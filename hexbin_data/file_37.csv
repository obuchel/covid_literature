46,46,46,Development of a humanized monoclonal antibody with therapeutic potential against West Nile virus,11.151727,7.639054,2005-04-24,"Neutralization of West Nile virus (WNV) in vivo correlates with the development of an antibody response against the viral envelope (E) protein. Using random mutagenesis and yeast surface display, we defined individual contact residues of 14 newly generated monoclonal antibodies against domain III of the WNV E protein. Monoclonal antibodies that strongly neutralized WNV localized to a surface patch on the lateral face of domain III. Convalescent antibodies from individuals who had recovered from WNV infection also detected this epitope. One monoclonal antibody, E16, neutralized 10 different strains in vitro, and showed therapeutic efficacy in mice, even when administered as a single dose 5 d after infection. A humanized version of E16 was generated that retained antigen specificity, avidity and neutralizing activity. In postexposure therapeutic trials in mice, a single dose of humanized E16 protected mice against WNV-induced mortality, and may therefore be a viable treatment option against WNV infection in humans.

111,111,111,Experimental infection of H5N1 HPAI in BALB/c mice,10.818458,7.585371,2007-07-27,"BACKGROUND: In 2005 huge epizooty of H5N1 HPAI occurred in Russia. It had been clear that territory of Russia becoming endemic for H5N1 HPAI. In 2006 several outbreaks have occurred. To develop new vaccines and antiviral therapies, animal models had to be investigated. We choose highly pathogenic strain for these studies. RESULTS: A/duck/Tuva/01/06 belongs to Quinghai-like group viruses. Molecular markers – cleavage site, K627 in PB2 characterize this virus as highly pathogenic. This data was confirmed by direct pathogenic tests: IVPI = 3.0, MLD(50 )= 1,4Log10EID(50). Also molecular analysis showed sensivity of the virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Serological analysis showed wide cross-reactivity of this virus with sera produced to H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated earlier in South-East Asia. Mean time to death of infected animals was 8,19+/-0,18 days. First time acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome was observed in mice lethal model. Hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera levels of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-10. CONCLUSION: Assuming all obtained data we can conclude that basic model parameters were characterized and virus A/duck/Tuva/01/06 can be used to evaluate anti-influenza vaccines and therapeutics.","Evseenko, Vasily A; Bukin, Eugeny K; Zaykovskaya, Anna V; Sharshov, Kirill A; Ternovoi, Vladimir A; Ignatyev, George M; Shestopalov, Alexander M",Virol J,37,1
119,119,119,An evaluation of Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) by comparing two previously-sequenced bacterial genomes,11.124747,7.5840178,2007-08-14,"BACKGROUND: With the development of new technology, it has recently become practical to resequence the genome of a bacterium after experimental manipulation. It is critical though to know the accuracy of the technique used, and to establish confidence that all of the mutations were detected. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray-based Comparative Genome Sequencing service provided by Nimblegen Systems Inc., we resequenced the E. coli strain W3110 Kohara using MG1655 as a reference, both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods. CGS detected 7 of 8 small sequence differences, one large deletion, and 9 of 12 IS element insertions present in W3110, but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion. In addition, we confirmed that CGS also detected 2 SNPs, one deletion and 7 IS element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence, which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the W3110 lambda clone library. The false positive rate for SNPs was one per 244 Kb of genome sequence. CONCLUSION: CGS is an effective way to detect multiple mutations present in one bacterium relative to another, and while highly cost-effective, is prone to certain errors. Mutations occurring in repeated sequences or in sequences with a high degree of secondary structure may go undetected. It is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which SNPs were not called because they often indicate deletions or IS element insertions.","Herring, Christopher D; Palsson, Bernhard Ø",BMC Genomics,37,1
125,125,125,Transmissibility of the Influenza Virus in the 1918 Pandemic,10.890614,7.6878705,2008-01-30,"BACKGROUND: With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R(0) = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30–40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of Influenza. The methods that we employ for estimation of the reproductive numbers and the serial interval can be easily replicated in other populations and with other diseases.","White, Laura Forsberg; Pagano, Marcello",PLoS One,37,28
145,145,145,The evolution of human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006: A complete genome study,11.043142,7.5564365,2008-03-07,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza A viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding of the evolution and migration of strains. Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses. We have studied the evolution of circulating human H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, we analysed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes. RESULTS: H3N2 was the prevalent strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000–2001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002–2003. After years of little genetic change in the H1N1 viruses the 2005–2006 season presented H1N1 of greater variability than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again. Generally, the influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. The evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002–2003. Also evolutionary stasis-periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site A has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions at CTL-epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and especially the nucleoprotein (NP) were observed. The N-linked glycosylation pattern varied during the study period and the H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten predicted sequons in HA, the highest amount of glycosylations observed in this study period. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to our knowledge to characterise the evolution of complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a time period of seven years from 1999 to 2006. More precise knowledge about the circulating strains may have implications for predicting the following season strains and thereby better matching the vaccine composition.","Bragstad, Karoline; Nielsen, Lars P; Fomsgaard, Anders",Virol J,37,11
177,177,177,Evolutionary and Transmission Dynamics of Reassortant H5N1 Influenza Virus in Indonesia,10.956065,7.313684,2008-08-22,"H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have seriously affected the Asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003. The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.","Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Hon, Chung-Chau; Pybus, Oliver G.; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.; Wong, Raymond Tze-Yeung; Yip, Chi-Wai; Zeng, Fanya; Leung, Frederick Chi-Ching",PLoS Pathog,37,28
222,222,222,The Complete Genome and Proteome of Laribacter hongkongensis Reveal Potential Mechanisms for Adaptations to Different Temperatures and Habitats,11.013505,7.6655836,2009-03-13,"Laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered Gram-negative bacillus of the Neisseriaceae family associated with freshwater fish–borne gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea. The complete genome sequence of L. hongkongensis HLHK9, recovered from an immunocompetent patient with severe gastroenteritis, consists of a 3,169-kb chromosome with G+C content of 62.35%. Genome analysis reveals different mechanisms potentially important for its adaptation to diverse habitats of human and freshwater fish intestines and freshwater environments. The gene contents support its phenotypic properties and suggest that amino acids and fatty acids can be used as carbon sources. The extensive variety of transporters, including multidrug efflux and heavy metal transporters as well as genes involved in chemotaxis, may enable L. hongkongensis to survive in different environmental niches. Genes encoding urease, bile salts efflux pump, adhesin, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and other putative virulence factors—such as hemolysins, RTX toxins, patatin-like proteins, phospholipase A1, and collagenases—are present. Proteomes of L. hongkongensis HLHK9 cultured at 37°C (human body temperature) and 20°C (freshwater habitat temperature) showed differential gene expression, including two homologous copies of argB, argB-20, and argB-37, which encode two isoenzymes of N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK)—NAGK-20 and NAGK-37—in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. NAGK-20 showed higher expression at 20°C, whereas NAGK-37 showed higher expression at 37°C. NAGK-20 also had a lower optimal temperature for enzymatic activities and was inhibited by arginine probably as negative-feedback control. Similar duplicated copies of argB are also observed in bacteria from hot springs such as Thermus thermophilus, Deinococcus geothermalis, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Roseiflexus castenholzii, suggesting that similar mechanisms for temperature adaptation may be employed by other bacteria. Genome and proteome analysis of L. hongkongensis revealed novel mechanisms for adaptations to survival at different temperatures and habitats.","Woo, Patrick C. Y.; Lau, Susanna K.

240,240,240,Small Interfering RNA Targeting M2 Gene Induces Effective and Long Term Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Replication,11.04124,7.354851,2009-05-22,"RNA interference (RNAi) provides a powerful new means to inhibit viral infection specifically. However, the selection of siRNA-resistant viruses is a major concern in the use of RNAi as antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we conducted a lentiviral vector with a H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassette to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells. Using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as surrogate marker, stable shRNA-expressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed siRNAs targeting to conserved regions of influenza A virus genome were assessed. The results showed that a siRNA targeting influenza M2 gene (siM2) potently inhibited viral replication. The siM2 was not only effective for H1N1 virus but also for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In addition to its M2 inhibition, the siM2 also inhibited NP mRNA accumulation and protein expression. A long term inhibition effect of the siM2 was demonstrated and the emergence of siRNA-resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed. Taken together, our study suggested that M2 gene might be an optimal RNAi target for antiviral therapy. These findings provide useful information for the development of RNAi-based prophylaxis and therapy for human influenza virus infection.","Sui, Hong-Yan; Zhao, Guang-Yu; Huang, Jian-Dong; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Bo-Jian",PLoS One,37,28
270,270,270,Generation and Characterization of Novel Human IRAS Monoclonal Antibodies,11.031406,7.431168,2009-08-10,"Imidazoline receptors were first proposed by Bousquet et al., when they studied antihypertensive effect of clonidine. A strong candidate for I1R, known as imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS), has been cloned from human hippocampus. We reported that IRAS mediated agmatine-induced inhibition of opioid dependence in morphine-dependent cells. To elucidate the functional and structure properties of I1R, we developed the newly monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal hIRAS region including the PX domain (10–120aa) through immunization of BALB/c mice with the NusA-IRAS fusion protein containing an IRAS N-terminal (10–120aa). Stable hybridoma cell lines were established and monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized full-length IRAS proteins in their native state by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation.

318,318,318,Efficient Assembly and Secretion of Recombinant Subviral Particles of the Four Dengue Serotypes Using Native prM and E Proteins,10.950197,7.649901,2009-12-15,"BACKGROUND: Flavivirus infected cells produce infectious virions and subviral particles, both of which are formed by the assembly of prM and E envelope proteins and are believed to undergo the same maturation process. Dengue recombinant subviral particles have been produced in cell cultures with either modified or chimeric proteins but not using the native forms of prM and E. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have used a codon optimization strategy to obtain an efficient expression of native viral proteins and production of recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) for all four dengue virus (DV) serotypes. A stable HeLa cell line expressing DV1 prME was established (HeLa-prME) and RSPs were analyzed by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. We found that E protein is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where assembly of RSPs could be observed. Biochemical characterization of DV1 RSPs secretion revealed both prM protein cleavage and homodimerization of E proteins before their release into the supernatant, indicating that RSPs undergo a similar maturation process as dengue virus. Pulse chase experiment showed that 8 hours are required for the secretion of DV1 RSPs. We have used HeLa-prME to develop a semi-quantitative assay and screened a human siRNA library targeting genes involved in membrane trafficking. Knockdown of 23 genes resulted in a significant reduction in DV RSP secretion, whereas for 22 others we observed an increase of RSP levels in cell supernatant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data describe the efficient production of RSPs containing native prM and E envelope proteins for all dengue serotypes. Dengue RSPs and corresponding producing cell lines are safe and novel tools that can be used in the study of viral egress as well as in the development of vaccine and drugs against dengue virus.","Wang, Pei-Gang; Kudelko, Mateusz; Lo, Joanne; Siu, Lewis Yu Lam; Kwok, Kevin Tsz Hin; Sachse, Martin; Nicholls, John M.; Bruzzone, Roberto; Altmeyer, Ralf M.; Nal, Béatrice",PLoS One,37,1

350,350,350,Anthropogenic factors and the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: prospects from a spatial-based model,10.952623,7.710559,2009-12-16,"Beginning in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread across Southeast Asia, causing unprecedented epidemics. Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the “second wave” of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained.","Paul, Mathilde; Tavornpanich, Saraya; Abrial, David; Gasqui, Patrick; Charras-Garrido, Myriam; Thanapongtharm, Weerapong; Xiao, Xiangming; Gilbert, Marius; Roger, Francois; Ducrot, Christian",Vet Res,37,1
366,366,366,"Comparative Efficacy of Hemagglutinin, Nucleoprotein, and Matrix 2 Protein Gene-Based Vaccination against H5N1 Influenza in Mouse and Ferret",11.148337,7.290119,2010-03-23,"Efforts to develop a broadly protective vaccine against the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus have focused on highly conserved influenza gene products. The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and ion channel matrix protein (M2) are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza A subtypes. Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA. However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased. To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2. Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets. These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge.","Rao, Srinivas S.; Kong, Wing-Pui; Wei, Chih-Jen; Van Hoeven, Neal; Gorres, J.

381,381,381,Electron Tomography Reveals the Steps in Filovirus Budding,11.078776,7.456382,2010-04-29,"The filoviruses, Marburg and Ebola, are non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates. The sequence of events that leads to release of filovirus particles from cells is poorly understood. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed, one proceeding via a “submarine-like” budding with the helical nucleocapsid emerging parallel to the plasma membrane, and the other via perpendicular “rocket-like” protrusion. Here we have infected cells with Marburg virus under BSL-4 containment conditions, and reconstructed the sequence of steps in the budding process in three dimensions using electron tomography of plastic-embedded cells. We find that highly infectious filamentous particles are released at early stages in infection. Budding proceeds via lateral association of intracellular nucleocapsid along its whole length with the plasma membrane, followed by rapid envelopment initiated at one end of the nucleocapsid, leading to a protruding intermediate. Scission results in local membrane instability at the rear of the virus. After prolonged infection, increased vesiculation of the plasma membrane correlates with changes in shape and infectivity of released viruses. Our observations demonstrate a cellular determinant of virus shape. They reconcile the contrasting models of filovirus budding and allow us to describe the sequence of events taking place during budding and release of Marburg virus. We propose that this represents a general sequence of events also followed by other filamentous and rod-shaped viruses.","Welsch, Sonja; Kolesnikova, Larissa; Krähling, Verena; Riches, James D.; Becker, Stephan; Briggs, John A.

Based on our previous studies showing that feeding on an amino acid meal induces TOR signaling in Ae. aegypti, we used proteomics and RNAi to functionally identify midgut epithelial cell proteins that contribute to RER whorl formation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were maintained on sugar alone (unfed), or fed an amino acid meal, and then midgut epithelial cells were analyzed by electron microscopy and protein biochemistry. The size and number of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells were found to decrease significantly after feeding, and several KDEL-containing proteins were shown to have altered expression levels. LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry was used to analyze midgut microsomal proteins isolated from unfed and amino acid fed mosquitoes, and of the 127 proteins identified, 8 were chosen as candidate whorl forming proteins. Three candidate proteins were COPI coatomer subunits (alpha, beta, beta'), all of which appeared to be present at higher levels in microsomal fractions from unfed mosquitoes. Using RNAi to knockdown alpha-COPI expression, electron microscopy revealed that both the size and number of RER whorls were dramatically reduced in unfed mosquitoes, and moreover, that extended regions of swollen RER were prevalent in fed mosquitoes. Lastly, while a deficiency in alpha-COPI had no effect on early trypsin protein synthesis or secretion 3 hr post blood meal (PBM), expression of late phase proteases at 24 hr PBM was completely blocked. CONCLUSIONS: alpha-COPI was found to be required for the formation of RER whorls in midgut epithelial cells of unfed Aa. aegypti mosquitoes, as well as for the expression of late phase midgut proteases.","Zhou, Guoli; Isoe, Jun; Day, W.

In the course of bacterial infections, these cytokines could be beneficial or detrimental. IFN-β is the primary member of type I IFN that initiates a cascade of IFN-α production. Here we addressed the question which cells are responsible for IFN-β expression after infection with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by using a genetic approach. By means of newly established reporter mice, maximum of IFN-β expression was observed at 24 hours post infection in spleen and, surprisingly, 48 hours post infection in colonized cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. Colonization of lymph nodes was independent of the type I IFN signaling, as well as bacterial dose and strain. Using cell specific reporter function and conditional deletions we could define cells expressing LysM as the major IFN-β producers, with cells formerly defined as Tip-DCs being the highest. Neutrophilic granulocytes, dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells did not significantly contribute to type I IFN production.","Solodova, Evgenia; Jablonska, Jadwiga; Weiss, Siegfried; Lienenklaus, Stefan",PLoS One,37,7

We demonstrate that chicken tracheal ciliated cells express α2,3-linked SA, while goblet cells mainly express α2,6-linked SA. In addition, the plant lectin MAL-II, but not MAA/MAL-I, is bound to the surface of goblet cells, suggesting that SA2,3-linked oligosaccharides with Galβ1–3GalNAc subterminal residues are specifically present on the goblet cells. Moreover, both α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs are detected on single tracheal basal cells. At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) avian influenza virus H6N1 is exclusively detected in the ciliated cells, suggesting that the ciliated cell is the major target cell of the H6N1 virus. At a MOI of 1, ciliated, goblet and basal cells are all permissive to the AIV infection.

Here we report the development of a method that overcomes this limitation by using a protein substrate, lamin A, which is highly specific for caspase-6 cleavage at amino acid 230. Using a neo-epitope antibody against cleaved lamin A, we developed an electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA assay that is suitable to specifically detect and quantify caspase-6 activity in highly apoptotic cell extracts. The method is more sensitive than VEID-based assays and can be adapted to a high-content imaging platform for high-throughput screening. This method should be useful to screen for and characterize caspase-6 inhibitor compounds and other interventions to decrease intracellular caspase-6 activity for applications in neurodegenerative disorders.","Ehrnhoefer, Dagmar E.; Skotte, Niels H.; Savill, Jane; Nguyen, Yen T.

For this purpose, the geometry of 4- and 5-X-substituted salicylaldehyde derivatives (X = NO(2), H or OH) was optimized by means of B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ methods. The results obtained allowed us to show that substituents (NO(2) or OH) in the para or meta position with respect to either OH or CHO in H-bonded systems interact more strongly than in the case of di-substituted species: 4- and 3-nitrophenol or 4- and 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde by ∼31%. The substituent effect due to the intramolecular charge transfer from the para-counter substituent (NO(2)) to the proton-donating group (OH) is ∼35% greater than for the interaction of para-OH with the proton-accepting group (CHO). The total energy of H-bonding for salicylaldehyde, and its derivatives, is composed of two contributions: ∼80% from the energy of H-bond formation and ∼20% from the energy associated with reorganization of the electron structure of the systems in question.

Major cellular targets of NiV infection are endothelial cells and neurons. To better understand virus-host interaction, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of NiV infection in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We further assessed some of the obtained results by in vitro and in vivo methods in a hamster model and in brain samples from NiV-infected patients. We found that NiV infection strongly induces genes involved in interferon response in endothelial cells. Among the top ten upregulated genes, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 (interferon-induced protein 10, IP-10), an important chemoattractant involved in the generation of inflammatory immune response and neurotoxicity. In NiV-infected hamsters, which develop pathology similar to what is seen in humans, expression of CXCL10 mRNA was induced in different organs with kinetics that followed NiV replication. Finally, we showed intense staining for CXCL10 in the brain of patients who succumbed to lethal NiV infection during the outbreak in Malaysia, confirming induction of this chemokine in fatal human infections. This study sheds new light on NiV pathogenesis, indicating the role of CXCL10 during the course of infection and suggests that this chemokine may serve as a potential new marker for lethal NiV encephalitis.","Mathieu, Cyrille; Guillaume, Vanessa; Sabine, Amélie; Ong, Kien Chai; Wong, Kum Thong; Legras-Lachuer, Catherine; Horvat, Branka",PLoS One,37,28

Based on clinical observation in humans and successful genetic strategies in experimental models, we reasoned that an improved interferon (IFN) signaling system might better protect against viral infection. Here we aimed to identify small molecular weight compounds that might mimic this beneficial effect and improve antiviral defense. Accordingly, we developed a cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify small molecules that enhance the IFN signaling pathway components. The assay is based on a phenotypic screen for increased IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity in a fully automated and robust format (Z′>0.7). Application of this assay system to a library of 2240 compounds (including 2160 already approved or approvable drugs) led to the identification of 64 compounds with significant ISRE activity. From these, we chose the anthracycline antibiotic, idarubicin, for further validation and mechanism based on activity in the sub-µM range. We found that idarubicin action to increase ISRE activity was manifest by other members of this drug class and was independent of cytotoxic or topoisomerase inhibitory effects as well as endogenous IFN signaling or production. We also observed that this compound conferred a consequent increase in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and a significant antiviral effect using a similar dose-range in a cell-culture system inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The antiviral effect was also found at compound concentrations below the ones observed for cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results provide proof of concept for using activators of components of the IFN signaling pathway to improve IFN efficacy and antiviral immune defense as well as a validated HTS approach to identify small molecules that might achieve this therapeutic benefit.","Patel, Dhara A.; Patel, Anand C.; Nolan, William C.; Zhang, Yong; Holtzman, Michael J.",PLoS One,37,1

Recent researches revealed that it, as one number of the Caliciviridae, has some specialties in its genome, its reproduction and so on. RESULTS: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV.","Tian, Xiao-ting; Li, Bao-yu; Zhang, Liang; Jiao, Wen-qiang; Liu, Ji-xing",Virol J,37,28

Each virus also causes serious and commonly lethal infection of people as well as various species of domestic animals, however little is known about the associated mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new paramyxovirus from pteropid bats, Cedar virus (CedPV), which shares significant features with the known henipaviruses. The genome size (18,162 nt) and organization of CedPV is very similar to that of HeV and NiV; its nucleocapsid protein displays antigenic cross-reactivity with henipaviruses; and it uses the same receptor molecule (ephrin- B2) for entry during infection. Preliminary challenge studies with CedPV in ferrets and guinea pigs, both susceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses, confirmed virus replication and production of neutralizing antibodies although clinical disease was not observed. In this context, it is interesting to note that the major genetic difference between CedPV and HeV or NiV lies within the coding strategy of the P gene, which is known to play an important role in evading the host innate immune system. Unlike HeV, NiV, and almost all known paramyxoviruses, the CedPV P gene lacks both RNA editing and also the coding capacity for the highly conserved V protein. Preliminary study indicated that CedPV infection of human cells induces a more robust IFN-β response than HeV.","Marsh, Glenn A.; de Jong, Carol; Barr, Jennifer A.; Tachedjian, Mary; Smith, Craig; Middleton, Deborah; Yu, Meng; Todd, Shawn; Foord, Adam J.; Haring, Volker; Payne, Jean; Robinson, Rachel; Broz, Ivano; Crameri, Gary; Field, Hume E.; Wang, Lin-Fa",PLoS Pathog,37,28

Clara cells also function as stem/progenitor cells for repair in the bronchioles. Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) is specifically expressed in pulmonary Clara cells and is widely used as a Clara cell marker. In addition CCSP promoter is commonly used to direct gene expression into the lung in transgenic models. The discovery of CCSP immunoreactivity in plasma membranes of airway lining cells prompted us to explore the possibility of enriching Clara cells by flow cytometry. We established a novel and simple method for the isolation of CCSP-expressing cell Clara cells using a combination of mechanical and enzymatic dissociation followed by flow cytometry sorting technology. We showed that ∼25% of dissociated cells from whole lung expressed CCSP. In the resulting preparation, up to 98% of cells expressed CCSP. Notably, we found that several common stem cell markers including CD44, CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 were expressed in CCSP(+) cells. Moreover, CCSP(+) cells were able to form spheroid colonies in vitro with 0.97‰ efficiency. Parallel studies in vivo confirmed that a small population of CCSP(−)expressing cells in mouse airways also demonstrates stem cell-like properties such as label retention and harboring rare bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in terminal bronchioles (TBs). We conclude that CCSP(+) cells exhibit a number of stem cell-like features including stem cell marker expression, bronchosphere colony formation and self-renewal ability. Clara cell isolation by flow cytometry sorting is a useful method for investigating the function of primary Clara cells in stem cell research and mouse models.","Wang, Xiao-Yang; Keefe, Kathleen M.; Jensen-Taubman, Sandra M.; Yang, Danlei; Yan, Kai; Linnoila, R.

It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV. Additionally, we show that DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice.","Aguirre, Sebastian; Maestre, Ana M.; Pagni, Sarah; Patel, Jenish R.; Savage, Timothy; Gutman, Delia; Maringer, Kevin; Bernal-Rubio, Dabeiba; Shabman, Reed S.; Simon, Viviana; Rodriguez-Madoz, Juan R.; Mulder, Lubbertus C.

The bacterium is the causative agent of C. difficile infection (CDI), for which the symptoms can range from a mild diarrhea to potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Endospore formation in Firmicutes, including C. difficile, is governed by the key regulator for sporulation, Spo0A. In Bacillus subtilis, this transcription factor is also directly or indirectly involved in various other cellular processes. Here, we report that C. difficile Spo0A shows a high degree of similarity to the well characterized B. subtilis protein and recognizes a similar binding sequence. We find that the laboratory strain C. difficile 630Δerm contains an 18bp-duplication near the DNA-binding domain compared to its ancestral strain 630. In vitro binding assays using purified C-terminal DNA binding domain of the C. difficile Spo0A protein demonstrate direct binding to DNA upstream of spo0A and sigH, early sporulation genes and several other putative targets. In vitro binding assays suggest that the gene encoding the major clostridial toxin TcdB may be a direct target of Spo0A, but supernatant derived from a spo0A negative strain was no less toxic towards Vero cells than that obtained from a wild type strain, in contrast to previous reports. These results identify for the first time direct (putative) targets of the Spo0A protein in C. difficile and make a positive effect of Spo0A on production of the large clostridial toxins unlikely.","Rosenbusch, Katharina E.; Bakker, Dennis; Kuijper, Ed J.; Smits, Wiep Klaas",PLoS One,37,1

However, several lines of evidence suggest that UL44 might have additional roles during virus life cycle. To shed light on this, we searched for cellular partners of UL44 by yeast two-hybrid screenings. Intriguingly, we discovered the interaction of UL44 with Ubc9, an enzyme involved in the covalent conjugation of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) to cellular and viral proteins. We found that UL44 can be extensively sumoylated not only in a cell-free system and in transfected cells, but also in HCMV-infected cells, in which about 50% of the protein resulted to be modified at late times post-infection, when viral genome replication is accomplished. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that UL44 possesses multiple SUMO target sites, located throughout the protein. Remarkably, we observed that binding of UL44 to DNA greatly stimulates its sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we showed that overexpression of SUMO alters the intranuclear distribution of UL44 in HCMV-infected cells, and enhances both virus production and DNA replication, arguing for an important role for sumoylation in HCMV life cycle and UL44 function(s). These data report for the first time the sumoylation of a viral processivity factor and show that there is a functional interplay between the HCMV UL44 protein and the cellular sumoylation system.","Sinigalia, Elisa; Alvisi, Gualtiero; Segré, Chiara V.; Mercorelli, Beatrice; Muratore, Giulia; Winkler, Michael; Hsiao, He-Hsuan; Urlaub, Henning; Ripalti, Alessandro; Chiocca, Susanna; Palù, Giorgio; Loregian, Arianna",PLoS One,37,11

The generation of secreted antigens has been studied in several viruses and suggested as a mechanism of host immune evasion through absorption of antibodies and interference with antibody-mediated clearance. However such a role has not been conclusively determined for the Ebola virus sGP. In this study, we immunized mice with DNA constructs expressing GP(1,2) and/or sGP, and demonstrate that sGP can efficiently compete for anti-GP(12) antibodies, but only from mice that have been immunized by sGP. We term this phenomenon “antigenic subversion”, and propose a model whereby sGP redirects the host antibody response to focus on epitopes which it shares with membrane-bound GP(1,2), thereby allowing it to absorb anti-GP(1,2) antibodies. Unexpectedly, we found that sGP can also subvert a previously immunized host's anti-GP(1,2) response resulting in strong cross-reactivity with sGP. This finding is particularly relevant to EBOV vaccinology since it underscores the importance of eliciting robust immunity that is sufficient to rapidly clear an infection before antigenic subversion can occur. Antigenic subversion represents a novel virus escape strategy that likely helps EBOV evade host immunity, and may represent an important obstacle to EBOV vaccine design.","Mohan, Gopi S.; Li, Wenfang; Ye, Ling; Compans, Richard W.; Yang, Chinglai",PLoS Pathog,37,28

In the present study, we evaluated if AAV manipulates the UPR pathways during its infection. We first examined the role of the three major UPR axes, namely, endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in AAV infected cells. Total RNA from mock or AAV infected HeLa cells were used to determine the levels of 8 different ER-stress responsive transcripts from these pathways. We observed a significant up-regulation of IRE1α (up to 11 fold) and PERK (up to 8 fold) genes 12–48 hours after infection with self-complementary (sc)AAV2 but less prominent with single-stranded (ss)AAV2 vectors. Further studies demonstrated that scAAV1 and scAAV6 also induce cellular UPR in vitro, with AAV1 vectors activating the PERK pathway (3 fold) while AAV6 vectors induced a significant increase on all the three major UPR pathways [6–16 fold]. These data suggest that the type and strength of UPR activation is dependent on the viral capsid. We then examined if transient inhibition of UPR pathways by RNA interference has an effect on AAV transduction. siRNA mediated silencing of PERK and IRE1α had a modest effect on AAV2 and AAV6 mediated gene expression (∼1.5–2 fold) in vitro. Furthermore, hepatic gene transfer of scAAV2 vectors in vivo, strongly elevated IRE1α and PERK pathways (2 and 3.5 fold, respectively). However, when animals were pre-treated with a pharmacological UPR inhibitor (metformin) during scAAV2 gene transfer, the UPR signalling and its subsequent inflammatory response was attenuated concomitant to a modest 2.8 fold increase in transgene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that AAV vectors activate the cellular UPR pathways and their selective inhibition may be beneficial during AAV mediated gene transfer.","Balakrishnan, Balaji; Sen, Dwaipayan; Hareendran, Sangeetha; Roshini, Vaani; David, Sachin; Srivastava, Alok; Jayandharan, Giridhara R.",PLoS One,37,28

However, the disproportionate epidemiologic clustering of severe malaria with aggressive forms of endemic diseases such as Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a neoplasm that is etiologically linked to infection with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), underscores the significance of previously unexplored co-pathogenetic interactions that have the potential to modify the overall disease burden in co-infected individuals. Based on recent studies of the mechanisms that P. falciparum and KSHV have evolved to interact with their mutual human host, several new perspectives are emerging that highlight a surprising convergence of biological themes potentially underlying their associated co-morbidities. Against this background, ongoing studies are rapidly constructing a fascinating new paradigm in which the major host receptors that control parasite invasion (Basigin/CD147) and cyto-adherence (CD36) are, surprisingly, also important targets for exploitation by KSHV. In this article, we consider the major pathobiological implications of the co-option of Basigin/CD147 and CD36 signaling pathways by both P. falciparum and KSHV, not only as essential host factors for parasite persistence but also as important mediators of the pro-angiogenic phenotype within the virus-infected endothelial microenvironment. Consequently, the triangulation of interactions between P. falciparum, KSHV, and their mutual human host articulates a syndemic relationship that points to a conceptual framework for prevalence of aggressive forms of KS in malaria-endemic areas, with implications for the possibility of dual-use therapies against these debilitating infections in resource-limited parts of the world.","Conant, Katelyn L.; Kaleeba, Johnan A.

First, a panel of mimotopes was affinity-selected from a random peptide library and potential m36-binding residues were computationally predicted. Second, homology modeling of m36 and molecular docking of m36 onto gp120 revealed potentially important residues in gp120-m36 interactions. Third, the predicted contact residues were verified by site-directed mutagenesis.

In the 3D structure of gp120, the sites C1 and C4 are located in the bridging sheet and the site C3 is within the β15-α3 excursion, which play essential roles for the receptor- and coreceptor-binding and are major targets of neutralizing antibodies.

We introduce such an outbreak threshold (T(0)), and find that for large and homogeneous host populations, in which the pathogen has a reproductive ratio R(0), on the order of 1/Log(R(0)) infected individuals are needed to prevent stochastic fade-out during the early stages of an epidemic.

Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%).

TYMV encodes a precursor replication polyprotein that is processed by the endoproteolytic activity of its internal cysteine proteinase domain (PRO). We recently reported that PRO is actually a multifunctional enzyme with a specific ubiquitin hydrolase (DUB) activity that contributes to viral infectivity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 150-residue PRO. Strikingly, PRO displays no homology to other processing proteinases from positive-stranded RNA viruses, including that of alphaviruses. Instead, the closest structural homologs of PRO are DUBs from the Ovarian tumor (OTU) family. In the crystal, one molecule's C-terminus inserts into the catalytic cleft of the next, providing a view of the N-terminal product complex in replication polyprotein processing. This allows us to locate the specificity determinants of PRO for its proteinase substrates. In addition to the catalytic cleft, at the exit of which the active site is unusually pared down and solvent-exposed, a key element in molecular recognition by PRO is a lobe N-terminal to the catalytic domain. Docking models and the activities of PRO and PRO mutants in a deubiquitylating assay suggest that this N-terminal lobe is also likely involved in PRO's DUB function. Our data thus establish that DUBs can evolve to specifically hydrolyze both iso- and endopeptide bonds with different sequences. This is achieved by the use of multiple specificity determinants, as recognition of substrate patches distant from the cleavage sites allows a relaxed specificity of PRO at the sites themselves. Our results thus shed light on how such a compact protein achieves a diversity of key functions in viral genome replication and host-pathogen interaction.","Lombardi, Charlotte; Ayach, Maya; Beaurepaire, Lionel; Chenon, Mélanie; Andreani, Jessica; Guerois, Raphaël; Jupin, Isabelle; Bressanelli, Stéphane",PLoS Pathog,37,1

Using six codon-based Maximum Likelihood methods, we were able to identify specific codons under positive selection in each of these three genes. The highest number of positively selected codons was detected in MDA5, but a great percentage of these codons were located outside of the currently defined protein domains for MDA5, which likely reflects the imposition of both functional and structural constraints. Additionally, our results support LGP2 as being the least prone to evolutionary change, since the lowest number of codons under selection was observed for this gene. On the other hand, the preponderance of positively selected codons for RIG-I were detected in known protein functional domains, suggesting that pressure has been imposed by the vast number of viruses that are recognized by this RNA helicase. Furthermore, the RIG-I repressor domain, the region responsible for recognizing and binding to its RNA substrates, exhibited the strongest evidence of selective pressures. Branch-site analyses were performed and several species branches on the three receptor gene trees showed evidence of episodic positive selection. In conclusion, by looking for evidence of positive evolutionary selection on mammalian RIG-I-like receptor genes, we propose that a multitude of viruses have crafted the receptors biological function in host defense, specifically for the RIG-I gene, contributing to the innate species-specific resistance/susceptibility to diverse viral pathogens.","Lemos de Matos, Ana; McFadden, Grant; Esteves, Pedro J.",PLoS One,37,1

Because interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) plays an important role in inflammation, this work assessed IFN-γ single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that may be associated with sepsis. METHODS: A total of 196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and 213 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers participated in our study from July 2012 to July 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Patient clinical information was collected. Clinical pathology was assessed in subgroups defined based on clinical criteria, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) and SOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) scores and discharge rate. Four functional SNPs, −1616T/C (rs2069705), −764G/C (rs2069707), +874A/T (rs2430561) and +3234C/T (rs2069718), were genotyped by Snapshot in both sepsis patients and healthy controls. Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were used to analyze the distribution of the SNPs, and the probability values (P values), odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: No mutations in the IFN-γ −764G/C SNP were detected among the participants in our study. The +874A/T and +3234C/T SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2) = 0.894). The −1616 TC+TT, +874 AT+AA genotype and the TAC haplotype were significantly associated with sepsis susceptibility, while the CTT haplotype was associated with protection against sepsis incidence. Genotype of −1616 TT wasn’t only protective against severity of sepsis, but also against higher APACHE II and SOFA scores as +874 AA and +3234 CC. The TAC haplotype was was protective against progression to severe sepsis either. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that functional IFN-γ SNPs and their haplotypes are associated with pneumonia-induced sepsis.","Wang, Ding; Zhong, Xuan; Huang, Dongjian; Chen, Rui; Bai, Guibin; Li, Qing; Yu, Bolan; Fan, Yong; Sun, Xiaofang",PLoS One,37,1
1374,1374,1374,Powerful Sequence Similarity Search Methods and In-Depth Manual Analyses Can Identify Remote Homologs in Many Apparently “Orphan” Viral Proteins,10.88925,7.4127693,2014-01-11,"The genome sequences of new viruses often contain many “orphan” or “taxon-specific” proteins apparently lacking homologs. However, because viral proteins evolve very fast, commonly used sequence similarity detection methods such as BLAST may overlook homologs. We analyzed a data set of proteins from RNA viruses characterized as “genus specific” by BLAST. More powerful methods developed recently, such as HHblits or HHpred (available through web-based, user-friendly interfaces), could detect distant homologs of a quarter of these proteins, suggesting that these methods should be used to annotate viral genomes. In-depth manual analyses of a subset of the remaining sequences, guided by contextual information such as taxonomy, gene order, or domain cooccurrence, identified distant homologs of another third. Thus, a combination of powerful automated methods and manual analyses can uncover distant homologs of many proteins thought to be orphans. We expect these methodological results to be also applicable to cellular organisms, since they generally evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses. As an application, we reanalyzed the genome of a bee pathogen, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). We could identify homologs of most of its proteins thought to be orphans; in each case, identifying homologs provided functional clues. We discovered that CBPV encodes a domain homologous to the Alphavirus methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase; a putative membrane protein, SP24, with homologs in unrelated insect viruses and insect-transmitted plant viruses having different morphologies (cileviruses, higreviruses, blunerviruses, negeviruses); and a putative virion glycoprotein, ORF2, also found in negeviruses. SP24 and ORF2 are probably major structural components of the virions.","Kuchibhatla, Durga B.; Sherman, Westley A.; Chung, Betty Y.

The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N- and O-linked glycans. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)-dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency.","Lennemann, Nicholas J.; Rhein, Bethany A.; Ndungo, Esther; Chandran, Kartik; Qiu, Xiangguo; Maury, Wendy",mBio,37,28

After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids (224)HWPKPHTLW(232), was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.","Fatima, Aneela; Wang, Haiying; Kang, Keren; Xia, Liliang; Wang, Ying; Ye, Wei; Wang, Jufang; Wang, Xiaoning",PLoS One,37,28

Although effective, these drugs carry risks of increased bleeding and drug ‘resistance’, underpinning a drive for new antiplatelet agents. To discover such drugs, one strategy is to identify a suitable druggable target and then find small molecules that modulate it. A good and unexploited target is the platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, which promotes thrombus formation. To identify inhibitors of GPVI that are safe and bioavailable, we docked a FDA-approved drug library into the GPVI collagen-binding site in silico. We now report that losartan and cinanserin inhibit GPVI-mediated platelet activation in a selective, competitive and dose-dependent manner. This mechanism of action likely underpins the cardioprotective effects of losartan that could not be ascribed to its antihypertensive effects. We have, therefore, identified small molecule inhibitors of GPVI-mediated platelet activation, and also demonstrated the utility of structure-based repurposing.","Taylor, Lewis; Vasudevan, Sridhar R.; Jones, Chris I.; Gibbins, Jonathan M.; Churchill, Grant C.; Campbell, R.

In vitro studies have shown that Δ21 IFITM3 loses its ability to restrict H1N1 IAV. Subsequent research has also revealed that tyrosine 20 is the key determinant for IFITM3 endocytic trafficking, which is essential for the efficient anti-viral activity of IFITM3. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that both Δ21 IFITM3 and an IFITM3 variant (Y20A IFITM3), in which tyrosine 20 is substituted with alanine, strongly restricted entry mediated by IAV H1, H3, H5, and H7 proteins. Δ21 IFITM3 also efficiently suppressed replication of H1N1 and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 IAV. Δ21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 had broader subcellular distributions than full-length IFITM3 but an abundant amount of both IFITM3 variants still localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data indicate that tyrosine 20 partially regulates the subcellular localization of IFITM3 but is not functionally essential for IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction. They also suggested that mechanisms, other than viral entry restriction, might contribute to variations in clinical outcomes of H1N1 influenza associated with rs12252-C.","Williams, David Evan Joseph; Wu, Wan-Lin; Grotefend, Christopher Robert; Radic, Vladimir; Chung, Changik; Chung, Young-Hwa; Farzan, Michael; Huang, I-Chueh",PLoS One,37,1

Differences in susceptibility to goat plague among different breeds and water buffalo exist. The host innate immune system discriminates between pathogen associated molecular patterns and self antigens through surveillance receptors known as Toll like receptors (TLR). We investigated the role of TLR and cytokines in differential susceptibility of goat breeds and water buffalo to PPRV. We examined the replication of PPRV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Indian domestic goats and water buffalo and demonstrated that the levels of TLR3 and TLR7 and downstream signalling molecules correlation with susceptibility vs resistance. Naturally susceptible goat breeds, Barbari and Tellichery, had dampened innate immune responses to PPRV and increased viral loads with lower basal expression levels of TLR 3/7. Upon stimulation of PBMC with synthetic TLR3 and TLR7 agonists or PPRV, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines were found to be significantly higher while immunosuppressive interleukin (IL) 10 levels were lower in PPRV resistant Kanni and Salem Black breeds and water buffalo at transcriptional level, correlating with reduced viralloads in infected PBMC. Water buffalo produced higher levels of interferon (IFN) α in comparison with goats at transcriptional and translational levels. Pre-treatment of Vero cells with human IFNα resulted in reduction of PPRV replication, confirming the role of IFNα in limiting PPRV replication. Treatment with IRS66, a TLR7 antagonist, resulted in the reduction of IFNα levels, with increased PPRV replication confirming the role of TLR7. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of TLR7 of these goat breeds did not show any marked nucleotide differences that might account for susceptibility vs resistance to PPRV. Analyzing other host genetic factors might provide further insights on susceptibility to PPRV and genetic polymorphisms in the host.","Dhanasekaran, Sakthivel; Biswas, Moanaro; Vignesh, Ambothi R.; Ramya, R.; Raj, Gopal Dhinakar; Tirumurugaan, Krishnaswamy G.; Raja, Angamuthu; Kataria, Ranjit S.; Parida, Satya; Subbiah, Elankumaran",PLoS One,37,28

Vpu forms cation-specific ion channels in host cells, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. An understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through Vpu is desirable, but remains limited because of the unavailability of an experimental structure of the channel. Using a structure of the pentameric form of Vpu – modeled and validated based on available experimental data – umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations (cumulative simulation time of more than 0.4 µs) were employed to elucidate the energetics and the molecular mechanism of ion transport in Vpu. Free energy profiles corresponding to the permeation of Na(+) and K(+) were found to be similar to each other indicating lack of ion selection, consistent with previous experimental studies. The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments. A two-dimensional free energy landscape has been computed to model multiple ion permeation, based on which a mechanism for ion conduction is proposed. It is shown that only one ion can pass through the channel at a time. This, along with a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, explains the slow kinetics of ion conduction. The results are consistent with previous conductance studies that showed Vpu to be a weakly conducting ion channel.","Padhi, Siladitya; Burri, Raghunadha Reddy; Jameel, Shahid; Priyakumar, U.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance studies showed that the selected aptamers bind tightly to H1-HA1 with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the aptamers were binding to H1-HA1 in a concentration-dependent manner, yet were not binding to H5-HA1. Interestingly, the selected aptamers contained G-rich sequences in the central random nucleotides region. Further biophysical analysis showed that the G-rich sequences formed a G-quadruplex structure, which is a distinctive structure compared to the starting ssDNA library. Using flow cytometry analysis, we found that the aptamers did not bind to the receptor-binding site of H1-HA1. These results indicate that the selected aptamers that distinguish H1-HA1 from H5-HA1 can be developed as unique probes for the detection of the H1 subtype of influenza virus.","Woo, Hye-Min; Lee, Jin-Moo; Yim, Sanggyu; Jeong, Yong-Joo",PLoS One,37,28

Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes.

In this study, we report ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 15 is involved in regulation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-dependent type I IFN induction pathway. Knockdown of endogenous USP15 augmented cellular antiviral responses. Overexpression of USP15 inhibited the transcription of IFN-β. Further analyses identified histidine 862 as a critical residue for USP15’s catalytic activity. Interestingly, USP15 specifically removed lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I among the essential components in RIG-I-like receptor-dependent pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that in contrast to USP15 de-ubiquitinating (DUB) activity, USP15-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling was not abolished by mutations eliminating the catalytic activity, indicating that a fraction of USP15-mediated IFN antagonism was independent of the DUB activity. Catalytically inactive USP15 mutants, as did the wild-type protein, disrupted virus-induced interaction of RIG-I and IFN-β promoter stimulator 1.

While we could not identify a single residue to be alone responsible for pH triggering, we propose that a distributed pH effect over multiple residues induces the conformational change that enhances membrane insertion and triggers the fusion activity of the EBOV FL.","Lee, Jinwoo; Gregory, Sonia M.; Nelson, Elizabeth A.; White, Judith M.; Tamm, Lukas K.",PLoS One,37,28

Unfortunately, no antivirals or vaccines are currently available, and therefore efficient and safe antivirals are urgently needed. We developed a high throughput screen to discover small molecule probes that inhibit virus infection of Vero E6 cells. A primary screen of a 13,001 compound library at a 10 μM final concentration was conducted using the 384-well format. Z′ values ranged from 0.54–0.83 with a median of 0.74. Average S/B was 17 and S/N for each plate ranged from 10.8 to 23.9. Twenty-six compounds showed a dose response in the HT screen and were further evaluated in a time of addition assay and in a titer reduction assay. Seven compounds showed potential as small molecule probes directed at WNV.

2235,2235,2235,Identification of four novel DC-SIGN ligands on Mycobacterium bovis BCG,10.957942,7.775236,2010-09-01,"Dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) has an important role in mediating adherence of Mycobacteria species, including M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG to human dendritic cells and macrophages, in which these bacteria can survive intracellularly. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, and interactions with mycobacterial cells are believed to occur via mannosylated structures on the mycobacterial surface. Recent studies suggest more varied modes of binding to multiple mycobacterial ligands. Here we identify, by affinity chromatography and mass-spectrometry, four novel ligands of M. bovis BCG that bind to DC-SIGN. The novel ligands are chaperone protein DnaK, 60 kDa chaperonin-1 (Cpn60.1), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lipoprotein lprG. Other published work strongly suggests that these are on the cell surface. Of these ligands, lprG appears to bind DC-SIGN via typical proteinglycan interactions, but DnaK and Cpn60.1 binding do not show evidence of carbohydrate-dependent interactions. LprG was also identified as a ligand for DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN; CD299) and the M. tuberculosis orthologue of lprG has been found previously to interact with human toll-like receptor 2. Collectively, these findings offer new targets for combating mycobacterial adhesion and within-host survival, and reinforce the role of DCSIGN as an important host ligand in mycobacterial infection.","Carroll, Maria V.; Sim, Robert B.; Bigi, Fabiana; Jäkel, Anne; Antrobus, Robin; Mitchell, Daniel A.",Protein & Cell,37,8

Knock-down of Csk expression by siRNAs or inhibition of Csk by an inhibitor reduced dengue virus RNA levels but did not affect viral entry. Csk partially colocalized with viral replication compartments. Dengue infection was drastically reduced in cells lacking the three ubiquitous src family kinases, Src, Fyn and Yes. Csk knock-down in these cells failed to block dengue virus replication suggesting that the effect of Csk is via regulation of Src family kinases. Csk was found to be hyper-phosphorylated during dengue infection and inhibition of protein kinase A led to a block in Csk phosphorylation and dengue virus replication. Overexpression studies suggest an important role for the kinase and SH3 domains in this process. Our results identified a novel role for Csk as a host tyrosine kinase involved in dengue virus replication and provide further insights into the role of host factors in dengue replication.","Kumar, Rinki; Agrawal, Tanvi; Khan, Naseem Ahmed; Nakayama, Yuji; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.",Sci Rep,37,28

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying each event is necessary for the intervention of virus infection in human healthcare and agriculture. Here we report the visualization of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) assembly in the medaka haploid embryonic stem (ES) cell line HX1. SGIV is a highly infectious DNA virus that causes a massive loss in marine aquaculture. Ectopic expression of VP88GFP, a fusion between green fluorescent protein and the envelope protein VP088, did not compromise the ES cell properties and susceptibility to SGIV infection. Although VP88GFP disperses evenly in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells, it undergoes aggregation and redistribution in SGIV-infected cells. Real-time visualization revealed multiple key stages of VP88GFP redistribution and the dynamics of viral assembly site (VAS). Specifically, VP88GFP entry into and condensation in the VAS occurred within a 6-h duration, a similar duration was observed also for the release of VP88GFP-containing SGIV out of the cell. Taken together, VP088 is an excellent marker for visualizing the SGIV infection process. Our results provide new insight into macromolecular component recruitment and SGIV assembly.

Since oncogene expression could often modulate sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, we wanted to examine if N-myc expression status would determine virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that induction of exogenous N-myc in a non-N-myc-amplified cell line background (TET-21N) increased susceptibility to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (mutant VSVΔM51) and alleviated the type I IFN-induced antiviral state. Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSVΔM51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFN-stimulated antiviral state. Our studies suggest the potential utility of N-myc amplification/overexpression as a predictive biomarker of virotherapy response for high-risk NB using IFN-sensitive oncolytic viruses.","Corredor, Juan C; Redding, Nicole; Bloté, Karen; Robbins, Stephen M; Senger, Donna L; Bell, John C; Beaudry, Paul",Mol Ther Oncolytics,37,11

Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19. Our results provide a model in which DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells to enhance their nuclear export. Information gained from this virus-host interaction improves the understanding of both the IAV replication cycle and the cellular function of DDX19.","Diot, Cédric; Fournier, Guillaume; Dos Santos, Mélanie; Magnus, Julie; Komarova, Anastasia; van der Werf, Sylvie; Munier, Sandie; Naffakh, Nadia",Sci Rep,37,28

H5N1 HPAI virus infection induced a decrease of dendritic cell number in the splenic extrafollicular T-cell zone and impaired formation of the outer layers of B-cell follicles, resulting in insufficient levels of antibody production after infection. However, in animals vaccinated with a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the H5 hemagglutinin, infection with H5N1 HPAI virus induced parafollicular dendritic cell accumulation and efficient antibody production.

A range of compounds currently available with broad antimicrobial activity have been tested for activity against EBOV. Using live EBOV, eighteen candidate compounds were screened for antiviral activity in vitro. The compounds were selected on a rational basis because their mechanisms of action suggested that they had the potential to disrupt EBOV entry, replication or exit from cells or because they had displayed some antiviral activity against EBOV in previous tests. Nine compounds caused no reduction in viral replication despite cells remaining healthy, so they were excluded from further analysis (zidovudine; didanosine; stavudine; abacavir sulphate; entecavir; JB1a; Aimspro; celgosivir; and castanospermine). A second screen of the remaining compounds and the feasibility of appropriateness for in vivo testing removed six further compounds (ouabain; omeprazole; esomeprazole; Gleevec; D-LANA-14; and Tasigna).

They signal through the Janus kinases (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway and promote an antiviral state by the induction of expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Contrary to type I IFNs, the effect of IFN-λ cytokines is largely limited to epithelial cells due to the restricted pattern of expression of their specific receptor. Several genome-wide association studies have established a strong correlation between polymorphism in the region of IL-28B gene (encoding for IFN-λ3) and both spontaneous and therapeutic IFN-mediated clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the mechanism(s) underlying this enhanced viral clearance are not fully understood. IFN-λ3 directly inhibits HCV replication, and in vitro studies suggest that polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 and its recently identified overlapping IFN-λ4 govern the pattern of ISGs induced upon HCV infection of hepatocytes. IFN-λ can also be produced by dendritic cells, and apart from its antiviral action on hepatocytes, it can regulate the inflammatory response of monocytes/macrophages, thus acting at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity.

Fitting of the atomic resolution X-ray data from expressed, truncated deletion constructs within our 11 Å structure of the entire molecule demonstrates the relationship between the GP1-GP2 domains, the mucin-like and transmembrane domains, and the bilaminar lipid envelope. We show that the mucin-like domain covers the glycan cap and partially occludes the receptor binding sites prior to proteolytic cleavage. Our structure is also consistent with key antibody neutralisation sites on GP being accessible prior to proteolysis.

The IFNL4-ΔG genotype, which encodes functional IFN-λ4 protein, is associated with a poor treatment response. In the present study, we investigated the induction and biological effects of IFN-λ4 in HCV-infected hepatocytes and their association with responsiveness to IFN-α. We also studied the effects of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment on IFN-λ4 expression and IFN-α responsiveness. HCV infection induced IFN-λ4 expression at mRNA and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). In hepatoma cells, IFNL4 gene transfection or recombinant IFN-λ4 protein treatment robustly increased the protein levels of ISG15 and USP18 in an IFNLR1-dependent manner and potently blocked IFN-α signalling. The ISG15/USP18-mediated IFN-α unresponsiveness was demonstrated by transfection of siRNAs targeting ISG15 and/or USP18. This potent IFN-λ4 effect was related to prolonged ISG expression after IFNL4 gene transfection. DAA treatment of HCV-infected PHHs reduced the expression of IFN-λs, including IFN-λ4, and restored IFN-α responsiveness.

The live attenuated vaccine strain, YFV-17D, has significantly contributed in controlling the global burden of yellow fever worldwide. However, the viral and host contributions to YFV-17D attenuation remain elusive. Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) signaling and type II interferon (IFN-γ) signaling have been shown to be mutually supportive in controlling YFV-17D infection despite distinct mechanisms of action in viral infection. However, it remains unclear how type III IFN (IFN-λ) integrates into this antiviral system. Here, we report that while wild-type (WT) and IFN-λ receptor knockout (λR(−/−)) mice were largely resistant to YFV-17D, deficiency in type I IFN signaling resulted in robust infection. Although IFN-α/β receptor knockout (α/βR(−/−)) mice survived the infection, mice with combined deficiencies in both type I signaling and type III IFN signaling were hypersusceptible to YFV-17D and succumbed to the infection. Mortality was associated with viral neuroinvasion and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). α/βR(−/−) λR(−/−) mice also exhibited distinct changes in the frequencies of multiple immune cell lineages, impaired T-cell activation, and severe perturbation of the proinflammatory cytokine balance. Taken together, our data highlight that type III IFN has critical immunomodulatory and neuroprotective functions that prevent viral neuroinvasion during active YFV-17D replication. Type III IFN thus likely represents a safeguard mechanism crucial for controlling YFV-17D infection and contributing to shaping vaccine immunogenicity.","Douam, Florian; Soto Albrecht, Yentli E.; Hrebikova, Gabriela; Sadimin, Evita; Davidson, Christian; Kotenko, Sergei V.; Ploss, Alexander",mBio,37,28

This process leads to the formation of multinucleated giant cells and facilitates bacterial access to an uninfected host cell in a direct manner. Despite its importance in virulence, the mechanism of the T6SS-5 and the role of host cell factors in cell-cell fusion remain elusive. To date, the T6SS-5 is the only system of bacterial origin known to induce host-cell fusion. To gain insight into the nature of T6SS-5-stimulated membrane fusion, we investigated the contribution of cholesterol and proteins exposed on the host cell surface, which were shown to be critically involved in virus-mediated giant cell formation. In particular, we analyzed the effect of host cell surface protein and cholesterol depletion on the formation of multinucleated giant cells induced by B. thailandensis. Acute protease treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages during infection with B. thailandensis followed by agarose overlay assays revealed a strong reduction in the number of cell-cell fusions compared with EDTA treated cells. Similarly, proteolytic treatment of specifically infected donor cells or uninfected recipient cells significantly decreased multinucleated giant cell formation. Furthermore, modulating host cell cholesterol content by acute cholesterol depletion from cellular membranes by methyl- β-cyclodextrin treatment or exogenous addition of cholesterol impaired the ability of B. thailandensis to induce cell-cell fusions. The requirement of physiological cholesterol levels suggests that the membrane organization or mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer influence the fusion process. Altogether, our data suggest that membrane fusion induced by B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis involves a complex interplay between the T6SS-5 and the host cell.","Whiteley, Liam; Haug, Maria; Klein, Kristina; Willmann, Matthias; Bohn, Erwin; Chiantia, Salvatore; Schwarz, Sandra",PLoS One,37,8

While autophagy has been shown to function in host antiviral defense by eliminating intracellular viruses and regulating adaptive immunity, several viruses have evolved molecular mechanisms to get benefits from it. The deltaretrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) has been reported to profit its replication from enhancing autophagosome accumulation. Here, we reported that HLA-DMB (generally referred to here as DMB), the beta chain of the non-classical MHC-II protein HLA-DM, had strong expression in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines and could be induced in Hela, PMA-differentiated THP1 (PMA-THP1) or primary human monocytes by HTLV-1 infection. Immunoblot and real-time PCR assays demonstrated that overexpression of DMB decreased HTLV-1 protein expression while the knockdown of DMB increased HTLV-1 protein expression. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy assays indicated that overexpression of DMB decreased HTLV-1 induced autophagosome accumulation while the knockdown of DMB yielded the opposite effects. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation experiments suggested DMB interacted with autophagy-related gene (ATG) 7 and increased the acetylation of ATG7.

At 10 hpi, 104 genes were down-regulated and 64 were up-regulated, while the expressions of 47 genes were increased and only one was down-regulated, which may play a role in retinoic acid biosynthesis, at 18 hpi in the ARV-infected cells. The similar profiles of up-regulated genes between the two groups of infected cells suggest that ARV infection activated a prolonged antiviral response of host cells. Alternative splicing analysis found no significantly changed events altered by ARV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the differential expression profile presented in this study can be used to expand our understanding of the comprehensive interactions between ARV and the host cells, and may be helpful for us to reveal the pathogenic mechanism on the molecular level.

2958,2958,2958,Preclinical Development and Production of Virus-Like Particles As Vaccine Candidates for Hepatitis C,10.814612,7.4050455,2017-12-05,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infects 2% of the world’s population and is the leading cause of liver disease and liver transplantation. It poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies. However, these treatments will not prevent re-infection particularly in high risk populations. The introduction of a HCV vaccine has been predicted, using simulation models in a high risk population, to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of HCV. A vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce HCV incidence in this population. Virus like particles (VLPs) are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses. Thus, VLPs represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses. Currently, many VLP-based vaccines have entered clinical trials, while licensed VLP vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) have been in use for many years. The HCV core, E1 and E2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic VLPs while inclusion of HCV antigens into heterogenous (chimeric) VLPs is also a promising approach. These VLPs are produced using different expression systems such as bacterial, yeast, mammalian, plant, or insect cells. Here, this paper will review HCV VLP-based vaccines and their immunogenicity in animal models as well as the different expression systems used in their production.","Masavuli, Makutiro Ghislain; Wijesundara, Danushka K.; Torresi, Joseph; Gowans, Eric J.; Grubor-Bauk, Branka",Front Microbiol,37,28

They are able to carry a specific single stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequence of choice inside their capsid, thus protecting it against the effects of ubiquitous nucleases. Such particles are able to mimic ssRNA viruses and, thus, may serve as the process control for molecular detection and quantification of such agents in several kinds of matrices, vaccines and vaccine candidates, drug delivery systems, and systems for the display of immunologically active peptides or nanomachines. Currently, there are several different in vivo plasmid-driven packaging systems for production of MS2 PLP. In order to combine all the advantages of the available systems and to upgrade and simplify the production and purification of MS2 PLP, a one-plasmid double-expression His-tag system was designed. The described system utilizes a unique fusion insertional mutation enabling purification of particles using His-tag affinity. Using this new production system, highly pure MS2 PLP can be quickly produced and purified by a fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) approach. The system can be easily adapted to produce other MS2 PLP with different properties.","Mikel, Pavel; Vasickova, Petra; Kralik, Petr",Sci Rep,37,1

The causal organism is a protozoan parasite of genus Plasmodium which spreads to the human host by the bite of hitherto infected female Anopheles mosquito. In the course of biting, a salivary protein of Anopheles helps in blood feeding behavior and having the ability to elicit the host immune response. This study represents a series of immunoinformatics approaches to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine using Anopheles mosquito salivary proteins. Designed subunit vaccine was evaluated for its immunogenicity, allergenicity and physiochemical parameters. To enhance the stability of vaccine protein, disulfide engineering was performed in a region of high mobility. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning was also performed to ensure the higher expression of designed subunit vaccine in E. coli K12 expression system. Finally, molecular docking and simulation study was performed for the vaccine protein and TLR-4 receptor, to determine the binding free energy and complex stability. Moreover, the designed subunit vaccine was found to induce anti-salivary immunity which may have the ability to prevent the entry of Plasmodium sporozoites into the human host.","Pandey, Rajan Kumar; Bhatt, Tarun Kumar; Prajapati, Vijay Kumar",Sci Rep,37,1

Additionally, there are 70 and 575 antibody-based molecules in phase III and phase I/II clinical trials, respectively. These total 719 antibody-based clinical stage molecules include 493 naked IgGs, 87 antibody-drug conjugates, 61 bispecific antibodies, 37 total Fc fusion proteins, 17 radioimmunoglobulins, 13 antibody fragments, and 11 immunocytokines. New uses for these antibodies are being discovered each year. For oncology, many of the exciting new approaches involve antibody modulation of T-cells. There are over 80 antibodies in clinical trials targeting T cell checkpoints, 26 T-cell-redirected bispecific antibodies, and 145 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell-based candidates (all currently in phase I or II clinical trials), totaling more than 250 T cell interacting clinical stage antibody-based candidates. Finally, significant progress has been made recently on routes of delivery, including delivery of proteins across the blood-brain barrier, oral delivery to the gut, delivery to the cellular cytosol, and gene- and viral-based delivery of antibodies. Thus, there are currently at least 864 antibody-based clinical stage molecules or cells, with incredible diversity in how they are constructed and what activities they impart. These are followed by a next wave of novel molecules, approaches, and new methods and routes of delivery, demonstrating that the field of antibody-based biologics is very innovative and diverse in its approaches to fulfill their promise to treat unmet medical needs.","Strohl, William R.",Protein Cell,37,8

Various Chinese herbal polysaccharides can activate the immune system. Cistanche deserticola (CD) is a traditional Chinese herb and an adjuvant candidate. Here, we confirmed that water-extractable polysaccharides of CD (WPCD) could modulate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. In a dose-dependent manner, WPCD significantly promoted the maturation and function of murine marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) through up-regulating the expression levels of MHC-II, CD86, CD80, and CD40, allogenic T cell proliferation, and the yields of IL-12 and TNF-α via toll-like receptor4 (TLR4), as indicated by in vitro experiments. In addition, its immunomodulatory activity was also observed in mice. WPCD effectively improved the titers of IgG, IgG(1) and IgG(2a) and markedly enhanced the proliferation of T and B cells, the production of IFN-γ and IL-4 in CD4(+) T cells and the expression level of IFN-γ in CD8(+) T cells better than Alum. Furthermore, WPCD could markedly up-regulate the expression levels of CD40 and CD80 on DCs in spleen and down-regulate the Treg frequency. The study suggests that polysaccharides of Cistanche deserticola are a safe and effective vaccine adjuvant for eliciting both humoral immunity and cellular immunity by activating DCs via TLR4 signaling pathway.","Zhang, Ailian; Yang, Xiumei; Li, Quanxiao; Yang, Yu; Zhao, Gan; Wang, Bin; Wu, Daocheng",PLoS One,37,1

Infections by Enterobacteriaceae producing metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), e.g., New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are very difficult to treat. Development of effective MBL inhibitors to revive the efficacy of existing antibiotics is highly desirable. However, such inhibitors are not clinically available till now. Here we show that an anti-Helicobacter pylori drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), and related Bi(III) compounds irreversibly inhibit different types of MBLs via the mechanism, with one Bi(III) displacing two Zn(II) ions as revealed by X-ray crystallography, leading to the release of Zn(II) cofactors. CBS restores meropenem (MER) efficacy against MBL-positive bacteria in vitro, and in mice infection model, importantly, also slows down the development of higher-level resistance in NDM-1-positive bacteria. This study demonstrates a high potential of Bi(III) compounds as the first broad-spectrum B1 MBL inhibitors to treat MBL-positive bacterial infection in conjunction with existing carbapenems.","Wang, Runming; Lai, Tsz-Pui; Gao, Peng; Zhang, Hongmin; Ho, Pak-Leung; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Ma, Guixing; Kao, Richard Yi-Tsun; Li, Hongyan; Sun, Hongzhe",Nat Commun,37,1

Ingestion has been shown as a natural route of transmission for both Lassa virus (LASV) and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Due to the mechanism of transmission, epithelial tissues are among the first host cells to come in contact with the viruses, and as such they potentially play a role in spread of virus to naïve hosts. The role of the intestinal epithelia during arenavirus infection remains to be uncharacterized. We have utilized a well-established cell culture model, Caco-2, to investigate the role of intestinal epithelia during intragastric infection. We found that LCMV-Armstrong, LCMV-WE, and Mopeia (MOPV) release infectious progeny via similar patterns. However, the reassortant virus, ML-29, containing the L segment of MOPV and S segment of LASV, exhibits a unique pattern of viral release relative to LCMV and MOPV. Furthermore, we have determined attachment efficacy to Caco-2 cells is potentially responsible for observed replication kinetics of these viruses in a polarized Caco-2 cell model. Collectively, our data shows that viral dissemination and interaction with intestinal epithelia may be host, tissue, and viral specific.","Warner, Nikole L.; Jokinen, Jenny D.; Beier, Juliane I.; Sokoloski, Kevin J.; Lukashevich, Igor S.",Viruses,37,1
3142,3142,3142,Host shifts result in parallel genetic changes when viruses evolve in closely related species,10.940459,7.3820767,2018-04-12,"Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.","Longdon, Ben; Day, Jonathan P.; Alves, Joel M.; Smith, Sophia C.

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) represent a huge reservoir of bioactive chemicals and many TCMs have been shown to have antiviral activities. 373 extracts from 128 TCMs were evaluated using a high throughput assay to screen for inhibitors of Ebola virus cell entry. Extract of Rhodiola rosea displayed specific and potent inhibition against cell entry of both Ebola virus and Marburg virus. In addition, twenty commercial compounds that were isolated from Rhodiola rosea were evaluated using the pseudotyped Ebola virus entry assay, and it was found that ellagic acid and gallic acid, which are two structurally related compounds, are the most effective ones. The activity of the extract and the two pure compounds were validated using infectious Ebola virus. The time-of-addition experiments suggest that, mechanistically, the Rhodiola rosea extract and the effective compounds act at an early step in the infection cycle following initial cell attachment, but prior to viral/cell membrane fusion. Our findings provide evidence that Rhodiola rosea has potent anti-filovirus properties that may be developed as a novel anti-Ebola treatment.","Cui, Qinghua; Du, Ruikun; Anantpadma, Manu; Schafer, Adam; Hou, Lin; Tian, Jingzhen; Davey, Robert A.; Cheng, Han; Rong, Lijun",Viruses,37,28

IFNs are cytokines, and bind receptors on cell surfaces to trigger signal transduction. The major signaling pathway activated by IFNs is the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway, a complex pathway involved in both viral and host survival strategies. On the one hand, viruses have evolved strategies to escape from antiviral host defenses evoked by IFN-activated JAK/STAT signaling. On the other hand, viruses have also evolved to exploit the JAK/STAT pathway to evoke activation of certain STATs that somehow promote viral pathogenesis. In this review, recent progress in our understanding of the virus-induced IFN-independent STAT signaling and its potential roles in viral induced inflammation and pathogenesis are summarized in detail, and perspectives are provided.","Nan, Yuchen; Wu, Chunyan; Zhang, Yan-Jin",Viruses,37,28

The self-aggregating AA protein responsible for this disease is a byproduct of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein degradation. Transcriptional induction of the SAA1 gene is dependent on both C/EBPβ and NF-κB cis-acting elements within the promoter region. In cheetahs, 2 alleles exist for a single guanine nucleotide deletion in the putative NF-κB binding site. In this study, a novel genotyping assay was developed to screen for the alleles. The results show that the SAA1A(−97delG) allele is associated with decreased SAA protein concentrations in the serum of captive cheetahs (n = 58), suggesting genetic differences at this locus may be affecting AA amyloidosis prevalence. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of the SAA1A(−97delG) allele between individuals confirmed AA amyloidosis positive versus AA amyloidosis negative at the time of necropsy (n = 48). Thus, even though there is evidence that having more copies of the SAA1A(−97delG) allele results in a potentially protective decrease in serum concentrations of SAA protein in captive cheetahs, genotype is not associated with this disease within the North American population. These results suggest that other factors are playing a more significant role in the pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis among captive cheetahs.","Franklin, Ashley D; Schmidt-Küntzel, Anne; Terio, Karen A; Marker, Laurie L; Crosier, Adrienne E",Journal of Heredity,37,1

While the effect of ECM stiffness on many aspects of cellular behavior has been studied previously, how ECM stiffness might mediate susceptibility of host cells to infection by bacterial pathogens is hitherto unexplored. To address this open question, we manufactured hydrogels of varying physiologically relevant stiffness and seeded human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) on them. We then infected HMEC-1 with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and found that adhesion of Lm to host cells increases monotonically with increasing matrix stiffness, an effect that requires the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified cell surface vimentin as a candidate surface receptor mediating stiffness-dependent adhesion of Lm to HMEC-1 and found that bacterial infection of these host cells is decreased when the amount of surface vimentin is reduced. Our results provide the first evidence that ECM stiffness can mediate the susceptibility of mammalian host cells to infection by a bacterial pathogen.","Bastounis, Effie E.; Yeh, Yi-Ting; Theriot, Julie A.",Mol Biol Cell,37,8

However, the mechanisms through which the brain’s immune system recognizes and controls viral infections propagating across synaptically linked neuronal circuits have remained unclear. Using a well-established model of alphaherpesvirus infection that reaches the brain exclusively via retrograde transsynaptic spread from the periphery, and in vivo two-photon imaging combined with high resolution microscopy, we show that microglia are recruited to and isolate infected neurons within hours. Selective elimination of microglia results in a marked increase in the spread of infection and egress of viral particles into the brain parenchyma, which are associated with diverse neurological symptoms. Microglia recruitment and clearance of infected cells require cell-autonomous P2Y12 signalling in microglia, triggered by nucleotides released from affected neurons. In turn, we identify microglia as key contributors to monocyte recruitment into the inflamed brain, which process is largely independent of P2Y12. P2Y12-positive microglia are also recruited to infected neurons in the human brain during viral encephalitis and both microglial responses and leukocyte numbers correlate with the severity of infection. Thus, our data identify a key role for microglial P2Y12 in defence against neurotropic viruses, whilst P2Y12-independent actions of microglia may contribute to neuroinflammation by facilitating monocyte recruitment to the sites of infection.

Despite a large body of evidence supporting mutagenesis as a conceivable antiviral strategy, there are currently no data on the sensitivity to increased mutagenesis for Zika virus (ZIKV) and Usutu virus (USUV), two emerging flaviviral threats. In this study, we demonstrate that both viruses are sensitive to three ribonucleosides, favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil, that have shown mutagenic activity against other RNA viruses while remaining unaffected by a mutagenic deoxyribonucleoside. Serial cell culture passages of ZIKV in the presence of these compounds resulted in the rapid extinction of infectivity, suggesting elevated sensitivity to mutagenesis. USUV extinction was achieved when a 10-fold dilution was applied between every passage, but not in experiments involving undiluted virus, indicating an overall lower susceptibility than ZIKV. Although the two viruses are inhibited by the same three drugs, ZIKV is relatively more susceptive to serial passage in the presence of purine analogues (favipiravir and ribavirin), while USUV replication is suppressed more efficiently by 5-fluorouracil. These differences in sensitivity typically correlate with the increases in the mutation frequencies observed in each nucleoside treatment. These results are relevant to the development of efficient therapies based on lethal mutagenesis and support the rational selection of different mutagenic nucleosides for each pathogen. We will discuss the implications of these results to the fidelity of flavivirus replication and the design of antiviral therapies based on lethal mutagenesis.","Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Sempere, Raquel Navarro; Meyn, Prashansa; Polacek, Charlotta; Arias, Armando",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,37,28

Here, using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we reveal the unique phosphoproteome dynamics that occur in the host cell within minutes of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We uncover cellular kinases required for the observed signaling pattern and find that inhibition of selected candidates, such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), leads to decreased IAV replication. As GRK2 has emerged as drug target in heart disease, we focus on its role in IAV infection and show that it is required for viral uncoating. Replication of seasonal and pandemic IAVs is severely decreased by specific GRK2 inhibitors in primary human airway cultures and in mice.

While typically asymptomatic, HCMV can cause fatal disease among congenitally infected infants and immunocompromised patients. These clinical issues are compounded by the emergence of antiviral resistance and the absence of an effective vaccine, the development of which is likely complicated by the numerous immune evasins encoded by HCMV to counter the host's adaptive immune responses, a feature that facilitates frequent super-infections. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HCMV is essential for the development of effective new drugs and vaccines. By comparing viral genomes from uncultivated or low-passaged clinical samples of diverse origins, we observe evidence of frequent homologous recombination events, both recent and ancient, and no structure of HCMV genetic diversity at the whole-genome scale. Analysis of individual gene-scale loci reveals a striking dichotomy: while most of the genome is highly conserved, recombines essentially freely and has evolved under purifying selection, 21 genes display extreme diversity, structured into distinct genotypes that do not recombine with each other. Most of these hyper-variable genes encode glycoproteins involved in cell entry or escape of host immunity. Evidence that half of them have diverged through episodes of intense positive selection suggests that rapid evolution of hyper-variable loci is likely driven by interactions with host immunity. It appears that this process is enabled by recombination unlinking hyper-variable loci from strongly constrained neighboring sites. It is conceivable that viral mechanisms facilitating super-infection have evolved to promote recombination between diverged genotypes, allowing the virus to continuously diversify at key loci to escape immune detection, while maintaining a genome optimally adapted to its asymptomatic infectious lifecycle.","Lassalle, Florent; Depledge, Daniel P.; Reeves, Matthew B.; Brown, Amanda C.; Christiansen, Mette T.; Tutill, Helena J.; Williams, Rachel J.; Einer-Jensen, Katja; Holdstock, Jolyon; Atkinson, Claire; Brown, Julianne R.; van Loenen, Freek B.; Clark, Duncan A.; Griffiths, Paul D.; Verjans, Georges M.G.M.; Schutten, Martin; Milne, Richard S.B.; Balloux, Francois; Breuer, Judith",Virus Evol,37,11

The mechanism(s) of ZIKV intrauterine transmission, the cell types involved, the most vulnerable period of pregnancy for severe outcomes from infection and other physiopathological aspects are not completely elucidated. In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of 24 women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these third-trimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects.

3454,3454,3454,A High-Throughput Screening Approach To Repurpose FDA-Approved Drugs for Bactericidal Applications against Staphylococcus aureus Small-Colony Variants,11.078045,7.735316,2018-10-31,"Drug repurposing offers an expedited and economical route to develop new clinical therapeutics in comparison to traditional drug development. Growth-based high-throughput screening is concomitant with drug repurposing and enables rapid identification of new therapeutic uses for investigated drugs; however, this traditional method is not compatible with microorganisms with abnormal growth patterns such as Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCV). SCV subpopulations are auxotrophic for key compounds in biosynthetic pathways, which result in low growth rate. SCV formation is also associated with reduced antibiotic susceptibility, and the SCV’s ability to revert to the normal cell growth state is thought to contribute to recurrence of S. aureus infections. Thus, there is a critical need to identify antimicrobial agents that are potent against SCV in order to effectively treat chronic infections. Accordingly, here we describe adapting an adenylate kinase (AK)-based cell death reporter assay to identify members of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library that display bactericidal activity against S. aureus SCV. Four library members, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, exhibited potent SCV bactericidal activity against a stable S. aureus SCV. Further investigation showed that sitafloxacin was potent against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus, as well as S. aureus within an established biofilm. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability to use the AK assay to screen small-molecule libraries for SCV bactericidal agents and highlight the therapeutic potential of sitafloxacin to be repurposed to treat chronic S. aureus infections associated with SCV and/or biofilm growth states. IMPORTANCE Conventional antibiotics fail to successfully treat chronic osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and device-related and airway infections. These recurring infections are associated with the emergence of SCV, which are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics. Studies have investigated antibiotic therapies to treat SCV-related infections but have had little success, emphasizing the need to identify novel antimicrobial drugs. However, drug discovery is a costly and time-consuming process. An alternative strategy is drug repurposing, which could identify FDA-approved and well-characterized drugs that could have off-label utility in treating SCV. In this study, we adapted a high-throughput AK-based assay to identify 4 FDA-approved drugs, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, which display antimicrobial activity against S. aureus SCV, suggesting an avenue for drug repurposing in order to effectively treat SCV-related infections. Additionally, this screening paradigm can easily be adapted for other drug/chemical libraries to identify compounds bactericidal against SCV.","Trombetta, Ryan P.; Dunman, Paul M.; Schwarz, Edward M.; Kates, Stephen L.; Awad, Hani A.",mSphere,37,1

Limiting infections and providing patients with optimal drug regimens require timely strain identification as well as virulence and drug-resistance profiling. Additionally, prophylactic interventions based on the identification of environmental sources of recurrent infections (e.g., contaminated sinks) and reconstruction of transmission chains (i.e., who infected whom) could help to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections. WGS could hold the key to solving these issues. However, uptake in the clinic has been slow. Some major scientific and logistical challenges need to be solved before WGS fulfils its potential in clinical microbial diagnostics. In this review we identify major bottlenecks that need to be resolved for WGS to routinely inform clinical intervention and discuss possible solutions.","Balloux, Francois; Brønstad Brynildsrud, Ola; van Dorp, Lucy; Shaw, Liam P.; Chen, Hongbin; Harris, Kathryn A.; Wang, Hui; Eldholm, Vegard",Trends Microbiol,37,1

In the work reported here, we detected that homoharringtonine (HHT) presents effective antiviral activity. HHT completely inhibited infections of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 nM in cell cultures, respectively. Treatment with HHT at doses of 0.05 or 0.2 mg/kg significantly reduced viral load and relieved severe symptoms in PEDV- or NDV-infected animals. HHT treatment, however, moderately inhibited avian influenza virus (AIV) infection, suggesting its potent antiviral action is restricted to a number of classes of RNA viruses. In this study, we also observed that HHT actively inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 139 nM; the treatment with HHT at 1000 nM led to reductions of three orders of magnitude. Moreover, HHT antagonized the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (p-eIF4E), which might regulate the selective translation of specific messenger RNA (mRNA). HHT provides a starting point for further progress toward the clinical development of broad-spectrum antivirals.","Dong, Hui-Jun; Wang, Zhao-Hua; Meng, Wen; Li, Cui-Cui; Hu, Yan-Xin; Zhou, Lei; Wang, Xiao-Jia",Viruses,37,1

In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of poultry and hundreds of people. The two main means of international spread are through migratory birds and the live poultry trade. We focus on the role played by the live poultry trade in the spread of H5N1 across three regions widely infected by the disease, which also correspond to three major trade blocs: the European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Across all three regions, we found per-capita GDP (a proxy for modernization, general biosecurity, and value-at-risk) to be risk reducing. A more specific biosecurity measure–general surveillance–was also found to be mitigating at the all-regions level. However, there were important inter-regional differences. For the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc live poultry imports were risk reducing while extra-bloc imports were risk increasing; for ECOWAS the reverse was true. This is likely due to the fact that while the EU and ASEAN have long-standing biosecurity standards and stringent enforcement (pursuant to the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), ECOWAS suffered from a lack of uniform standards and lax enforcement.","Wu, Tong; Perrings, Charles",PLoS One,37,1

This study aims to develop chloroquine-loaded poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanoparticles (CQ-NP) to improve the chloroquine anti- HSV-1 efficacy. CQ-NP were successfully prepared using a modified emulsification-solvent evaporation method. Physicochemical properties of the NP were monitored using dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, drug loading efficiency, and drug release studies. Spherical nanoparticles were produced with modal diameter of <300 nm, zeta potential of −20 mv and encapsulation efficiency of 64.1%. In vitro assays of CQ-NP performed in Vero E6 cells, using the MTT-assay, revealed different cytotoxicity levels. Blank nanoparticles (B-NP) were biocompatible. Finally, the antiviral activity tested by the plaque reduction assay revealed greater efficacy for CQ-NP compared to CQ at concentrations equal to or lower than 20 µg mL(−1) (p < 0.001).

3644,3644,3644,Pathogen diversity drives the evolution of generalist MHC-II alleles in human populations,11.034634,7.5279374,2019-01-31,"Central players of the adaptive immune system are the groups of proteins encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which shape the immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides. The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.","Manczinger, Máté; Boross, Gábor; Kemény, Lajos; Müller, Viktor; Lenz, Tobias L.; Papp, Balázs; Pál, Csaba",PLoS Biol,37,11

We conducted a cross sectional study of 124 406 reproductive-age Chinese females who participated in the National Free Pre-conception Check-up Projects to investigate the risk of HBV infection among females with LG6PD and its effect on liver enzyme. Based on HBV serological test results, the participants were divided into the susceptible, immunized, and HBV infected groups. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for HBV infection in LG6PD participants were 1.71 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45–2.01) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.23–1.62), respectively with the susceptible and immunized participants as references, compared to those without LG6PD. Participants with HBV infection only and combined with HBV infection and LG6PD had 184% and 249% significantly higher risks of elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) (susceptible participants as reference). If the immunized participants were used as reference, significant higher odds of elevated ALT occurred (3.48 (95% CI: 3.18–3.80), 4.28 (95% CI: 2.92–6.28)). Thus, reproductive-age females with LG6PD had a higher prevalence of HBV infection, and LG6PD might exacerbate ALT elevation in HBV infected females. Our findings underscore the need to explore collaborative management approaches for these two diseases among reproductive-age females for maternal and child health.","Zhao, Jun; Zhang, Xu; Guan, Ting; Dai, Qiaoyun; He, Wenshan; Zhang, Hongguang; Wang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Bei; Peng, Zuoqi; Hu, Xuhuai; Qi, Daxun; Yang, Xueying; Zhang, Yue; Ma, Xu",Sci Rep,37,28

NiV is endemic to Bangladesh and Malaysia and is highly fatal to both livestock and humans (human case fatality rate = 74.5%). Currently, there is no approved vaccine against NiV on the market. The goal of this study was to use a recombinant RABV vector expressing NiV glycoprotein (NiV G) to develop a bivalent candidate vaccine against NiV disease and rabies virus (RABV) disease, which is also a significant health burden in the regions where NiV is endemic. The rabies vector is a well-established vaccine strain that lacks neurovirulence and can stably expresses foreign antigens that are immunogenic in various animal models. Mice inoculated intranasally with the live recombinant RABV/NiV vaccine (NIPARAB) showed no signs of disease. To test the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of live vaccine particles or two doses of chemically inactivated viral particles. Both vaccination groups showed NiV G-specific seroconversion, and the inactivated (INAC) vaccine group yielded higher titers of NiV G-specific antibodies. Furthermore, cross-reactivity of NiV G-specific immune sera against Hendra virus (HeV), was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) and indirect ELISA against soluble recombinant HeV glycoprotein (HeV G). Both live and killed vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies. These results indicate that NIPARAB may be used as a killed virus vaccine to protect humans against NiV and RABV, and possibly as a preventative measure against HeV as well.","Keshwara, Rohan; Shiels, Thomas; Postnikova, Elena; Kurup, Drishya; Wirblich, Christoph; Johnson, Reed F.; Schnell, Matthias J.",NPJ Vaccines,37,13

Initial exposure to HCV is most often followed by chronic hepatitis, with only a minority of individuals spontaneously clearing the virus. The induction of sustained and broadly directed HCV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, together with neutralizing antibodies (nAb), and specific genetic polymorphism have been associated with spontaneous resolution of the infection. However, due to its high variability, HCV is able to overwhelm the host immune response through the rapid acquisition of mutations in the epitopes targeted by T cells and neutralizing antibodies. In this context, immune-mediated pressure represents the main force in driving HCV evolution. This review summarizes the data on HCV diversity and the current state of knowledge about the contributions of antibodies, T cells, and host genetic polymorphism in driving HCV evolution in vivo.","Lapa, Daniele; Garbuglia, Anna Rosa; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Del Porto, Paola",Cells,37,28

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes characterized by spectacular polymorphism and fitness association have become valuable adaptive markers. Herein we investigate the variation of all MHC class I and II genes across seven populations of an endangered bird, the crested ibis, of which all current individuals are offspring of only two pairs. We inferred seven multilocus haplotypes from linked alleles in the Core Region and revealed structural variation of the class II region that probably evolved through unequal crossing over. Based on the low polymorphism, structural variation, strong linkage, and extensive shared alleles, we applied the MHC haplotypes in population analysis. The genetic variation and population structure at MHC haplotypes are generally concordant with those expected from microsatellites, underlining the predominant role of genetic drift in shaping MHC variation in the bottlenecked populations. Nonetheless, some populations showed elevated differentiation at MHC, probably due to limited gene flow. The seven populations were significantly differentiated into three groups and some groups exhibited genetic monomorphism, which can be attributed to founder effects. We therefore propose various strategies for future conservation and management.","Lan, Hong; Zhou, Tong; Wan, Qiu-Hong; Fang, Sheng-Guo",Cells,37,1

The main goal of aging research is to find therapies that attenuate aging and alleviate aging-related diseases. In this study, we screened a natural product library for geroprotective compounds using Werner syndrome (WS) human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), a premature aging model that we recently established. Ten candidate compounds were identified and quercetin was investigated in detail due to its leading effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that quercetin alleviated senescence via the enhancement of cell proliferation and restoration of heterochromatin architecture in WS hMSCs. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the transcriptional commonalities and differences in the geroprotective effects by quercetin and Vitamin C. Besides WS hMSCs, quercetin also attenuated cellular senescence in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and physiological-aging hMSCs.

These antiviral cytokines have evolved remarkable molecular and functional diversity to confront ever-evolving viral threats and physiological regulation. We have annotated IFN gene families across 110 animal genomes, and showed that IFN genes, after originating in jawed fishes, had several significant evolutionary surges in vertebrate species of amphibians, bats and ungulates, particularly pigs and cattle. For example, pigs have the largest but still expanding type I IFN family consisting of nearly 60 IFN-coding genes that encode seven IFN subtypes including multigene subtypes of IFN-α, -δ, and -ω. Whereas, subtypes such as IFN-α and -β have been widely studied in many species, the unconventional subtypes such as IFN-ω have barely been investigated. We have cross-species defined the IFN evolution, and shown that unconventional IFN subtypes particularly the IFN-ω subtype have evolved several novel features including: (1) being a signature multi-gene subtype expanding primarily in mammals such as bats and ungulates, (2) emerging isoforms that have superior antiviral potency than typical IFN-α, (3) highly cross-species antiviral (but little anti-proliferative) activity exerted in cells of humans and other mammalian species, and (4) demonstrating potential novel molecular and functional properties. This study focused on IFN-ω to investigate the immunogenetic evolution and functional diversity of unconventional IFN subtypes, which may further IFN-based novel antiviral design pertinent to their cross-species high antiviral and novel activities.","Shields, Lauren E.; Jennings, Jordan; Liu, Qinfang; Lee, Jinhwa; Ma, Wenjun; Blecha, Frank; Miller, Laura C.; Sang, Yongming",Front Immunol,37,1

Ebola GP2 plays a critical role in virus entry and has similarities in mechanism and structure to the HIV gp41 protein for which inhibitors have been successfully developed. In this work, a putative binding pocket for the C-terminal heptad repeat in the N-terminal heptad repeat trimer was targeted for identification of small molecules that arrest EBOV-host membrane fusion. Two computational structure-based virtual screens of ∼1.7 M compounds were performed (DOCK program) against a GP2 five-helix bundle, resulting in 165 commercially available compounds purchased for experimental testing. Based on assessment of inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, and target specificity, four promising candidates emerged with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the 3 to 26 μM range. Molecular dynamics simulations of the two most potent candidates in their DOCK-predicted binding poses indicate that the majority of favorable interactions involve seven highly conserved residues that can be used to guide further inhibitor development and refinement targeting EBOV. IMPORTANCE The most recent Ebola virus disease outbreak, from 2014 to 2016, resulted in approximately 28,000 individuals becoming infected, which led to over 12,000 causalities worldwide. The particularly high pathogenicity of the virus makes paramount the identification and development of promising lead compounds to serve as inhibitors of Ebola infection. To limit viral load, the virus-host membrane fusion event can be targeted through the inhibition of the class I fusion glycoprotein of Ebolavirus. In the current work, several promising small-molecule inhibitors that target the glycoprotein GP2 were identified through systematic application of structure-based computational and experimental drug design procedures.","Singleton, Courtney D.; Humby, Monica S.; Yi, Hyun Ah; Rizzo, Robert C.; Jacobs, Amy",J Virol,37,28

Here, viral cell-binding proteins and their cognate cellular receptors were investigated using two ranaviruses, Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV) and Rana grylio virus (RGV), and two different cell lines, Chinese giant salamander thymus cells (GSTC) and Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells. The heparan sulfate (HS) analog heparin inhibited plaque formation of ADRV and RGV in the two cell lines by more than 80% at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. In addition, enzymatic removal of cell surface HS by heparinase I markedly reduced plaque formation by both viruses and competition with heparin reduced virus-cell binding. These results indicate that cell surface HS is involved in ADRV and RGV cell binding and infection. Furthermore, recombinant viral envelope proteins ADRV-58L and RGV-53R bound heparin-Sepharose beads implying the potential that cell surface HS is involved in the initial interaction between ranaviruses and susceptible host cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying cell surface HS as ranavirus binding factor and furthers understanding of interactions between ranaviruses and host cells.","Ke, Fei; Wang, Zi-Hao; Ming, Cheng-Yue; Zhang, Qi-Ya",Viruses,37,1

This study offers strong evidence to support the roles that the CALT and HG play in the development of protective ILTV immune responses. It supports the premise that ILTV-mediated immunomodulation favors the B cell response over those of T cells. Further, it provides evidence that expansions of CD8α(+) cells, with the concomitant expression of the Granzyme A gene, are key to reducing viral genomes in the CALT and halting ILTV cytolytic replication in the conjunctiva. Ultimately, this study revealed that the early upregulation of interleukin (IL)-12p40 and Interferon (IFN)-γ cytokine genes, which shape the antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses, retarded the decline of virus replication, and enhanced the development of lesions in the conjunctiva epithelium.","Beltrán, Gabriela; Hurley, David J.; Gogal, Robert M.; Sharif, Shayan; Read, Leah R.; Williams, Susan M.; Jerry, Carmen F.; Maekawa, Daniel A.; García, Maricarmen",Viruses,37,28

Although the DC-targeting strategy has attracted more attention, relevant studies on chicken are rare. Here, specific chicken bone marrow DC-binding peptides were selected using a phage display peptide library and confirmed through ELISA, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and laser confocal microscopy. The peptide candidate SPHLHTSSPWER, named SP, was fused to the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) structural protein and protective antigen VP2. In vitro, the expression of DC markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, DEC205, and MHCII) and some cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCLi1) by VP2-SP-stimulated DCs was significantly higher than that by DCs treated with the VP2-control peptide at 4 h (p < 0.001). In addition, an oral vaccine targeting DCs was generated using chicken-borne Lactobacillus saerimneri M11 (L. sae M11) to deliver VP2 fused with SP. Anti-IBDV mucosal and humoral immune responses were induced efficiently via oral administration, resulting in higher protective efficacy in the VP2-SP group than the VP2 group. Therefore, chicken DC targeting of IBDV protective antigen VP2 delivered by L. sae provides effective immune protection in chicken.

In this report, we study the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced apoptosis by investigating the unfolded protein response (UPR). We found that NDV infection activated all three branches of the UPR signaling (PERK-eIF2α, ATF6, and IRE1α) and triggered apoptosis, in avian cells (DF-1 and CEF) and in various human cancer cell types (HeLa, Cal27, HN13, A549, H1299, Huh7, and HepG2). Interestingly, the suppression of either apoptosis or UPR led to impaired NDV proliferation. Meanwhile, the inhibition of UPR by 4-PBA protected cells from NDV-induced apoptosis. Further study revealed that activation of PERK-eIF2α induced the expression of transcription factor CHOP, which subsequently promoted apoptosis by downregulating BCL-2/MCL-1, promoting JNK signaling and suppressing AKT signaling. In parallel, IRE1α mediated the splicing of XBP1 mRNA and resulted in the translation and nuclear translocation of XBP1s, thereby promoting the transcription of ER chaperones and components of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Furthermore, IRE1α promoted apoptosis and cytokines secretion via the activation of JNK signaling. Knock down and overexpression studies showed that CHOP, IRE1α, XBP1, and JNK supported efficient virus proliferation. Our study demonstrates that the induction of eIF2α-CHOP-BCL-2/JNK and IRE1α-XBP1/JNK signaling cascades promote apoptosis and cytokines secretion, and these signaling cascades support NDV proliferation.","Li, Yanrong; Jiang, Weiyu; Niu, Qiaona; Sun, Yingjie; Meng, Chunchun; Tan, Lei; Song, Cuiping; Qiu, Xusheng; Liao, Ying; Ding, Chan",Cell Death Dis,37,28

There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable.

We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout and the assay displayed no cross-reactivity to other 13 swine viruses including classical swine fever (CSF). CORDS could identify the ASFV DNA target at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37°C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the reagents of CORDS were lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4°C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provide a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection. Lyophilized CORDS can withstand long-term transportation and storage, and is ready for field-based applications.","Bai, Jing; Lin, Haosi; Li, Haojian; Zhou, Yang; Liu, Junshan; Zhong, Guorui; Wu, Luting; Jiang, Weifan; Du, Hongli; Yang, Jinyi; Xie, Qingmei; Huang, Lizhen",Front Microbiol,37,1
4292,4292,4292,The pan-genome of Treponema pallidum reveals differences in genome plasticity between subspecies related to venereal and non-venereal syphilis,11.166563,7.5886035,2020-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Spirochetal organisms of the Treponema genus are responsible for causing Treponematoses. Pathogenic treponemes is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete pathogen that causes syphilis in human. Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) causes endemic syphilis (bejel); T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA) causes venereal syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) causes yaws; and T. pallidum subsp. Ccarateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is mediated by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact. The global distribution of syphilis is alarming and there is an increasing need of proper treatment and preventive measures. Unfortunately, effective measures are limited. RESULTS: Here, the genome sequences of 53 T. pallidum strains isolated from different parts of the world and a diverse range of hosts were comparatively analysed using pan-genomic strategy. Phylogenomic, pan-genomic, core genomic and singleton analysis disclosed the close connection among all strains of the pathogen T. pallidum, its clonal behaviour and showed increases in the sizes of the pan-genome. Based on the genome plasticity analysis of the subsets containing the subspecies T pallidum subsp. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, we found differences in the presence/absence of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and genomic islands (GIs) on subsp.-based study. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we identified four pathogenicity islands (PAIs), eight genomic islands (GIs) in subsp. pallidum, whereas subsp. endemicum has three PAIs and seven GIs and subsp. pertenue harbours three PAIs and eight GIs. Concerning the presence of genes in PAIs and GIs, we found some genes related to lipid and amino acid biosynthesis that were only present in the subsp. of T. pallidum, compared to T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue.","Jaiswal, Arun Kumar; Tiwari, Sandeep; Jamal, Syed Babar; de Castro Oliveira, Letícia; Alves, Leandro Gomes; Azevedo, Vasco; Ghosh, Preetam; Oliveira, Carlo Jose Freira; Soares, Siomar C.",BMC Genomics,37,1

Therefore, effective vaccines against H5N1 viruses are needed to counter the potential threat of a global pandemic. We have previously developed a fast-acting and efficacious vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform. In this study, we generated recombinant VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus vectors to demonstrate the feasibility of this platform for a fast-acting pan-H5 influenza virus vaccine. We chose multiple approaches regarding antigen design and genome location to define a more optimized vaccine approach. After the VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus constructs were recovered and characterized in vitro, mice were vaccinated by a single dose or prime/boost regimen followed by challenge with a lethal dose of the homologous H5 clade 1 virus. We found that a single dose of VSV vectors expressing full-length hemagglutinin (HAfl) were sufficient to provide 100% protection. The vaccine vectors were fast-acting as demonstrated by uniform protection when administered 3 days prior to lethal challenge. Moreover, single vaccination induced cross-protective H5-specific antibodies and protected mice against lethal challenge with various H5 clade 2 viruses, highlighting the potential of the VSV-based HAfl as a pan-H5 influenza virus emergency vaccine.","Furuyama, Wakako; Reynolds, Pierce; Haddock, Elaine; Meade-White, Kimberly; Quynh Le, Mai; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Feldmann, Heinz; Marzi, Andrea",NPJ Vaccines,37,28

The current prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for IAV requires frequent changes due to the continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shift of IAV. Emerging evidence indicates that the host microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Cellular miRNAs may directly target virus to inhibit its infection and be developed as potential anti-virus drugs. METHODS: In this study, we established a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening method using miRanda software. The screened miRNAs were further verified by luciferase assay, viral protein expression assay and virus replication assay. RESULTS: Five cellular miRNAs (miR-188-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-3183, miR-15-3p and miR-769-3p), targeting 99.96, 95.31, 92.9, 94.58 and 97.24% of human IAV strains recorded in NCBI, respectively, were chosen for further experimental verification. Finally, we found that miR-188-3p downregulated PB2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeted the predicted sites on PB2 and effectively inhibited the replication of IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report screening cellular miRNAs that broad-spectrum inhibiting IAV infection.

METHODS: We mapped available clinical research sites through interrogation of online clinical trial registries and relevant disease-based consortia. A structured online questionnaire was used to assess the capability of clinical trial sites to conduct Lassa fever vaccine clinical trials. We developed a new scoring template by allocating scores to questionnaire parameters based on perceived importance to the conduct of clinical trials as described in the WHO/TDR Global Competency Framework for Clinical Research. Cutoff points of 75% and 50% were used to categorize sites into categories A, B, or C. RESULTS: This study identified 44 clinical trial sites in 8 Lassa fever-affected countries. Out of these, 35 sites were characterized based on their capacity to hold Lassa fever vaccine clinical trials. A total of 14 sites in 4 countries were identified as ready to host Lassa fever vaccine trials immediately or with little support. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to hold Lassa fever vaccine trials in affected countries based on the outcome of the survey. However, the findings are to be validated through sites’ visits. This experience with a standardized and objective method of the site assessment is encouraging, and the site selection method used can serve as an orientation to sponsors and researchers planning clinical trials in the region.","Salami, Kolawole; Imbault, Nathalie; Erlebach, Aljoscha; Urban, Johanna; Zoglowek, Mike; Tornieporth, Nadia G.",Pilot Feasibility Stud,37,1

As intermediate traits, protein biomarkers report on underlying disease severity and prognosis in NSTE-ACS. We hypothesized that integration of dense microRNA (miRNA) profiling with biomarker measurements would highlight potential regulatory pathways that underlie the relationships between prognostic biomarkers, miRNAs, and cardiovascular phenotypes. We performed miRNA sequencing using whole blood from 186 patients from the TRILOGY-ACS trial. Seven circulating prognostic biomarkers were measured: NH(2)-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteopontin (OPN), myeloperoxidase, growth differentiation factor 15, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and neopterin. We tested miRNAs for association with each biomarker with generalized linear models and controlled the false discovery rate at 0.05. Ten miRNAs, including known cardiac-related miRNAs 25-3p and 423-3p, were associated with NT-proBNP levels (min. P = 7.5 × 10(−4)) and 48 miRNAs, including cardiac-related miRNAs 378a-3p, 20b-5p and 320a, -b, and -d, were associated with OPN levels (min. P = 1.6 × 10(−6)). NT-proBNP and OPN were also associated with time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the sample. By integrating large-scale miRNA profiling with circulating biomarkers as intermediate traits, we identified associations of known cardiac-related and novel miRNAs with two prognostic biomarkers and identified potential genomic networks regulating these biomarkers. These results, highlighting plausible biological pathways connecting miRNAs with biomarkers and outcomes, may inform future studies seeking to delineate genomic pathways underlying NSTE-ACS outcomes.","Kwee, Lydia Coulter; Neely, Megan L.; Grass, Elizabeth; Gregory, Simon G.; Roe, Matthew T.; Ohman, E.

While early studies indicated that sumoylation takes place mainly in the nucleus, an increasing number of non-nuclear substrates have recently been identified, suggesting a wider stage for sumoylation in the cell. Unlike ubiquitylation, which primarily targets a substrate for degradation, sumoylation regulates a substrate’s functions mainly by altering the intracellular localization, protein-protein interactions or other types of post-translational modifications. These changes in turn affect gene expression, genomic and chromosomal stability and integrity, and signal transduction. Sumoylation is counter-balanced by desumoylation, and well-balanced sumoylation is essential for normal cellular behaviors. Loss of the balance has been associated with a number of diseases. This paper reviews recent progress in the study of SUMO pathways, substrates, and cellular functions and highlights important findings that have accelerated advances in this study field and link sumoylation to human diseases.","Zhao, J.",Cell Mol Life Sci,37,8

Both mouse strains were resistant to intraperitoneal infection with MHV 4 or MHVA 59 and only the A/J mice showed resistance to MHV 3, the BALB/c mice being fully susceptible to this virus infection. Comparable growth kinetics, for all three viruses, were observed in both mouse strains, except for the MHV 3 growth in BALB/c mice, where the virus titre increased to a peak on day 2, remaining high until day 4 when the mice died of acute hepatitis. The IFN gamma titres in the peritoneum of mice preceded and correlated with the virus growth, higher titres being found in MHV 3 infected BALB/c mice. The highest titre was always observed 24 to 48 h after infection. Among viral strains grown in cultured macrophages, higher titres were always observed in cultures infected with MHVA 59, followed by MHV 3 and the lowest those infected with MHV 4.

The patients were given a single dose of 2 mg nicotine from the nasal spray with and without concurrent administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor decongestant, xylometazoline, in randomised order. Control session measurements were made in the disease-free state. Applying strict bioequivalence criteria, we found that common cold/rhinitis slightly reduced the bioavailability of nicotine, both in its rate and extent; the geometric mean of the ratio of C(max), AUC and t(max) were 0.81, 0.93 and 1.36, respectively. The nasal vasoconstrictor, xylometazoline, normalised the extent of the bioavailability of nicotine, but further prolonged the time for absorption to almost twice that measured in the disease-free state, increasing the t(max) ratio to 1.72. The results suggest that a minor proportion of people stopping smoking with the help of a nicotine nasal spray may experience a minor reduction in the effect of the spray during common cold/rhinitis. However, the nicotine self-titration behaviour found with most smoking cessation products (except the nicotine patch) will automatically lead to an adjustment of the dosage to achieve the desired effect.","Lunell, E.; Molander, L.; Andersson, M.",Eur J Clin Pharmacol,37,28

This article describes the nature of the vaccines, from live attenuated agents to subunits, their efficacy and safety, and the kind of the immune responses generated by those vaccines, which are so effective. To date, all licensed vaccines generate especially specific antibodies, which attach to the infectious agent and therefore can very largely prevent infection. These vaccines have been so effective in developed countries in preventing mortality after a subsequent infection that attempts are being made to develop vaccines against many of the remaining infectious agents. Many of the latter are difficult to manipulate; they can cause persisting infections or show great antigenic variation. A range of new approaches to improve selected immune responses, such as immunization with DNA or chimeric live vectors, viral or bacterial, are under intense scrutiny, as well as genomic analysis of the agent.","Ada, Gordon",Mol Biotechnol,37,28

Bacterial infections remain the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This review is focused on the prevalence of infections in those with cirrhosis, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, pathogenesis of infection-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), current treatment recommendations, and prophylactic strategies in patients with cirrhosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiological studies have noted an emerging prevalence of MDR bacterial infections and associated with poor prognosis, and a high rate of treatment failure and mortality. Therefore, new recommendations on empirical antibiotic use based on epidemiological data have been developed in order to improve outcomes. SUMMARY: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and urinary tract infection (UTI) are the most frequent infections followed by pneumonia, cellulitis, and bacteremia, while pneumonia carries the highest risk of mortality. The incidence of MDR bacterial infections has been increasing, especially in healthcare-associated settings. Second infections that develop during hospitalization, multiple organ failures, and high MELD score are associated with poor survival. Preventive measures, early diagnosis, and adequate treatment of infections are essential key concepts in minimizing morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis.","Ekpanyapong, Sirina; Reddy, K.

Total enzyme activity was shown to be significantly, (p < .001) lower in tensor fascia latae, biceps femoris, and soleus muscle obtained from 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. Similarly, values for the active form of enzyme were significantly lower, (p < .001) in all three muscle types of 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. This age-related decline in glycogen synthase activity was not due to a reduction in the affinity of the enzyme for its activator (glucose-6-phosphate) and was independent of the concentration of substrate (UDP-glucose) in the assay system. Because similar age-related changes were seen when enzyme activity was expressed per milligram of muscle protein or per gram of muscle tissue, the fall in enzyme activity was not a simple function of an age-related decline in muscle mass. Glycogen levels also were reduced significantly in tensor fascia latae, biceps femoris, and soleus of 24-monthold rats compared with 2-month-old rats, p < .001.

The human counterpart is known as biliary glycoprotein (BGP) or CD66a. It is involved in different cellular functions ranging from intercellular adhesion, microbial receptor activity, signaling and tumor suppression. In the present study N-glyco-sylation of C-CAM immunopurified from rat liver was analyzed in detail. The primary sequence of rat C-CAM contains 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. The N-glycans were enzymatically released from glycopeptides, fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide, and separated by two-dimensional HPLC. Oligosaccharide structures were characterized by enzymatic sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS. Mainly bi- and triantennary complex structures were identified. The presence of type I and type II chains in the antennae of these glycans results in heterogeneous glycosylation of C-CAM. Sialylation of the sugars was found to be unusual; bi- and triantennary glycans contained three and four sialic acid residues, respectively, and this linkage seemed to be restricted to the type I chain in the antennae. Approximately 20% of the detected sugars contain these unusual numbers of sialic acids. C-CAM is the first transmembrane protein found to be over-sialylated.","Kannicht, Christoph; Lucka, Lothar; Nuck, Rolf; Reutter, Werner; Gohlke, Martin",Glycobiology,37,28

When Sindbis virus (SV) is injected intracerebrally into weanling mice it causes an acute non-fatal encephalitis and recovery is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody. We used a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype in brain, spleen and cervical lymph nodes over the course of the acute encephalitis. The numbers of SV-specific ASC peak early in spleen and lymph nodes and then begin to increase in brain, suggesting that initial stimulation of B cells occurs primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissue followed by B cell entry into the circulation and appearance in the brain. The pattern for each individual isotype was similar with peak numbers of SV-specific cells present in the spleen 5–7 days after infection, while numbers in the brain continue to rise through day 20 when most ASC were secreting IgG2a or IgA SV-specific antibody. The data suggest therefore that most isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An exception to this pattern is IgG1, where numbers of ASC producing IgG1 do not show a peak in spleen and continue to rise in brain through the course of acute encephalitis. The data also indicate that early in infection a large proportion of ASC in the brain are not specific for SV and demonstrate that recruitment of ASC into the CNS is non-specific. However, the percentage of ASC that are specific for SV structural proteins rises steadi throughout the course of encephalitis suggesting that retention of ASC in the CNS is specific or that some portion of the SV-specific antibody response is generated within the CNS.","Tyor, William R.; Griffin, Diane E.",J Neuroimmunol,37,8

Many, if not most, of all important zoonoses relate in some way to animals in the food production chain. Therefore, the food becomes an important vehicle for many, but not all, of these zoonotic pathogens. One of the major issues in food safety over the latest decennia has been the lack of cross-sectoral collaboration across the food production chain. Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. Examples range from BSE and E. coli outbreaks over dioxin crises to intentional melamine contamination. One Health formulates clearly both the need for and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration. In this chapter, we will focus on the human health risk related to zoonotic microorganisms present both in food animals and food from these animals, and typically transmitted to humans through food. We focus on these issues because they are very important in relation to the human disease burden, but also because this is the area where some experience of cross-sectoral collaboration already exist. Food related zoonoses can be separated in three major classes: parasites, bacteria, and viruses. While parasites often relate to very specific animal hosts and contribute significantly to the human disease burden, virus have often been related to major, well-published global outbreaks, e.g. SARS and avian- and swine-influenza. The bacterial zoonoses on the other hand often result in sporadic, but very wide-spread disease cases, resulting in a major disease burden in all countries, e.g. Salmonella and Campylobacter. Next to these traditional zoonotic problems, the use of antimicrobials in (food) animals has also caused the emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) zoonotic bacteria. It is important to realize the difference in the nature of disease epidemiology, as well as, in society’s reaction to these diseases in different socio-economic settings. Some diseases have global epidemic—or pandemic—potential, resulting in dramatic action from international organizations and national agricultural—and health authorities in most countries, for instance as was the case with avian influenza. Other diseases relate to the industrialized food production chain and have been—in some settings—dealt with efficiently through farm-to-fork preventive action in the animal sector, e.g. Salmonella. Finally, an important group of zoonotic diseases are ‘neglected diseases’ in poor settings, while they have been basically eradicated in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies in the animal sector, e.g. Brucella.","Wielinga, Peter R.; Schlundt, Jørgen",One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases,37,1

In order to establish a successful infection, replicate and persist in the host, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to counter and evade host antiviral immune responses as well as exploit them for productive viral replication. These strategies include those that target immune receptor transmembrane signaling. Uncovering the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these critical points in viral pathogenesis will not only help us understand strategies used by viruses to escape from the host immune surveillance but also reveal new therapeutic targets for antiviral as well as immunomodulatory therapy. In this chapter, based on our current understanding of transmembrane signal transduction mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) and the results of sequence analysis, we discuss the MIRR-targeting viral strategies of immune evasion and suggest their possible mechanisms that, in turn, reveal new points of antiviral intervention. We also show how two unrelated enveloped viruses, human immunodeficiency virus and human cytomegalovirus, use a similar mechanism to modulate the host immune response mediated by two functionally different MIRRs—T-cell antigen receptor and natural killer cell receptor, NKp30. This suggests that it is very likely that similar general mechanisms can be or are used by other viral and possibly nonviral pathogens.","Kim, Walter M.; Sigalov, Alexander B.",Multichain Immune Recognition Receptor Signaling,37,1

What are the regulatory mechanisms that ensure proper timing and coordination of events during the cell cycle? Biochemical and genetic screens have identified a number of cell-cycle regulators, and it was recognized early on that many of the genes encoding cell-cycle regulators, including cyclins, were transcribed only in distinct phases of the cell cycle. Thus, “just in time” expression is likely an important part of the mechanism that maintains the proper temporal order of cell cycle events. New high-throughput technologies for measuring transcript levels have revealed that a large percentage of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome (~20 %) is cell cycle regulated. Similarly, a substantial fraction of the mammalian transcriptome is cell cycle-regulated. Over the past 25 years, many studies have been undertaken to determine how gene expression is regulated during the cell cycle. In this review, we discuss contemporary models for the control of cell cycle-regulated transcription, and how this transcription program is coordinated with other cell cycle events in S. cerevisiae. In addition, we address the genomic approaches and analytical methods that enabled contemporary models of cell cycle transcription. Finally, we address current and future technologies that will aid in further understanding the role of periodic transcription during cell cycle progression.","Bristow, Sara L.; Leman, Adam R.; Haase, Steven B.",Cell Cycle Control,37,28

Diverse exposure circumstances, varied clinical presentations, unique patient-specific factors, and inconsistent diagnostic and therapeutic infrastructure support, coupled with relatively few definitive antidotes, may complicate evaluation and management. The historical approach to poisoned patients (patient arousal, toxin elimination, and toxin identification) has given way to rigorous attention to the fundamental aspects of basic life suppport — airway management, oxygenation and ventilation, circulatory competence, thermoregulation, and substrate availability. Selected patients may benefit from methods to alter toxin pharmacokinetics to minimize systemic, target organ, or tissue compartment exposure (either by decreasing absorption or increasing elimination). These may include syrup of ipecac, orogastric lavage, activated single- or multi-dose charcoal, whole bowel irrigation, endoscopy and surgery, urinary alkalinization, saline diuresis, or extracorporeal methods (hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion).

To obtain information on the receptor binding site(s) several synthetic peptides derived from Ad2 and Ad3 fiber head sequences and their antisera were tested for interference with virus attachment to HeLa and FL cells and cell adhesion to viruses. The anti-peptide sera were also evaluated in ELISA and virus neutralisation test. Ad2 (of subgroup C) and Ad3 (of subgroup B) attachment was not significantly inhibited by peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 535–554, 555–573, 562–582 of Ad2 fiber or 210–225, 267–283, 291–306 and 300–319 of Ad3 fiber. However, microplate pre-adsorbed Ad3 fiber residues 210–225 and 267–283 could bind FL and HeLa cells, and 1 mg/ml of Ad3 fiber residues 267–283 inhibited the cell adhesion to Ad3 virus to approximately 90%. This peptide may participate in the receptor binding site of Ad3 fiber. ELISA reactive anti-peptide antibodies against the homologous peptide and virus did not significantly reduce the cell adhesion to the immobilised virus or the virus attachment to cells, but in the neutralisation assay antibodies raised to Ad2 fiber residues 555–573 and 562–582 and Ad3 fiber residues 210–225 caused neutralisation of the homologous virus at serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:32, respectively. The corresponding peptides and one further peptide of Ad2 fiber and two of Ad3 fiber seem to contain neutralisation epitopes.","Liebermann, Herbert; Mentel, Renate; Döhner, Leopold; Modrow, Susanne; Seidel, Werner",Virus Res,37,11

Previously, the 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-7) was marketed in Russia in 2009 but has never been offered for mass vaccination. A carriage study was performed among children in Arkhangelsk in 2006. The objective was to determine the prevalence of carriage, serotype distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and the molecular structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains before marketing and introduction of PCV-13. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a cluster-randomized sample of children and a self-administrated questionnaire for parents/guardians. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 438 children younger than 7 years attending nurseries and kindergartens in the Arkhangelsk region, Russia. Detailed demographic data, as well as information about the child’s health, traveling, exposure to antimicrobials within the last 3 months and anthropometric measurements were collected for all study subjects. Variables extracted from the questionnaire were analysed using statistic regression models to estimate the risk of carriage. All pneumococcal isolates were examined with susceptibility testing, serotyping and multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of asymptomatic carriage was high and peaking at 36 months with a rate of 57%. PCV-13 covered 67.3% of the detected strains. High rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin, macrolides and multidrug resistance were associated with specific vaccine serotypes, pandemic clones, and local sequence types. Nine percent of isolates represented three globally disseminated disease-associated pandemic clones; penicillin- and macrolide-resistant clones Norway(NT)-42 and Poland(6B)-20, as well as penicillin- and macrolide-susceptible clone Netherlands(3)-31. A high level of antimicrobial consumption was noted by the study. According to the parent’s reports, 89.5% of the children used at least one antimicrobial regime since birth. None of the hypothesised predictors of S. pneumoniae carriage were statistically significant in univariable and multivariable logistic models. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a high coverage of the PCV-13-vaccine, but serotype replacement and expansion of globally disseminated disease-associated clones with non-vaccine serotypes may be expected. Further surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution is therefore required.","Vorobieva S. Jensen, V.; Furberg, A-S; Slotved, H-C; Bazhukova, T.; Haldorsen, B.; Caugant, D.

Based upon reconstructed phylogenies for the higher gerromorphan taxa, the hypothesis that the hygropetric zone is the ancestral one is confirmed for the Mesoveliidae, Hebridae and the clade comprising the Paraphrynoveliidae, Macroveliidae and Hydrometridae, but not for the Hermatobatidae and Veliidae. There is no support for the hypothesis that the intersection zone was a sort of transitional zone during the ecological evolution of pleustonic bugs. It is shown that the unique morphological and behavioural traits of the most derived members of this group evolved after inferred historical changes in environmental conditions and therefore qualify as adaptations in the sense ofGould and Vrba (1982),Coddington (1988) andBaum and Larson (1991). Other predictions about the adaptive evolution of gerromorphan bugs do not pass the cladistic test. The study illustrates that cladistic inference is a valuable tool in clarifying and sharpening retrospective explanations of complex evolutionary scenarios.","Andersen, Nils Møller",Cladistics,37,8

During the acute stage of neurologic disease following intracerebral inoculation, Junin antigen was detected in 100% of animals, strongly in most neurons but also to a much lesser degree in scattered astrocytes, dropping to 20% of rats at 540 days postinfection. Initially labeled in all brain areas, viral antigen gradually disappeared from hippocampus but persisted irregularly in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, Purkinje cells, pons, and medulla oblongata. Such a pattern suggests that specific neuronal subpopulations, in spite of apparently unaltered cell morphology, may persistently harbor the virus, leading on occasion to a delayed neurologic syndrome. During both the acute and chronic stages of disease, a mild inflammatory exudate was observed, characterized by the presence of T and B lymphocytes, as well as macrophages and unidentified round cells. GFAP immunostaining showed increased astrocytic reaction as infection lapsed into chronicity. Corpus callosum, hippocampus, and cerebellum exhibited the sharpest reactive astrocytosis, followed by basal ganglia, pons, and medulla oblongata, whereas in cerebral cortex it was considerably less. Astrocyte activation, which failed to correlate with viral antigen presence in neurons, seems to result from a generalized condition, possibly including diffusible brain factors triggered by viral infection. Such widespread astroglial reaction may thus contribute to the outcome of the late neurologic syndrome.","Lascano, Eduardo F.; Berría, María I.; Avila, María M.; Weissenbacher, Mercedes C.",J Med Virol,37,28

The aim of the present study was to document the incidence and clinical features of NP in patients with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on CAP patients who had been admitted to a tertiary referral centre and who had available enhanced CT scan images. Patients were allocated into NP and non‐NP groups, and they were compared with respect to various clinical variables. RESULTS: Of the 830 patients included in the present study, necrotizing change was observed in 103 patients (12%). Patients with NP experienced more symptoms of pneumonia, had higher blood levels of inflammatory markers and more often required pleural drainage compared to patients with non‐NP. Although the use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor infusion, 30‐day mortality, in‐hospital mortality and clinical deterioration did not differ between the NP and non‐NP groups, the median length of hospital stay (LOS) was significantly longer in the NP group. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards model showed that necrotizing change independently predicted LOS in patients with CAP. CONCLUSION: NP affects approximately one‐tenth of hospitalized CAP patients. It may be associated with more severe clinical manifestations and may increase the need for pleural drainage. NP was found to be an independent predictor of LOS, but not of mortality in CAP patients.","Seo, Hyewon; Cha, Seung‐Ick; Shin, Kyung‐Min; Lim, Jae‐Kwang; Yoo, Seung‐Soo; Lee, Jaehee; Lee, Shin‐Yup; Kim, Chang‐Ho; Park, Jae‐Yong; Lee, Won‐Kee",Respirology,37,28

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.","Clauw, Daniel J.",PM R,37,28

Linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis, MRSA, and VRE were further typed by multilocus sequence typing. Mutations in region V of 23S rDNA and ribosomal protein L4were investigated by PCR and sequencing analysis. The presence of the cfr gene was tested by PCR.

The most common type of infection was catheter-related (66; 46.8%), followed by primary BSI (28; 19.9%). Overall 14-day fatality was 24.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed septic shock as independent predictor of fatality, while appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment and catheter-related BSI were identified as a predictor of good prognosis. Even though most of Gram-positive cocci were multidrug-resistant, fatality rate was low, associated with catheter-related BSIs.

Its global prevalence is underscored by more serious morbidity and some mortality in the young (<5 years) and the elderly. To date, there are no licensed vaccines or approved therapeutics for HuNoV, mostly because there are limited cell culture systems and small animal models available. Recently described cell culture systems are not ideal substrates for HuNoV vaccine development because they are not clonal or only support a single strain. In this study, we show Vero cell-based replication of two pandemic GII.4 HuNoV strains and one GII.3 strain and confirm exosome-mediated HuNoV infection in Vero cells. Lastly, we show that trypsin addition to virus cultures or disruption of Vero cell host genes can modestly increase HuNoV replication.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the lack and need of general nurses and midwives in the Hradec Kralove region where the shortage is higher than the national average. The used methods are quantitative research and structured interviews, to determine the number of nurses in healthcare institutions. The study uses data obtained from publicly available sources, i.e., Czech Statistical Office (CSO) and the National Institute of Education (NIE). The shortage of nurses in the Hradec Kralove region can be expected by 2030 to be in the range between 647.6 and 667.1 nurses while maintaining the existing conditions, that is, five times more than at present. In addition to the commonly considered measures that appear in the country’s strategies—such as improving the quality of conditions during studies and during employment, specifying or adjusting the role and competency of nurses and midwives in the healthcare system, or unifying employment standards— a focus on promoting the nursing profession can be recommended. Schools and ministries should be encouraged to focus on and invest in the promotion of this profession, so as to play a key role in recruiting new students for the nursing field of study at a time when the nursing profession is perceived positively, as an embodiment of solidarity and selflessness.","Maresova, Petra; Prochazka, Miroslav; Barakovic, Sabina; Baraković Husić, Jasmina; Kuca, Kamil",Healthcare (Basel),37,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After ethics committee approval, this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed on 512 consecutive subjects, who underwent knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a total of 59 different institutions followed by arthroscopic knee surgery at our institution. The DCNN and 3 fellowship-trained full-time academic musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated the MRI examinations for full-thickness ACL tears independently. Surgical reports served as the reference standard. Statistics included diagnostic performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve (“AUC ROC”), and kappa statistics. P values less than 0.05 were considered to represent statistical significance. RESULTS: Anterior cruciate ligament tears were present in 45.7% (234/512) and absent in 54.3% (278/512) of the subjects. The DCNN had a sensitivity of 96.1%, which was not significantly different from the readers (97.5%–97.9%; all P ≥ 0.118), but significantly lower specificity of 93.1% (readers, 99.6%–100%; all P < 0.001) and “AUC ROC” of 0.935 (readers, 0.989–0.991; all P < 0.001) for the entire cohort. Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower sensitivity, specificity, and “AUC ROC” of the DCNN for outside MRI (92.5%, 87.1%, and 0.898, respectively) than in-house MRI (99.0%, 94.4%, and 0.967, respectively) examinations (P = 0.026, P = 0.043, and P < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in DCNN performance for 1.5-T and 3-T MRI examinations (all P ≥ 0.753, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Deep Convolutional Neural Network performance of ACL tear diagnosis can approach performance levels similar to fellowship-trained full-time academic musculoskeletal radiologists at 1.5 T and 3 T; however, the performance may decrease with increasing MRI examination heterogeneity.","Germann, Christoph; Marbach, Giuseppe; Civardi, Francesco; Fucentese, Sandro F.; Fritz, Jan; Sutter, Reto; Pfirrmann, Christian W.A.; Fritz, Benjamin",Invest Radiol,37,28

OBJECTIVES: To compare lung/lobe volumes on computed tomography (CT) between these two positions and evaluate the correlation between the total lung volume and total lung capacity (TLC) on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: Thirty-two asymptomatic volunteers underwent both conventional CT (supine position) and upright CT (standing position), during deep inspiration breath-hold, and PFTs on the same day. We measured lung/lobe volumes on CT in each position. Paired t tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The volumes of the total lung (10.9% increase), right lung (10.3% increase), right upper lobe (8.6% increase), right lower lobe (14.6% increase), left lung (11.6% increase), left upper lobe (7.1% increase), and left lower lobe (16.0% increase) were significantly greater in the standing position than in the supine position (all p < 0.0001). The right middle lobe volume was similar between the two positions (p = 0.16). Intraclass correlation coefficients for agreement between total lung volumes on CT in the supine/standing positions and the TLC on PFT were 0.891/0.938, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While the volumes of the bilateral upper and lower lobes and bilateral lungs were significantly greater in the standing than in the supine position, with lower lobes showing larger changes, the right middle lobe volume did not change significantly between positions. The total lung volume on upright CT in the standing position was more similar to TLC on PFT than that in the supine position.","Yamada, Yoshitake; Yamada, Minoru; Yokoyama, Yoichi; Tanabe, Akiko; Matsuoka, Shiho; Niijima, Yuki; Narita, Keiichi; Nakahara, Takehiro; Murata, Mitsuru; Fukunaga, Koichi; Chubachi, Shotaro; Jinzaki, Masahiro",Respiration,37,11

The project the age-dependent distribution of alleles or haplotypes of three P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidates, Circumsporozoite Protein (csp), Erythrocyte Binding Antigen 175 (eba-175) and Serine Repeat Antigen 5 (sera5) in a region of intense malaria transmission in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and November 2009 in which 250 study participants were selected from a population of 600. Finger prick blood samples were collected after informed consent from participants below 5 years, 5–10 years, and above 10 years of age. Blood was used for microscopy, RDT and dried blood spots. Plasmodium falciparum DNA was extracted by chelex method. Alleles of sera5 and eba-175 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by resolution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Allele calling was done using gel photographs from ethiduim bromide stained gels. Haplotypes of csp were identified by sequencing 63 PCR products using the P. falciparum 7G8 laboratory strain sequence as a reference. The data were analysed using SPSS 16, EQX for windows and Chi-square test was used to calculate associations (P-values), Excel was used to generate graphs. The BioEdit and NCBI blast software programs were used to analyse the sequences from which csp haplotypes map was constructed. RESULTS: Eba-175 FCR3 (48/178) and CAMP (16/178) alleles were observed, the FCR3 (24/67) allele being predominant among children aged below 5 years old while the CAMP (12/67) allele was predominant among older participants. Sera5 alleles ORI (6/204) and ORII (103/204) were observed in the population, ORII was more prevalent and was significantly associated with age (P values < 0.0001), parasite density (P-value < 0.0001) and clinical outcomes (P value = 0.018). There was marked csp diversity in the Th2/Th3 region. Out of 63 sequences, 16 conformed to the reference strain and one (1/16) was similar to a West African haplotype and the majority (14/16) of the haplotypes were unique to this study region. There was an age-dependent distribution of csp haplotypes with more haplotypes being harbored by children < 5-year of age, (10/16) compared to adults (2/16). Interestingly, the csp haplotype corresponding to 3D7 whose prototypical sequence is identical to the sequence of the leading malaria vaccine candidate RTS, S was not observed. CONCLUSION: This data suggest that the eba-175 FCR3 allele, sera5 ORII allele, and csp haplotypes are targets of host immunity and under immune selection pressure in Apac District. These molecules could provide alternative malaria vaccine candidates as sub-unit vaccines.","Agwang, Constance; Erume, Joseph; Okech, Brenda; Olobo, Joseph; Egwang, Thomas G.",Malar J,37,28

Two Zika virus (ZIKV) structural proteins, the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) protein are N-glycosylated. The prM protein of all ZIKV strains contains a single N-linked glycosylation site, while not all strains contain an N-linked site in the E protein. Our aim was to examine the impact of prM and E N-linked glycosylation on ZIKV infectivity and cell trafficking. Using a ZIKV infectious clone, we found that when the N-glycan sites were removed, the prM- and the prM/E-double mutants did not produce an infectious virus in the supernatant. Further, by using ZIKV prME constructs, we found that N-glycosylation was necessary for effective secretion of ZIKV virions. The absence of the N-glycan on prM or E caused protein aggregation in the rough endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) compartment. The aggregation was more pronounced for the prM-mutation, and the mutant virus lost the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) localization. In addition, lack of the N-glycan on prM induced nuclear translocation of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), an ER stress marker. To conclude, we show that the prM N-glycan is essential for the ZIKV infectious cycle, and plays an important role in viral protein trafficking, protein folding, and virion assembly.","Gwon, Yong-Dae; Zusinaite, Eva; Merits, Andres; Överby, Anna K.; Evander, Magnus",Viruses,37,1

The metabolic changes are not the same in all cancers. Some features, however, are considered hallmarks of this disease. As an example, all cancer cells rewire the amino acid metabolism for fulfilling both the energy demand and the changed signaling routes. In these altered conditions, some amino acids are more frequently used than others. In any case, the prerequisite for amino acid utilization is the presence of specific transporters in the cell membrane that can guarantee the absorption and the traffic of amino acids among tissues. Tumor cells preferentially use some of these transporters for satisfying their needs. The evidence for this phenomenon is the over-expression of selected transporters, associated with specific cancer types. The knowledge of the link between the over-expression and the metabolic rewiring is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism of reprogramming in cancer cells. The continuous growth of information on structure–function relationships and the regulation of transporters will open novel perspectives in the fight against human cancers.","Scalise, Mariafrancesca; Console, Lara; Rovella, Filomena; Galluccio, Michele; Pochini, Lorena; Indiveri, Cesare",Cells,37,28

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and reliability of smartwatch to obtain 3-lead ECG recordings, the classical Einthoven ECG leads I-III compared to standard ECG. To record lead I, the watch was worn on the left wrist and the right index finger was placed on the digital crown for 30 s. For lead II, the watch was placed on the lower abdomen and the right index finger was placed on the digital crown for 30 s. For lead III, the same process was repeated with the left index finger. Spearman correlation and Bland-Altman tests were used for data analysis. A total of 300 smartwatch ECG tracings were successfully obtained. ECG waves’ characteristics of all three leads obtained from the smartwatch had a similar duration, amplitude, and polarity compared to standard ECG. The results of this study suggested that the examined smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 4) could obtain 3-lead ECG tracings, including Einthoven leads I, II, and III by placing the smartwatch on the described positions.","Behzadi, Amirali; Sepehri Shamloo, Alireza; Mouratis, Konstantinos; Hindricks, Gerhard; Arya, Arash; Bollmann, Andreas",Sensors (Basel),37,8

As neurological examination is often unreliable in sedated patients, additional neuromonitoring is needed. However, the value of electroencephalogram (EEG) in adult ECMO patients has not been well assessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of electroencephalographic abnormalities in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and their association with 3-month neurologic outcome. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing venous–venous (V–V) or venous–arterial (V–A) ECMO with a concomitant EEG recording (April 2009–December 2018), either recorded intermittently or continuously. EEG background was classified into four categories: mild/moderate encephalopathy (i.e., mostly defined by the presence of reactivity), severe encephalopathy (mostly defined by the absence of reactivity), burst-suppression (BS) and suppressed background. Epileptiform activity (i.e., ictal EEG pattern, sporadic epileptiform discharges or periodic discharges) and asymmetry were also reported. EEG findings were analyzed according to unfavorable neurological outcome (UO, defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale < 4) at 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: A total of 139 patients (54 [41–62] years; 60 (43%) male gender) out of 596 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Veno–arterial (V–A) ECMO was used in 98 (71%); UO occurred in 99 (71%) patients. Continuous EEG was performed in 113 (81%) patients. The analysis of EEG background showed that 29 (21%) patients had severe encephalopathy, 4 (3%) had BS and 19 (14%) a suppressed background. In addition, 11 (8%) of patients had seizures or status epilepticus, 10 (7%) had generalized periodic discharges or lateralized periodic discharges, and 27 (19%) had asymmetry on EEG. In the multivariate analysis, the occurrence of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage (OR 4.57 [1.25–16.74]; p = 0.02) and a suppressed background (OR 10.08 [1.24–82.20]; p = 0.03) were independently associated with UO. After an adjustment for covariates, an increasing probability for UO was observed with more severe EEG background categories. CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients treated with ECMO, EEG can identify patients with a high likelihood of poor outcome. In particular, suppressed background was independently associated with unfavorable neurological outcome.","Peluso, Lorenzo; Rechichi, Serena; Franchi, Federico; Pozzebon, Selene; Scolletta, Sabino; Brasseur, Alexandre; Legros, Benjamin; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Creteur, Jacques; Gaspard, Nicolas; Taccone, Fabio Silvio",Crit Care,37,1

The conformational freedom of a peptide can be constrained by intramolecular cross-links. Conformational constraints enhance the receptor specificity, may lead to biased activity and confer proteolytic resistance to peptidic GPCR agonists. Chemical synthesis allows to introduce a variety of cross-links into a peptide and is suitable for bulk production of relatively simple lead peptides. Lanthionines are thioether bridged alanines of which the two alanines can be introduced at different distances in chosen positions in a peptide. Thioether bridges are much more stable than disulfide bridges. Biosynthesis of lanthionine-constrained peptides exploiting engineered Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria that contain lanthionine-introducing enzymes constitutes a convenient method for discovery of lanthionine-stabilized GPCR agonists. The presence of an N-terminal leader peptide enables dehydratases to dehydrate serines and threonines in the peptide of interest after which a cyclase can couple the formed dehydroamino acids to cysteines forming (methyl)lanthionines. The leader peptide also guides the export of the formed lanthionine-containing precursor peptide out of Gram-positive bacteria via a lanthipeptide transporter. An engineered cleavage site in the C-terminus of the leader peptide allows to cleave off the leader peptide yielding the modified peptide of interest. Lanthipeptide GPCR agonists are an emerging class of therapeutics of which a few examples have demonstrated high efficacy in animal models of a variety of diseases. One lanthipeptide GPCR agonist has successfully passed clinical Phase Ia.","Moll, Gert N.; Kuipers, Anneke; Rink, Rick; Bosma, Tjibbe; de Vries, Louwe; Namsolleck, Pawel",Biochem Soc Trans,37,28

Considering the anti-inflammatory effects of turmeric, we formulated a nano-emulsion of turmeric infused in edible sesame oil, with a globule size of 200–250 nm using high-energy microfluidization. The product with a zeta potential of −11.5 mV showed spherical globules when imaged for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We explored the anti-inflammatory potential of this edible nano-emulsion in lung inflammation. The lungs are the internal organ most vulnerable to infection, injury, and rapid inflammation from the external environment because of their constant exposure to pollutants, pathogenic microorganisms, and viruses. We evaluated the nano-emulsion for efficacy in ovalbumin-induced lung injury in mice with an oral treatment for two weeks. The therapeutic effect of nano-emulsion of the sesame oil-extract of turmeric was evident from biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung histopathology, and flow cytometric analysis. The developed nano-emulsion significantly reduced the inflammation and damage to the alveolar network in ovalbumin-injured mice. Significant reduction in the levels of neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was observed in the nano-emulsion-treated group. Leukotriene B4 and IgE were also significantly altered in the treated group, thus suggesting the suitability of the formulation for the treatment of allergy and other inflammatory conditions. The nano-emulsification process potentiated the immunoregulatory effect of turmeric, as observed from the elevated levels of the natural anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. The dietary constituents-based nano-emulsion of spice turmeric helped in scavenging the free radicals in the injured lungs, thus modulating the inflammation pathway. This easily scalable formulation technology approach can therefore serve as a potential noninvasive and safe treatment modality for reducing lung inflammation in lung injury cases.","Rasool, Sahibzada Tasleem; Alavala, Rajasekhar Reddy; Kulandaivelu, Umasankar; Sreeharsha, Nagaraja",Pharmaceutics,37,28

Most NYC pneumonia and influenza deaths are attributed to pneumonia caused by infection acquired in the community, and these deaths typically occur in hospitals. METHODS: We identified hospitalizations of New York State residents aged ≥20 years discharged from New York State hospitals during 2010–2014 with a principal diagnosis of community-setting pneumonia or a secondary diagnosis of community-setting pneumonia if the principal diagnosis was respiratory failure or sepsis. We examined mean annual age-adjusted community-setting pneumonia-associated hospitalization (CSPAH) rates and proportion of CSPAH with in-hospital death, overall and by sociodemographic group, and produced a multivariable negative binomial model to assess hospitalization rate ratios. RESULTS: Compared with non-NYC urban, suburban, and rural areas of New York State, NYC had the highest mean annual age-adjusted CSPAH rate at 475.3 per 100,000 population and the highest percentage of CSPAH with in-hospital death at 13.7%.

The aim of this study was to assess PAP therapy adherence in Arab (Saudi) patients with OHS and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >30/h. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of consecutive adult patients diagnosed with OHS between March 2010 and September 2019 was conducted. During the therapeutic sleep study, all OHS patients were started on continuous PAP (CPAP). Patients who failed to maintain oxygen saturation ≥88% despite the elimination of obstructive respiratory events were shifted to bi-level PAP (BPAP). Objective assessment of adherence was performed at 1, 6, and 12 months after initiating PAP therapy. We adopted the American-Thoracic-Society criteria for PAP adherence. RESULTS: The study included 101 patients (women = 65 patients) with OHS, an AHI ≥30/h, and a mean age of 54.9 ± 12.7 years. Successful titration on CPAP was achieved in 64.4% of the patients and BPAP was required for 35.6% of the patients who failed CPAP titration.

The treatment and control of hypertension calls for long-term management beyond hospital, which is hard to implement in traditional care settings. Integrated care combined with information technology can promote high-quality healthcare services across the life-course. However, few studies have applied a customized integrated care model in community-based hypertension management in China, catering to the emerging “three-manager” mode. This study aims to identify the effectiveness of a pathway-driven eHealth-based integrated model that implemented as a full-featured telehealth system to facilitate standardized management of hypertension in China. METHODS: The trial has been designed as a 1-year, non-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups. A total of 402 hypertensive patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized with a 1:1 allocation. All the participants will receive a mobile device for self-management, which is a part of our telehealth system. Participants in the control group will only use the device for BP measurement and receive regular follow-ups from care providers according to the guidelines. Participants in the intervention group will gain full access to the system and receive intervention based on the proposed model (a well-designed coordinated care pathway consisting of 9 tasks). Outcomes will be measured mainly on three occasions (at inclusion, at 6 months, and at 12 months). The primary outcome is mean change in systolic blood pressure over a 12-month period. Secondary outcomes include changes in diastolic blood pressure, biochemical indexes related to hypertension, lifestyles, self-management adherence, and hypertension awareness, as well as work efficiency of care providers. DISCUSSION: This study aims to investigate whether a pathway-driven eHealth-based integrated care model based on the “three-manager” mode will improve hypertension control in China.

Prehospital rotations might however also help senior residents acquire specific skills and knowledge. To assess the perceived added value of the prehospital rotation in comparison with other rotations, we analyzed web-based questionnaires sent between September 2011 and August 2020 to senior residents who had just completed a prehospital rotation. The primary outcome was the perceived benefit of the prehospital rotation in comparison with other rotations regarding technical and non-technical skills. Secondary outcomes included resident satisfaction regarding the prehospital rotation and regarding supervision. A pre-specified subgroup analysis was performed to search for differences according to the participants’ service of origin (anesthesiology, emergency medicine, or internal medicine). The completion rate was of 71.5% (113/158), and 91 surveys were analyzed.

The majority of evidence relates to pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalised with seasonal influenza. METHODS: This national, prospective, observational cohort study used the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) to identify all pregnant women admitted to hospital between 01/11/2016 and 31/10/2018 with laboratory confirmed influenza at any gestation and up to two days after giving birth. These were compared to women admitted to give birth that did not have influenza. Baseline characteristics, immunization status, maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared. RESULTS: There were 405 women admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed influenza in pregnancy: 2.7 per 10,000 maternities. Compared to 694 comparison women, women with influenza were less likely to be professionally employed (aOR 0.59, 95%CI 0.39–0.89) or immunised in the relevant season (aOR 0·59, 0·39–0·89) and more likely to have asthma (aOR 2.42, 1.30–4.49) or have had a previous pregnancy complication (aOR 2·47, 1·33–4·61). They were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 21.3, 2.78–163.1) and to have a cesarean birth (aOR 1·42, 1·02–1.98). Their babies were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (aOR 1.86, 1·01–3·42). CONCLUSIONS: Immunization reduces the risk of hospitalisation with influenza in pregnancy which is associated with increased risk of morbidity for both the mother and baby. There is a continued need to increase awareness of safety and effectiveness of immunization in pregnancy and provision within antenatal care settings, especially for high-risk groups.","Vousden, Nicola; Bunch, Kathryn; Knight, Marian",PLoS One,37,28

Health apps have benefits for individuals (eg, the ability to monitor one’s health) as well as for researchers (eg, the ability to collect data in population-based, clinical, and observational studies). Although the number of health apps on the global app market is huge and the associated potential seems to be great, app-based questionnaires for collecting patient-related data have not played an important role in epidemiological studies so far. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of studies that have collected patient data using an app-based approach, with a particular focus on longitudinal studies. This literature review describes the current extent to which smartphones have been used for collecting (patient) data for research purposes, and the potential benefits and challenges associated with this approach. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies that used data collection via apps. PubMed was used to identify studies describing the use of smartphone app questionnaires for collecting data over time. Overall, 17 articles were included in the summary. RESULTS: Based on the results of this scoping review, there are only a few studies that integrate smartphone apps into data-collection approaches. Studies dealing with the collection of health-related data via smartphone apps have mainly been developed with regard to psychosomatic, neurodegenerative, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as malign neoplasm. Among the identified studies, the duration of data collection ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, and the participants’ mean ages ranged from 7 to 69 years. Potential can be seen for real-time information transfer, fast data synchronization (which saves time and increases effectivity), and the possibility of tracking responses longitudinally. Furthermore, smartphone-based data-collection techniques might prevent biases, such as reminder bias or mistakes occurring during manual data transfers. In chronic diseases, real-time communication with physicians and early detection of symptoms enables rapid modifications in disease management. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that using mobile technologies can help to overcome challenges linked with data collection in epidemiological research. However, further feasibility studies need to be conducted in the near future to test the applicability and acceptance of these mobile apps for epidemiological research in various subpopulations.","Fischer, Florian; Kleen, Sina",J Med Internet Res,37,11

The current therapeutical strategies are not able to definitively resolve the underlying causes and stop the symptoms. Polyphenols are promising natural molecules that are receiving increasing attention for their activity/effects in counteracting the main pathologic mechanisms of dry eye disease and reducing its symptoms. In the present review, a deep literature search focusing on the main polyphenols tested against dry eye disease was conducted, analyzing related in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies to provide a comprehensive and current review on the state of the art. Polyphenols present multiple effects against dry eye diseases-related ocular surface injury. In particular, the observed beneficial effects of polyphenols on corneal cells are the reduction of the pathological processes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis and modulation of the tear film. Due to numerous studies reporting that polyphenols are effective and safe for treating the pathological mechanisms of this ocular surface disease, we believe that future studies should confirm and extend the evidence of polyphenols efficacy in clinical practice against dry eye disease and help to develop new ophthalmic drug(s).","Favero, Gaia; Moretti, Enrico; Krajčíková, Kristína; Tomečková, Vladimíra; Rezzani, Rita",Antioxidants (Basel),37,11

This novel vaccine strategy may prime a patient’s immune system against their tumor and work synergistically with immunotherapy against advanced-stage melanoma. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial of the tumor lysate, particle-loaded, dendritic cell (TLPLDC) vaccine administered to prevent recurrence in patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma. Patients were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to the TLPLDC vaccine or placebo (empty yeast cell wall particles and autologous dendritic cells). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per treatment (PT) analyses were predefined, with PT analysis including patients who remained disease-free through the primary vaccine/placebo series (6 months). RESULTS: A total of 144 patients were randomized (103 vaccine, 41 control). Therapy was well-tolerated with similar toxicity between treatment arms; one patient in each group experienced related serious adverse events. While disease-free survival (DFS) was not different between groups in ITT analysis, in PT analysis the vaccine group showed improved 24-month DFS (62.9% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: This phase IIb trial of TLPLDC vaccine administered to patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma shows TLPLDC is well-tolerated and improves DFS in patients who complete the primary vaccine series. This suggests patients who do not recur early benefit from TLPLDC in preventing future recurrence from melanoma.

This paper assesses the contribution of the CARD policy to rice production and forecasts the local rice supply and demand to provide a better understanding of the policies needed to attain rice self-sufficiency by 2030. A combination of the autoregressive integrated moving average method and counterfactual approach was adopted using rice statistical data from 23 countries in SSA. The results showed that the contribution of CARD to paddy rice production in 2018 was 10.2 million tons, equivalent to 74% of the target. This contribution resulted from increases in area and yield of 23% and 19%, respectively. However, the yield growth rate was not sustainable in almost two-thirds of countries. Investments in supply-push factors such as fertilizer and irrigation development, which were the focus in the past, have limited effects on rice production. We conclude that sustainable investments in demand-pull factors such as the private-led modern milling sector and contract farming development should be prioritized to achieve rice self-sufficiency in SSA.","Arouna, Aminou; Fatognon, Irene Akoko; Saito, Kazuki; Futakuchi, Koichi",World Dev Perspect,37,1

Here we describe in detail a methodology for the identification and quantification of multiple sterols including oxysterols and sterol-acids found in these fluids. The method is translatable to any laboratory with access to liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry. The method exploits isotope-dilution mass spectrometry for absolute quantification of target metabolites. The method is applicable for semi-quantification of other sterols for which isotope labelled surrogates are not available and approximate quantification of partially identified sterols. Values are reported for non-esterified sterols in the absence of saponification and total sterols following saponification. In this way absolute quantification data is reported for 17 sterols in the NIST SRM 1950 plasma along with semi-quantitative data for 8 additional sterols and approximate quantification for one further sterol. In a pooled (CSF) sample used for internal quality control, absolute quantification was performed on 10 sterols, semi-quantification on 9 sterols and approximate quantification on a further three partially identified sterols. The value of the method is illustrated by confirming the sterol phenotype of a patient suffering from ACOX2 deficiency, a rare disorder of bile acid biosynthesis, and in a plasma sample from a patient suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, where cholesterol 27-hydroxylase is deficient.","Yutuc, Eylan; Dickson, Alison L.; Pacciarini, Manuela; Griffiths, Lauren; Baker, Paul R.S.; Connell, Lisa; Öhman, Anders; Forsgren, Lars; Trupp, Miles; Vilarinho, Sílvia; Khalil, Youssef; Clayton, Peter T.; Sari, Sinan; Dalgic, Buket; Höflinger, Philip; Schöls, Ludger; Griffiths, William J.; Wang, Yuqin",Anal Chim Acta,37,1

Students role-play four different scenarios with simulated patients (SPs) and receive feedback from the patient’s perspective. The scenarios are video-recorded and uploaded onto the University’s virtual learning environment. Students can watch and annotate their own videos and give others access to view them. Project description: Although the course is well liked by students, we identified three areas for improvement: lack of faculty feedback; ; little active use of the video-recordings; lack of opportunity for students to discuss their experiences with each other. We aimed to address these shortcomings by introducing an additional learning task: students are asked to annotate a section of the video in which they had performed well, and one in which they thought they could have done better, in both their own and a colleague’s videos. These video clips and annotations served as the basis of a subsequent two-hour small-group seminar with a physician tutor. The course was evaluated by a mandatory online questionnaire. Results: All 247 students completed the questionnaire. The annotation tool and task were deemed to be comprehensible. Students believed they had learnt more from annotating a peers’ video than from their own and most thought being assessed by peers was acceptable. The physician tutors’ comments were largely deemed as helpful. The mean mark for the course given by students was 4.6 (median 5) (1=very poor, 6=very good). Conclusion: A communication skills course expanded by video-annotations and group discussions with a physician tutor was shown to be feasible and was well received by students and faculty.","Pless, Anina; Hari, Roman; Brem, Beate; Woermamm, Ulrich; Schnabel, Kai P.",GMS J Med Educ,37,1

Historically, epidermal-innervating sensory neurons were thought to be the exclusive detectors and transmitters of environmental stimuli. However, recent work from our lab (Moehring et al., 2018) and others (Baumbauer et al., 2015) has demonstrated that keratinocytes are also critical for normal mechanotransduction and mechanically-evoked behavioral responses in mice. Here, we asked whether keratinocyte activity is also required for normal cold and heat sensation. Using calcium imaging, we determined that keratinocyte cold activity is conserved across mammalian species and requires the release of intracellular calcium through one or more unknown cold-sensitive proteins. Both epidermal cell optogenetic inhibition and interruption of ATP-P2X4 signaling reduced reflexive behavioral responses to cold and heat stimuli. Based on these data and our previous findings, keratinocyte purinergic signaling is a modality-conserved amplification system that is required for normal somatosensation in vivo.","Sadler, Katelyn E; Moehring, Francie; Stucky, Cheryl L",,37,1

A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user’s estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals—considered to be a major limitation of similar methods—can be eliminated by an efficient, “peak-to-peak” iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist. It can be used independently or as a fast way to obtain better starting conditions for computationally expensive methods, such as iterated filtering and generalized profiling.","Jagan, Mikael; deJonge, Michelle S.; Krylova, Olga; Earn, David J.

SCL was widely distributed in Japan, South Korea, and China, which was traditionally considered heat-clearing, detoxicating, and dampness-eliminating medicine. Systems pharmacology revealed that 32 compounds in SCL may interact with 19 targets for immunoenhancement, antiapoptosis, anti-inflammation, and antioxidant activity of the PID model. Molecular docking revealed that isorhamnetin, moracin M, rutin, and oxyresveratrol may have higher binding potential with prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), siderocalin (LCN2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP9), respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the binding modes of moracin M-MAPK1, rutin-TNF, and oxyresveratrol-MMP9 complexes were more stable, evidenced by relatively smaller fluctuations in root mean square deviation values. Conclusively, SCL may treat PID by inhibiting inflammatory factors, antitissue fibrosis, and microbial growth.","Zhang, Yunsen; Zhao, Zikuang; Chen, Huimin; Fu, Yutong; Wang, Wenxiang; Li, Qi; Li, Xuanhao; Wang, Xiaobo; Fan, Gang; Zhang, Yi",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,37,11

In the present narrative review, we investigated the potential role of vitamin D in the etiology of temporomandibular disorders in order todetermine whether the current knowledge supports 25-hidroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) supplementation in temporomandibular disorders associated with insufficient or deficient levels of vitamin D. Methods. A literature research was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases, and a total of 10 articles were included for analysis. Results.Among the observational studies published to date, investigating the role for vitamin D in the etiology of TMDs, six of them suggest that there is a connection between the two aspects. In this context, patients suffering from TMD, with deficient levels of vitamin D (<30 ng/mL), are most likely to benefit from supplementation, whereas individuals with vitamin D level >50ng/mL probably have little benefit from supplementation.Conclusion.Vitamin D might be a safe, simple, and potentially beneficial way to prevent TMDs or to reduce pain; however, more randomized and placebo-controlled trials are required before any firm conclusions can be drawn.","Kui, Andreea; Buduru, Smaranda; Labunet, Anca; Balhuc, Silvia; Negucioiu, Marius",Nutrients,37,1

A few studies suggest that increased concentration of pro-inflammatory biomarkers may be related to olfactory deficits, but these associations are understudied in population-based samples. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and olfactory identification level as well as rate of change in aging. METHODS: We included 1,721 participants (mean age 70.5 years; 61.9% female) with at least two olfactory assessments across the 12-year follow-up. Baseline level and change in odor identification were estimated with linear mixed models as a function of CRP levels, derived from blood plasma at baseline. RESULTS: Results indicated a negative dose–response association between CRP level and odor identification scores at baseline, after adjustment for demographic, cognitive, health, and lifestyle factors. CRP levels ranging between 11 and 20 mg/L were significantly related to lower olfactory ability (β = −0.811, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−1.503 to −0.118]; p = .022). Likewise, CRP values above 20 mg/L were related to lower olfactory scores, an association that approached statistical significance (β = −0.996, 95% CI [−2.045 to 0.054]; p = .063). We found no associations between CRP and olfactory change (ps > .368). Sensitivity analyses showed that associations between CRP and olfaction were confined to younger participants (age ≤72 years) and men (ps < .034).

Reactive air surfaces (beds, mattresses or overlays) can be used for preventing pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of reactive air beds, mattresses or overlays compared with any support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to reactive air beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses that were applied for preventing pressure ulcers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. If a reactive air surface was compared with surfaces that were not clearly specified, then we recorded and described the concerned study but did not included it in further data analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 studies (2604 participants) in this review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 83 participants). The average participant age ranged from 56 to 87 years (median: 72 years). Participants were recruited from a wide range of care settings with the majority being acute care settings. Almost all studies were conducted in the regions of Europe and America. Of the 17 included studies, two (223 participants) compared reactive air surfaces with surfaces that were not well described and therefore could not be classified. We analysed data for five comparisons: reactive air surfaces compared with (1) alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (seven studies with 1728 participants), (2) foam surfaces (four studies with 229 participants), (3) reactive water surfaces (one study with 37 participants), (4) reactive gel surfaces (one study with 66 participants), and (5) another type of reactive air surface (two studies with 223 participants). Of the 17 studies, seven (41.2%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcome: Pressure ulcer incidence Reactive air surfaces may reduce the proportion of participants developing a new pressure ulcer compared with foam surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.96; I(2) = 25%; 4 studies, 229 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if there is a difference in the proportions of participants developing a new pressure ulcer on reactive air surfaces compared with: alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (6 studies, 1648 participants); reactive water surfaces (1 study, 37 participants); reactive gel surfaces (1 study, 66 participants), or another type of reactive air surface (2 studies, 223 participants). Evidence for all these comparisons is of very low certainty. Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer incidence for two comparisons. When time to pressure ulcer incidence is considered using a hazard ratio (HR), low‐certainty evidence suggests that in the nursing home setting, people on reactive air surfaces may be less likely to develop a new pressure ulcer over 14 days' of follow‐up than people on alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.96; 1 study, 308 participants). It is uncertain if there is a difference in the hazard of developing new pressure ulcers between two types of reactive air surfaces (1 study, 123 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes Support‐surface‐associated patient comfort: the included studies have data on this outcome for three comparisons. We could not pool any data as comfort outcome measures differed between included studies; therefore a narrative summary is provided. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient comfort responses between reactive air surfaces and foam surfaces over the top of an alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants), and between those using reactive air surfaces and those using alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (4 studies, 1364 participants). Evidence for these two comparisons is of very low certainty. It is also uncertain if there is a difference in patient comfort responses between two types of reactive air surfaces (1 study, 84 participants; low‐certainty evidence). All reported adverse events: there were data on this outcome for one comparison: it is uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events between reactive air surfaces and foam surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The included studies have no data for health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness for all five comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is uncertain regarding any differences in the relative effects of reactive air surfaces on ulcer incidence and patient comfort, when compared with reactive water surfaces, reactive gel surfaces, or another type of reactive air surface. Using reactive air surfaces may reduce the risk of developing new pressure ulcers compared with using foam surfaces. Also, using reactive air surfaces may reduce the risk of developing new pressure ulcers within 14 days compared with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in people in a nursing home setting. Future research in this area should consider evaluation of the most important support surfaces from the perspective of decision‐makers. Time‐to‐event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Trials should be designed to minimise the risk of detection bias; for example, by using digital photography and adjudicators of the photographs being blinded to group allocation. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.","Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; Leung, Vannessa; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,37,28

Published guidelines to limit technical variability whilst maintaining important biological variation favour DNA-based microarrays that often differ fundamentally in their experimental design. Rigorous tools to guide background correction, the quantification of within-sample variation, normalisation, and batch correction specifically for protein microarrays are limited, require extensive investigation and are not centrally accessible. Here, we develop a generic one-stop-shop pre-processing suite for protein microarrays that is compatible with data from the major protein microarray scanners. Our graphical and tabular interfaces facilitate a detailed inspection of data and are coupled with supporting guidelines that enable users to select the most appropriate algorithms to systematically address bias arising in customized experiments. The localization and distribution of background signal intensities determine the optimal correction strategy. A novel function overcomes the limitations in the interpretation of the coefficient of variation when signal intensities are at the lower end of the detection threshold. We demonstrate essential considerations in the experimental design and their impact on a range of algorithms for normalization and minimization of batch effects. Our user-friendly interactive web-based platform eliminates the need for prowess in programming. The open-source R interface includes illustrative examples, generates an auditable record, enables reproducibility, and can incorporate additional custom scripts through its online repository. This versatility will enhance its broad uptake in the infectious disease and vaccine development community.","Mwai, Kennedy; Kibinge, Nelson; Tuju, James; Kamuyu, Gathoni; Kimathi, Rinter; Mburu, James; Chepsat, Emily; Nyamako, Lydia; Chege, Timothy; Nkumama, Irene; Kinyanjui, Samson; Musenge, Eustasius; Osier, Faith",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,37,28

DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative assessment comprising 32 in-depth interviews (16 in Kenema district and 16 in Western Area). All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis to identify themes. SETTING: Participants were selected from urban and rural communities in two districts that experienced varying levels of Ebola cases during the outbreak. All interviews were conducted in August 2017 in the post-Ebola-outbreak context in Sierra Leone when the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation was continuing to mandate reporting of all deaths. PARTICIPANTS: Family members of deceased persons whose deaths were not reported to the 1-1-7 system. RESULTS: Death reporting barriers were driven by the lack of awareness to report all deaths, lack of services linked to reporting, negative experiences from the Ebola outbreak including prohibition of traditional burial rituals, perception that inevitable deaths do not need to be reported and situations where prompt burials may be needed. Facilitators of future willingness to report deaths were largely influenced by the perceived communicability and severity of the disease, unexplained circumstances of the death that need investigation and the potential to leverage existing death notification practices through local leaders. CONCLUSIONS: Social mobilisation and risk communication efforts are needed to help the public understand the importance and benefits of sustained and ongoing death reporting after an Ebola outbreak. Localised practices for informal death notification through community leaders could be integrated into the formal reporting system to capture community-based deaths that may otherwise be missed.","Jalloh, Mohamed F; Kinsman, John; Conteh, James; Kaiser, Reinhard; Jambai, Amara; Ekström, Anna Mia; Bunnell, Rebecca E; Nordenstedt, Helena",BMJ Open,37,1

Delivering perpetrator interventions concurrently with substance use treatment shows promise. METHODS: The feasibility of conducting an efficacy and cost-effectiveness trial of the ADVANCE 16-week intervention to reduce IPA by men in substance use treatment was explored. A multicentre, parallel group individually randomised controlled feasibility trial and formative evaluation was conducted. Over three temporal cycles, 104 men who had perpetrated IPA towards a female (ex) partner in the past year were randomly allocated to receive the ADVANCE intervention + substance use treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 54) or TAU only (n = 50) and assessed 16-weeks post-randomisation. Participants’ (ex) partners were offered support and 27 provided outcome data. Thirty-one staff and 12 men who attended the intervention participated in focus groups or interviews that were analysed using the framework approach. Pre-specified criteria assessed the feasibility of progression to a definitive trial: 1) ≥ 60% of eligible male participants recruited; 2) intervention acceptable to staff and male participants; 3) ≥ 70% of participants followed-up and 4) levels of substance use and 5) IPA perpetrated by men in the intervention arm did not increase from average baseline level at 16-weeks post-randomisation. RESULTS: 70.7% (104/147) of eligible men were recruited. The formative evaluation confirmed the intervention’s acceptability. Therapeutic alliance and session satisfaction were rated highly. The overall median rate of intervention session attendance (of 14 compulsory sessions) was 28.6% (range 14.3–64.3% by the third cycle). 49.0% (51/104) of men and 63.0% (17/27) of their (ex) partners were followed-up 16-weeks post-randomisation. This increased to 100% of men and women by cycle three. At follow-up, neither substance use nor IPA perpetration had worsened for men in the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to deliver the ADVANCE intervention in substance use treatment services, although it proved difficult to collect data from female (ex)partners. While some progression criteria were met, others were not, although improvements were demonstrated by the third cycle.

Sera exhibited low-level neutralizing antibodies (NAb) post PIV priming, yet moderate to high in vitro ADE activity. Following LAV administration, the PIV primed groups exhibited DENV-2 LAV peak viremias up to 1,176-fold higher than the mock primed group, and peak viremia correlated with in vitro ADE. Furthermore, PIV primed groups had more balanced and higher DENV-1–4 NAb seroconversion and titers than the mock primed group following LAV administration.

Informal providers (IPs) who practise allopathic medicine are part of India's pluralistic health system legacy. They outnumber formal providers but operate in a policy environment of unclear legitimacy, creating unique challenges for antibiotic stewardship. Using a systems approach we analysed the multiple intrinsic (provider specific) and extrinsic (community, health and regulatory system and pharmaceutical industry) drivers of antibiotic provision by IPs in rural West Bengal, to inform the design of community stewardship interventions. We surveyed 291 IPs in randomly selected village clusters in two contrasting districts and conducted in-depth interviews with 30 IPs and 17 key informants including pharmaceutical sales representatives, managers and wholesalers/retailers; medically qualified private and public doctors and health and regulatory officials. Eight focus group discussions were conducted with community members. We found a mosaic or bricolage of informal practices conducted by IPs, qualified doctors and industry stakeholders that sustained private enterprise and supplemented the weak public health sector. IPs' intrinsic drivers included misconceptions about the therapeutic necessity of antibiotics, and direct and indirect economic benefits, though antibiotics were not the most profitable category of drug sales. Private doctors were a key source of IPs' learning, often in exchange for referrals. IPs constituted a substantial market for local and global pharmaceutical companies that adopted aggressive business strategies to exploit less-saturated rural markets. Paradoxically, the top-down nature of regulations produced a regulatory impasse wherein regulators were reluctant to enforce heavy sanctions for illegal sales, fearing an adverse impact on rural healthcare, but could not implement enabling strategies to improve antibiotic provision due to legal barriers. We discuss the implications for a multi-stakeholder antibiotic stewardship strategy in this setting.","Gautham, Meenakshi; Spicer, Neil; Chatterjee, Soumyadip; Goodman, Catherine",Soc Sci Med,37,1

Firstly, the obtained empirical data make it possible to estimate the prevalence of compensative and compulsive buying among the general population of Poles aged 15 years old and over, with the sample split into users and non-users of the e-commerce market offer. Secondly, the conducted analysis shows to what extent the prevalence of compulsive and compensative buying is differentiated by the frequency of online shopping, by the extent of the expenditures on online shopping compared with offline shopping, by attitudes towards online shopping, and by sociodemographic conditions (gender, age, monthly net income of household). The findings come from a survey conducted in 2019 based on a nationwide statistically representative sample of 1,000 Poles aged 15 years old and over. Drawing on this survey based on the German Compulsive Buying Indicator (GCBI), the prevalence of compulsive buying is observed at about 3% and compensative buying at about 12%. Dividing the general population into online and offline shoppers, one can see serious differences between both target groups; the share of compulsive and compensative buyers in the segment of online shoppers amounts to 3.6% and 16.9%, while among non-online shoppers– 3.3% and 10.1%. The strongest susceptibility to compulsive buying is characteristic of female online shoppers having very positive attitudes towards online shopping and doing online shopping very frequently.","Adamczyk, Grzegorz",PLoS One,37,1

Water activities and seafood consumption have been emphasized as the major exposure pathways to coastal water pollution. In contrast, relatively little is known about the potential for airborne exposure to pollutants and pathogens from contaminated seawater. The Cross Surfzone/Inner-shelf Dye Exchange (CSIDE) study was a large-scale experiment designed to investigate the transport pathways of water pollution along the coast by releasing dye into the surfzone in Imperial Beach, CA. Additionally, we leveraged this ocean-focused study to investigate potential airborne transmission of coastal water pollution by collecting complementary air samples along the coast and inland. Aerial measurements tracked sea surface dye concentrations along 5+ km of coast at 2 m × 2 m resolution. Dye was detected in the air over land for the first 2 days during two of the three dye releases, as far as 668 m inland and 720 m downwind of the ocean. These coordinated water/air measurements, comparing dye concentrations in the air and upwind source waters, provide insights into the factors that lead to the water-to-air transfer of pollutants. These findings show that coastal water pollution can reach people through an airborne pathway and this needs to be taken into account when assessing the full impact of coastal ocean pollution on public health. This study sets the stage for further studies to determine the details and importance of airborne exposure to sewage-based pathogens and toxins in order to fully assess the impact of coastal pollution on public health.","Pendergraft, Matthew A.; Grimes, Derek J.; Giddings, Sarah N.; Feddersen, Falk; Beall, Charlotte M.; Lee, Christopher; Santander, Mitchell V.; Prather, Kimberly A.",PeerJ,37,1

However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML‐driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML‐powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current state‐of‐the‐art of AI/ML‐guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood–brain barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions to these difficulties.","Vatansever, Sezen; Schlessinger, Avner; Wacker, Daniel; Kaniskan, H.

Concerns that the existing algorithm favors programs over students, recent findings that the program’s ranking of applicants is not associated with resident performance, and disruptions of existing screening methods and metrics have prompted reevaluation of the current algorithm relative to a student-centric algorithm, in which student ranking of programs is primary and program ranking of students is secondary. OBJECTIVE: To compare program-centric and student-centric algorithms for the NRMP participants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used randomized computer-generated data reflecting the NRMP match for 2018, 2019, and 2020, capturing more than 50 000 students and more than 4000 programs in 23 specialties, to compare the 2 algorithms. EXPOSURES: The same simulated students, programs, and rankings were exposed to the 2 algorithms, running 2300 simulations in the overall analysis and 1000 simulations in each of 23 specialties. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The percentage of students who did and did not match, the percentage of students who matched to their top-ranked and top-5–ranked programs, and the program’s rank of the last student matched per position were examined. RESULTS: The 2 algorithms were not different in percentage of students matched overall (eg, for 2020, program-centric: 59% [95% CI, 57%-61%]; student-centric: 58% [95% CI, 56%-60%]; P = .73). The student-centric algorithm, relative to the program-centric algorithm, matched a significantly higher percentage of students to their first-ranked program (eg, for 2020, 50% [95% CI, 48%-52%] vs 14% [95% CI, 13%-15%]; P < .001) and to their top-5–ranked programs (eg, for 2020, 60% [95% CI, 58%-62%] vs 46% [95% CI, 44%-48%]; P < .001). However, the last position was filled with students who had lower program rankings in the student-centric algorithm vs the program-centric algorithm (2 [95% CI, 1-2] vs 8 [95% CI, 6-10]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the 2 algorithms were not different in the percentage of students matched overall. However, the student-centric algorithm matched a significantly higher percentage of students to their preferred programs. The program-centric algorithm was associated with a lower program’s last matched student rank. Further research is needed on the algorithms’ associations with cost and time demands in the match, postmatch resident and program performance, and fit with a changing environment.","Mascarenhas, Briance; Puranam, Kartikeya S.; Katehakis, Michael N.",JAMA Netw Open,37,1

Insufficient knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance, the fear of complications from infections, and how providers perceive antibiotic use and resistance are likely to influence prescribing behavior. This study's objective was to identify the knowledge and belief healthcare professionals' differences about antibiotic stewardship. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study of three hospitals in the East Java province, Indonesia utilized a 43-item questionnaire to assess antimicrobial stewardship knowledge and belief. There were 12 knowledge questions (total possible score: 12) and 31 belief questions (total possible score: 155). The Kuder Richardson 20 (KR-20) and Cronbach alpha values of the questionnaire were 0.54 and 0.92, respectively. RESULTS: Out of the 257 respondents, 19% (48/257) had a low scores of knowledge, and 39% (101/257) had low scores on belief about antibiotic stewardship (101/257).

Plasma therapy (PE) is the recommended approach to treat both acute episodes and prevent recurrences in aHUS, but studies have yet to show PE efficacy in aHUS associated with a CD46 mutation. The factors determining failure to treatment are not clear and may be related to the mutation involved or to insufficient treatment. Our experience of PE in a family of three sisters with CFH-associated aHUS suggests that intensive and prophylactic PE allows renal function to be maintained in both native kidneys and allografts. The success of this strategy has led us to use it in all cases of aHUS. Here, we describe the effect of this strategy in a child with aHUS and a CD46 mutation. The initial episode was treated with daily PE, resulting in the recovery of renal function. However, over the next 4 years, there was a progressive decline in renal function to end-stage renal failure, with evidence of an on-going thrombotic microangiopathy despite continuous prophylactic PE. Prophylactic PE does not influence the natural course of aHUS and CD46 mutation.","Davin, Jean-Claude; Buter, Nynke; Groothoff, Jaap; van Wijk, Joanna; Bouts, Antonia; Strain, Lisa; Goodship, Tim",Pediatr Nephrol,37,11

Characteristics were similar among early empirically treated patients and those treated after TB screening. 50% of early empirical TB treatment was based on radiological investigations, 22% on cerebrospinal or pleural fluid testing, and 28% on clinical features alone. Only 11 of 100 empirically treated patients had subsequent microbiological confirmation. In-hospital mortality was lower in patients with microbiologically confirmed TB compared to those treated empirically (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.5 [95% confidence interval, .3–.9). CONCLUSIONS: Empirical TB treatment remains common in severely ill HIV-positive inpatients. These patients may benefit from TB screening using existing rapid diagnostics, both to improve confirmation of TB disease and reduce overtreatment for TB.","Bresges, Carolin; Wilson, Douglas; Fielding, Katherine; Corbett, Elizabeth L; Del-Greco, Fabrizia; Grint, Daniel; Peters, Jurgens; Gupta-Wright, Ankur",Open Forum Infect Dis,37,8

The aim of this study was to determine the most common mechanisms of injury (MOI), injury patterns, and associated injuries in patients who undergo surgery for chest wall trauma. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of trauma patients with multiple rib fractures and unstable thoracic cage injuries who were managed surgically at Sahlgrenska University Hospital during the period September 2010–September 2017. The MOI, injury severity score (ISS), new injury severity score (NISS), thoracic and associated injuries were recorded. Patients were categorized according to age (years): groups I (15‒44), II (45‒64) and III ( > 64). Unstable thoracic cage injuries were classified as sternal, anterior, lateral and posterior flail chest. RESULTS: Two hundred and eleven trauma patients with a mean age (years) of 58.2 ± 15.6, mean ISS 23.6 ± 11.0, and mean NISS 34.1 ± 10.6 were included in the study. Traffic accidents were the most common MOI in Group I (62%) and falls in Group III (59%). The most common flail segments were lateral and posterior. Sternal and anterior flail segments were more common with bilateral injuries and traffic accidents, particularly frontal collisions. Injuries in at least three body regions were also more associated with traffic accidents. Diaphragmatic injury was seen in 18% of patients who underwent thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS: The MOI associated with multiple rib fractures differs according to the age of the patient and is associated with different chest wall injury patterns and extra-thoracic injuries.","Caragounis, Eva-Corina; Xiao, Yao; Granhed, Hans",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,37,11

Furthermore, gender biases may result in differing expectations and perceptions of female and male physicians and may be associated with patient rapport and trust building. OBJECTIVE: To characterize public perceptions of casual physician attire and implicit gender biases in public assessment of physicians’ professional attire. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used a population-based survey administered via Amazon Mechanical Turk from May to June 2020 among individuals aged 18 years or older who were US residents and for whom English was the primary language. INTERVENTION: Survey featuring photographs of a male or female model wearing various types of physician attire (white coat, business attire, and scrubs). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Respondents’ ratings of professionalism, experience, and friendliness of the male and female models in various attire and perceptions of the models’ most likely health care profession. Preference scores for various outfits were calculated as the difference between the preference score for an outfit and the mean preference score for the outfit-role pairing. RESULTS: Of 522 surveys completed, 487 were included for analysis; the mean (SD) age of respondents was 36.2 (12.4) years, 260 (53.4%) were female, and 372 (76.4%) were White individuals. Respondents perceived models of health care professionals wearing white coats vs those wearing fleece or softshell jackets as significantly more experienced (mean [SD] experience score: white coat, 4.9 [1.5]; fleece, 3.1 [1.5]; softshell, 3.1 [1.5]; P < .001) and professional (mean [SD] professionalism score: white coat, 4.9 [1.6]; fleece, 3.2 [1.5]; softshell, 3.3 [1.5]; P < .001). A white coat with scrubs attire was most preferred for surgeons (mean [SD] preference index: 1.3 [2.3]), whereas a white coat with business attire was preferred for family physicians and dermatologists (mean [SD] preference indexes, 1.6 [2.3] and 1.2 [2.3], respectively; P < .001). Regardless of outerwear, female models in business attire as inner wear were rated as less professional than male counterparts (mean [SD] professionalism score: male, 65.8 [25.4]; female, 56.2 [20.2]; P < .001). Both the male and the female model were identified by the greater number of respondents as a physician or surgeon; however, the female model vs the male model was mistaken by more respondents as a medical technician (39 [8.0] vs 16 [3.3%]; P < .005), physician assistant (56 [11.5%] vs 11 [2.3%]; P < .001), or nurse (161 [33.1%] vs 133 [27.3%]; P = .050). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study, survey respondents rated physicians wearing casual attire as less professional and experienced than those wearing a white coat. Gender biases were found in impressions of professionalism, with female physicians’ roles being more frequently misidentified. Understanding disparate public perceptions of physician apparel may inform interventions to address professional role confusion and cumulative career disadvantages for women in medicine.","Xun, Helen; Chen, Jonlin; Sun, Alexander H.; Jenny, Hillary E.; Liang, Fan; Steinberg, Jordan P.",JAMA Netw Open,37,1

However, the biggest challenge for transdermal delivery is that only a limited number of potent drugs with ideal physicochemical properties can passively diffuse and intercellularly permeate through skin barriers and achieve therapeutic concentration by this route. Significant efforts have been made toward the development of approaches to enhance transdermal permeation of the drugs. Among them, microneedles represent one of the microscale physical enhancement methods that greatly expand the spectrum of drugs for transdermal and intradermal delivery. Microneedles typically measure 0.1–1 mm in length. In this review, microneedle materials, fabrication routes, characterization techniques, and applications for transdermal delivery are discussed. A variety of materials such as silicon, stainless steel, and polymers have been used to fabricate solid, coated, hollow, or dissolvable microneedles. Their implications for transdermal drug delivery have been discussed extensively. However, there remain challenges with sustained delivery, efficacy, cost-effective fabrication, and large-scale manufacturing. This review discusses different modes of characterization and the gaps in manufacturing technologies associated with microneedles. This review also discusses their potential impact on drug delivery, vaccine delivery, disease diagnostic, and cosmetics applications.","Aldawood, Faisal Khaled; Andar, Abhay; Desai, Salil",Polymers (Basel),37,1

SSA can obtain good results in solving some optimization problems. However, it is easy to suffer from local minima and lower density of population. SMA specializes in global exploration and good robustness, but its convergence rate is too slow to find satisfactory solutions efficiently. Thus, in this paper, considering the characteristics and advantages of both the above optimization algorithms, SMA is integrated into the leader position updating equations of SSA, which can share helpful information so that the proposed algorithm can utilize these two algorithms' advantages to enhance global optimization performance. Furthermore, Levy flight is utilized to enhance the exploration ability. It is worth noting that a novel strategy called mutation opposition-based learning is proposed to enhance the performance of the hybrid optimization algorithm on premature convergence avoidance, balance between exploration and exploitation phases, and finding satisfactory global optimum. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, HSMSSA is applied to 23 different benchmark functions of the unimodal and multimodal types. Additionally, five classical constrained engineering problems are utilized to evaluate the proposed technique's practicable abilities. The simulation results show that the HSMSSA method is more competitive and presents more engineering effectiveness for real-world constrained problems than SMA, SSA, and other comparative algorithms. In the end, we also provide some potential areas for future studies such as feature selection and multilevel threshold image segmentation.","Wang, Shuang; Liu, Qingxin; Liu, Yuxiang; Jia, Heming; Abualigah, Laith; Zheng, Rong; Wu, Di",Comput Intell Neurosci,37,1

At present, it is impossible to predict patients with COPD with frequent acute exacerbation phenotypes. The composition of the lower respiratory tract flora and the intestinal flora is closely related to AECOPD, but the specific association mechanism between them is not very clear. This study used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology to explore the microbial characteristics of the intestinal tract and airways of patients with COPD, and analyse the correlation between the sequencing results and inflammatory factors, immune factors and nutritional factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a prospective cohort study. We intend to recruit 152 patients with stable COPD. In the baseline, we will detect the participants’ induced sputum and faecal flora through mNGS, and changes in blood immune levels, and the patient’s condition is evaluated. Every 2 months, we will check the number of acute exacerbation through the phone range. After 12 months, we will check again the changes in the blood immune level, evaluate the patient’s condition and count the number of episodes.

To explore possible consequences of asymptomatic infections, particularly in the context of elimination of transmission—a goal set to be achieved by 2030—we propose a novel dynamic transmission model to account for the asymptomatic population. This extends an established framework, basing infection progression on a number of experimental and observation gHAT studies. Asymptomatic gHAT infections include those in people with blood-dwelling trypanosomes, but no discernible symptoms, or those with parasites only detectable in skin. Given current protocols, asymptomatic infection with blood parasites may be diagnosed and treated, based on observable parasitaemia, in contrast to many other diseases for which treatment (and/or diagnosis) may be based on symptomatic infection. We construct a model in which exposed people can either progress to either asymptomatic skin-only parasite infection, which would not be diagnosed through active screening algorithms, or blood-parasite infection, which is likely to be diagnosed if tested. We add extra parameters to the baseline model including different self-cure, recovery, transmission and detection rates for skin-only or blood infections. Performing sensitivity analysis suggests all the new parameters introduced in the asymptomatic model can impact the infection dynamics substantially. Among them, the proportion of exposures resulting in initial skin or blood infection appears the most influential parameter. For some plausible parameterisations, an initial fall in infection prevalence due to interventions could subsequently stagnate even under continued screening due to the formation of a new, lower endemic equilibrium. Excluding this scenario, our results still highlight the possibility for asymptomatic infection to slow down progress towards elimination of transmission. Location-specific model fitting will be needed to determine if and where this could pose a threat.","Aliee, Maryam; Keeling, Matt J.; Rock, Kat S.",PLoS Comput Biol,37,28

Neurofilament proteins (NfPs) are well suited as biomarkers in these contexts because they are major neuron-specific components that maintain structural integrity and are sensitive to neurodegeneration and neuronal injury across a wide range of neurologic diseases. Low levels of NfPs are constantly released from neurons into the extracellular space and ultimately reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood under physiological conditions throughout normal brain development, maturation, and aging. NfP levels in CSF and blood rise above normal in response to neuronal injury and neurodegeneration independently of cause. NfPs in CSF measured by lumbar puncture are about 40-fold more concentrated than in blood in healthy individuals. New ultra-sensitive methods now allow minimally invasive measurement of these low levels of NfPs in serum or plasma to track disease onset and progression in neurological disorders or nervous system injury and assess responses to therapeutic interventions. Any of the five Nf subunits – neurofilament light chain (NfL), neurofilament medium chain (NfM), neurofilament heavy chain (NfH), alpha-internexin (INA) and peripherin (PRPH) may be altered in a given neuropathological condition. In familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), plasma NfL levels may rise as early as 22 years before clinical onset in familial AD and 10 years before sporadic AD. The major determinants of elevated levels of NfPs and degradation fragments in CSF and blood are the magnitude of damaged or degenerating axons of fiber tracks, the affected axon caliber sizes and the rate of release of NfP and fragments at different stages of a given neurological disease or condition directly or indirectly affecting central nervous system (CNS) and/or peripheral nervous system (PNS). NfPs are rapidly emerging as transformative blood biomarkers in neurology providing novel insights into a wide range of neurological diseases and advancing clinical trials. Here we summarize the current understanding of intracellular NfP physiology, pathophysiology and extracellular kinetics of NfPs in biofluids and review the value and limitations of NfPs and degradation fragments as biomarkers of neurodegeneration and neuronal injury.","Yuan, Aidong; Nixon, Ralph A.",Front Neurosci,37,28

Therefore, the need for alternative solutions is crucial. Thus, short peptide vaccine candidates promise effective answers under such circumstances. Short peptide vaccine candidates are linear T-cell epitopes (antigenic determinants that are recognized by the immune system) that specifically function by binding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles of different ethnicities (including Black, Caucasian, Oriental, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Australian aboriginal, and mixed ethnicities). The population-specific allele-level HLA sequence data in the public IMGT/HLA database contains approximately 12542 nomenclature defined class I (9437) and class II (3105) HLA alleles as of March 2015 present in several ethnic populations. The bottleneck in short peptide vaccine design and development is HLA polymorphism on the one hand and viral diversity on the other hand. Hence, a crucial step in its design and development is HLA allele-specific binding of short antigen peptides. This is usually combinatorial and computationally labor intensive. Mathematical models utilizing structure-defined pockets are currently available for class I and class II HLA-peptide-binding peptides. Frameworks have been developed to design protocols to identify the most feasible short peptide cocktails as vaccine candidates with superantigen properties among known HLA supertypes. This approach is a promising solution to develop new viral vaccines given the current advancement in T-cell immuno-informatics, yet challenging in terms of prediction efficiency and protocol development.","Kangueane, Pandjassarame; Sowmya, Gopichandran; Anupriya, Sadhasivam; Dangeti, Sandeep Raja; Mathura, Venkatrajan S.; Sakharkar, Meena K.",Global Virology I - Identifying and Investigating Viral Diseases,37,33

There are four CEACAM1 isoforms, with either four or two ectodomains, resulting from an alternative splicing mechanism. CEACAM1 is expressed on the epithelium and in endothelial cells of a variety of tissues and hemopoietic cells, and functions as a homophilic and heterophilic adhesion molecule. It is used as a receptor for some bacteria as well. The N terminal domain participates in mediating homophilic adhesion. This domain is also responsible for binding to the MHV spike (S) protein; the CC’ face protruding in this domain interacts with an N terminal region of the S protein composed of 330 amino acids (called S1N330). The binding of CEACAM1 with MHV S protein induces S protein conformational changes and converts fusion-negative S protein to a fusion-positive form. The allelic forms of CEACAM1 found among mouse strains are thought to be an important determinant for mouse susceptibility to MHV.","Taguchi, Fumihiro",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,37,8

It has been theorized that effective vaccines can be developed using the minimum essential subset of T cell and B cell epitopes that comprise the ‘immunome.’ Researchers are therefore using bioinformatics sequence analysis tools, epitope-mapping tools, microarrays, and high-throughput immunology assays to discover the minimal essential components of the immunome. When these minimal components, or epitopes, are packaged with adjuvants in an appropriate delivery vehicle, the complete package comprises an epitope-based immunome-derived vaccine. Such vaccines may have a significant advantage over conventional vaccines, as the careful selection of the components may diminish undesired side effects such as have been observed with whole pathogen and protein subunit vaccines. This chapter will review the pre-clinical and anticipated clinical development of computer-driven vaccine design and the validation of epitope-based immunome-derived vaccines in animal models; it will also include an overview of heterologous immunity and other emerging issues that will need to be addressed by vaccines of all types in the future.","De Groot, Anne S.; Moise, Leonard; McMurry, Julie A.; Martin, William",Clinical Applications of Immunomics,37,1

This is associated with increased risk of acquiring fungal opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients which account for high morbidity and mortality rates, if left untreated. The conventional antifungal drugs to treat fungal diseases (mycoses) are increasingly becoming inadequate due to observed varied susceptibility of fungi and their recurrent resistance. RNA interference (RNAi), sequence-specific gene silencing, is emerging as a promising new therapeutic approach. This chapter discusses various aspects of RNAi, viz., the fundamental RNAi machinery present in fungi, in silico siRNA features, designing guidelines and tools, siRNA delivery, and validation of gene knockdown for therapeutics against mycoses. Target gene identification is a crucial step in designing of gene-specific siRNA in addition to efficient delivery strategies to bring about effective inhibition of fungi. Subsequently, designed siRNA can be delivered effectively in vitro either by soaking fungi with siRNA or by transforming inverted repeat transgene containing plasmid into fungi, which ultimately generates siRNA(s). Finally, fungal inhibition can be verified at the RNA and protein levels by blotting techniques, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical assays. Despite challenges, several such in vitro studies have spawned optimism around RNAi as a revolutionary new class of therapeutics against mycoses. But, pharmacokinetic parameters need to be evaluated from in vivo studies and clinical trials to recognize RNAi as a novel treatment approach for mycoses.","Jain, Chakresh Kumar; Wadhwa, Gulshan",Current trends in Bioinformatics: An Insight,37,1

As we have begun to unravel the complex underlying immunologic and inflammatory pathophysiology of the disease, new therapeutic strategies as well as specific molecular and cellular constituents have emerged as potential targets for clinical intervention. These efforts also have shed light on the mechanisms by which current antiallergy medications act—or sometimes fail to be effective.7, 31, 51, 89 The similar pathophysiologic basis for allergic rhinitis and the often comorbid condition, asthma, was underscored in the recently published American Thoracic Society Workshop Summary on the Immunobiology of Asthma and Rhinitis: Pathogenic Factors and Therapeutic Options.(18) In his conclusion, workshop chair, Thomas Casale,(18) counsels readers to consider that “…allergic asthma and rhinitis represent a systemic disease affecting two organs, the lung and the nose. Asthma and allergic rhinitis share many of the same pathogenic factors, but they operate in different parts of the airway. Inflammatory cells and mediators are often the same, and there may be common alterations that occur in the immune system.” Thus, therapeutic strategies and potential therapeutic agents found to be beneficial in the treatment of one airway target may show similar effects in the other. For this reason, and because many of the therapies now being developed are at early stages in their evolution, physicians interested in rhinitis therapy also must examine what is known about these agents in asthma. One avenue of active research has been the role of leukotrienes and other mediators in the pathophysiology of asthma and rhinitis. Three leukotriene modifiers now have been approved for the treatment of asthma in the United States; their potential use in the treatment of rhinitis has been a focus of considerable speculation and investigation. An early “day in the park” study showed that with antileukotriene therapy, patients with rhinitis had demonstrable improvements in their rhinitic symptoms.(29) Roquet et al(83) reported that in the treatment of asthma, there was a synergistic effect when an antileukotriene agent and an antihistamine were used, compared with either drug alone. A product combining an antileukotriene with an antihistamine is currently under development. The most exciting developments, however, may be in the immunology arena. As described by Baraniuk elsewhere in this issue, the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis is highly complex. Multiple interacting, interdependent, and redundant pathways and molecular and cellular constituents are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. Briefly, exposure of the nasal mucosa to allergen in a sensitized individual leads to the release and further production of inflammatory mediators and the release of cytokines.(5) These released cytokines activate endothelial cells, thereby inducing expression of adhesion receptors on the cell surface and initiating a cascade of events that facilitates transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells. T lymphocytes also are activated by these cytokines. Within a given tissue, specific patterns of cytokines are released, dependent on the dominant subset of local T lymphocytes. These, in turn, lead to the preferential activation and recruitment of specific inflammatory cells and the characteristic cellular inflammation observed in allergic rhinitis.","Agosti, Jan M.; Sanes-Miller, Carol H.",Immunol Allergy Clin North Am,37,1

The aim of this exploratory study was to determine if the factor, Culture influences women’s IT career choices in South Africa. An on-line survey was conducted amongst women IT professionals in South Africa to determine the factors that influenced their IT career choices. The data from the survey were analysed using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The results, specifically relating to the factor Culture, are reported in this paper. The findings indicate that the factor Culture plays an important role when women make IT career choices as well as when females decide to remain in an IT career. The study found that culture does play a significant role in IT career decisions for different ethnic groups in South Africa.

However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these “exit strategies” entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures. Methods: We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database. Results: We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe. Conclusions: We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.","Leclerc, Quentin J.; Fuller, Naomi M.; Knight, Lisa E.; Funk, Sebastian; Knight, Gwenan M.",Wellcome Open Res,37,1

Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by high-permeability pulmonary edema in addition to refractory hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. In this study, we examined whether VEGF can be implicated as a pulmonary vascular permeability factor in sepsis-associated ALI. We found that a great increase in lung vascular leak occurred in mice instilled intranasally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as assessed by IgM levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Treatment with the VEGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody bevacizumab significantly reduced this hyperpermeability response, suggesting active participation of VEGF in non-cardiogenic lung edema associated with LPS-induced ALI. However, this was not solely attributable to excessive levels of intrapulmonary VEGF. Expression levels of VEGF were significantly reduced in lung tissues from mice with both intranasal LPS administration and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, which may stem from decreases in non-endothelial cells-dependent VEGF production in the lungs. In support of this assumption, stimulation with LPS and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) significantly increased VEGF in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, a significant rise in plasma VEGF levels was observed in CLP-induced septic mice. The increase in VEGF released from HPMECs after LPS/IFN-γ challenge was completely blocked by either specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) subgroups. Taken together, our results indicate that VEGF can contribute to the development of non-cardiogenic lung edema in sepsis-associated ALI due to increased VEGF secretion from pulmonary vascular endothelial cells through multiple MAPK-dependent pathways.","Tomita, Kengo; Saito, Yuna; Suzuki, Tokiko; Imbaby, Samar; Hattori, Kohshi; Matsuda, Naoyuki; Hattori, Yuichi",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,37,1

METHODS: Patients with acute TBF requiring early decompression were prospectively collected. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to TXA and control group, in which wound surface was soaked with TXA or the same volume of normal saline for 5 min after wound incision, respectively. The total blood loss (TBL), intraoperative blood loss (IBL), postoperative blood loss (PBL), hemoglobin (HGB) levels on preoperatively (pre-op) and postoperatively, and amount of allogenic blood transfusion were recorded. Furthermore, the general information was also compared between groups. RESULTS: There were 39 and 37 patients enrolled in TXA and control group for final analysis. The demographics data showed no significant difference between groups (P > 0.05), but operation time and IBL were significantly decreased in TXA group (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that HGB level was significantly higher in the TXA group at POD1, while the TBL and PBL were significantly less than those in the control group (P < 0.05), but similar to HBL (P > 0.05). The postoperative ambulation time, removal time of drainage tube, length of hospital stay, and blood transfusion rate were also significantly less in TXA group (P < 0.05). At the final follow-up, no neurological deteriorations and no TXA-related complications were observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: This RCT first demonstrated that topical TXA usage after wound incision could effectively reduce IBL without increasing risk of complications, beneficial to enhanced recovery after early operation for TBF.

Weight management problems (being obese or overweight) are among the problems that produce infertility, both in women seeking spontaneous pregnancy and in those undergoing assisted reproduction techniques. Over the last few decades, the prevalence of obesity has increased alarmingly in our society and is now considered one of the most important public health problems. The combination of diet and exercise to achieve weight loss are currently considered an effective intervention for the improvement of reproductive parameters in overweight or obese infertile women. In other population groups, it has been shown that Internet-based interventions are just as effective as traditional ones, and these cover a larger population with a good cost–benefit ratio. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies so far have analysed any specific online interventions for this group of infertile women. Thus, the objective of this project will be to evaluate the effectiveness of an online program to promote a healthy lifestyle among women who are overweight or obese who also have a diagnosis of infertility and are on the waiting list for in vitro fertilisation treatment. Methods: This will be a randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in 94 women which will compare a self-administered Internet-based intervention promoting a healthy lifestyle in terms of diet and exercise (n = 47) to a control group that will receive standard medical care. The online program will comprise nine modules, will last for 3 months, and will be monitored every 3 months after the intervention until the final follow-up at 12 months. The main outcome will be the spontaneous pregnancy rate. Secondary outcomes will include changes in body composition, dietary and physical exercise habits, glycaemic profiles, lipid profiles, hormonal profiles, and patient quality of life related to their fertility problems. The data analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. Discussion: The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge of the effectiveness of online interventions specifically adapted to infertile women who are overweight or obese in the promotion of healthy lifestyles.","Biviá-Roig, Gemma; Blasco-Sanz, Ruth; Boldó-Roda, Ana; Vara, M.

Herein, a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was employed to load chlorin e6 (Ce6) to serve as a potential in situ DC vaccine (NLC/Ce6) for effective immunotherapy of gastric cancer. Taking advantage of the photodynamic effect of Ce6 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under laser irradiation, the NLC/Ce6 was able to trigger cell death and expose tumor-associated antigen (TAA). Moreover, mimicking the natural inflammatory response, the ROS can also recruit the DC for the effective processing/presentation of the in situ exposed TAA.

RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-nine people completed an online questionnaire which included the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Psychological distress was found among 35% of the study sample. Western and northern regions reported higher rates of distress. In addition, higher rates were found among younger and unmarried individuals. Distress was significantly positively correlated with perceptions of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, and the fear to lose a job as a result of the pandemic and the related precautions. CONCLUSION: Psychological support programs should be provided targeting high-risk groups of younger and unmarried population.

Despite the increasing accuracy achieved so far, it still remains under-explored how the decisions made by such systems may be influenced by the inherent characteristics of the individual under consideration. In this paper, we investigate how state-of-the-art speaker verification models are susceptible to unfairness towards legally-protected classes of individuals, characterized by a common sensitive attribute (i.e., gender, age, language). To this end, we first arranged a voice dataset, with the aim of including and identifying various demographic classes. Then, we conducted a performance analysis at different levels, from equal error rates to verification score distributions. Experiments show that individuals belonging to certain demographic groups systematically experience higher error rates, highlighting the need of fairer speaker recognition models and, by extension, of proper evaluation frameworks.","Fenu, Gianni; Lafhouli, Hicham; Marras, Mirko",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,37,7

We aimed to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Bangladeshi nurses, as well as the relationship between occupational factors and mental health symptoms. We conducted a cross-sectional study among registered nurses in Bangladesh. We used the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to assess mental health symptoms. RESULTS: Among the 547 nurses included in the study, the prevalence of mild to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress was 50.5%, 51.8%, and 41.7% respectively, and 61.9% of the respondents reported mild to severe psychological impact for COVID-19. Psychological symptoms were more prevalent among female nurses than male nurses (p <0.05). Linear regression revealed that having complete personal protective equipment (PPE) during working was significantly associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress (p <0.05). Facing any emotional abuse working in the COVID-19 pandemic situation was significantly associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress and greater psychological impact of the outbreak (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of mental health symptoms was observed in nurses. We recommend the implementation of mental well-being interventions and ensuring a proper work environment for nurses during the pandemic.","Chowdhury, Saifur Rahman; Sunna, Tachlima Chowdhury; Das, Dipak Chandra; Kabir, Humayun; Hossain, Ahmed; Mahmud, Sabbir; Ahmed, Shakil",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,37,18

INTRODUCTION: Centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs have been forced to close due to the need for physical and social distancing imposed by COVID-19 pandemic. A major problem emerges concerning the potential harmful effects resulting from the suspension of the centre-based CR programs, leading to physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyle routines. Therefore, the development of alternative delivery models to maintain access to CR programs and to avoid physical inactivity should be organized and tested. PURPOSE: To assess the physical activity (PA) levels in a group of patients with known cardiovascular disease (CVD), after completing 3-months of a home-based multidisciplinary digital CR program, organized as an alternative method to the centre-based CR suspended program. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with CVD (62.6 ± 8.9 years, 95 males) who were previously attending a face-to-face CR program were included and the following parameters were assessed at baseline and 3 months: self-reported PA and sedentary behaviour, adherence to the online CR program, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular symptoms, feelings towards the pandemic, dietary habits, risk factor control, safety and adverse events. The intervention consisted in a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including online exercise training sessions, online educational sessions, psychological online group sessions, risk factor control, nutritional and psychological consults and patient regular assessment by cardiologist and nurse. RESULTS: Ninety-eight CVD patients successfully completed all the online assessments (15.5% drop-out). It was observed a significant increase from moderate-to-vigorous PA (230 ± 198 mins/week to 393 ± 378 mins/week, p < 0.001) and a decrease of the sedentary time at 3-months (6.47 ± 3.26 hours/day to 5.17 ± 3.18 hours/day, p < 0.001). Seventy percent of the patients met the PA recommendations and 41% reached more than 300 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous PA at 3 months. Almost half of the participants (46.9%) did at least more than one online exercise training session per week and attended at least one of the online educational sessions. There were no major adverse events reported and only one minor non-cardiovascular event occurred. CONCLUSION: Patients with CVD, who suspended centre-based CR due to COVID-19 pandemic and started a home-based multidisciplinary digital CR program, had a significant improvement in moderate to vigorous PA after 3 months. Therefore, home-based CR programs showed to be a good option for selected clinically stable patients, who are eligible for CR and cannot attend a centre-based CR program due to COVID-19 pandemic or eventually other reasons.","Pinto, R; Lemos Pires, M; Borges, M; Linan Pinto, M; Sousa Guerreiro, C; Miguel, S; Santos, O; Ramalhinho, M; Fiuza, S; Cordeiro Ferreira, M; Ricardo, I; Cunha, N; Alves Da Silva, P; Pinto, FJ; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,37,1

These accounts have generally highlighted Modi’s public overtures toward Israel, including an unprecedented 2017 visit, as public signs of a break with India’s traditional pro-Arab and pro-Palestine approach. Others have interpreted Modi’s successive visits to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, and Oman as indicators of a new outreach to all relevant actors in the region. However, has this diplomatic balancing among regional stakeholders signalled a substantial foreign policy change? Can this apparent policy shift be attributed to the personal preferences of Modi? Or Can India’s fluctuating Middle-East policy be explained by a wider number of fluid international and regional opportunities and constraints? Alternatively, can factors such as ideological and religious politics at the national and regional levels also help account for changes (or the absence thereof) in India’s Middle-East policy? Building on foreign policy scholarship, this paper offers to derive theoretical understandings and expectations about Modi’s role in (re)shaping this regional policy in order to problematizes the conventional understanding of Modi’s engagement with the Middle East as a sign of substantial foreign policy change.","Blarel, Nicolas",Int Polit,37,1

Accurate prediction models are very much essential to make proper forecasts and take necessary actions. This study demonstrates the capability of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), an Artificial Neural network (ANN) model for forecasting the number of infected cases in the state of Karnataka in India. It is trained using a fast training algorithm namely, Extreme Learning machine to reduce the training time required. The parameters required for the forecasting model have been selected using partial autocorrelation function, which is a conventional method, and its performance has been compared with parameters selected using cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, which is a very popular metaheuristic optimization algorithm. The testing of the forecasting model has been done, and comparison between the two parameter selection methods as well as with MLP with conventional backpropagation has been carried out. Use of CS algorithm has resulted in a better forecasting performance based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), with a value of 6.62% on training data and 7.03% on the test data. Further to check the efficacy of the model, the data of COVID-19 cases of Hungary from 4 March to 19 April 2020 have been used, which resulted in a MAPE of 1.55%, thereby establishing the robustness of the proposed ANN model for forecasting COVID-19 cases for the state of Karnataka.","Shetty, Rashmi P.; Pai, P.

We incorporated several COVID‐19‐related topics in pharmacology content taught throughout the Pharm.D. curriculum and analyzed student performance on related assignments. In first professional year class, we created an active learning exercise in Principles of Drug Action course about pharmacology of glucocorticoids that included recently published articles about the use of dexamethasone in severely‐ill COVID‐19 patients. Students completed an open‐book group assignment containing open‐ended questions on glucocorticoid pharmacology and COVID‐19 treatment. They mastered the material with average scores of 89.06% on questions related to general glucocorticoid pharmacology and 98.21% on COVID‐related glucocorticoid use questions. In professional year two, we created an active learning practice opportunity for Integrated Pharmacotherapy: Cardiology class about the role of renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) pathways and their inhibition in COVID‐19. Readings that summarized recent controversies about the role of RAS inhibitors in COVID‐19 were chosen. Students worked in groups on open‐ended questions about general pharmacology of RAS inhibitors and their proposed and observed effects on COVID‐19. Student scores for general pharmacology of RAS inhibitors questions and RAS inhibitors’ effects on COVID‐19 were similar in this activity, with the averages of 88.99% and 87.17%, respectively. Over the semester students demonstrated a trend towards improvement in their RAS pharmacology performance on closed‐book assessments, which increased from 70.3% on the first test to the average of 84.6% on subsequent exams, however, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Finally, antiviral pharmacology lecture in Integrated Pharmacotherapy: Infectious Disease course presented to third professional year students included COVID‐related content. We did not test students on COVID‐related pharmacology content specifically in this class and their overall performance on antiviral drugs pharmacology exam questions was similar to last year's class performance (79.73% vs. 76.79%). Our observations indicate that additional practice opportunities that demonstrate clear clinical relevance of pharmacology content can positively affect student performance as evidenced by high average scores on reported assessments. These class activities may promote our students commitment to lifelong learning.","Marjanovic, Jasna; Profirovic, Jasmina",FASEB J,37,1

Specifically, we position the pandemic as an “unsettled time” (Swidler 1986) and examine how different racialized groups made sense of the economic and health risks posed during this unprecedented period. We find that even when accounting for economic precarity and potential exposure to COVID-19, as well as for various other measures of social status, racialized minorities felt significantly more threatened by COVID-19 than did whites. Religion and political ideology mediated this relationship to some degree, but the racialized differences were substantial. Indeed, we find that even the most liberal whites reported being significantly less concerned about some COVID-19 risks than the most politically conservative of our Latinx and Black respondents. By linking the literature on race and racial stratification with research on risk and culture, we argue that whiteness facilitates a cognitive insulating effect vis-à-vis COVID-19 risks. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and conclude by highlighting the enduring importance of racialization, including various manifestations of white privilege, when assessing the social and cultural realities of crises on the ground.","Vargas, Nicholas; Mora, G Cristina; Gleeson, Shannon",Soc Probl,37,5

The current study aimed to describe changes in family rules and routines during the first year of pediatric cancer treatment, and to explore associations with demographics, illness factors, and caregiver distress. METHODS This exploratory mixed-methods, cross-sectional study examined 44 primary caregivers of youth in treatment for a new cancer diagnosis in 2019 and 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers completed validated questionnaires assessing demographic and child illness characteristics, psychosocial distress, and cancer-related stressors, and participated in a semi-structured interview about family rules and routines. RESULTS Caregivers reported changes in bedtime, mealtime, and school routines, relaxed behavioral expectations and rules around screen time, and new rules and routines around treatment, medications, and infection control. Caregivers with elevated levels of psychosocial distress reported more changed routines than caregivers with low levels of psychosocial distress. Caregivers who endorsed more cancer-related stressors reported more new rules and routines than those who reported fewer cancer-related stressors. Demographic and illness factors were not significantly associated with the number of changed, new, or stable family rules and routines. CONCLUSIONS Families may relax rules and routines during the first several months of diagnosis, and this may be related to side effects of treatment and limited caregiver capacity. The long-term impact of changes in family rules and routines during cancer treatment warrants further study given that accommodating parenting strategies have been associated with adverse short- and long-term child health and behavior outcomes.

Hyperammonemia has also rarely been reported in association with multiple myeloma. With modest elevations, hyperammonemia often leads to encephalopathy. However, when ammonia reaches extreme levels cerebral edema and herniation may occur leading to coma, seizures, or death. CASE We describe a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and multiple myeloma who developed profound encephalopathy and eventual obtundation. He was found to have severe hyperammonemia that was not due to any identified hepatic impairment. His hyperammonemia proved to be refractory to medical therapy with cathartics and antibiotics, prolonged high-flux hemodialysis, and even continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). This metabolic derangement as well as encephalopathy was eventually reversed with simultaneous CVVHD and extended daily hemodialysis (EDD). A more durable response was achieved after vincristine and dexamethasone were administered, which allowed the patient to resume his previous intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) schedule. The patient regained his full sensorium and was eventually discharged to home. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous double hemodialysis may be used as an important adjunct in treating refractory hyperammonemia.","Brucculeri, Michael; Gabbard, Wesley; Masson, John; Jooma, Nuruddin",The International journal of artificial organs,37,1

For many patients the psychological impact of the disease is substantial. Surgical treatment is indicated when medical treatments fail. Until now, most published research on the subject has focused on how effective surgical treatment is on correcting the cosmetic appearance of the breast. Little is known about the effect of surgical treatment on the psychological aspects of the disease. The aim of this review was to identify the psychological domains affected by the disease and the effect of surgical treatment on these. A systematic search of the published literature was performed. All studies on the subject were evaluated for inclusion and six studies were included in the review. Several of the included studies reported improvement in quality of life and several psychological domains after surgical treatment for gynecomastia. Among these domains, are; vitality, emotional discomfort, limitations due to physical aspects and limitations due to pain. Impact of surgical treatment for gynecomastia seems to be beneficial for several psychological domains. The current level of evidence on this subject is very low and future studies, examining the impact of the surgical intervention for gynecomastia on psychological domains, are greatly needed. More data on this subject could improve the pre-operative evaluation of these patients and help identify the patients that will benefit from treatment.","Sollie, Martin",Gland surgery,37,1

The immune system is involved in the pathogenesis of many of these, either by causing tissue damage or alternatively by responding to disease and contributing to repair. It is clearly vital that cells of the immune system patrol the CNS and protect against infection. However, in contrast to other tissues, damage caused by immune pathology in the CNS can be irreparable. The nervous and immune systems have, therefore, coevolved to permit effective immune surveillance while limiting immune pathology. Here we will consider aspects of adaptive immunity in the CNS and the retina, both in the context of protection from infection as well as cancer and autoimmunity, while focusing on immune responses that compromise health and lead to significant morbidity.","Wraith, David C; Nicholson, Lindsay B",The Journal of clinical investigation,37,1

Here we report the accuracy of an (111)In-labeled pretherapy test dose for personalized dosing of (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 following pretargeting with the anti-CEA × anti-hapten bsMAb, TF2, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS In 20 patients bone marrow absorbed doses (BMD) and doses to the kidneys were predicted based on blood samples and scintigrams acquired after (111)In-IMP288 injection for individualized dosing of PRIT with (177)Lu-IMP288. Different dose schedules were studied, varying the interval between the bsMAb and peptide administration (5 days vs. 1 day), increasing the bsMAb dose (75 mg vs. 150 mg), and lowering the peptide dose (100 μg vs. 25 μg). RESULTS TF2 and (111)In/(177)Lu-IMP288 clearance was highly variable. A strong correlation was observed between peptide residence times and individual TF2 blood concentrations at the time of peptide injection (Spearman's ρ = 0.94, P < 0.0001). PRIT with 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-IMP288 resulted in low radiation doses to normal tissues (BMD <0.5 Gy, kidney dose <3 Gy). Predicted (177)Lu-IMP288 BMD were in good agreement with the actual measured doses (mean ± SD difference -0.0026 ± 0.028 mGy/MBq). Hematological toxicity was mild in most patients, with only two (10 %) having grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia. A correlation was found between platelet toxicity and BMD (Spearman's ρ = 0.58, P = 0.008). No nonhematological toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION These results show that individual high activity doses in PRIT in patients with CEA-expressing CRC could be safely administered by predicting the radiation dose to red marrow and kidneys, based on dosimetric analysis of a test dose of TF2 and (111)In-IMP288.","Schoffelen, Rafke; Woliner-van der Weg, Wietske; Visser, Eric P; Goldenberg, David M; Sharkey, Robert M; McBride, William J; Chang, Chien-Hsing; Rossi, Edmund A; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,37,19

Although understanding of the short and long-term manifestations of COVID-19 remains incomplete, there is a preponderance of respiratory pathology in COVID-19 and potential for chronic loss of pulmonary function in recovered patients, raising concerns for associated cognitive impacts. METHOD We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature on neuropsychological variables in acute/severe respiratory disease and various forms of chronic pulmonary disease to inform expectations about potential cognitive manifestations of COVID-19. RESULTS Cognitive dysfunction is common but not inevitable in acute and chronic pulmonary disease, although unique predictors and symptom trajectories appear to be associated with each.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine whether minority groups receiving care in NHs versus the community had fewer differences in their functional needs compared with the differences in nonminority older adults, suggesting a disparity. METHODS We identified respondents aged 65 years or above with a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study who reported requiring LTSS help. We performed unadjusted analyses to assess the difference in functional need between community and NH care. Functional need was operationalized using a functional limitations score and 6 individual activities of daily living. We compared the LTSS setting for minority older adults to White older adults using difference-in-differences. RESULTS There were 186 minority older adults (community=75%, NH=25%) and 357 White older adults (community=50%, NH=50%). Between settings, minority older adults did not differ in education or marital status, but were younger and had greater income in the NH versus the community. The functional limitations score was higher in NHs than in the community for both groups. Functional needs for all 6 activities of daily living for the minority group were greater in NHs compared with the community. CONCLUSION Functional need for minority older adults differed by setting while demographics varied in unexpected ways. Factors such as familial and financial support are important to consider when implementing programs to keep older adults out of NHs.","Travers, Jasmine L; Naylor, Mary D; Coe, Norma B; Meng, Can; Li, Fangyong; Cohen, Andrew B",Medical care,37,1

Its social acceptability, which affects both what systems (infrastructure) can be put in place and to what extent their implementation will be successful, is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, often not well understood. In light of the growing evidence that decisions to build new infrastructure are often contested by the public, there is a clear need to understand the role of scientific evidence in public perception, particularly as environmental infrastructure delivery is often objected to by the public on environmental grounds. In this paper the need for waste management infrastructure is reviewed, and the way its delivery in the UK has evolved is used as an example of the role of public perception in the planning and delivery of waste facilities. Findings demonstrate the vital role of public communication in waste management infrastructure delivery. Public perception must be taken into account early in the decision making process, with the public informed and engaged from the start. There is a pressing need for people not simply to accept but to understand and appreciate the need for infrastructure, the nature of infrastructure investments and development, the costs and the benefits involved, and the technological aspects. Scientific evidence and literacy have a critical role to play, facilitating public engagement in a process that empowers people, allowing them to define and handle challenges and influence decisions that will impact their lives.

These meshes are generally composed of two layers of non-absorbable materials, or one non-absorbable, one absorbable layer that degrades within the body upon healing of the defect. The most crucial point in the design of a dual mesh is to produce the respective layers based on the structure and requirements of the recipient site. We herein developed a dual mesh that consists of two layers; a nanofibrous layer made of poly (glycerol sebacate)/poly (caprolactone) (PGS/PCL) to support the healing of the abdominal wall defect and a non-degradable, non-adhesive smooth layer made of polycarbonateurethane (PU) with suitable properties to avoid the adhesion of the viscera to the mesh. To prepare the double-sided structure, PGS/PCL was directly electrospun onto the PU film. This processing approach provided a final product with well-integrated layers as observed by SEM. Tensile test performed at the dry state of the samples showed that the dual mesh has the ability to elongate 7 times more as compared to the commercially available counterparts, mimicking the native tissue properties. The degradation test carried out at physiological conditions revealed that PGS started to degrade within the first 15 days. In vitro studies with HUVECs demonstrated the double function of the meshes, in which PU layer did not allow cell adhesion while PGS/PCL layer has the ability to support cell adhesion and proliferation. Therefore, the material developed in this study has the potential to be an alternative to the existing hernia mesh products.","Kaya, M; Ahi, Z B; Ergene, E; Yilgor Huri, P; Tuzlakoglu, K",Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,37,1

The concentration of HIF-1α in the contents of periodontal pockets in patients with CGP depended on the severity of the disease: with mild CGP, it did not differ from the control group, and with moderate CGP it was 3.15 times higher (p<0.001). In patients with cancer of OM, the concentration of HIF-1α in the gingival fluid did not depend on the presence of inflammatory periodontal lesions and was determined by a multiple increase in the biomarker level (7.5 times) due to the development of a malignant process in the oral cavity. Therefore, monitoring the concentration of HIF-1α in the gingival fluid is informative in patients with CGP in assessing the severity of periodontal conditions, as well as in differential diagnosis with malignant formations of the oral cavity.","Zorina, O A; Amkhadova, M A; Abaev, Z M; Khamukova, A A; Demidova, A A",Stomatologiia,37,1

Due to vindesine unavailability, we assessed the safety and efficacy of replacing vindesine with vincristine in a modified R-ACVBP protocol (mR-ACVBP). METHODS This is a retrospective study including all consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who received first-line mR-ACVBP. Vindesine was replaced with vincristine 1.5 mg on days 1 and 5 of each cycle. Responders continued with published R-ACVBP consolidation. Patients with inadequate response on interim imaging were offered consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation. RESULTS We identified 56 patients with DLBCL, with a median age of 41 years (range, 21-67). Thirty-seven (66%) patients had an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index of ≥ 2. Complete response was achieved in 41 (80%) patients and partial response in 6 (12%). The most common adverse events during induction were anemia (91%), febrile neutropenia (64%; grade 4 in 46%), thrombocytopenia (39%), and mucositis (21%). Peripheral neuropathy was encountered in 7 (12%) patients (grade 3; n = 1). Two deaths from septic shock were reported in patients with initial poor performance status. After a median follow-up of 17 months, the 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 86% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSION The replacement of vindesine with vincristine in mR-ACVBP seems feasible, with manageable adverse events and excellent 2-year progression-free survival. These data need validation in larger prospective trials.","El Sayed, Rola; El Darsa, Haidar; Kort, Jeries; Al Chami, Farouk; Ibrahim, Ali; Charafeddine, Maya; Bazarbachi, Ali; Abou Dalle, Iman; El Cheikh, Jean","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",37,30

Hence, we analyzed multiple aspects of historical and present-day female representation in the diabetes field. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We quantified gender representation at annual American Diabetes Association (ADA) meetings; editorial board service positions for ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) journals; principal investigators for ADA, JDRF, and National Institutes of Health National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases P30 grant funding; and ADA, JDRF, and EASD award recipients. RESULTS There are many women in the field of diabetes: registration for the ADA Scientific Sessions has been 43% female since 2016, and for over five decades, women made up 83% of ADA Presidents of Health Care and Education. Yet, only 9% of ADA Presidents of Medicine and Science have been women. Women were well represented on editorial boards for journals focused on diabetes education (Diabetes Spectrum, 89% female) and primary care (Clinical Diabetes, 49% female) but not for the more academically targeted Diabetes Care (34% female), Diabetes (21% female), and Diabetologia (30% female). Only one-third of ADA Pathway to Stop Diabetes and JDRF grants have been awarded to women, and females only lead 2 of 18 (11%) of the P30-supported Diabetes Research Centers. Finally, only 2-12% of major ADA, JDRF, and EASD awards were given to women, without significant change over time. CONCLUSIONS Despite increasing recognition of gender imbalance in research and medicine, many disparities in the field of diabetes persist. We call for decreasing barriers for advancement of female investigators and creating environments that promote their retention and equitable recognition for their contributions to the field.","Dunne, Jessica L; Maizel, Jennifer L; Posgai, Amanda L; Atkinson, Mark A; DiMeglio, Linda A",Diabetes care,37,1

Drawing from life-history theory, affective and developmental science, and social-psychological frameworks, we examined the idea that perceptions of uncertainty--perceiving the world as random and unpredictable-enhance subsequent savoring. In a large experience-sampling study (Study 1, N = 6,680), we found that individuals who perceived more uncertainty showed increases in subsequent savoring in their daily lives. In a preregistered experiment (Study 2, N = 397), individuals who watched a film that induced uncertainty (vs. order or a control condition) subsequently reported higher savoring intentions. Finally, in a field experiment on a busy urban street (Study 3, N = 201), we found that passersby who received fliers that induced uncertainty (vs. order) subsequently engaged in more savoring behavior by stopping to smell a bouquet of roses. These findings from three studies with diverse samples and methodologies underscore an upside to the specter of uncertainty: it can cause people to savor the positives of the present.

Individuals with ALG3-CDG frequently exhibit severe neurological involvement (epilepsy, microcephaly, hypotonia), ocular anomalies, dysmorphic features, skeletal anomalies and feeding difficulties. We present ten unreported individuals diagnosed with ALG3-CDG based on molecular and biochemical testing with eleven novel variants in ALG3, bringing the total to 40 reported individuals. In addition to the typical multisystem disease seen in ALG3-CDG, we expand the symptomatology of ALG3-CDG to now include endocrine abnormalities, neural tube defects, mild aortic root dilatation, immunodeficiency and renal anomalies. N-glycan analyses of these individuals showed combined deficiencies of hybrid glycans and glycan extension beyond Man5 GlcNAc2 consistent with their truncated lipid-linked precursor oligosaccharides. This spectrum of N-glycan changes is unique to ALG3-CDG. These expanded features of ALG3-CDG facilitates diagnosis and suggests that optimal management should include baseline endocrine, renal, cardiac and immunological evaluation at the time of diagnosis and with ongoing monitoring.

In Tama City in Tokyo, 12-lead ECG and serum creatinine concentration have been included as essential examinations in specific health checkups to diagnose AF and CKD. In the present study, we investigated the impact of CKD classification on new-onset AF in the general population.Methods and Results:Among 13,478 subjects aged 40-74 years at entry (age, 65.6±7.8 years; men, 42.0%), renal impairment with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2and proteinuria were found in 15.5% and 4.6%, respectively. CKD severity in individual subjects was classified according to a heatmap of the Japanese Society of Nephrology as 81.3% in the green, 15.1% in the yellow, 2.5% in the orange, and 0.9% in the red. Of those without AF in 2012, it had developed in 115 up to 2017; thus, the new-onset AF incidence rate was 2.6/1,000 person-years. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for new-onset AF in each CKD classification were 1.50 (0.93-2.41, P=0.097) in the yellow, 2.53 (1.03-6.23, P=0.044) in the orange, and 4.65 (1.47-14.70, P=0.009) in the red compared with the green as a reference. CONCLUSIONS CKD classification was significantly associated with new-onset AF in the general population. Thus, it would be useful for risk stratification of new-onset AF.

To strengthen caregiving and promote targeted care for older adults during and after the pandemic, this paper investigates the impact of the coronavirus on the economic activities and well-being of older adults in Enugu and Anambra states, Nigeria. Hermeneutic phenomenology was adopted and 16 older adults aged between 60 and 81 years, with a majority of them still working as farmers and traders were phone-interviewed. Findings highlighted four key lessons for gerontological social workers including 1) the fear that impact of the containment measures could kill the older adults faster than the virus; 2) the measures generate a feeling of neglect and marginalization of healthcare needs among older adults; 3) altered positive health-seeking behavior among the older adults; 4) and concern about the absence of functional policy and plan to address the welfare of older adults. Therefore, the central focus of the gerontological social workers and Nigerian polity should not be on how to reduce the spread of the disease alone, but on an application of caution in instituting and implementing the measures.","Agbawodikeizu, Patricia Uju; Ezulike, Chigozie Donatus; Ekoh, Prince Chiagozie; George, Elizabeth Onyedikachi; Okoye, Uzoma Odera; Nnebe, Ikechukwu",Journal of gerontological social work,37,1

Despite various modifications of reconstruction methods after LTG, an optimal procedure has yet to be established. The authors report the newly developed reconstruction technique after LTG: intracorporeal circular stapling esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). METHODS After full mobilization of the abdominal esophagus, the esophagus is transected with an endoscopic linear stapler. The anvil is then transorally inserted into the esophagus by using the OrVil system. After jejunojejunostomy is performed through a 4-cm midline minilaparotomy, preparing a 50-cm Roux-en-Y jejunal limb, a circular stapler is inserted into the jejunum and introduced into the abdominal cavity. Pneumoperitoneum is established by sealing off the laparotomy wound retractor with a surgical glove attached to the circular stapler. Double-stapling esophagojejunostomy with a circular stapler is performed intracorporeally, and the jejunal stump is closed with an endoscopic linear stapler. RESULTS Of the 16 patients who underwent this operation, there was no intraoperative complication or conversion to open surgery, and no patient required an extension of the initial incision for anastomosis. Mean operation time and blood loss were 194 min and 272 ml, respectively. One patient developed an intra-abdominal abscess postoperatively. Postoperative fluorography revealed no anastomosis leakage or stenosis in any of the patients. Patients resumed an oral liquid diet on postoperative day 3-5, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 11 days. CONCLUSIONS We have successfully performed LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction using our technique in 16 patients without any anastomosis complications. We believe that our procedure is a secure and reliable reconstruction method after LTG, which is especially useful in obese patients, in whom conventional extracorporeal anastomosis often is difficult.","Jeong, Oh; Park, Young Kyu",Surgical endoscopy,37,31

In vivo lactose permease (LacY) of Escherichia coli displays a mixture of topological conformations ranging from complete inversion of the N-terminal helical bundle to mixed topology and then to completely native topology as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is increased from 0% to 70% of membrane phospholipids. These topological conformers are interconvertible by postassembly synthesis or dilution of PE in vivo. To investigate whether coexistence of multiple topological conformers is dependent solely on the membrane lipid composition, we determined the topological organization of LacY in an in vitro proteoliposome system in which lipid composition can be systematically controlled before (liposomes) and after (fliposomes) reconstitution using a lipid exchange technique. Purified LacY reconstituted into preformed liposomes of increasing PE content displayed inverted topology at low PE and then a mixture of inverted and proper topologies with the latter increasing with increasing PE until all LacY adopted its native topology. Interconversion between topological conformers of LacY was observed in a PE dose-dependent manner by either increasing or decreasing PE levels in proteoliposomes postreconstitution of LacY, clearly demonstrating that membrane protein topology can be changed simply by changing membrane lipid composition independent of other cellular factors. The results provide a thermodynamic-based lipid-dependent model for shifting the equilibrium between different conformational states of a membrane protein.","Vitrac, Heidi; Bogdanov, Mikhail; Dowhan, William",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,37,19

A járvánnyal szembeni védekezés során mindennapossá vált a maszkhasználat, amely jelentős kihívást jelent a hétköznapi kommunikációs helyzetekben. Az egészségügy bizonyos területein korábban is jelen volt ez a probléma, azonban a most általános érvényű, folyamatos maszkviselés és védőruha-használat szimbolikus és gyakorlati értelemben is akadályként jelenik meg az orvos és a páciens között, ami több szinten nehezíti a hatékony kapcsolatteremtést és kommunikációt.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(23): 897-904. Summary. In the fight against the epidemic, the use of masks has become commonplace, which is a significant challenge in everyday communication situations. This problem has been present in some areas of healthcare in the past, but today's universal use of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) is both a symbolic and practical barrier between doctor and patient, making it difficult to establish an effective communication and connectivity on several levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop unified communication protocols that help building a relationship of trust in healthcare so that emotional availability of providers and safe physical distance are achieved simultaneously. The aim of our study is to summarize the effects of mask wearing and PPE usage on the physician-patient communication and also the trust and empathy processes that emerge within the relationship through the review of the current literature. We would also like to draw attention to the effects on healthcare staff. Our goal is also to formulate recommendations, taking into account domestic and international experience, that can be used to improve the communication of healthcare professionals, and through that, the satisfaction of the most important actors in care, patients and caregivers.

Hippocrates, the wise man of Kos, knew over two millennia ago. Our objective is to comment on the types of studies aimed at understanding and optimizing drug usage and to draw attention to the need to seek approval before using or citing the Morisky adherence scale. COMMENT The study of prescribing and how patients use their medicines is important. As part of this effort, the results of investigations of how patients adhere to drug prescriptions can be informative. However, the results are meaningful only if the methods used for doing the measurements are valid and made explicit. We were surprised when a team of our authors were threatened with legal action for citing the Morisky Adherence Scale and explaining how some authors had obtained their adherence scores. Adherence studies are but one facet of the study of prescribing aimed at improving clinical outcomes. Other aspects include investigating the quality of prescribing, and how unnecessary medicines can be deprescribed to improve the quality of care and reduce the risk of adverse effects. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The study of optimal prescribing is an important endeavour and adherence studies are but one aspect. We report that using and citing the Morisky Adherence scale in any detail is a risky business. Prior approval is required unless one is prepared to pay up, retrospectively. We require all authors to certify they have no conflicts of interest with respect to the scale.","Li-Wan-Po, Alain; Peterson, Gregory M",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,37,1

Therefore, response predictors are needed for early identification of patients not responding to TVR-based triple therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-five patients (mean age: 54 ± 13 years; male gender: 60%; treatment-experienced: 82%; cirrhosis: 58%) with HCV genotype 1 infection were treated with a TVR-based triple-therapy regimen. TVR plasma levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization-tandem mass spectrometry at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 of antiviral therapy. On-treatment HCV RNA response was assessed at weeks 4, 12, and 24 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS An extended rapid virological response (eRVR) and sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 21 of 45 patients (47%) and 36 of 45 (80%) patients, respectively. Mean ± standard deviation TVR plasma levels at week 2 were 3.4 ± 0.2 log10 ng/ml and did not differ over time (when assessed at weeks 4, 8, and 12). TVR plasma levels at week 2 were significantly higher in patients who achieved an eRVR compared to those who did not achieve eRVR (3.5 ± 0.1 vs. 3.3 ± 0.2 log10 ng/ml; p = 0.003) but were neither associated with SVR nor with treatment-related anemia. CONCLUSION TVR plasma levels are associated with on-treatment response but not with overall treatment efficacy. Given the high overall response rates to TVR-based triple therapy, our data suggest that TVR trough levels may not be a useful predictor of treatment response, and routine drug-level monitoring is not required.","Farnik, Harald; Ferreirós, Nerea; Labocha, Sandra; Geisslinger, Gerd; Zeuzem, Stefan; Sarrazin, Christoph; Vermehren, Johannes",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,37,20

To assess the impact on length of stay (LOS), complication and readmission rates. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 165 consecutive patients undergoing open RC (ORC) and urinary diversion between January 2008 and April 2013 were entered into an ERP. A retrospective case note review was undertaken. Outcomes recorded included LOS, time to mobilisation, complication rates within the first 30 days (Clavien-Dindo classification) and readmissions. RESULTS All patients were successfully entered into the ERP. As enhanced recovery principles became embedded in the unit, LOS reduced from a mean of 14 days over the initial year of the ERP to a mean of 9.2 days. The complication rate was 6.6% for Clavien ≥3, and 43.5% for Clavien ≤2. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.2%. The 30-day readmission rate was 13.9%. In the most contemporary subset of 52 patients: the median time after ORC to sit out of bed, mobilise and open bowels was day 1, 2 and 6, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The ERP described for patients undergoing ORC appears to be safe. Benefits include early feeding, mobilisation and hospital discharge. The ERP will continue to develop with the incorporation of advancing evidence and technology, in particular the introduction of robot-assisted RC.","Dutton, Thomas J; Daugherty, Mark O; Mason, Robert G; McGrath, John S",BJU international,37,20

Until a few years ago it was deemed inescapable, as all the conventional medications used to treat the disease have been proven of little benefit in preventing recurrence after surgical treatment. In the past few years, anti-TNF agents given immediately after surgery have shown a remarkable efficacy in the prevention of disease recurrence. Large, randomized, controlled trials are currently underway to confirm these findings. Anti-TNF treatment of endoscopic lesions that occur after surgery seems to be less effective than using TNF antagonists to prevent recurrence. However, although the data are limited, this treatment strategy seems to be still superior to all the other prevention strategies that are not based on anti-TNF agents. Limited data are available on long-term outcomes of patients treated with anti-TNF agents after surgery. They suggest that these medications are safe and effective after many years of treatment.

METHODS Science Direct, MEDLINE, and ISI Web of Science were searched to find relevant articles, published up to August 2020. Studies were included if they compared homocysteine levels in healthy subjects with subjects with depression. Also, articles that reported the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and risk of depression were included. Odds ratios of depression and means of homocysteine were used to ascertain the overall effect size. RESULTS Homocysteine level was higher in subjects with depression in comparison with healthy controls (weight mean difference =2.53 µmol/L, 95% confidence interval: 1.77, 3.30), and the depression diagnostic tool was a source of heterogeneity. Homocysteine level was significantly higher in subjects with depression in studies that used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS), and Beck Depression Index II (BDI-II) as depression diagnostic tools. Also, participants with hyperhomocysteinemia had a higher chance of depression (Pooled risk =1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.52), where the depression diagnostic tool was a source of heterogeneity. In contrast to ZDRS and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) subgroups, hyperhomocysteinemia yielded a significantly higher risk of depression in DSM-IV, GDS, and ""other"" subgroups. CONCLUSION Homocysteinemia level is higher in individuals with depression. However, the depression diagnostic tool used is instrumental in influencing their association, and thus, future studies should focus on the tools for depression assessment.","Moradi, Fatemeh; Lotfi, Keyhan; Armin, Maryam; Clark, Cain C T; Askari, Gholamreza; Rouhani, Mohammad Hossein",European journal of clinical investigation,37,1

Childhood-onset obesity is associated with a number of cardiometabolic consequences, which contribute to diminished quality of life. Metabolic and bariatric surgery offers a powerful treatment paradigm with positive long-term health effects. A growing body of literature supports the notion that earlier intervention in younger patients results in long-term health benefits. The development of a multidisciplinary care model and best practice guidelines are central to providing optimal care for this vulnerable patient population. Although the outcomes of metabolic and bariatric surgery in pediatric patients are reassuring and support the ongoing utilization of this important treatment paradigm, a number of significant challenges remain regarding access to care. As the literature continues to support earlier intervention for youth with severe obesity, future efforts should address these challenges to ensure that eligible patients are referred in timely fashion.","Gonzalez, Dani O; Michalsky, Marc P",Pediatric obesity,37,1

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.","Mei, Xueyan; Lee, Hao-Chih; Diao, Kai-Yue; Huang, Mingqian; Lin, Bin; Liu, Chenyu; Xie, Zongyu; Ma, Yixuan; Robson, Philip M; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Mani, Venkatesh; Calcagno, Claudia; Li, Kunwei; Li, Shaolin; Shan, Hong; Lv, Jian; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Long, Qihua; Steinberger, Sharon; Jacobi, Adam; Deyer, Timothy; Luksza, Marta; Liu, Fang; Little, Brent P; Fayad, Zahi A; Yang, Yang",Nature medicine,37,16

STUDY DESIGN Prospective descriptive study. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 45). METHODS Collected data were organized into 6 categories: patient data, wound data, NPWT data, adjunctive treatments, complications, and final outcome. RESULTS Wounds (53 in 45 dogs) were largely traumatic in origin, and distributed fairly evenly to the trunk, proximal and distal aspects of the limbs. Most wounds (34 dogs, 76%) had no granulation tissue and were treated a mean of 4.2 days after wounding, whereas 11 dogs had granulating wounds that were initially treated a mean of 87 days after wounding. Median NPWT use was 3 days with a mean hospitalization of 7.8 days. Most wounds (33; 62%) were closed surgically after NPWT and were healed by 14 days. The other 18 wounds healed (mean, 21 days) by second intention after hospital discharge. Overall, 96% of the wounds healed; 2 dogs died before definitive closure could be attempted. CONCLUSION NPWT is applicable to a wide variety of canine wounds, is well tolerated, allows for several days between dressing changes, and can used to optimize the wound bed for surgical closure or second intention healing.","Pitt, Kathryn A; Stanley, Bryden J",Veterinary surgery : VS,37,24

Little is known about institutional review board (IRB) decision-making practices when reviewing such research. We conducted a survey of current and former IRB personnel in the United States to elicit their interpretations of ""minimal risk""-a formal regulatory category-and to identify factors that may influence IRB decisions to approve or disapprove research involving pregnant participants. Study results revealed some consensus among IRB members about the risk level of individual research procedures and hypothetical study vignettes. However, we uncovered important variations not only in the assessment of risk but also in the willingness of IRB members to approve minimal risk research that includes pregnant women. Based on our findings, guidance is needed to assist IRB members in characterizing risk, applying federal regulations, and appropriately ensuring the inclusion or justified exclusion of pregnant people in research.","White, Amina; Grady, Christine; Little, Margaret; Sullivan, Kristen; Clark, Katie; Ngwu, Monalisa; Lyerly, Anne Drapkin",Ethics & human research,37,30

However, the use of barbed progressive tension sutures (B-PTSs) in deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap donor-site closure has not been investigated. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with DIEP flap reconstruction in a 3-year period at 2 institutions by 2 surgeons. Patients were compared by method of DIEP donor-site closure. Group 1 had barbed running progressive tension sutures without drain placement. Group 2 had interrupted progressive tension closure with abdominal drain placement (PTS-AD). Group 3 had closure with only abdominal drain placement (AD). Data collected included demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent DIEP reconstruction (25 B-PTS, 25 PTS-AD, and 25 AD). Patient characteristics-age, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking status, and chemotherapy-were not significantly different between groups. Rate of seroma was 1.3% (B-PTS = 0%, PTS-AD = 4%, AD = 0%), wound dehiscence 16% (B-PTS = 8%, PTS-AD = 16%, AD = 24%), and umbilical necrosis 5.3% (B-PTS = 0%, PTS-AD = 0%, AD = 16%). No hematomas were observed in any patients. No statistically significant difference was found between complication rates across groups. CONCLUSIONS Use of B-PTSs for abdominal closure after DIEP flap harvest can obviate the need for abdominal drains. Complication rates following this technique are not significantly different from closure using progressive tension suture and abdominal drain placement. This practice can prevent the use of abdominal drains, which can promote patient mobility, increase independence upon discharge, and contribute to patient satisfaction.","Nagarkar, Purushottam; Lakhiani, Chrisovalantis; Cheng, Angela; Lee, Michael; Teotia, Sumeet; Saint-Cyr, Michel",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Both horses were unable to bear weight on the affected forelimb and had a dropped elbow appearance. Radial nerve paralysis, triceps myopathy, and fractures of the humerus and ulna were ruled out. The caudal aspect of the affected antebrachium of each horse was very firm to palpation and became firmer when weight was shifted onto the limb. Ultrasonographic examination revealed swelling and suspected intramuscular hemorrhage of the caudal antebrachial muscles. On the basis of clinical examination and diagnostic imaging findings, both horses had antebrachial compartment syndrome diagnosed. Lameness did not substantially improve with medical treatment in either horse. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Caudal antebrachial fasciotomy was performed in each horse. Following sedation and local anesthetic administration, a bistoury knife was inserted through small incisions to perform fasciotomy. Horses remained standing throughout the procedure and were immediately able to bear weight on the affected limb without signs of discomfort. Horse 1 developed colitis and horse 2 developed a mild incisional infection, but both fully recovered and returned to their previous activities. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Antebrachial compartment syndrome is a rare cause of severe unilateral forelimb lameness and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in horses with a dropped elbow appearance. Both horses of this report had a successful outcome following antebrachial fasciotomy.","Nelson, Brad B; Ragle, Claude A; Barrett, Myra F; Hendrickson, Dean A",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,37,1

The current article aims to describe this experience in designing and organizing a web-congress by the 2020-IWBNC method. METHODS The 2020-IWBNC was organized by the Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery (CIEN in Spanish) in a record time of four weeks. Eight committees were created and assigned with a specific task to fulfill. The event followed a strict protocol based on the double-room method, which consisted of two virtual rooms (A and B) hosted from four different physical locations to avoid lecture overlapping and connection drops. Quality and impact were measured by videoconferencing platform and social media parameters, and an audience perception survey. RESULTS High-quality was achieved in academic standards, worldwide assistance, schedule adherence, and security. The 2020-IWBNC hosted 25 internationally renowned speakers and offered 30 top-of-the-line multidisciplinary conferences.

We analyzed the determinants of discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients and suggest policy recommendations to reduce such discrimination.Methods: Twenty-seven Chinese cities were selected randomly based on their geographical location and GDP rank. One hundred adults were interviewed in each city with an equal number of men and women and three urban residents for every two rural residents. A multiple ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the associations between potential determinants and the COVID-19 discrimination level.Results: Of 2377 participants, 79.76% displayed discrimination toward recovered COVID-19 patients. The female discrimination level was 1.25 times that of males; the discrimination level increased with age; and was occupation-specific, with physicians' (OR = 0.352) and students' (OR = 0.553) discrimination level lower than that of farmers. The discrimination level of participants from the central regions was 1.828 times, and the eastern region 1.504 times, that of participants from western region. The participants' discrimination level was lower when they scored higher in transmission knowledge, prevention knowledge and other COVID-19 knowledge, treatment methods and quarantine time.Conclusion: Sex, age, occupation, infections of relatives and friends, regions and scores on COVID-19 knowledge were determinants of discrimination level against recovered COVID-19 patients. In contrast with qualitative studies, our quantitative study recommends targeted education campaigns, focusing on physicians, women, older people and certain occupations. Only the COVID-19 vaccination program for the whole population will resolve the COVID-19 discrimination problem.","Liu, Rugang; Nicholas, Stephen; Leng, Anli; Qian, Dongfu; Maitland, Elizabeth; Wang, Jian",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,37,29

The situation caused by the rapidly increasing number of new cases and deaths due to COVID-19 required the rapid development of international recommendations and procedures to limit the spread of infections and ongoing monitoring of the epidemiological situation. In the field of epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 cases, international organizations - WHO and regionally ECDC, have developed basic requirements for reporting data on newly detected cases of infection. In order to ensure the possibility of reporting new cases and activities undertaken by sanitary-epidemiological services in the country and to fulfill the obligation to report data to the European surveillance network, it was necessary to adapt the electronic system supporting epidemiological surveillance operations, for registration of suspected and confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This work presents the characteristics of the new COVID-19 module created as part of the central Epidemiological Case Reporting System and a preliminary evaluation of its usefulness for the purposes of combating COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS. The Epidemiological Case Reporting System is an efficient and adequate tool that can be adapted to newly emerging threats. In order to use the module to monitor the current epidemiological situation, it is necessary to integrate it with other systems collecting data about COVID-19 patients - ie.

However, few is known about the characteristics of HRV-associated CAP. To describe the clinical features of HRV-associated CAP in immunocompetent adults admitted to multiple medical centers in mainland China over a 2-year period. Methods A total of 383 patients admitted to hospitals for CAP were enrolled from 46 medical centers in mainland China between January 2013 and December 2014. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for viral detection and DNA-based quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assays for bacterial detection were implemented to all lower respiratory tract specimens obtained from the patients. Twenty-eight cases (28/383, 7.3%) revealed HRV-positive PCR results. Patients with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) HRV-positive PCR results (n=20) were further enrolled and divided into two groups depending on the status of bacterial co-infection (viral group, n=12; viral-Bacterial group, n=8). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were reviewed and compared in detail. Results Cases with HRV-infection were remarkably correlated with respiratory failure (14/20) and most of them (13/14) received mechanical ventilation. Fever (17/20), productive cough (15/20) and dyspnea (6/20) were common symptoms while flu-like symptoms were rarely observed in the cohort. Streptococcus pneumoniae (3/8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3/8) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2/8) were most frequently identified bacterium in the viral-bacterial group. Compared with the viral group, higher incidence of septic shock (3/8 vs. 1/12, P=0.255), longer ICU length of stay (LOS) (10.0 vs. 6.5 days, P=0.686), longer hospital LOS (18.5 vs. 13.0 days, P=0.208) and higher 28-day mortality (2/8 vs. 2/12, P=1) were observed in the Viral-Bacterial group, although without statistically significant difference. Conclusions HRV is a common etiology in CAP among China adults, especially in severe CAP. Clinicians should be vigilant considering of the poor outcome.

Artemisinin-containing combination therapies (ACTs) are the most effective antimalarials known. WHO recommends 7-day quinine therapy for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the first trimester despite the superior tolerability and efficacy of 3-day ACT regimens because artemisinins caused embryolethality and/or cardiovascular malformations at relatively low doses in rats, rabbits, and monkeys. The developmental toxicity of artesunate, artemether, and DHA were similar in rats but artesunate was embryotoxic at lower doses in rabbits (5 mg/kg/day) than artemether (no effect level = 25 mg/kg/day). In clinical studies in Africa, treatment with artemether-lumefantrine in the first trimester was observed to be highly efficacious and the miscarriage rate (≤3.1%) was similar to no antimalarial treatment (2.6%). When data from the first-trimester use of largely artesunate-based therapies in Thailand were pooled together, there was no difference in miscarriage rate compared to quinine. However, individually, artesunate-mefloquine was associated with a higher miscarriage rate (15/71 = 21%) compared to other artemisinin-based therapies including 7-day artesunate + clindamycin (2/50 = 4%) and quinine (92/842 = 11%). Thus, appropriate statistical comparisons of individual ACT groups are needed prior to assuming that they all have the same risk for developmental toxicity. Current limitations in the assessment of the safety of ACTs in the first trimester are a lack of exposures early in gestation (gestational weeks 6-7), limited postnatal evaluation for cardiovascular malformations, and the pooling of all ACTs for the assessment of risk.","Clark, Robert L",Birth defects research,37,16

Although stress is one of the most commonly reported triggers of binge eating in individuals with BED, there has been little work examining the stress response specifically in individuals with the disorder. In this review, we examine what is known about how individuals with BED respond to acute stressors. A systematic literature search identified 14 relevant articles that report on the effects of experimentally induced stress on objective measures. Dependent measures that have been examined include changes in the levels of hormones such as cortisol and ghrelin, cardiovascular function, ad libitum food intake and eating rate. In this review, we describe the published findings and discuss their implications in the context of the wider literature. Overall, we found partial evidence that BED is associated with a heightened response to stress. Given the inconsistencies between studies, we suggest that reported differences between individuals with and without BED might be driven by factors that are correlated with, but not specific to, BED. We suggest that two priorities for this research area are to identify factors that modulate the stress response in individuals with BED, and to address the underrepresentation of males in this literature.","Naish, Katherine R; Laliberte, Michele; MacKillop, James; Balodis, Iris M",The European journal of neuroscience,37,1

We evaluated the diagnostic yield of RT-PCR assays and measured the effect of rapid reporting on patient care. METHODS In a controlled clinical trial, nasal wash specimens were obtained from patients <12 years of age with suspected acute respiratory infections. In addition to the standard hospital protocol, RT-PCR assays for 17 pathogens were performed. The RT-PCR results were communicated to the clinicians within 12 to 36 hours in the intervention group and after 4 weeks in the control group. RESULTS A total of 583 patients were included (mean age: 8.1 months [range: 0-107.5 months]): 298 in the intervention group and 285 in the control group. Eighty-two percent of nasal wash specimens tested positive for ≥1 pathogen. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently encountered (55%) pathogen. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to hospital admissions (intervention group: 223 admissions; control group: 211 admissions; P = .825), length of hospital stay (mean ± SD: 3.68 ± 2.68 days [intervention group] and 3.96 ± 2.67 days [control group]; P = .178), or duration of antibiotic use (mean ± SD: 6.52 ± 2.15 days [intervention group] and 6.97 ± 2.86 days [control group]; P = .490), when antibiotic treatment had been initiated. CONCLUSIONS RT-PCR testing has a high yield of viral diagnoses, but rapid communication does not lead to decreases in hospital admissions, shorter hospital stays, or less antibiotic use for children with acute respiratory infections.","Wishaupt, Jérôme O; Russcher, Anne; Smeets, Leo C; Versteegh, Florens G A; Hartwig, Nico G",Pediatrics,37,1

The data obtained from the newly tested compounds expanded the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of the thiazinoquinone scaffold, indicating that antiplasmodial activity is not affected by the inductive effect but rather by the resonance effect of the introduced group at the para position of the benzyl substituent. Indeed, the current survey was based on the evaluation of antiparasitic usefulness as well as the selectivity on mammalian cells of the tested p-benzyl-substituted thiazinoquinones, upgrading the knowledge about the active thiazinoquinone scaffold.","Casertano, Marcello; Menna, Marialuisa; Fattorusso, Caterina; Basilico, Nicoletta; Parapini, Silvia; Persico, Marco; Imperatore, Concetta",Molecules,37,11

The present trial was aimed at evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) in comparison with manual control across multiple centers in India. METHODS Adult patients scheduled for major surgical procedures of an expected duration of 1 to 3 hours were randomized across 6 sites into 2 groups: a CLADS group and a manual group. In the manual control group, propofol infusion was titrated manually by the attending anesthesiologist to a BIS of 50 during induction and maintenance. Analgesia was maintained with fentanyl infusion and nitrous oxide in both groups. In the CLADS group, both induction and maintenance of anesthesia were performed automatically using CLADS. The primary outcome measure was the performance of the system as assessed by the percentage of total anesthesia time BIS remained ±10 of target BIS. The secondary outcome measures were a percentage of anesthesia-time heart rate and mean arterial pressure within 25% of the baseline, median absolute performance error, wobble, and global score. Wobble indicates intraindividual variability in the control of BIS, and global score reflects the overall performance; lower values indicate superior performance for both parameters. The performance parameters of the system also were compared among the participating sites. RESULTS Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. BIS was maintained within ±10 of target for significantly longer time in the CLADS group (81.4% ± 8.9 % of anesthesia duration) than in the manual group (55.34% ± 25%, P < 0.0001). The indices that assess performance were significantly better in the CLADS group than the manual group as follows: median absolute performance error was 10 (10, 12) (median [interquartile range]) in the CLADS group versus 18 (14, 24) in the manual group, P < 0.0001; wobble was 9 (8, 10) in CLADS group versus 10 (8, 14) in the manual group, P = 0.0009; and Global score, which reflects overall performance, was 24 (19, 30) in the CLADS group versus 51 (31, 99) in the manual group, P < 0.0001. The percentage of time heart rate was within 25% of the baseline was significantly greater in the CLADS group (heart rate of 95 [87, 99], median [interquartile range], in the CLADS group versus 90 [75, 98] in the manual group P = 0.0031). On comparison of data between the centers, the performance parameters did not differ significantly among the centers in the CLADS group (P = 0.94), but the parameters differed significantly among the centers in the manual group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our study in a multicenter setting proves the consistently better performance of automated anesthesia drug delivery compared with conventional manual control. This highlights an important advantage of an automated system for delivering standardized anesthesia, thereby overcoming differences in practices among anesthesiologists.","Puri, Goverdhan D; Mathew, Preethy J; Biswas, Indranil; Dutta, Amitabh; Sood, Jayashree; Gombar, Satinder; Palta, Sanjeev; Tsering, Morup; Gautam, P L; Jayant, Aveek; Arora, Inderjeet; Bajaj, Vishal; Punia, T S; Singh, Gurjit",Anesthesia and analgesia,37,26

AIMS This paper attempted to investigate the recognition and development potential of customized cosmetics focusing on inner beauty products through DTC (Direct to Customer) genetic testing in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS/METHODS The number of women included in the survey of consumers living in Seoul metropolitan city ranged from 40 to 60, and 380 women in Republic of Korea. Statistical processing of the data collected by the data analysis method is analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) WIN25.0 statistical package program through the process of data coding and data cleansing. RESULTS In this study, the DTC genetic test, single, and/or combination treatment for customized inner beauty products and customized cosmetics were compared and analyzed, respectively. Accordingly, in keeping with the rapidly changing market conditions, we sought to study customized inner beauty and customized cosmetics recognition and purchasing behavior through DTC genetic testing in the unexplored era after COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it was significantly more effective to use customized inner beauty and customized cosmetics after DTC genetic test (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION This study emphasizes that after the global COVID-19 pandemic worldwide that occurred after January 2020, the definition of health persistence, wellness, and well-dying associated with beauty and cosmetology is also evolving from the DTC genetic test. In our results, it was found for the first time that the intake of customized inner beauty preparations and the use of customized cosmetics would be more effective. In the above significant research results, it is believed that research on the combinational effect of customized inner beauty products and customized cosmetics is required in the global DTC genetic testing market.","Lee, Jinkyung; Kwon, Ki Han",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,37,12

We systematically reviewed the management of BCG-associated regional lymphadenitis and injection site abscess in immunocompetent individuals. METHODS Searches of Medline, Embase and PubMed were done until November 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that compared management strategies for complications of intradermal BCG vaccination were included. RESULTS Of 1338 individual articles, 15 met inclusion criteria. Six RCTs, 4 prospective and 4 retrospective cohort studies compared management in 1022 children with BCG-associated lymphadenitis. For nonsuppurative lymphadenitis, no antimicrobial was found to significantly impact on time to resolution or prevention of suppuration. For suppurative lymphadenitis, there was some evidence that needle aspiration shortens time to resolution and prevents sinus tract formation. Surgical excision (mainly offered for persistent suppurative lymphadenitis) generally had favorable outcome. Two cohort studies (including 1 aforementioned) compared management strategies in up to 36 children with BCG injection site abscess; one showed no difference in outcome in children treated with antibiotics and the other reported complete resolution without treatment. CONCLUSIONS Evidence does not support a role for antimicrobial therapy in the management of localized reactions to BCG vaccination in immunocompetent children. Needle aspiration may shorten the recovery period for BCG-associated suppurative lymphadenitis. BCG injection site abscess usually heals without treatment. However, studies are limited and cases are not well defined. Growing research into novel BCG applications provides opportunities to investigate optimal management strategies for adverse reactions in a prospective manner using active safety surveillance.","Villanueva, Paola; Pittet, Laure F; Curtis, Nigel",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,37,1

This study examines the impacts of HIV/AIDS and MSM news coverage on web search query in Hong Kong. METHODS Relevant news coverage about HIV/AIDS and MSM from January 1st, 2004 to December 31st, 2014 was obtained from the WiseNews databse. News trends were created by computing the number of relevant articles by type, topic, place of origin and sub-populations. We then obtained relevant search volumes from Google and analysed causality between news trends and Google Trends using Granger Causality test and orthogonal impulse function. RESULTS We found that editorial news has an impact on ""HIV"" Google searches on HIV, with the search term popularity peaking at an average of two weeks after the news are published. Similarly, editorial news has an impact on the frequency of ""AIDS"" searches two weeks after. MSM-related news trends have a more fluctuating impact on ""MSM"" Google searches, although the time lag varies anywhere from one week later to ten weeks later. CONCLUSIONS This infodemiological study shows that there is a positive impact of news trends on the online search behavior of HIV/AIDS or MSM-related issues for up to ten weeks after.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Approval was obtained from institutional review boards, research was in compliance with HIPAA protocol. The need to obtain informed consent was waived for retrospective review of patient records. The records of patients with biopsy-proved chondroblastoma who were treated with RF ablation at two academic centers from July 1995 to July 2007 were reviewed. RF ablation was performed with a single-tip electrode by using computed tomography for guidance. Lesion characteristics were determined from imaging studies obtained at the time of the procedure. Symptoms were assessed before and 1 day after the procedure. Longer-term follow-up was obtained from medical records. RESULTS Thirteen male and four female patients were treated (mean age, 17.3 years). The lesions were located in the proximal humerus (n = 7), proximal tibia (n = 4), proximal femur (n = 3), and distal femur (n = 3). The mean volume of the lesions was 2.46 mL. All patients reported relief of symptoms on postprocedure day 1. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 14 patients for whom longer-term (mean, 41.3 months; range, 4-134 months) follow-up was available, 12 had complete relief of symptoms with no need for medications and full return to all activities. The patient who had the largest lesion of the study required surgical intervention because of collapse of the articular surface in the treatment area. Residual viable tumor was found at surgery. Another patient experienced mechanical problems that were thought to be unrelated to the RF ablation and was rendered pain-free after subsequent surgical treatment. CONCLUSION Percutaneous RF ablation is an alternative to surgery for treatment of selected chondroblastomas. Larger lesions beneath weight-bearing surfaces should be approached with caution due to an increased risk of articular collapse and recurrence.","Rybak, Leon D; Rosenthal, Daniel I; Wittig, James C",Radiology,37,31

Here, the authors investigated the association between treatment method and long-term Medicare expenditures in elderly patients with aneurysmal SAH. METHODS The authors performed a cohort study of 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service claims data for elderly patients who had undergone treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms in the period from 2007 to 2012. To control for measured confounding, the authors used propensity score-adjusted multivariable regression analysis with mixed effects to account for clustering at the hospital referral region (HRR) level. An instrumental variable (regional rates of coiling) analysis was used to control for unmeasured confounding by creating pseudo-randomization on the treatment method. RESULTS During the study period, 3210 patients underwent treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and met the inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 1206 (37.6%) had surgical clipping and 2004 (62.4%) had endovascular coiling. The median total Medicare expenditures in the 1st year after admission for SAH were $113,000 (IQR $77,500-$182,000) for surgical clipping and $103,000 (IQR $72,900-$159,000) for endovascular coiling. When the authors adjusted for unmeasured confounders by using an instrumental variable analysis, clipping was associated with increased 1-year Medicare expenditures by $19,577 (95% CI $4492-$34,663). CONCLUSIONS In a cohort of Medicare patients with aneurysmal SAH, after controlling for unmeasured confounding, surgical clipping was associated with increased 1-year expenditures in comparison with endovascular coiling.","Bekelis, Kimon; Gottlieb, Daniel J; Su, Yin; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Lawton, Michael T; MacKenzie, Todd A",Journal of neurosurgery,37,7

Step 1 Preoperative Assessment If the posterior tibial artery is not palpable, obtain an angiogram to determine the vascular supply distal to the traumatic zone and to prepare for conversion to a composite free microvascular transfer. Step 2 Remove Provisional Implants Remove provisional stabilization implants and minimize surgery about the knee. Step 3 Develop the Flap The dissection about the tarsal tunnel is the critical portion of the operative technique. Step 4 Contour the Calcaneus Any deviation from perpendicular will translate to an axial deformity in the reconstructed limb. Step 5 Prepare the Proximal Part of the Tibia and Surrounding Tissues Retain viable soft tissues and bone, but resect the fibula obliquely. Step 6 Secure the Calcaneus to the Tibia Avoid varus and recurvatum malalignment. Step 7 Repair and Reconstruct the Soft Tissues The injured limb is routinely very swollen, and in some cases complete coverage requires split-thickness skin-grafting. Step 8 Postoperative Care and Rehabilitation As the initial reconstruction is sometimes extremely bulbous, continually advise the patient that the shape will improve dramatically over time with shrinkage of the limb. Results In our original study, ten men and four women with a mean age of 43.2 years (range, twenty-four to sixty-four years) underwent an osteocutaneous pedicle flap transfer with use of the ipsilateral foot for salvage to achieve a transtibial amputation level.

Particular characteristics make the differential diagnosis with the well recognised clinical patterns of diffuse alveolar damage, cryptogenic organising pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia. The lack of hyaline membranes, the presence of intra-alveolar fibrin, absence of noticeable eosinophils and patchy distribution suggests that AFOP define a distinct histological pattern. The authors describe the case of a woman diagnosed with AFOP after surgical lung biopsy, in association with primary biliary cirrhosis. The patient presented dyspnoea, fatigue, dry cough and thoracic pain. The CT scan showed bilateral patchy infiltrates predominantly in the lower lobes. Flexible bronchoscopy and subsidiary techniques were inconclusive and biopsy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery led to anatomopathological diagnosis of AFOP. The patient is having a good clinical response to prednisone.","Guimarães, Catarina; Sanches, Inês; Ferreira, Catarina",BMJ case reports,37,11

Our objective is to determine which therapeutic strategy - lateral lymph node dissection versus radiochemotherapy - offers the best overall and recurrence-free survivals for these patients. Methods and analysis We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming at determining the overall and recurrence-free survivals of patients with total mesorectum excision with and without lateral lymph node dissection, in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science will be searched from inception to the 16th of January 2019 for original studies written in English or in French including patients who benefited from lateral lymph node dissection for low rectal cancer and reporting overall survival for patients with and without lateral lymph node dissection. Hazard ratios of overall and recurrence-free survivals extracted from included studies will be combined and compared between patients with and without lateral lymph node dissection. Risk of bias will be assessed by using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.The systematic review and meta-analysis protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Ongoing Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with number CRD42019123181.

Methods: Using a sample of adults in the 1999 to 2016 National Health Interview Survey (N = 419,336), we examined changes in labor force and economic outcomes by mental health and physical disability status. We employed difference-in-differences analyses to determine whether the changes in these outcomes during and after the recession for each comparison group (those with moderate mental illness, serious psychiatric disability, or physical disability) were significantly different from the changes for persons with neither a mental illness nor a disability. Findings: While the recession impacted all groups, those with mental illnesses or physical disabilities were hardest hit. Persons with disabilities were disadvantaged on all outcomes at each period, but persons with mental illnesses were the most disadvantaged. Unemployment, poverty, and use of food stamps increased for all groups, but the increase was greatest for persons with mental health problems who also saw a more substantial decline in wage income. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The effects of the recession persist well after the recovery period. Practitioners should be aware that although most persons with mental illnesses want to work, they face significant barriers to employment. Following economic shocks such as those brought on by the current coronavirus pandemic, interventions should focus on people who are the most vulnerable, especially those with mental health problems. Renewed focus on employment for people with mental disorders is important.

This paper compares three survey instruments for the assessment of life in pregnancy/postpartum and investigates the effects of the timing of early-life stress for emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBD) of offspring during mid/late childhood and adolescence. METHODS Observational data were obtained from the European Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC-CZ), which included 4811 pregnancies in two Czech metropolitan areas. We used data collected between 1991 and 2010 at 20 weeks of pregnancy (T1), after delivery (T2), at 6 months postpartum (T3), and at child's age of 7 years (T4), 11 years (T5), 15 years (T6), and 18 years (T7). Life stress was assessed with (1) the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), (2) a stressful life events (SLE) count based on 42-item inventory, and (3) the SLE measure weighted by perceived stressfulness (PS). Each stress measure was administered at T1, T2, and T3. Child's EBD were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at T4, T5, T6, and T7. RESULTS Each stress measure independently predicted long-term EBD. The best data fit was obtained in a model combining EPDS and SLE. Effect sizes for SLEs decreased between the first half of pregnancy and postpartum, while the effect of EPDS increased. DISCUSSION SLE-based methods capture an aspect of perinatal stress not adequately assessed by EPDS. Combination of psychological distress measures and SLE-based measures is optimal in predicting EBD of the child. Stress measures based on SLE are suitable for early pregnancy, while self-reports of depressive symptoms may perform better in postpartum.","Štěpáníková, Irena; Baker, Elizabeth; Oates, Gabriela; Bienertova-Vasku, Julie; Klánová, Jana",Maternal and child health journal,37,31

Computer simulations of light transport, heat transfer, and thermal damage in tissue were performed, comparing transvaginal and transurethral approaches. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provided spatial distributions of absorbed photons in the tissue layers (vaginal wall, endopelvic fascia, and urethral wall). Optical properties (n,μa ,μs ,g) were assigned to each tissue at λ = 1064 nm. A 5-mm-diameter laser beam and incident power of 5 W for 15 seconds was used, based on previous experiments. MC output was converted into absorbed energy, serving as input for finite element heat transfer simulations of tissue temperatures over time. Convective heat transfer was simulated with contact probe cooling temperature set at 0°C. Variables used for thermal simulations (κ,c,ρ) were assigned to each tissue layer. MATLAB code was used for Arrhenius integral thermal damage calculations. A temperature matrix was constructed from ANSYS output, and finite sum was incorporated to approximate Arrhenius integral calculations. Tissue damage properties (Ea ,A) were used to compute Arrhenius sums. RESULTS For the transvaginal approach, 37% of energy was absorbed in the endopelvic fascia target layer with 0.8% deposited beyond it. Peak temperature was 71°C, the treatment zone was 0.8-mm-diameter, and 2.4 mm of the 2.7-mm-thick vaginal wall was preserved. For transurethral approach, 18% energy was absorbed in endopelvic fascia with 0.3% deposited beyond the layer. Peak temperature was 80°C, treatment zone was 2.0-mm-diameter, and 0.6 mm of 2.4-mm-thick urethral wall was preserved. CONCLUSIONS Computer simulations suggest that transvaginal approach is more feasible than transurethral approach. Lasers Surg.

METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 65 Japanese children (male, 25; female, 40; age <16 years) with new-onset type 1 diabetes. A GST was conducted within 1 month after diagnosis, when glucose toxicity improved. 1 to 2-hour postprandial serum C-peptide values were measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 120 months after diagnosis. RESULTS Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the cutoff values of peak serum C-peptide levels used to predict the complete destruction of β-cells at 3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis were all 0.20 ng/mL (area under the curve [AUC] 0.867, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.745-0.990; AUC 0.774, 95% CI 0.634-0.914; and AUC 0.804, 95% CI 0.695-0.914, respectively); the values at 24, 36, and 60 months were 0.69 ng/mL (AUC 0.828, 95% CI 0.721-0.936), 0.60 ng/mL (AUC 0.777, 95% CI 0.636-0.918), and 0.70 ng/mL (AUC 0.848, 95% CI 0.715-0.982), respectively. On multivariate analysis, peak serum C-peptide level on a GST, diabetic ketoacidosis, age and HbA1c level at diagnosis were associated with residual β-cell function over time. CONCLUSIONS Peak serum C-peptide levels on a GST conducted soon after diagnosis in Japanese children with type 1 diabetes could predict the time to decrease in postprandial serum C-peptide values to less than 0.20 ng/mL.

Although recently approved vaccines for COVID-19 are engendering hope, finding new ways to cure the viral pandemic is still a quest for researchers worldwide. Major pandemics in history have been of viral origin, such as SARS, MERS, H1NI, Spanish flu, and so on. A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved three siRNA products for human use that garner significant hope in siRNA therapeutics for coronaviruses. There have been some commentaries and communications addressing this area. We have summarized and illustrated the significance and the potential of the siRNA therapeutics available as of April 30, 2021 to combat the ongoing viral pandemic and the emerging new variants such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Numerous successful in vitro studies and several investigations to address the clinical application of siRNA therapeutics provide great hope in this field. This seminal Review describes the significance of siRNA-based therapy to treat diverse viral infections in addition to the current coronavirus challenge. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the patents approved for coronaviruses, the major challenges in siRNA therapy, and the potential approaches to address them, followed by innovation and prospects.","Sajid, Muhammad Imran; Moazzam, Muhammad; Cho, Yeseom; Kato, Shun; Xu, Ava; Way, J J; Lohan, Sandeep; Tiwari, Rakesh K",Molecular pharmaceutics,37,6

Impaired endometrial receptivity and ovulation disorders/anovulation are both important causes of PCOS-related infertility. However, change in endometrium has never received the same attention as ovulatory dysfunction. Besides, putting emphasis on endometrial function may be more realistic for PCOS-related infertility, given the wide use of assisted reproductive technology. The present review focuses on the disorders of endometrial receptivity of patients with PCOS, summarizes the changes of the indicators of endometrial receptivity including leukemia inhibitory factor, homeobox genes A, pinopodes, αvβ3-integrin, and intercellular junctions and also analyzes the possible mechanisms of decreased endometrial receptivity and its relationship with the main endocrine and metabolic disorders of PCOS such as hyperandrogenism, inflammation, insulin resistance, and obesity. Despite several biomarkers have been found to be associated with decreased endometrial receptivity in PCOS, the clinical relevance of these findings still awaits future clarification.","Jiang, Nan-Xing; Li, Xue-Lian",Reproductive sciences,37,23

However, there is much debate regarding the appropriate level of funding for health and care in the UK. In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 3·7% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection. COVID-19 has highlighted major issues in the capacity and resilience of the health and care system. We recommend an independent review to examine the precise amount of additional funds that are required to better equip the UK to withstand further acute shocks and major threats to health.","Charlesworth, Anita; Anderson, Michael; Donaldson, Cam; Johnson, Paul; Knapp, Martin; McGuire, Alistair; McKee, Martin; Mossialos, Elias; Smith, Peter; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael",Lancet,37,1

The trial was conducted to confirm the efficacy of Myrtol® in the treatment of acute bronchitis. METHODS Patients with acute bronchitis and without confounding co-morbidity or co-medication were randomly assigned to treatment with either Myrtol® 300 mg 4 times daily or matched placebo in double-blind, parallel-group fashion. Signs and symptoms were evaluated by the investigator at baseline and after 7, 10 and 14 days of treatment; intake of medication, wellbeing and symptoms were recorded daily by the patient in the patients' diaries. FINDINGS 413 patients were enrolled and randomised (Myrtol®: 202; Placebo: 211); 398 had at least one on-treatment efficacy evaluation (Myrtol®: 196; Placebo: 202). The mean change in coughing fits from D01 (baseline) to D07-D09 (after about one week treatment) was 62.1% (95% CI: 57.6-66.6%) and 49.8% (95% CI: 44.6-55.0%) for treatment with Myrtol® and placebo, respectively (p<0.0001). With Myrtol®, the median time to 50% reduction in coughing fits was statistically significantly shorter and there were more patients without day-time coughing fits; there also were statistically significantly less day-time coughing fits, less difficulty coughing up, less sleep disturbance due to night-time coughing; with Myrtol® there was less symptomatic impairment (composite bronchitis severity score and subscores) and significant more patients had a clinically satisfying response to the investigational treatment.Both treatments were generally well tolerated.

We built a set of tables that allowed us to classify the information in four main categories, namely the psychological impact of the pandemic, whether people follow or not official measures to protect themselves against the pandemic, psychological adherence considerations implied as mediators to respect official strategies, and relevant methodological characteristics of the pandemic research. Results show that there are significant impacts on the psychological behavior of people, social groups and organizations in several dimensions, namely emotion, cognition, behavior, mental health, organization and psychosocial factors. In addition, we found that certain social groups experienced a critical psychosocial impact likely due to the pandemic. Psychosocial factors affecting adherence were also identified, which allow us to better understand how health strategies are followed by the population.

In the summertime, however, the Japanese government has cautioned that some COVID-19 pandemic conditions may affect the risk to heatstroke. This study investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic setting affected heatstroke-related ambulance dispatches (HSAD). Daily HSAD data and relevant weather parameters from June to September from 2016 to 2020 of 47 prefectures in Japan were obtained from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) database. A binary variable representing COVID-19 impact was created, whereby years 2016 to 2019 were coded as 0, while 2020 as 1. We employed a two-stage analysis in elucidating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HSAD. Firstly, we regressed HSAD with the COVID-19 binary variable after adjusting for relevant covariates to obtain prefecture-specific effect estimates. Prefecture-specific estimates were subsequently pooled via random effects meta-analysis in generating the pooled estimate. Pooled Relative Risk (RR) of HSAD during the COVID-19 pandemic was 0.78 (95% Confidential Interval [CI], 0.75-0.82). We found an overall statistically significant decrease in HSAD risk during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Specifically, the decrease in the risk of HSAD may be linked to the COVID-19 precautionary measures such as stay-home request and availability of alternative consultation services, which may have decreased the direct exposure of the population to extreme heat.","Hatakeyama, Koya; Ota, Junko; Takahashi, Yoshiko; Kawamitsu, Saki; Seposo, Xerxes",The Science of the total environment,37,1

Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment. The current pandemic provides the opportunity to rapidly explore the advantages and limitations of these technologies in the care of individuals with SUD.","McDonnell, Amy; MacNeill, Courtney; Chapman, Brittany; Gilbertson, Nicole; Reinhardt, Megan; Carreiro, Stephanie",Journal of substance abuse treatment,37,1

Recent studies have shown that recognition of the spirochete is mediated by TLR2 and NOD2. The latter receptor has been associated with the induction of the intracellular degradation process called autophagy. The present study demonstrated for the first time the induction of autophagy by exposure to B. burgdorferi and that autophagy modulates the B. burgdorferi-dependent cytokine production. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with autophagy inhibitors showed an increased IL-1β and IL-6 production in response to the exposure of the spirochete, whereas TNFα production was unchanged. Autophagy induction against B. burgdorferi was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) because cells from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which are defective in ROS production, also produced elevated IL-1β. Further, the enhanced production of the proinflammatory cytokines was because of the elevated mRNA expression in the absence of autophagy. Our results thus demonstrate the induction of autophagy, which, in turn, modulates cytokine production by B. burgdorferi for the first time.","Buffen, Kathrin; Oosting, Marije; Mennens, Svenja; Anand, Paras K; Plantinga, Theo S; Sturm, Patrick; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; van der Meer, Jos W M; Xavier, Ramnik J; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi; Netea, Mihai G; Joosten, Leo A B",The Journal of biological chemistry,37,28

However, high levels of clinical evidence comparing laparoscopic vs open radical cystectomy (ORC) are lacking. METHODS A prospective randomised controlled clinical trial comparing LRC vs ORC in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Thirty-five patients were eligible for final analysis in each group. RESULTS The median follow-up was 26 months (range, 4-59 months) for laparoscopic vs 32 months (range, 6-60 months) for ORC. Significant differences were noted in operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), blood transfusion rate, analgesic requirement, and time to resumption of oral intake. No significant differences were noted in the length of hospital stay, complication rate, lymph node yield (14.1±6.3 for LRC and 15.2±5.9 for ORC), positive surgical margin rate, postoperative pathology, or recurrence rate (7 for LRC and 8 for ORC). The 5-year recurrence-free survival with laparoscopic vs ORC was 78.5% vs 70.9%, respectively (P=0.773). The overall survival with laparoscopic vs ORC was 73.8% vs 67.4%, respectively (P=0.511). CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that LRC is superior to ORC in perioperative outcomes, including EBL, blood transfusion rate, and analgesic requirement. We found no major difference in oncologic outcomes. The number of patients is too small to allow for a final conclusion.","Lin, T; Fan, X; Zhang, C; Xu, K; Liu, H; Zhang, J; Jiang, C; Huang, H; Han, J; Yao, Y; Xie, W; Dong, W; Bi, L; Huang, J",British journal of cancer,37,10

Successful disaster psychosocial planning and the institutionalizing of psychosocial response within emergency management require clearly-defined skill sets. This necessitates anticipating both the short- and long-term psychosocial implications of a disaster or health emergency (ie, pandemic) by developing effective and sustained working relationships among psychosocial providers, programs, and other planning partners. The following article outlines recommended competencies for psychosocial responders to enable communities and organizations to prepare for and effectively manage a disaster response. Competency-based models are founded on observable performance or behavioral indicators, attitudes, traits, or personalities related to effective performance in a specific role or job. After analyzing the literature regarding competency-based frameworks, a proposed competency framework that details 13 competency domains is suggested. Each domain describes a series of competencies and suggests behavioral indicators for each competency and, where relevant, associated training expectations. These domains have been organized under three distinct categories or types of competencies: general competency domains; disaster psychosocial intervention competency domains; and disaster psychosocial program leadership and coordination competency domains. Competencies do not replace job descriptions nor should they be confused with performance assessments. What they can do is update and revise job descriptions; orient existing and new employees to their disaster/emergency roles and responsibilities; target training needs; provide the basis for ongoing self-assessment by agencies and individuals as they evaluate their readiness to respond; and provide a job- or role-relevant basis for performance appraisal dimensions or standards and review discussions. Using a modular approach to psychosocial planning, service providers can improve their response capacity by utilizing differences in levels of expertise and training. The competencies outlined in this paper can thus be used to standardize expectations about levels of psychosocial support interventions. In addition this approach provides an adaptable framework that can be adjusted for various contexts.","Cox, Robin S; Danford, Taryn",Prehospital and disaster medicine,37,1

To address the underlying etiology, we examined postmortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers, a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-a accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific ""disease-related"" B cell populations. These data identify defective Bcl-6+TFH cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult.

However, toxicological and epidemiological studies focusing on the adverse effects of RCFs were still insufficient, particularly in China. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate comprehensively the associations between occupational exposure to RCFs and respiratory health effects among Chinese workers. We measured and calculated cumulative RCFexposure levels of RCFs workers from the biggest RCFs factory in China. In total, 430 RCF-exposed workers and 121 controls were enrolled in this study. Physical examinations of the respiratory system were performed and serum levels of biomarkers including Clara cell protein 16 (CC16), surfactant protein D (SP-D), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were determined among all subjects. RCF exposure workers showed a higher prevalence rate of respiratory symptoms (cough: 11.9%) and lower levels of small airways function indices (V50 %: 82.71 ± 20.01, maximal mid expiratory flow (MMEF)%: 81.08 ± 19.56) compared with the control group (cough: 5.0%, V50 %: 90.64 ± 24.36, MMEF%: 88.83 ± 24.22). RCFs workers showed higher levels of TGF-β1 (31.04 ng/mL) and 8-OHdG (130.72 ng/mL) and lower levels of CC16 (3.68 ng/mL) compared with the controls (TGF-β1: 26.63 ng/mL, 8-OHdG: 106.86 ng/mL, CC16: 5.65 ng/mL). After adjusting for covariates, cumulative RCF exposure levels showed significant positive associations with the levels of TGF-β1 and 8-OHdG and negative association with the level of CC16. Occupational RCF exposure could induce adverse respiratory health effects, including cough and small airways damage, which may correlate to the altered levels of lung damage markers (CC16 and TGF-β1) and oxidative markers (8-OHdG).","Gu, Yishuo; He, Wei; Wang, Yanhua; Chen, Juan; Wang, Hongfei; Gao, Panjun; Yang, Siwen; Zhu, Xiaojun; Ma, Wenjun; Li, Tao",Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,37,5

Timing of the nasal repair remains somewhat controversial. Some authors perform a combined nasal and lip repair in infancy while others advocate for a staged repair with the nasal component occurring later in childhood. Frequently, secondary repair is needed to address residual nasal deformities in early adulthood. Conchal cartilage has become increasingly popular as a source of cartilage for secondary reconstruction. Donor site morbidities include hematoma formation, scar formation, and wound healing complications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is 1 previous report of a full through-and-through conchal defect as a complication of auricular cartilage graft harvesting. The authors report an infrequently described iatrogenic conchal defect due to cartilage harvesting managed with a single-stage reconstruction using bookend flaps. METHODS A 19-year-old female with a history of unilateral cleft lip and palate repair underwent secondary rhinoplasty using conchal cartilage. A bolster dressing was applied to the conchal harvest site. The patient was unable to attend her postoperative clinic visit and was eventually seen 2 months postoperatively with the bolster still in place. A full-thickness conchal defect was present when the bolster was removed. RESULTS A pressure dressing such as a bolster is commonly used to prevent hematoma formation after conchal cartilage graft harvesting. This is routinely removed during the initial postoperative visit. Prolonged placement can result in donor site complications such as a full-thickness conchal defect. CONCLUSION A functional and aesthetic reconstruction of a full-thickness iatrogenic conchal defect was achieved with excellent results using a local posterior flap, and 2 anteriorly based bookend flaps for closure. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this report is the first to describe a single-stage reconstruction of an iatrogenic defect in the concha as a complication of conchal cartilage harvesting.","Mundra, Leela S; AlQattan, Husain T; Janette, Meghan G; Patete, Carissa; Thaller, Seth R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,37,1

The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of two recently proposed grading systems and to assess the association between grade and genotype in a cohort of sporadic MTC. DESIGN We identified 44 sporadic MTC. All available tumor slides were examined, and cases were assigned a grade based on either mitotic count and tumor necrosis or mitotic count, tumor necrosis, and Ki-67 proliferative index, as described in two recent studies. Additional clinicopathologic features and outcome information were obtained from the pathology reports and electronic medical records. Presence of RET and RAS mutations were determined either by direct sequencing or massively parallel sequencing. RESULTS Both grading systems were prognostic for progression-free survival and disease-specific survival on univariate analysis. There was no correlation between grade and mutation status. Specifically, neither RET nor high-risk RET mutations were enriched in high-grade tumors, as assessed by either grading scheme. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that grade is not correlated with RET/RAS mutation status, indicating that grade and genotype may give independent prognostic information.","Najdawi, Fedaa; Ahmadi, Sara; Capelletti, Marzia; Dong, Fei; Chau, Nicole G; Barletta, Justine A",Histopathology,37,24

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS This is a case series of patients from a U.S. healthcare system in New York City. All adult patients (≥ 18 yr) admitted to the hospital with positive coronavirus disease 2019 testing between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, who required mechanical ventilatory support were included. Patients who remained hospitalized were followed through May 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Renal replacement therapy included at least one session of dialysis, continued venovenous hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline characteristics, laboratory markers, 30-day in-hospital outcomes, ventilator days, and survival to discharge were included. Multivariate predictors for mortality and need for renal replacement therapy were identified. A total of 330 patients were included in this analysis and were most commonly greater than or equal to 70 years (40%), male (61%), Black or African American (41%), and Hispanic or Latino (38%). Renal replacement therapy was required in 101 patients (29%), most commonly among Blacks or African Americans (50%). Elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with renal replacement therapy, compared with the nondialysis cohort. Overall, 243 patients (74%) died and 56 (17%) were discharged from the hospital, of which 9 (3%) required renal replacement therapy. Male sex (odds ratio, 2.0; 1.1-3.5; p = 0.020), Black race (odds ratio, 1.8; 1.0-3.1; p = 0.453), and history of hypertension (odds ratio, 2.7; 1.3-5.4; p = 0.005) were predictors for requiring renal replacement therapy. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality included age greater than or equal to 60 years (odds ratio, 6.2; 3.0-13.0; p < 0.0001), male sex (odds ratio, 3.0; 1.4-6.4; p = 0.004), and body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m (odds ratio, 2.1; 1.0-4.4; p = 0.039). Concomitant renal failure in critical coronavirus disease 2019 was not a significant predictor of death (odds ratio, 2.3; 0.98-5.5; p = 0.057). CONCLUSIONS This case series concludes that respiratory failure conveys significant mortality risk in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and that survival with concomitant renal failure is rare.","Forest, Stephen J; Michler, Robert E; Skendelas, John P; DeRose, Joseph J; Friedmann, Patricia; Parides, Michael K; Forest, Stefanie K; Chauhan, Dhaval; Goldstein, Daniel J",Critical care medicine,37,1

Here we compare our open and minimally invasive Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy (MIE) experience. METHODS A prospective database of all oesophagectomies performed at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA between November 2007 and January 2011 was analysed. A total of 38 MIE and 76 open Ivor Lewis (OIE) oesophagectomies were performed for oesophageal carcinoma. Sixty-day surgical, oncological and postoperative outcomes were examined between the two groups. RESULTS Groups had similar demographics in terms of age, gender, tumour histology, clinical stage, preoperative comorbidities and neoadjuvant therapy. No difference was found with respect to adequacy of oncological resections. The median number of lymph nodes retrieved (OIE: 21, inter-quartile range (IQR): (16, 27) versus MIE: 19, IQR: (15, 28)), resection margins (OIE: 6.6% positive versus MIE: no positive margins) and 60-day mortality (OIE: 2.6% versus MIE: no deaths) were comparable. However, rates of pulmonary complications were significantly lower in the MIE group (OIE: 43.4 versus MIE: 2.6%, P < 0.001). Additionally, the median length of ICU and hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss and amount of intravenous fluids infused intraoperatively were also significantly decreased with MIE, while median operative times and the requirement for intraoperative blood transfusion were not significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified MIE as the only variable associated with a significant reduction in the rate of pulmonary complications in our study, while pre-existing pulmonary comborbidity was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS Open and MIE appear equivalent with regard to early oncological outcomes. A minimally invasive approach, however, appears to lead to a significant reduction in the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications. Length of ICU and hospital stay, as well as intraoperative blood loss and intravenous fluid requirements are also reduced in the setting of MIE. Long-term survival data will need to be followed closely. A large, multi-centred, randomized, controlled trial is warranted to confirm these results.","Sihag, Smita; Wright, Cameron D; Wain, John C; Gaissert, Henning A; Lanuti, Michael; Allan, James S; Mathisen, Douglas J; Morse, Christopher R",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,37,31

OBJECTIVE The aim was to evaluate the effectivity of a program of control and prevention of COVID-19 in an academic general hospital in Spain. METHODS We captured the number of COVID-19 cases and the type of contact that occurred in hospitalized patients and healthcare personnel (HCP). To evaluate the impact of the continuous use of a surgical mask among HCP, the number of patients with COVID-19 HAIs and accumulated incidence of HCP with COVID-19 was compared between the preintervention and intervention periods. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-two patients with COVID-19 have been admitted to the hospital. Seven of them had an HAI origin (6 in the preintervention period and 1 in the intervention period). One hundred forty-two HCP were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of them, 22 (15.5%) were attributed to healthcare (2 in the emergency department and none in the critical care departments), and 120 (84.5%) were attributed to social relations in the workplace or during their non-work-related personal interactions. The accumulated incidence during the preintervention period was 22.3 for every 1000 HCP and 8.2 for every 1000 HCP during the intervention period. The relative risk was 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.55) and the attributable risk was -0.014 (95% confidence interval, -0.020 to -0.009). CONCLUSIONS A program of control and prevention of HAIs complemented with the recommendation for the continuous use of a surgical mask in the workplace and social environments of HCP effectively decreased the risk of COVID-19 HAIs in admitted patients and HCP.","Gras-Valentí, Paula; Mora-Muriel, Juan G; Chico-Sánchez, Pablo; Algado-Sellés, Natividad; Soler-Molina, Victor M; Hernández-Maldonado, María; Lameiras-Azevedo, Ana S; Jiménez Sepúlveda, Natali J; Gómez Sotero, Isel L; Villanueva-Ruiz, César O; Barrenengoa-Sañudo, Julio; Fuster-Pérez, Marina; Cánovas-Jávega, Sandra; Cerezo-Milan, Patricia; Monerris-Palmer, Miranda; Llorens-Soriano, Pere; Merino-Lucas, Esperanza; Rodríguez-Diaz, Juan C; Gil-Carbonell, Joan; Sánchez-Martínez, Rosario; Pastor-Cesteros, Rogelio; Mena-Esquivias, Luis; Galiana-Ivars, Maria; Jaime-Sánchez, Francisco A; Margarit-Ferri, Cesar; Gonzalez-deDios, Javier; Lloret, German; García-Alonso, Miguel A; Sánchez-Vela, Pablo; Sánchez-Payá, José",Journal of patient safety,37,27

Instead, treatment recommendations are aimed at the alleviation of clinical signs and symptoms, especially the restoration of respiratory function, and at the inhibition of virus replication, assuming viral load is responsible for disease phenotype. Studies of highly pathogenic influenza in different animal models, especially nonhuman primates and ferrets, reproduce many of the key observations from clinical cases. Host-response kinetics reveal a delayed but broad activation of genes involved in the innate and acquired immune responses (innate responses produce inflammatory responses), which continue after the virus has been cleared and may contribute importantly to the clinical signs observed. Experimental animal models point to an important role for immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of highly pathogenic influenza. The use of these models to develop and validate therapeutic approaches is just beginning, but published studies reveal the importance of early treatment with antivirals and show the potential and limitations of approaches aimed at the host response.","Meunier, Isabelle; Pillet, Stéphane; Simonsen, J Neil; von Messling, Veronika",Critical care medicine,37,1

Method: A case report. Result: A 21-year-old woman presented with insidious painless, progressive, central scotoma of the right eye for 5 weeks. She was disease free for 9 years after she underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy for her mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of right ovary. She completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy regimen. On presentation, her visual acuity was counting finger in the right eye and 6/ 6 in the left eye. Both anterior segments were unremarkable. Fundus examination of the right eye showed multiple choroidal masses with the largest in the temporal to fovea. Generally, she was well. Her tumor markers were raised. Urgent Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed multiple distance metastases. She was referred to the gynecology team. She was scheduled for chemotherapy. However, she defaulted the treatment. 3 months after that, her general condition deteriorated. She developed bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis and massive right pleural effusion. She passed away due to that complication. Conclusion: Choroidal metastasis from primary ovary carcinoma is very rare.

No vaccine/therapeutic is currently licensed for humans. Human-to-human transmission was previously reported during outbreaks and NiV could be isolated from respiratory secretions, but the proportion of cases in Malaysia exhibiting respiratory symptoms was significantly lower than that in Bangladesh. Previously, we showed that primary human basal respiratory epithelial cells are susceptible to both NiV-Malaysia (M) and -Bangladesh (B) strains causing robust pro-inflammatory responses. However, the cells of the human respiratory epithelium that NiV targets are unknown and their role in NiV transmission and NiV-related lung pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized NiV infection of the human respiratory epithelium using a model of the human tracheal/bronchial (B-ALI) and small airway (S-ALI) epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interface. We show that NiV-M and NiV-B infect ciliated and secretory cells in B/S-ALI, and that infection of S-ALI, but not B-ALI, results in disruption of the epithelium integrity and host responses recruiting human immune cells. Interestingly, NiV-B replicated more efficiently in B-ALI than did NiV-M. These results suggest that the human tracheal/bronchial epithelium is favourable to NiV replication and shedding, while inducing a limited host response. Our data suggest that the small airways epithelium is prone to inflammation and lesions as well as constituting a point of virus entry into the pulmonary vasculature. The use of relevant models of the human respiratory tract, such as B/S-ALI, is critical for understanding NiV-related lung pathogenesis and identifying the underlying mechanisms allowing human-to-human transmission.","Escaffre, Olivier; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Vergara, Leoncio A; Wen, Julie W; Long, Dan; Rockx, Barry",The Journal of general virology,37,31

METHODS We enrolled 2207 children, aged <2 years, hospitalized with bronchiolitis at 16 sites during the winters of 2007 to 2010. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were obtained on all subjects, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to test NPA samples for 16 viruses. Inpatient apnea was ascertained by daily chart review, with outcome data in 2156 children (98%). Age was corrected for birth <37 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for inpatient apnea. RESULTS Inpatient apnea was identified in 108 children (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4%-6%). Statistically significant, independent predictors of inpatient apnea included: corrected ages of <2 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 9.67) and 2 to 8 weeks (OR 4.72), compared with age ≥ 6 months; birth weight <2.3 kg (5 pounds; OR 2.15), compared with ≥ 3.2 kg (7 pounds); caretaker report of previous apnea during this bronchiolitis episode (OR 3.63); preadmission respiratory rates of <30 (OR 4.05), 30 to 39 (OR 2.35) and >70 (OR 2.26), compared with 40 to 49; and having a preadmission room air oxygen saturation <90% (OR 1.60). Apnea risk was similar across the major viral pathogens. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective, multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, inpatient apnea was associated with younger corrected age, lower birth weight, history of apnea, and preadmission clinical factors including low or high respiratory rates and low room air oxygen saturation. Several bronchiolitis pathogens were associated with apnea, with similar apnea risk across the major viral pathogens.","Schroeder, Alan R; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Stevenson, Michelle; Macias, Charles G; Fisher, Erin Stucky; Barcega, Besh; Sullivan, Ashley F; Espinola, Janice A; Piedra, Pedro A; Camargo, Carlos A",Pediatrics,37,17

Recent clinical reports describing the success of lightweight, macroporous synthetic meshes in contaminated ventral hernia repairs have led some surgeons to challenge the belief that synthetics are contraindicated in contaminated fields. We aimed to determine whether a frequently used biologic mesh (Strattice(TM)) is more resistant to bacterial colonization than macroporous synthetic mesh (Parietex(TM) Progrip(TM)) after inoculation with two common pathogens. METHODS Rats (n = 48) were implanted subcutaneously with Strattice(TM) or Progrip(TM). Meshes were inoculated with sterile saline or a suspension containing 10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli prior to wound closure (n = 8 per subgroup). Meshes were explanted at 4 weeks and underwent microbiologic and histologic analyses. RESULTS Progrip(TM) demonstrated superior bacterial clearance compared to Strattice(TM) (E. coli, 88 vs. 17% clearance, p = 0.03; S. aureus, 75 vs. 50%, p = 0.61; combined bacterial strains, 81 vs. 36%, p = 0.02; respectively). In the Strattice(TM) group, severely degraded meshes were observed in 100% of animals inoculated with E. coli (but 0% inoculated with S. aureus). In contrast, all Progrip(TM) meshes remained intact regardless of inoculum. Scores for neovascularization were higher in the synthetic group irrespective of contamination (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Biologic meshes may not be more resistant to bacterial colonization than reduced-weight synthetics, and their resistance may differ in response to different pathogens. The routine use of biologics in contaminated ventral hernia repair should be questioned, particularly in the presence of E. coli.","Cole, William C; Balent, Eric M; Masella, Pamela C; Kajiura, Lauren N; Matsumoto, Karen W; Pierce, Lisa M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,37,31

Surveying emergency department (ED) staff is a straightforward method for investigating risks, identifying solutions and evaluating interventions. This study's aim was to validate an ED safety questionnaire specifically for use in the UK and provide an overview of safety culture and risks. METHODS An ED safety questionnaire developed in the USA was modified then validated using 33 RCEM (Royal College of Emergency Medicine) patient safety leads (calculating content validity index). The resulting 39 multiple-choice questionnaire was used in a multicentre survey. 110 participants were randomly selected from each site. A minimum 40% response rate per site reduced non-response bias. Cronbach's alpha was calculated across five categories as an estimate of reliability. Simple descriptive statistics were used to identify risks or good practice. χ2 test compared individual sites' results with national results to highlight outlier questions (ie, the department's strengths and weaknesses). χ2 was also used to identify significant differences between responses from nurses and doctors. RESULTS 1060 participants were recruited across 18 sites. Cronbach's alpha was adequate (0.65 to 0.8). Analysis highlighted risks posed by interruptions, negative effects of targets, deficient mental healthcare (especially compared with critical care) and ED crowding. The study also revealed encouraging safety culture, such as effective doctor-nurse communication, and identified sites that were positive outliers overall or for specific questions. Comparing doctors and nurses' responses suggests additional support is needed for nursing staff. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the first step towards assessing ED safety culture and describing risks in the UK. Identifying outlier sites provides opportunities to learn from excellence. Repeat application of the survey will enable monitoring of safety interventions on a local and national level.","Flowerdew, Lynsey; Tipping, Michelle",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,37,25

Pre-analytical determinants, such as sampling procedures, time and temperature storage conditions, might impact on the end result. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of sampling procedures, time and temperature of the primary nasopharyngeal swabs storage on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results. Methods Each nasopharyngeal swab obtained from 10 hospitalized patients for COVID-19 was subdivided in 15 aliquots: five were kept at room temperature; five were refrigerated (+4 °C); five were immediately mixed with the extraction buffer and refrigerated at +4 °C. Every day and for 5 days, one aliquot per condition was analyzed (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 gene E and RNaseP and threshold cycles (Ct) compared. To evaluate manual sampling, 70 nasopharyngeal swabs were sampled twice by two different operators and analyzed separately one from the other. Results A total of 6/10 swabs were SARS-CoV-2 positive. No significant time or storage-dependent variations were observed in SARS-CoV-2 Ct. Re-sampling of swabs with SARS-CoV-2 Ct lower than 33 resulted in highly reproducible results (CV=2.9%), while a high variability was observed when Ct values were higher than 33 (CV=10.3%). Conclusions This study demonstrates that time and temperature of nasopharyngeal swabs storage do not significantly impact on results reproducibility. However, swabs sampling is a critical step, and especially in case of low viral load, might be a potential source of diagnostic errors.","Basso, Daniela; Aita, Ada; Navaglia, Filippo; Franchin, Elisa; Fioretto, Paola; Moz, Stefania; Bozzato, Dania; Zambon, Carlo-Federico; Martin, Barbara; Dal Prà, Chiara; Crisanti, Andrea; Plebani, Mario",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,37,31

We studied the genomic profile of 52 treatment-naïve CLL patients. Methods Genetic analysis was performed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using the SALSA P038 Probemix (MRC Holland, Amsterdam), which contains probes for 2p (MYCN,ALK,REL), 6q, 8p (TNFRSF10A/B), 8q (EIF3H,MYC), 9p21(CDKN2A/B), 10q (PTEN), 11q (ATM, RDX, PPP2R1B, CADM1), chromosome 12, 13q14 (RB1, DLEU1/2/7, KCNRG, MIR15A), 14q, 17p (TP53) and chromosome 19, and for NOTCH17541-7542delCT, SF3B1K700E, and MYD88L265P mutations. Results The median age was 65 years (male:female=2:1). The median hemoglobin, total leukocyte, and platelet counts were 12.4 g/dL, 57.7×109/L, and 176.5×109/L, respectively. At least one genetic abnormality was observed in 34 (65%) patients. The most common abnormality was del(13q14) (deleted DLEU2 and DLEU1/RB1 genes), which was observed in 22 (42%) cases, followed by trisomy 12 [7 (13%) cases]. Del(11q) (deleted ATM, RDX11/PPP2R1B-4) and del(17p) (deleted TP53) were present in 5 (10%) and 2 (4%) cases, respectively. 19p13.2 (CDKN2D-2) amplification and NOTCH1 mutation were found in one case each. Conclusion Genetic abnormalities are commonly (65%) observed in CLL patients. Del(13q), which is associated with DLEU2 and DLEU1/RB1 gene deletion, was the most common. Compared with other abnormalities, del(11q) and del(17p) patients presented with cytopenia and higher Binet stage, while those with del(13q14) had a longer time to first treatment.","Naseem, Shano; Ks, Vishrut; Varma, Neelam; Malhotra, Pankaj",Blood research,37,4

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 100 cats evaluated at an open-admission municipal animal shelter in Florida. PROCEDURES Fecal samples collected within 24 hours after admission from 50 cats with normal feces and 50 cats with diarrhea were tested by fecal flotation, antigen testing, PCR assay, and electron microscopy for selected enteropathogens. RESULTS 12 enteropathogens were identified. Cats with diarrhea were no more likely to be infected with ≥ 1 (84%) enteropathogens than were cats with normal feces (84%). Only feline coronavirus was significantly more prevalent in cats with diarrhea (58%) than in cats with normal feces (36%). Other enteropathogens identified in cats with and without diarrhea included Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A (42% and 50%, respectively), Cryptosporidium spp (10% and 20%, respectively), Giardia spp (20% and 8%, respectively), Cystoisospora spp (14% and 10%, respectively), hookworms (10% and 18%, respectively), ascarids (6% and 16%, respectively), Salmonella spp (6% and 4%, respectively), astrovirus (8% and 2%, respectively), feline panleukopenia virus (4% and 4%, respectively), calicivirus (0% and 2%, respectively), and Spirometra spp (0% and 2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In the present study, cats entered the shelter with a variety of enteropathogens, many of which are pathogenic or zoonotic. Most infections were not associated with diarrhea or any specific risk factors such as signalment, source, or body condition, making it difficult to predict which cats were most likely to be infected. It is not possible to test all shelter cats for all possible infections, so practical guidelines should be developed to treat routinely for the most common and important enteropathogens.","Sabshin, Stephanie J; Levy, Julie K; Tupler, Tiffany; Tucker, Sylvia J; Greiner, Ellis C; Leutenegger, Christian M",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,37,12

METHODS Patients were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Demographic data, tumor types, and the perioperative outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In a 10-year period, 75 patients (female, n = 44; male, n = 31; median age, 53 years [range, 9-84 years]) were identified. The majority of patients had pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (n = 39, 52%) and cystic neoplasms (n = 23, 31%) with a median tumor size of 17 (3-60) mm. Nineteen (25.3%) patients underwent enucleation (robotic, n = 11; laparoscopic, n = 8) and 56 (74.7%) patients underwent distal pancreatic resection (robotic, n = 24; laparoscopic, n = 32), of those 48 (85%) underwent spleen-preserving procedures. Eight (10.7%) procedures had to be converted to open surgery. The rate of vessel preservation in distal pancreatectomy was significantly higher in robotic-assisted procedures (62.5% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.01). Twenty-six (34.6%) patients experienced postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade > 3). Twenty (26.7%) patients developed a pancreatic fistula type B. There was no mortality. After a median follow-up period of 58 months (range 2-120 months), one patient (1.3%) developed local recurrence (glucagonoma) after enucleation, which was treated with a Whipple procedure. CONCLUSION The robotic approach is comparably safe, but increases the rate of splenic vessel preservation and reduces the risk of conversion to open surgery.","Najafi, Nawid; Mintziras, I; Wiese, D; Albers, M B; Maurer, E; Bartsch, D K",Surgery today,37,11

DATA SOURCES Major databases (PubMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), systematic snowballing, and trial registries were screened from the inception dates until September 2017. Methods and Study Selection Comparative studies involving reproductive-aged women undergoing chemotherapy with or without coadministration of GnRHa were included. Spontaneous menstrual resumption was assessed as a main outcome. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA 14.2 statistical software. Effect estimates were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS The literature search yielded 25 436 citations and 84 papers were assessed in full text. Eighteen studies (11 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 7 cohort studies) published between 1987 and 2015 were included in the analysis, revealing a significant protective effect of GnRHa (n = 1043; RR:1.38; 95% CI: 1.18-1.63) although with high heterogeneity (I2 = 83.3%). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant benefit of GnRHa cotreatment both in RCTs and in cohort studies. Statistical significance was found in all subgroups by the underlying disease, that is, hematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and breast cancer. Sensitivity analyses in GnRH agonist-treated patients, in patients younger than 40 years old, and in patients without supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy also revealed a significant benefit of GnRHa cotreatment. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that concurrent GnRHa administration is an effective method to decrease gonadotoxicity of alkylating agents. The presence of low-quality evidence favoring gonadoprotective effect requires a strong recommendation for offering GnRHa coadministration to young women who are to undergo gonadotoxic chemotherapy. Capsule: The present systematic review and meta-analysis shows a significant gonadoprotective effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs in women treated with alkylating agents.","Sofiyeva, Nigar; Siepmann, Timo; Barlinn, Kristian; Seli, Emre; Ata, Baris",Reproductive sciences,37,1

The objective of this study was to determine the antiviral effect of NO, produced in response to in ovo delivery of CpG DNA, against avian influenza virus (AIV) infection. We found that when CpG DNA is delivered at embryo day (ED)18 in ovo and subsequently challenged with H4N6 AIV at ED19 pre-hatch and day 1 post-hatching, CpG DNA reduces H4N6 AIV replication associated with enhanced NO production and macrophage recruitment in lungs. In vitro, we showed that NO originating from macrophages is capable of eliciting an antiviral response against H4N6 AIV infection. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of CpG DNA-mediated antiviral response, particularly against AIV infection in avian species.","Abdul-Cader, Mohamed Sarjoon; Ahmed-Hassan, Hanaa; Amarasinghe, Aruna; Nagy, Eva; Sharif, Shayan; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal",The Journal of general virology,37,1

METHODS Data was analysed from the Chinese National Transgender Survey in 2017; the survey was distributed through community-based organizations to transgender adolescents and adults residing in China, with representation from all 32 provinces and autonomous regions. A total of 1293 youth that self-identified as transgender or gender queer completed the study. Measures covered psychopathological symptoms including depression, anxiety, risk of suicideand self-harm. Parental psychological abuse was assessed in terms of neglect and avoidance, force to change, and verbal insults. Both the edges and centralities were computed via network analysis, and the network properties were then compared among the three gender minority subgroups. In addition, linear regression was adopted to test the predictive ability of node centrality for low self-esteem. RESULTS Descriptive analysis revealed that among the three subgroups, transgender women had more severe psychopathological symptoms and reported the most psychological abuse. Network analysis revealed that the risk of suicide and self-harm was directly connected with one type of parental psychological abuse (""neglect and avoidance""). Node centrality was significantly associated with the predicting value of the nodes on low self-esteem (r2 = 0.25, 0.17, 0.31) among all three gender minority subgroups. CONCLUSIONS The distinctive core psychopathological symptoms, within the networks of the gender minority subgroups, revealed specific symptoms across each group. The significant association between node centrality and low self-esteem indicated the extent of parental psychological abuse. Parental psychological abuse directed towards gender minority youth should be recognized as a form of family cold violence. It is recommended that schools and local communities should support early intervention to improve psychological well-being.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Ma, Zhihao; Wilson, Amanda; Hu, Zhishan; Ying, Xin; Han, Meng; Cui, Zaixu; Chen, Runsen",BMC medicine,37,24

The UK Standards provide a benchmark which researchers should aim to achieve, yet its implementation continues to be a step wise iterative process of change management. A recent evaluation by a regional research group has suggested that our understanding of PI is enhanced through reflection on the UK Standards. We report on the utility of PI in the design, conduct and dissemination of the HIDDen study, a national, multicentre clinical study based across three UK centres. METHODS A retrospective review of PI within the HIDDen study was conducted using field notes taken by the lead author from interactions throughout their involvement as a lay representative on the study. Key members of the HIDDen study were interviewed and data analysed to explore adherence to the UK Standards. RESULTS There was universal support for PI across the study management group with genuine inclusivity of lay members of the committee. All six of the UK Standards were met to varying degrees. The greatest opportunities lay in 'working together' and 'support and learning'. There were challenges meeting 'governance' with evidence of participation in decision making but less evidence of opportunities in management, regulation, leadership. CONCLUSION This study concurs with previous research supporting the utility of the Standards in the conduct and evaluation of PI in clinical research. To our knowledge this is the first multi-national study to be evaluated against the UK Standards.","Seddon, Kathy; Elliott, Jim; Johnson, Miriam; White, Clare; Watson, Max; Nelson, Annmarie; Noble, Simon",Research involvement and engagement,37,33

METHODS Data on open surgical revascularisation and peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) of symptomatic PAOD from 2010 to 2017 were collected from population based administrative and registry data from 11 countries. Differences in age, sex, indication, and invasive treatment modality were analysed. RESULTS Data from 11 countries covering 671 million inhabitants and 1 164 497 hospitalisations (40% women, mean age 72 years, 49% with intermittent claudication, 54% treated with PVI) in Europe (including Russia), North America, Australia, and New Zealand were included. Patient selection and treatment modality varied widely for the proportion of female patients (23% in Portugal and 46% in Sweden), the proportion of patients with claudication (6% in Italy and 69% in Russia), patients' mean age (70 years in the USA and 76 years in Italy), the proportion of octogenarians (8% in Russia and 33% in Sweden), and the proportion of PVI (24% in Russia and 88% in Italy). Numerous differences between females and males were observed in regard to patient age (72 vs. 70 years), the proportion of octogenarians (28% vs. 15%), proportion of patients with claudication (45% vs. 51%), proportion of PVI (57% vs. 51%), and length of hospital stay (7 days vs. 6 days).

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Academic medical center. PATIENTS A total of 1,200 patients with acoustic neuromas presented to our institution from 2005 to 2018. Of these, 196 patients underwent surgical resection via a retrosigmoid approach. INTERVENTION At our institution, internal auditory canal (IAC) reconstruction following a retrosigmoid approach was performed with bone wax and muscle plug or Norian hydroxyapatite bone cement from 2005 to 2013. Starting in 2014, a newer model of bone cement, Cranios hydroxyapatite, was used exclusively for reconstruction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of CSF leak were evaluated across different methods of IAC reconstruction and types of bone cement. Patients whose leaks were attributable to the craniectomy site were excluded from analysis. RESULTS The postoperative CSF leak rate among patients who did not receive bone cement for IAC reconstruction was 15.6% (n.5). The leak rate amongst patients who received Norian bone cement was 6.3% (n.4). After introduction of Cranios bone cement, the total leak rate decreased to 1% (n.1). Compared with all other types of closure, Cranios had a significantly reduced rate of postoperative CSF leak (p < 0.005). The leak rate following Cranios versus Norian was also significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Leak rate was not affected by tumor size (p.0.30) or age (p.0.43). CONCLUSION CSF leak rate following acoustic neuroma resection was significantly reduced by introduction of Cranios hydroxyapatite bone cement.","Hwa, Tiffany Peng; Luu, Neil; Henry, Laura E; Naples, James G; Kaufman, Adam C; Brant, Jason A; Lee, John Y K; Ruckenstein, Michael J; Bigelow, Douglas C","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",37,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 13 closed-ended and open-ended questions was sent to all students (n = 97) at the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the University of Malta. Emergent themes from open-ended questions were identified and tallied. Since data were classified as categorical ranks, nonparametric tests were used to compare variables among the different courses, years of study, preclinical/clinical students, and gender categories. RESULTS Dental technology students were significantly less stressed about contracting COVID-19 (P = 0.005) and regarding lack of preparation due to inability to physically go to the library (P = 0.019). Female students reported significantly more anxiety for the following factors: ""feeling anxious all the time"" (P = 0.033), ""worried about contracting COVID-19'"" (P = 0.012), ""worried that a family member may contract COVID-19'"" (P = 0.048), ""more anxious about exams this year because of the challenges we are facing"" (P = 0.029), and ""concern about losing manual dexterity skills"" (P = 0.038). Qualitative data gathered show considerable stress reported by students regarding changes in examination processes and formats and lack of timely communication. CONCLUSION Students were greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and this caused fear of losing their manual dexterity skills, anxiety related to its consequences on their long-term plans, and anxiety related to the examinations. Dental schools in turn should adapt rapidly and customize changes that are specific to the individual student cohort and their stage of training.","Agius, Anne-Marie; Gatt, Gabriella; Vento Zahra, Ethel; Busuttil, Adrienne; Gainza-Cirauqui, Maria Luisa; Cortes, Arthur R G; Attard, Nikolai J",Journal of dental education,37,19

Stent-assisted coiling (SAC) is associated with increased complications and requires dual antiplatelet therapy. OBJECTIVE To compare treatment of unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms with a dual-microcatheter technique (DMT) versus SAC. METHODS Between 2006 and 2011, 100 patients with unruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with DMT and 160 with SAC. Over time there was a significant decrease in the use of SAC and a corresponding increase in DMT. The investigators matched 60 patients treated with DMT blinded to outcome in a 1:2 fashion based on maximal aneurysm dome diameter with 120 patients treated with SAC. Outcomes were determined with conditional (matched) multivariate analysis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient or aneurysm characteristics between cohorts, including aneurysm diameter, neck width, or volume. Overall packing density and coil volume achieved was not significantly different between cohorts. There were higher rates of overall complications in those receiving SAC (19.2%) compared with DMT (5.0%; p=0.012), but no significant difference in major complications (8.3% vs 1.7%, respectively; p=0.103). At a mean follow-up of 27.0 ± 18.9 months, rates of retreatment did not differ between DMT (15.1%) and SAC (17.7%). Delayed in-stent stenosis occurred in five patients and in-stent thrombosis in four patients treated with SAC. There was no difference in favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin score 0-2) between those treated with DMT (90.6%) compared with SAC (91.2%). CONCLUSIONS DMT and SAC are effective endovascular approaches for unruptured, wide-necked aneurysms; however, DMT may result in less morbidity. Further long-term studies are necessary to determine the optimal indications for these treatment options.","Starke, Robert M; Durst, Christopher R; Evans, Avery; Ding, Dale; Raper, Daniel M S; Jensen, Mary E; Crowley, Richard W; Liu, Kenneth C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,37,29

Medical advances over the past three decades have resulted in increasing numbers of BHFS survivors. This retrospective review summarized local territory-wide experience and outcomes of BHFS patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Hong Kong. METHODS All BHFS patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT in Hong Kong, either in one of the two former pediatric transplant centers (Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital) on or before 2019 or in the single territory-wide pediatric transplant center (Hong Kong Children's Hospital) since 2019, from January 1, 1996, till December 31, 2020, were included. Basic demographic data, perinatal history, transplant details, long-term outcomes, and morbidities were reviewed. RESULTS Total five allogeneic HSCT were performed in two males and three females at a median age of 22 months, which include one 8/8 matched-sibling bone marrow transplant, one 5/6 matched-sibling cord blood transplant with HLA-DR antigenic mismatch, two 12/12 matched-unrelated peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT), and one haploidentical PBSCT with TCRαβ/CD45RA depletion from maternal donor. Neutrophil and platelet engrafted (>20 × 109 /L) at a median of 15 and 22 days, respectively. All achieved near full donor chimerism at 1 month. All patients survived and remained transfusion-independent without significant morbidities with median follow-up duration of 10 years. CONCLUSION To conclude, local data demonstrated favorable outcome of allogeneic HSCT for BHFS patients, but sample number is small.

Carbyne, often called linear carbon, has a higher predicted gravimetric modulus and gravimetric strength than any other form of carbon, but possibly reacts under near-ambient conditions because of the extended sp1 hybridization. The successful fabrication of carbon nanotube wrapped single carbyne chain (Shi et al. Nat. Mater. 2016, 15, 634) suggests the possibility of carbyne's bulk production. Herein, we designed a type of carbon assembly that includes a possibly large array of carbyne chains confined within a single-walled nanotube sheath (nanotube wrapped carbynes, NTWCs), in which carbyne chains act as reinforcing building blocks, and the carbon nanotube sheath protects the multiple carbyne chains against chemical or topochemical reaction. We showed that NTWCs exhibit confinement-enhanced stabilities, even when they contain multiple neighboring carbyne chains. We developed a mechanics model for exploring the mechanical properties of NTWCs. On the basis of this model, the gravimetric modulus (and strength) of NTWCs was predicted to increase from 356.4 (50.25) to 977.2 GPa·g-1·cm3 (71.20 GPa·g-1·cm3) as the mass ratio of carbyne carbons to sheath carbons increases, which is supported by atomistic simulations. The highest calculated gravimetric modulus and strength of NTWCs are 174.2% and 41.7%, respectively, higher than those of either graphene or carbon nanotubes. The corresponding highest values of engineering modulus and strength of NTWCs with a density of 1.54 g·cm-3 are 1505 and 109.6 GPa, respectively. Hence, NTWCs are promising for uses in high-modulus, high-strength, lightweight composites.","Gao, Enlai; Li, Ruishan; Baughman, Ray H",ACS nano,37,9

Relationships between clinical and cognitive features of patients with HSP who had brain and cervical cord damage were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was approved by the local ethical committees on human studies, and written informed consent from all subjects was obtained prior to enrollment. Forty-four patients with HSP (20 genetically defined cases and 24 without genetic diagnosis) and 19 healthy control subjects underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluations. Patterns of GM atrophy and WM microstructural damage obtained by using structural and diffusion-tensor MR imaging were compared between groups. Cervical cord atrophy was also assessed by using an active surface method. Correlations between clinical, cognitive, and diffusion-tensor MR imaging measures were evaluated. RESULTS Clinical data showed that spastic paraplegia is accompanied by a number of other features, including sensory disturbances, and verbal and spatial memory deficits, not only in complicated HSP but also in pure HSP. MR imaging demonstrated a similar involvement of motor, association, and cerebellar WM pathways (P < .05, family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons) and cervical cord (P < .001) in patients with HSP relative to healthy control subjects, regardless of their clinical picture. The severity of WM damage correlated with the degree of spasticity (P < .05, family-wise error corrected) and cognitive impairment (r values, -0.39 to 0.51; P values, .001-.05) in both pure and complicated HSP. CONCLUSION The detection of a distributed pattern of central nervous system damage in patients with pure and complicated HSP suggests that the ""primary"" corticospinal tract involvement known to occur in these patients may be associated with a neurodegenerative process, which spreads out to extramotor regions, likely via anatomic connections. This observation is in line with emerging pieces of evidence that, independent of the clinical phenotype, there is a common neurodegenerative cascade shared by different neurologic disorders.","Agosta, Federica; Scarlato, Marina; Spinelli, Edoardo G; Canu, Elisa; Benedetti, Sara; Bassi, Maria Teresa; Casali, Carlo; Sessa, Maria; Copetti, Massimiliano; Pagani, Elisabetta; Comi, Giancarlo; Ferrari, Maurizio; Falini, Andrea; Filippi, Massimo",Radiology,37,1

METHODS A total of 133 consenting patients (98 female, 35 male; mean age, 45.6 ± 11.7 years) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 65 patients, 105 nerves), superior thyroid pole dissection was performed with no attempt to identify the EBSLN; in group 2 (n = 68 patients, 106 nerves), IONM was used to identify the EBSLN during surgery. EBSLN function was evaluated by intraoperative electromyography of the cricothyroid muscle. The EBSLN Voice Impairment Index-5 (VII-5) was conducted preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was the prevalence of EBSLN injury. The secondary outcomes were the identification rate of the EBSLN using IONM and changes in postoperative voice performance. RESULTS EBSLN injury was detected in eight (12.3%) patients and nine (8.6%) nerves in group 1 and in one (1.5%) patient and one (0.9%) nerve in group 2 (patients, p = 0.015; nerves, p = 0.010). IONM contributed significantly to visual (p < 0.001) and functional (p < 0.001) nerve identification in group 2. The VII-5 indicated more voice changes in group 1 than 2 at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.012, p = 0.015, and p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION IONM contributes to visual and functional identification of the EBSLN and decreases the rate of EBSLN injury during superior pole dissection. Routine use of IONM to identify the EBSLN will minimize the risk of injury during thyroidectomy.","Uludag, Mehmet; Aygun, Nurcihan; Kartal, Kinyas; Citgez, Bulent; Besler, Evren; Yetkin, Gurkan; Kaya, Cemal; Ozsahin, Hamdi; Mihmanli, Mehmet; Isgor, Adnan",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,37,5

The acute diabetes foot clinic is an important example of such a service. We explore the important lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic for managing high-acuity outpatient services through the context of the diabetic foot clinic. Learning can be divided into the following categories: remote and digital working, physical changes in service delivery, workforce challenges and post-pandemic preparedness. This learning is applicable to a wide range of high-acuity services during and following the pandemic.

Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is mainly transmitted by droplets either by direct or indirect contact. The duration of infectiousness of COVID-19 ranges from 1-2 days before and 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is often difficult to detect the signs and symptoms of infection and to implement timely intervention during the very early stage of infection. Thus, finding and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to contain this epidemic. Therefore, it is very important to wear masks, take personal precautions, and practice recommended social distancing to achieve source control and stop transmission. Taiwan has learned from its previous experience with the SARS epidemic and prepared for the potential of new disease outbreaks for at least 17 years. This helped the government to implement a multifaceted strategy in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Taiwan's effective response has made the country a model for pandemic response policy that has been appreciated internationally. This paper examines COVID-19 epidemic prevention from the perspective of infection control strategies. In Taiwan, hospital infection control, which is practiced nationwide, emphasizes the importance to epidemic prevention of collecting and tracking travel history, occupation, contact history, cluster (TOCC) information; practicing hand hygiene; promoting the correct use of personal protective equipment; and maintaining safe distances from others. Personal control measures are recognized as critical to providing a safe environment for patients and staff.","Huang, Wan-Tsuei; Chen, Yin-Yin",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,37,8

The virus first occurred in Wuhan, China, but the whole world is now struggling with the pandemic. Over 13 million confirmed cases and 571,000 deaths have been reported so far, and this number is growing. Older people, who constitute a notable proportion of the world population, are at an increased risk of infection because of altered immunity and chronic comorbidities. Thus, appropriate health care is necessary to control fatalities and spread of the disease in this specific population. The chapter provides an overview of diagnostic methods, laboratory and imaging findings, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 in aged people. Possible mechanisms behind the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly include immunosenescence and related impaired antiviral immunity, mature immunity and related hyper-inflammatory responses, comorbidities and their effects on the functioning of critical organs/systems, and the altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This evidence defines the herding behavior of COVID-19 in relation to ACE2 under the influence of immune dysregulation. Then, identifying the immunogenetic factors that affect the disease susceptibility and severity and as well as key inflammatory pathways that have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets needs to remain an active area of research.","Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,37,8

The integration of mental health workers into primary care has been proposed as one possible solution, but evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness of this approach is unclear. We reviewed the clinical and cost effectiveness of mental health workers colocated within primary care practices. DESIGN Systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES We searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and Global Health databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA All quantitative studies published before July 2019 were eligible for the review; participants of any age and gender were included. Studies did not need to report a certain outcome measure or comparator in order to be eligible. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted using a standardised table; however, pooled analysis proved unfeasible. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. RESULTS Fifteen studies from four countries were included. Mental health worker integration was associated with mental health benefits to varied populations, including minority groups and those with comorbid chronic diseases. Furthermore, the interventions were correlated with high patient satisfaction and increases in specialist mental health referrals among minority populations. However, there was insufficient evidence to suggest clinical outcomes were significantly different from usual general practitioner care. CONCLUSIONS While there appear to be some benefits associated with mental health worker integration in primary care practices, we found insufficient evidence to conclude that an onsite primary care mental health worker is significantly more clinically or cost effective when compared with usual general practitioner care. There should therefore be an increased emphasis on generating new evidence from clinical trials to better understand the benefits and effectiveness of mental health workers colocated within primary care practices.","Woods, Jean-Baptiste; Greenfield, Geva; Majeed, Azeem; Hayhoe, Benedict",BMJ open,37,1

In the case of DNA vaccines, this consists of plasmid DNA; however, the adjuvant element(s) as well as its intra- and inter-cellular innate immune signalling pathway(s) leading to the encoded antigen-specific T- and B-cell responses remain unclear. Here we demonstrate in vivo that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a non-canonical IkappaB kinase, mediates the adjuvant effect of DNA vaccines and is essential for its immunogenicity in mice. Plasmid-DNA-activated, TBK1-dependent signalling and the resultant type-I interferon receptor-mediated signalling was required for induction of antigen-specific B and T cells, which occurred even in the absence of innate immune signalling through a well known CpG DNA sensor-Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) or Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1, also known as DAI, which was recently reported as a potential B-form DNA sensor). Moreover, bone-marrow-transfer experiments revealed that TBK1-mediated signalling in haematopoietic cells was critical for the induction of antigen-specific B and CD4(+) T cells, whereas in non-haematopoietic cells TBK1 was required for CD8(+) T-cell induction. These data suggest that TBK1 is a key signalling molecule for DNA-vaccine-induced immunogenicity, by differentially controlling DNA-activated innate immune signalling through haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cells.","Ishii, Ken J; Kawagoe, Tatsukata; Koyama, Shohei; Matsui, Kosuke; Kumar, Himanshu; Kawai, Taro; Uematsu, Satoshi; Takeuchi, Osamu; Takeshita, Fumihiko; Coban, Cevayir; Akira, Shizuo",Nature,37,5

The home is a unique place where chronic disease management is often performed by informal caregivers, yet how caregivers make decisions about adopting a specific technology has not been thoroughly explored. This systematic scoping review mapped evidence on decision-making factors associated with technology adoption and use by caregivers of patients receiving care at home. We followed the recommendations developed by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched using both medical subject headings (MeSH terms) and key words. A total of six papers were included for data synthesis. Factors such as information, comprehension, motivation, time, perceived burden, and perceived caregiving competency were found to affect adoption of technology. There are other factors uniquely springing from the patient and technology, as well as shared issues between caregivers and patient, and caregivers and technology. Although some factors depend on technology type and patient diagnosis, there were some common factors across the research. Those factors can be carefully considered in referring technology use for caregivers.

European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines for Prostate Cancer underline the importance of screening, performed through PSA testing on all men with more than 50 years of age and before on men with risk factors. The diagnosis is still histopathologic, and it is done on the basis of the findings on biopsy samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fusion biopsy is a relatively new technique that allows the operator to perform the biopsies in office instead of the MRI gantry, without losing the detection capability of MRI. The T2-wighted images obtained during a previous mpMRI are merged with the real-time ones of the TRUS. RESULTS Fusion biopsy in comparison with the systematic standard biopsy has a better detection rate of clinically significant cancers and of any cancers. CONCLUSION EAU 2020 guidelines still do offer a list of indications of when the biopsy should be performed, but it still appeared to be overperformed. The aim of our study is to underline how, in accordance with the recent literature result, fusion biopsy has showed a better detection rate of any cancer and clinically significant disease with a reduced numbers of samplings, and no substantial difference between the multiple software.","Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Di Meglio, Letizia; Petrillo, Mario; Arrichiello, Antonio; Pandolfi, Marco; Rodà, Giovanni Maria; Granata, Giuseppe; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Donat, Daniela; Paolucci, Aldo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,37,1

METHODS Thirty-two patients with severe obesity who were consecutively scheduled for LSG and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. LV global longitudinal strain (LGS), peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), and strain rates (S-Sr, E-Sr, and A-Sr) of the lateral and septal LA walls, and intra- and interatrial dyssynchrony periods for all subjects were evaluated using strain echocardiography. The measurements were repeated in patients 1 month after surgery. RESULTS LGS of the LV was significantly depressed in the patient group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). LA peak septal and lateral wall strain values were significantly lower in patients than in controls (both p values <0.001). LA intra- and interatrial dyssynchrony periods were longer in patients than in controls (p = 0.012 and p = 0.004, respectively). LGS significantly improved after LSG (p < 0.001). Significant reductions were noted in the LA antero-posterior diameter (p < 0.001), LA volume index (LAVI, p = 0.001), and in the mitral velocity to the early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus ratio (E/e' ratio, p = 0.046). The PALS of the septal and lateral LA walls significantly increased (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). S-Sr, E-Sr, and A-Sr values of the septal LA wall (p = 0.049, p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively) and the lateral LA wall (p = 0.009, p = 0.007, and p = 0.002, respectively) significantly improved postoperatively. Intra- and interatrial dyssynchrony significantly decreased (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Weight loss positively correlated with changes in LGS (R = 0.39, p = 0.039), LAVI (R = 0.39, p = 0.034), intra-atrial dyssynchrony (R = 0.45, p = 0.021), interatrial dyssynchrony (R = 0.42, p = 0.038), septal LA wall peak strain (R = 0.44, p = 0.027), lateral LA wall peak strain (R = 0.46, p = 0.017), septal LA wall A-Sr (R = 0.43, p = 0.028), and lateral LA wall A-Sr (R = 0.46, p = 0.019). The comparison of postoperative findings of the patients with controls revealed that the LA diameter, both LA volume and volume index (LAVI), E/e' ratio, S-Sr and E-Sr of both lateral and septal LA walls, intra- and interatrial LA dyssynchrony of the patient group became similar to the control group (all p value >0.05). Postoperative A-Sr values of both LA walls (both p value <0.001) were higher in patients than controls. CONCLUSION The benefits of LSG on LV and LA function may be observed even in the early postoperative phase. The resulting weight loss correlates with LV and LA reverse remodeling in severely obese patients.","Tuluce, Kamil; Kara, Cemal; Tuluce, Selcen Yakar; Cetin, Nurullah; Topaloglu, Caner; Bozkaya, Yasemin Turhan; Saklamaz, Ali; Cinar, Cahide Soydas; Ergene, Oktay",Obesity surgery,37,16

METHODS A ProModel-based simulation was developed based on historical data. Probabilistic distributions of operative time calculated and combined with an ACGME compliant call schedule. RESULTS For the advanced surgical cases modeled (cardiothoracic transplants), 80-hour violations were 6.07% and the minimum number of days off was violated 22.50%. There was a 36% chance of failure to fulfill any (either heart or lung) minimum case requirement despite adequate volume. CONCLUSIONS The variable nature of emergency cases inevitably leads to work hour violations under ACGME regulations. Unpredictable cases mandate higher operative volume to ensure achievement of adequate caseloads. Publically available simulation technology provides a valuable avenue to identify adequacy of case volumes for trainees in both the elective and emergency setting.","Obi, Andrea; Chung, Jennifer; Chen, Ryan; Lin, Wandi; Sun, Siyuan; Pozehl, William; Cohn, Amy M; Daskin, Mark S; Seagull, F Jacob; Reddy, Rishindra M",American journal of surgery,37,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS All experimental protocols were approved by our institutional animal experimentation committee. We intravenously injected 12 Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits with one of the 4 types of SPIO (0.8 mmol Fe/kg). Two other rabbits served as the control. The rabbits underwent in vivo contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before- and 5 days after these injections; excised aortae were subjected to in vitro MRI. In the in vivo and in vitro studies we assessed the signal intensity of the vessels at identical regions of interest (ROI) and calculated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For histologic assessment we evaluated the iron-positive regions in Prussian blue-stained specimens. RESULTS There were significant differences in iron-positive regions where M-USPIO>USPIO, M-SPIO>SPIO, USPIO>SPIO (p<0.05) but not between M-USPIO and M-SPIO. The difference between the pre- and post-injection SNR was significantly greater in rabbits treated with M-USPIO than USPIO and in rabbits injected with M-SPIO than SPIO (p<0.05). On in vitro MRI scans SNR tended to be lower in M-USPIO- and M-SPIO- than USPIO- and SPIO-treated rabbits (p<0.1). CONCLUSION Histologic and imaging analysis showed that mannan-coated SPIO and USPIO particles were taken up more readily by the atherosclerotic rabbit wall than uncoated SPIO and USPIO.","Tsuchiya, Keiko; Nitta, Norihisa; Sonoda, Akinaga; Otani, Hideji; Takahashi, Masashi; Murata, Kiyoshi; Shiomi, Masashi; Tabata, Yasuhiko; Nohara, Satoshi",European journal of radiology,37,1

METHODS Five databases were searched from inception to April 23, 2020 for randomized clinical trials comparing the failure rate of these materials. After duplicate study removal, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with the Cochrane tool, data synthesis was conducted, comparing all five tooth-coloured materials in pairs and computing the overall success rate for each one, respectively. RESULTS A total of 5615 articles were obtained by electronic and hand literature search. After the application of the eligibility criteria, ten RCTs were included in this systematic review and six RCTs for meta-analysis. Their risk of bias was assessed to be high to moderate. Due to the small number of RCTs comparing the five restorative materials in pairs investigated in the same study, only three MAs were available for heterogeneity assessment. These were: (1) between CO-RMGI (RR 1.04 [0.59, 1.84]; p = 0.88; I2 = 1%), (2) CR-CO (RR 1.12 [0.41, 3.02]; p = 0.83; I2 = 57%), and (3) between CR-RMGI (RR 1.10 [0.74, 1.63]; p = 0.65; I2 = 0%). No statistically significant differences were found between the two materials in all three comparisons. CONCLUSION CR, RMGI and CO presented no statistical differences. In comparison to other tooth-coloured materials, studies on GI were too few to allow recommendations about its use. More studies on HGVI are needed for evidence-based recommendations to be made. The evidence extracted from this meta-analysis was not strong enough (moderate), due to the small number of RCTs and the risk of bias ranging from high to moderate.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 62 patients [35 males and 27 females; mean age 55.8±12.7 (range: 27-81) years] were enrolled in the study. CE F-FDG PET/CT scanning included whole-body (early) and abdominal imaging (late) 1 and 2 h after intravenous F-FDG administration, respectively. SUVmax was calculated for primary tumors. CE F-FDG PET/CT and CT/MRI findings were compared with respect to primary tumors and staging. RESULTS The sensitivity of CE F-FDG PET/CT in primary tumor detection was 98%, which was very close to that of CT/MRI (100%). CE F-FDG PET/CT resulted in correct staging in 84% of the cases, compared with 68% of the cases with conventional methods (52 vs. 42 patients). SUVmax values of early PET for the primary tumors were significantly correlated with the Fuhrman grades (P<0.001). CE F-FDG PET/CT enabled the detection of synchronous tumors in four patients, one of which was incorrectly diagnosed as having metastasis by CT. Distant metastases were detected in 16 patients with CE F-FDG PET/CT and in 13 patients with routine conventional methods. CONCLUSION CE F-FDG PET/CT showed similar results compared with CT/MRI in the detection of primary tumors, but it was superior to conventional methods in the detection of metastasis and staging. Given the highly significant correlation between SUVmax values and the Fuhrman grading, CE F-FDG PET/CT may play a significant role in the evaluation of patient prognosis.","Gündoğan, Cihan; Çermik, Tevfik F; Erkan, Erkan; Yardimci, Aytül H; Behzatoğlu, Kemal; Tatar, Gamze; Okçu, Oğuzhan; Toktaş, Mahmut G",Nuclear medicine communications,37,12

Local excision is an acceptable alternative in selected patients with early disease (T(is)0-T(1)) and low-risk features, in whom radical resection may be associated with unacceptably high morbidity. With recent data demonstrating favorable results in well-selected patients, the role of local excision for rectal cancer is expanding.1 (,) 2 Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), which requires the use of an operating anoscope, has been used for the local excision of mid-upper rectal tumors. We describe an alternative approach to TEM for rectal cancer. METHODS We present a stepwise technique for TEM using a single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) port. The patient is a 64 year-old male with a right anterolateral rectal polyp 7 cm from the anal verge, which on snare polypectomy demonstrated in-situ carcinoma with positive margins. Endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated uT(1) disease with no lymphadenopathy. He opted for local excision and underwent TEM. Our stepwise approach includes: (1) delineation of excision margins, (2) full thickness incision of the rectal wall, (3) circumferential dissection, and full thickness excision, and (4) suture repair. RESULTS The procedure was performed without intraoperative or postoperative complications. Final pathology revealed in-situ carcinoma with widely negative margins. At 1- and 3-week follow-up visits, the patient was pain free with normal bowel activity and no rectal bleeding or genitourinary dysfunction.

SUDEP shares many features with sudden cardiac death and sudden unexplained death in the young and may have a similar genetic contribution. We aim to systematically review the literature on the genetics of SUDEP. Methods and Results PubMed, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, Ovid Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus were searched through April 4, 2017. English language human studies analyzing SUDEP for known sudden death, ion channel and arrhythmia-related pathogenic variants, novel variant discovery, and copy number variant analyses were included. Aggregate descriptive statistics were generated; data were insufficient for meta-analysis. A total of 8 studies with 161 unique individuals were included; mean was age 29.0 (±SD 14.2) years; 61% males; ECG data were reported in 7.5% of cases; 50.7% were found prone and 58% of deaths were nocturnal. Cause included all types of epilepsy. Antemortem diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and autism (with duplication of chromosome 15) was associated with 11% and 9% of cases. The most frequently detected known pathogenic variants at postmortem were in Na+ and K+ ion channel subunits, as were novel potentially pathogenic variants (11%). Overall, the majority of variants were of unknown significance. Analysis of copy number variant was insignificant. Conclusions SUDEP case adjudication and evaluation remains limited largely because of crucial missing data such as ECGs. The most frequent pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants identified by molecular autopsy are in ion channel or arrhythmia-related genes, with an ≈11% discovery rate.

The relationship between paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two groups were selected for the study, the COVID-19 and the control groups. The control group consisted of 40 patients who applied to our clinic with headache and therefore underwent PNS CT. The other group consisted of 40 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with sudden loss of smell with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. Clinical and demographic characteristics, tomography results, and olfactory test scores of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell and control group patients were recorded. The relationship between CT changes in the olfactory cleft and the degree of loss of smell was evaluated. The ""Opacification in the olfactory cleft"" was accepted as a positive CT finding. RESULTS Comparison of patients with COVID-19 who had a loss of smell and the control group indicated that a significant difference was observed in terms of CT findings (P = .022). When we evaluated the paranasal CTs obtained from our patients with loss of smell, the CT of 13 patients showed pathological findings (P < .05). As the COVID-19 progressed (pneumonia and respiratory failure), the degree of loss of smell increased (P < .05). A statistically significant relationship was found between the CCCRC score and the presence of PNS CT findings (P = .0012). CONCLUSION The PNS CT findings are significant in patients with COVID-19 with a loss of smell and were significantly associated with the degree of loss of smell. In patients with olfactory loss due to COVID-19, PNS CT can help in diagnosis. However, for this imaging to be diagnostic, a larger patient series is needed.","Yıldız, Erkan; Balcı, Aydın; Selendili, Okan; Kuzu, Selçuk","Ear, nose, & throat journal",37,1

Testing for H. pylori infection in appropriate patients with prompt treatment followed by the testing of eradication is the standard of care in the United States. Active Duty Service members (ADSMs) in the U.S. military are a unique patient population that may be at higher risk for acquiring H. pylori infection given frequent deployments to developing countries. Noninvasive diagnostic strategies include the urea breath test, the stool antigen test, and serologic testing, which include H. pylori immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Among noninvasive methods, the least sensitive is serology, and although there is clinical utility in testing for H. pylori IgG antibodies, H. pylori IgA or IgM antibodies have limited clinical utility. Despite this, H. pylori IgA and IgM antibodies are still widely ordered across the Military Health System. MATERIALS AND METHODS In order to determine how frequently this testing is being ordered and the associated cost, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of H. pylori serologic testing utilization in the MHS from October 2015 to September 2018 in adult patients using the MHS Data Repository. All H. pylori IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies, H. pylori stool antigen tests, and H. pylori urea breath tests were queried during this time period across all ADSMs, retirees, and ADSM dependents for all adults. Cost information was obtained from LabCorp, and the institutional price used for cost analysis was the same throughout all military treatment facilities in the Department of Defense (DOD). RESULTS We discovered that over a 3-yr period, 1,916 H. pylori IgA and 2,492 IgM antibodies were ordered. In total, the DOD spent close to $400,000 on antibody-based testing for H. pylori not accounting for indirect associated costs like personnel, supplies, repeat testing, as well as the costs of delayed diagnosis and associated complications. CONCLUSION H. pylori IgM and IgA have limited clinical utility, are inaccurate, and are costly to maintain, especially when more accurate alternative tests are available. Based on our analysis, we strongly recommend the removal of the H. pylori IgA and IgM serologic tests throughout the DOD in order to improve the efficiency and quality of care for patients suspected of having an H. pylori infection. Further research is needed to determine how these tests are ordered, how providers are responding to the results of the serologic tests, and if noninvasive testing is being ordered appropriately.","Pak, Kevin; Junga, Zachary; Mertz, Andrew; Singla, Manish",Military medicine,37,16

In the presence of hormesis, a low dose of a toxic agent may have a lower risk than the risk at the control dose, and the risk may increase at high doses. When the sample size is small due to practical, logistic, and ethical considerations, a parametric model may provide an efficient approach to hypothesis testing at the cost of adopting a strong assumption, which is not guaranteed to be true. In this article, we first consider alternative parameterizations based on the traditional three-parameter logistic regression. The new parameterizations attempt to provide robustness to model misspecification by allowing an unspecified dose-response relationship between the control dose and the first nonzero experimental dose. We then consider experimental designs including the uniform design (the same sample size per dose group) and the c -optimal design (minimizing the standard error of an estimator for a parameter of interest). Our simulation studies showed that (1) the c -optimal design under the traditional three-parameter logistic regression does not help reducing an inflated Type I error rate due to model misspecification, (2) it is helpful under the new parameterization with three parameters (Type I error rate is close to a fixed significance level), and (3) the new parameterization with four parameters and the c -optimal design does not reduce statistical power much while preserving the Type I error rate at a fixed significance level.","Kim, Steven; Wand, Jeffrey; Magana-Ramirez, Christina; Frej, Jenelle",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,37,1

Current sampling practice risks loss of sample to the attached negative flow, aerosolisation, or spillage, due to repeated circuit breaks, when replacing sample containers. Such concerns were highlighted during the recent coronavirus pandemic. OBJECTIVES Evaluation of an alternative integrated sampling solution, with the Ambu Bronchosampler with aScope 4, by an experienced bronchoscopist in ICU. METHODS An observational study of 20 sequential bronchoscopic diagnostic sampling procedures was performed on mechanically ventilated patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Mixed methods assessment was done. The predefined outcome measures were (1) ease of set up, (2) ease of specimen collection, (3) ease of protecting specimen from loss or spillage, and (4) overall workflow. The duration of the procedure and the % volume of sample retrieved were recorded. RESULTS The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) time for collecting 1 sample was 2.5 ± 0.8 min. The mean (±SD) specimen yield for instilled miniBAL was 54.2 ± 17.9%. Compared with standard sampling, the set-up was much easier in 18 (90%), or easier in 2 (10%) of procedures, reducing the connection steps. It was much more intuitive to use in 14 (70%), more intuitive in 4 (20%), and no more intuitive to use in 2 (10%). The overall set-up and workflow was much easier in 69% of the 13 intraprocedural connections and easier or as easy in the remaining 31% procedures. All procedures where pre connection was established were much easier (7, 100%). The Ambu Bronchosampler remained upright in all procedures with no loss or spillage of sample. Obtaining a sample was much easier in 60%, easier in 10%, no different in 20%, and worse in 10%. The ability to protect a sample from start to finish compared to standard procedures was much easier in 80%, easier in 15%, and no different in 5% of procedures. Overall workflow was much easier in 14 (70%), easier in 4 (20%), and no different in 2 (10%) of procedures. CONCLUSIONS The Ambu Bronchosampler unit was a reliable, effective, and possibly safer technique for diagnostic sampling in ICU. It may improve safety standards during the coronavirus pandemic. A randomized control trial against the standard sampling technique is warranted.","Singh, Suveer; Shah, Pallav L",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,37,1

METHODS Participants were 4,305 weight-loss maintainers who had maintained ≥9.1 kg of weight loss (24.7 kg on average) for 3.3 years and had an average current BMI of 27.6 kg/m2 . A control group of weight-stable individuals with obesity (n = 619) had an average BMI of 38.9 kg/m2 . The Multicontext Sitting Time Questionnaire and Paffenbarger physical activity questionnaire were administered. RESULTS Weight-loss maintainers versus controls spent 3 hours less per day sitting during the week (10.9 vs. 13.9; η p 2 = 0.039; P = 0.0001) and weekends (9.7 vs. 12.6; η p 2 = 0.038). Weight-loss maintainers versus controls spent 1 hour less per day in non-work-related sitting using a computer or video games during the week (1.4 vs. 2.3; η p 2 = 0.03; P = 0.0001) and weekends (1.5 vs. 2.5; η p 2 = 0.03; P = 0.0001).

Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentrations in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases.METHODS: We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020.RESULTS: Several non-infectious as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases are characterized by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a diagnostic biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.CONCLUSIONS: Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","Kappert, Kai; Jahić, Amir; Tauber, Rudolf","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",37,12

In addition, studies have shown the impact of a child's physical and psychosocial environment on developing brain structure and function. A rate-limiting complication in these studies, however, is the high cost and infrastructural requirements of modern MRI systems. High costs mean many neuroimaging studies typically include fewer than 100 individuals and are performed predominately in high resource hospitals and university settings within high income countries (HICs). As a result, our knowledge of brain development, particularly in children who live in lower and middle income countries (LMICs) is relatively limited. Low field systems, with magnetic fields less than 100mT offer the promise of lower scanning costs and wide-spread global adoption, but routine low field pediatric neuroimaging has yet to be demonstrated. Here we present the first pediatric MRI data collected on a low cost and assessable 64mT scanner in children 6 weeks to 16 years of age and replicate brain volumes estimates and developmental trajectories derived from 3T MRI data. While preliminary, these results illustrate the potential of low field imaging as a viable complement to more conventional high field imaging systems, and one that may further enhance our knowledge of neurodevelopment in LMICs where malnutrition, psychosocial adversities, and other environmental exposures may profoundly affect brain maturation.","Deoni, Sean C L; Bruchhage, Muriel M K; Beauchemin, Jennifer; Volpe, Alexandra; D'Sa, Viren; Huentelman, Matthew; Williams, Steven C R",NeuroImage,37,16

We aimed to determine whether inhaling 5% CO₂ can be used to suppress seizures in epilepsy patients. The effect of CO₂ on cortical epileptic activity accompanying behavioral seizures was studied in rats and nonhuman primates, and based on these data, preliminary tests were carried out in humans. METHODS In freely moving rats, cortical afterdischarges paralleled by myoclonic convulsions were evoked by sensorimotor cortex stimulation. Five percent CO₂ was applied for 5 min, 3 min before stimulation. In macaque monkeys, hypercarbia was induced by hypoventilation while seizure activity was electrically or chemically evoked in the sensorimotor cortex. Seven patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy were examined with video-EEG (electroencephalography) and received 5% CO₂ in medical carbogen shortly after electrographic seizure onset. RESULTS In rats, 5% CO₂ strongly suppressed cortical afterdischarges, by approximately 75%, whereas responses to single-pulse stimulation were reduced by about 15% only. In macaques, increasing pCO₂) from 37 to 44-45 mm Hg (corresponding to inhalation of 5% CO₂ or less) suppressed stimulation-induced cortical afterdischarges by about 70% and single, bicuculline-induced epileptiform spikes by approximately 25%. In a pilot trial carried out in seven patients, a rapid termination of electrographic seizures was seen despite the fact that the application of 5% CO₂ was started after seizure generalization. CONCLUSIONS Five percent CO₂ has a fast and potent anticonvulsant action. The present data suggest that medical carbogen with 5% CO₂ can be used for acute treatment to suppress seizures in epilepsy patients.","Tolner, Else A; Hochman, Daryl W; Hassinen, Pekka; Otáhal, Jakub; Gaily, Eija; Haglund, Michael M; Kubová, Hana; Schuchmann, Sebastian; Vanhatalo, Sampsa; Kaila, Kai",Epilepsia,37,11

Our intent was to stratify clinical and economic outcomes based on the timing of revascularization. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2011. Patients were included if they were admitted non-electively with a primary diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis with infarction and subsequently treated with revascularization. Cases were stratified into four groups based upon the timing of revascularization: (1) within 48-h of admission, (2) between 48-h and day four of hospitalization, (3) between days five and seven, and (4) during the second week of admission. RESULTS 27,839 cases met our inclusion criteria. The lowest odds of iatrogenic complications (OR=0.643, P<.001) and mortality (OR=0.631, P<.001) coincided with revascularization between days five and seven of hospitalization. Treatment with carotid artery stenting (CAS) and administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) increased the odds of complications and death. With regards to economic measures, administration of rtPA and utilization of CAS drove cost and length-of-stay up, while lower co-morbidity burden and earlier time to revascularization drove both measures down. CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that the optimum timing of revascularization may be near the end of the first week of hospitalization following acute stroke. However, this study must be cautioned with limitations including its inability to control for critical disease specific variables including symptom severity and degree of stenosis. Prospective examination seems warranted.","Villwock, Mark R; Singla, Amit; Padalino, David J; Ramaswamy, Raghu; Deshaies, Eric M",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,37,31

Although many methods have been proposed for protein structure alignment or comparison, alternative similarity measures are still strongly demanded due to the requirement of fast screening and query in large-scale structure databases. In this paper, we first formulate a novel representation of a protein structure, i.e., Feature Sequence of Surface (FSS). Then, a new score scheme is developed to measure the similarity between two representations. To verify the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted in four different protein data sets. We also classify SARS coronavirus to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Furthermore, preliminary results of fast classification of the whole CATH v2.5.1 database based on the new macrostructure similarity are given as a pilot study. We demonstrate that the proposed approach to measure the similarities between protein structures is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and surprisingly fast. In addition, the method itself provides a new and quantitative tool to view a protein structure.","Wang, Yong; Wu, Ling-Yun; Zhang, Ji-Hong; Zhan, Zhong-Wei; Zhang, Xiang-Sun; Chen, Luonan",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,37,1

CXCL10 may not be a bystander to the severe virus infection but may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of neutrophil-mediated, excessive pulmonary inflammation. OBJECTIVES We investigated the contribution of CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 axis to the pathogenesis of ARDS with nonviral and viral origins. METHODS We induced nonviral ARDS by acid aspiration and viral ARDS by intratracheal influenza virus infection in wild-type mice and mice deficient in CXCL10, CXCR3, IFNAR1 (IFN-α/β receptor 1), or TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We found that the mice lacking CXCL10 or CXCR3 demonstrated improved severity and survival of nonviral and viral ARDS, whereas mice that lack IFNAR1 did not control the severity of ARDS in vivo. The increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with ARDS originate to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor via TRIF. CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in the inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. CONCLUSIONS CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbation of the pathology of ARDS. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could represent a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of nonviral and viral origins.","Ichikawa, Akihiko; Kuba, Keiji; Morita, Masayuki; Chida, Shinsuke; Tezuka, Hiroyuki; Hara, Hiromitsu; Sasaki, Takehiko; Ohteki, Toshiaki; Ranieri, V Marco; dos Santos, Claudia C; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Akira, Shizuo; Luster, Andrew D; Lu, Bao; Penninger, Josef M; Uhlig, Stefan; Slutsky, Arthur S; Imai, Yumiko",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,37,1

This technique has potential advantages in terms of less invasive surgery without the need to create a complicated intraabdominal anastomosis. METHODS From 2008 to 2011, 262 patients with gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy and reconstruction with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and 52 patients underwent LATG with DST. A retrospective analysis then was performed comparing the patients who experienced postoperative stenosis after LATG-DST (positive group) and the patients who did not (negative group). A comparative analysis was performed among patients comparing conventional open total gastrectomy and LATG, and multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors for the development of anastomotic stenosis. RESULTS A minor leak was found in 1 patient (1.9 %), and 11 patients experienced anastomotic stenosis (21 %) after LATG with DST. Among the patients with anastomotic stenosis, three (3/4, 75 %) anastomoses were performed with the 21-mm end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler, and eight anastomoses were performed (8/47, 17 %) with the 25-mm EEA stapler. The median interval to the diagnosis of anastomotic stenosis was 43 days after surgery. The patients with stenosis needed endoscopic balloon dilation an average of four times, and the rate of perforation after dilation was 13 %. The clinical and operative characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Anastomotic stenosis after open total gastrectomy occurred in two cases (0.98 %). Multivariate analysis showed that the size of the EEA stapler and the use of DST were risk factors for anastomotic stenosis. CONCLUSION Esophagojejunostomy using DST with OrVil is useful in performing a minimally invasive procedure but carries a high risk of anastomotic stenosis.","Zuiki, Toru; Hosoya, Yoshinori; Kaneda, Yuji; Kurashina, Kentaro; Saito, Shin; Ui, Takashi; Haruta, Hidenori; Hyodo, Masanobu; Sata, Naohiro; Lefor, Alan T; Yasuda, Yoshikazu",Surgical endoscopy,37,1

Our aim was to assess treatment patterns, outcomes, and complications in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. METHODS A retrospective study of patients with stage IB2 cervical carcinoma at a single institution between January 1982 and September 2006 was performed. To adequately control treatment variables, we only included patients who underwent their entire treatment at our institution. Toxicity was assessed using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). RESULTS We identified 82 patients, of whom 47 met the strict inclusion criteria. Of these, 27 patients (57%) underwent primary radical hysterectomy (RH) and 20 (43%) were treated with definitive radiation/chemoradiation therapy (RT/CRT). Patients selected for RT/CRT had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score than those selected for surgery (P=0.037). The 3-year progression free survival rate was 52% for the RH group and 55% for the RT/CRT group (P=0.977). The 3-year overall survival rates were 72% and 55%, respectively (P=0.161). Overall, 52% of patients in the RH group received postoperative radiation therapy as part of their adjuvant treatment. CTC grade 3, 4, and 5 complications affected 5 patients (19%) in the RH group and 3 (15%) in the RT/CRT group. CONCLUSION Both RH and definitive RT/CRT are adequate management strategies for patients with FIGO stage IB2 cervical cancer. However, there was a subset of patients in whom RH as monotherapy was appropriate. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of new preoperative models that will accurately identify these patients.","Zivanovic, Oliver; Alektiar, Kaled M; Sonoda, Yukio; Zhou, Qin; Iasonos, Alexia; Tew, William P; Diaz, John P; Chi, Dennis S; Barakat, Richard R; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R",Gynecologic oncology,37,1

This systematic review compared these techniques in terms of function, surgical outcomes and quality of life. METHODS A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library, from inception of the databases until November 2014) was conducted to identify randomized clinical trials comparing reconstructive techniques after LAR. Random-effects meta-analyses were carried out, and results presented as weighted odds ratios or mean differences with corresponding 95 per cent c.i. A network meta-analysis was conducted for the outcome anastomotic leakage. RESULTS The search yielded 965 results; 21 trials comprising data from 1636 patients were included. Colonic J pouch was associated with lower stool frequency and antidiarrhoeal medication use for up to 1 year after surgery compared with straight CAA. Transverse coloplasty and side-to-end CAA had similar functional outcomes to the colonic J pouch. No superiority was found for any of the techniques in terms of anastomotic leak rate. CONCLUSION Colonic J pouch and side-to-end CAA or transverse coloplasty lead to a better functional outcome than straight CAA for the first year after surgery.","Hüttner, F J; Tenckhoff, S; Jensen, K; Uhlmann, L; Kulu, Y; Büchler, M W; Diener, M K; Ulrich, A",The British journal of surgery,37,1

CASE SUMMARY A 28 kg, 4-year-old female neutered mixed breed dog presented to the primary care veterinarian with diabetic ketosis. During the process of central venous catheterization, the guide wire was accidently released and the entire length of the guide wire slipped into the jugular vein. Due to the absence of nearby interventional radiology facilities, surgical intervention was proposed. An ultrasound was used to determine that the guide wire was located in the caudal vena cava extending caudally into the right internal iliac vein. Rommel tourniquets were placed around the iliac vein cranial to the bifurcation of the common iliac vein into the external and internal iliac veins. A venotomy was performed in the right common iliac vein and the guide wire was grasped with hemostats and gently removed while alternately relaxing the cranial then caudal tourniquets. During anesthesia, ventricular premature contractions were noted that varied in frequency with the dog's positioning. Postoperative color flow Doppler ultrasound evaluation of the caudal vena cava, right common, internal and external iliac veins, and right femoral vein was normal with no evidence of thrombosis. Several days postoperative the dog's diabetic ketosis and ventricular premature contractions had resolved and color flow Doppler ultrasound evaluation was normal with no evidence of thrombosis. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported veterinary case of loss and subsequent surgical retrieval of a central venous catheter guide wire.","Hardy, Jade M; Lansdowne, Jennifer L; Himsel, Carol A; Freer, Sean R",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,37,17

Ribavirin represents a possible treatment option although the outcome on graft function and BOS incidence is unknown. METHODS We analysed outcomes of all PV infections in lung/heart-lung recipients between September 2006 and April 2009 in a single centre. PV-infected recipients treated with oral ribavirin were compared with those unable to receive ribavirin due to contraindications. Recovery of graft function, time to recovery and new development of BOS were compared. RESULTS A total of 38 patients (ribavirin group) were treated with ribavirin for a median of 9 days (IQR 8-12), whilst 29 patients (non-ribavirin group) received best supportive care including corticosteroids. The median forced expiratory volume in 1 s dropped 20% (IQR 15-32) from baseline in the ribavirin group versus 18% (IQR 13-30) in the non-ribavirin group during infection. In 84% of patients treated with ribavirin and 59% of the non-ribavirin group, graft function recovered within 30 days (P=0.02). New onset of BOS developed within 6 months in 5% of the ribavirin group versus 24% of the non-ribavirin group (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of PV after lung/heart-lung transplantation with oral ribavirin seems to be associated with earlier recovery of graft function and to prevent BOS.","Fuehner, Thomas; Dierich, Martin; Duesberg, Christoph; DeWall, Claudia; Welte, Tobias; Haverich, Axel; Warnecke, Gregor; Simon, Andre R; Gottlieb, Jens",Antiviral therapy,37,24

We aimed to evaluate, longitudinally, the association between upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) caused by viruses and AECOPD.Detection of 18 viruses was performed in naso- and orοpharyngeal swabs in 450 COPD patients (GOLD 2-4), followed for a mean of 27 months, at stable periods (n=1909), at URTI onset (n=391), 10 days after the URTI (n=356) and at AECOPD (n=177) using a multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing.Evidence of at least one respiratory virus was significantly higher at URTI onset (52.7%), at 10 days following a URTI (15.2%) and at exacerbation (38.4%), compared with the stable period (5.3%, p<0.001). At stable visits rhinovirus accounted for 54.2% of all viral infections, followed by coronavirus (20.5%). None of the viruses could be identified in two consecutive stable visits. Patients with viral infection at URTI onset did not have a higher incidence of exacerbation, compared with patients without viral infection (p=0.993). Τhe incidence of any viral infection at AECOPD was similar between URTI-related AECOPD and non-URTI-related AECOPD (p=0.359). Only 24% of the patients that had a URTI-related AECOPD had the same virus at URTI and AECOPD. Detection of parainfluenza 3 at URTI onset was associated with higher risk of AECOPD (p=0.003). Rhinovirus and coronavirus were the most frequently detected viruses at AECOPD visits accounting for 35.7% and 25.9% of all viral infections, respectively.The prevalence of viral infection at the stable period of COPD is low. The risk of exacerbation following the onset of URTI symptoms depends on the particular virus associated with the event and was significant only for parainfluenza 3.","Stolz, Daiana; Papakonstantinou, Eleni; Grize, Leticia; Schilter, Daniel; Strobel, Werner; Louis, Renaud; Schindler, Christian; Hirsch, Hans H; Tamm, Michael",The European respiratory journal,37,17

Twenty-three professional male basketball players, aged 25.8 ± 8.6 years old, were voluntarily assigned to participate in three treatments, including no treatment (no mouthguard), acute treatment (wearing a mouthguard), and repeated treatments (8 weeks follow-up). Body alignment status, such as spinal and pelvic posture and balance performance, were measured at each time point using a 3D Formetric III (Germany) and a postural control device (Posturomed 202, Germany), respectively. A repeated MANOVA analysis with a Bonferroni post hoc test was applied, and the adjusted p-value was set at 0.02. No significant treatment effect was observed in body alignment (p = 0.302). However, univariate analysis showed a significant difference in pelvic torsion, where it was decreased after acute and repeated mouthguard treatments compared to no treatment (p < 0.001). Kyphotic angle also increased significantly following 8 weeks of treatment compared to no treatment (p < 0.001) and acute treatment (p < 0.002). There was a significant treatment effect on balance performance (p < 0.001). Both static and dynamic balance performance improved following 8 weeks of treatment (p < 0.001). Our study revealed that a customized mouthguard provides a benefit to balance performance. Notably, repeated treatment impacts on balance performance more than acute treatment. Although our findings did not show a significant effect on body alignment, some positive results, such as pelvic torsion and kyphotic angle, may provide substantial information for developing future longitudinal studies with large sample sizes.","Nam, Hae Joo; Lee, Joon-Hee; Hong, Dae-Seok; Jung, Hyun Chul",International journal of environmental research and public health,37,20

We characterized hospitalizations for severe LRTI among children. METHODS We analyzed claims data from commercial and Medicaid insurance enrollees (MarketScan) ages 0 to 18 years from 2007 to 2011. LRTI hospitalizations were identified by the first 2 listed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision discharge codes; those with ICU admission and/or receiving mechanical ventilation were defined as severe LRTI. Underlying conditions were determined from out- and inpatient discharge codes in the preceding year. We report insurance specific and combined rates that used both commercial and Medicaid rates and adjusted for age and insurance status. RESULTS During 2007-2011, we identified 16797 and 12053 severe LRTI hospitalizations among commercial and Medicaid enrollees, respectively. The rates of severe LRTI hospitalizations per 100000 person-years were highest in children aged <1 year (commercial: 244; Medicaid: 372, respectively), and decreased with age. Among commercial enrollees, ≥ 1 condition increased the risk for severe LRTI (1 condition: adjusted relative risk, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-2.78; 3 conditions: adjusted relative risk, 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 4.65-5.07) compared with children with no medical conditions. Using commercial/Medicaid combined rates, an estimated 31289 hospitalizations for severe LRTI occurred each year in children in the United States.

RECENT FINDINGS Objective measurement tools such as ccardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and muscle-specific ultrasound show great promise to assess/treat post-ICU physical dysfunction. CPET is showing that systemic mitochondrial dysfunction may underlie development and persistence of poor post-ICU functional recovery. Finally, recent data indicate that we are poor at delivering effective, early ICU rehabilitation and that there is limited benefit of currently employed later ICU rehabilitation on ICU-acquired weakness and QoL outcomes.

Currently, technologies such as muscle-specific ultrasound and CPET testing show great promise to guide ICU muscle/functional recovery. Further, we must evolve improved ICU-rehabilitation strategies, as current methods are not consistently improving outcomes.

Although the majority of transmissions often occurs within social groups6-9, the contribution of connections that bridge groups and species to pathogen dynamics is poorly understood10-12. These cryptic connections-which are often indirect or infrequent-provide transmission routes between otherwise disconnected individuals and may have a key role in large-scale outbreaks that span multiple populations or species. Here we quantify the importance of cryptic connections in disease dynamics by simultaneously characterizing social networks and tracing transmission dynamics of surrogate-pathogen epidemics through eight communities of bats. We then compared these data to the invasion of the fungal pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome, a recently emerged disease that is devastating North American bat populations13-15. We found that cryptic connections increased links between individuals and between species by an order of magnitude. Individuals were connected, on average, to less than two per cent of the population through direct contact and to only six per cent through shared groups. However, tracing surrogate-pathogen dynamics showed that each individual was connected to nearly fifteen per cent of the population, and revealed widespread transmission between solitarily roosting individuals as well as extensive contacts among species. Connections estimated from surrogate-pathogen epidemics, which include cryptic connections, explained three times as much variation in the transmission of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome as did connections based on shared groups. These findings show how cryptic connections facilitate the community-wide spread of pathogens and can lead to explosive epidemics.","Hoyt, Joseph R; Langwig, Kate E; White, J Paul; Kaarakka, Heather M; Redell, Jennifer A; Kurta, Allen; DePue, John E; Scullon, William H; Parise, Katy L; Foster, Jeffrey T; Frick, Winifred F; Kilpatrick, A Marm",Nature,37,12

We review the mechanisms of action, clinical effectiveness and safety of treatment, with emphasis on recently published studies. RECENT FINDINGS Several monoclonal antibodies targeting the surface molecule CD20 on B cells are approved or being developed for treatment of MS. Overall, they seem comparable in terms of strongly suppressing radiological disease activity and relapse biology. Novel approaches include anti-CD19 antibody therapy and treatment with oral drugs targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The main safety issue with persistent B cell depletion is an increased risk of infections - possibly including an increased risk of severe COVID-19. Vaccine responses are also blunted in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies. Lower doses or longer infusion intervals may be sufficient for control of disease activity. Whether this might also improve the safety of treatment and increase vaccination responses remains to be determined. SUMMARY Available data support the widespread use of therapies targeting B cells in MS. Whether novel approaches targeting CD19 or BTK will have advantages compared to anti-CD20 antibody therapy remains to be established.

The odds ratios (ORs) of relation between work functioning impairment and necessary of support for sick workers were estimated using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: The OR of work functioning impairment among sick workers not receiving support was 5.61 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.19-6.06, p<0.001) and those receiving support was 1.82 (95% CI 1.64-2.03, p<0.001) compared to healthy workers. Conclusions: This study suggests that providing support to workers with illness may improve their work functioning impairment.","Yu, I.; Tateishi, S.; Harada, A.; Hno, A.; Tsuji, M.; Ogami, A.; Mori, K.; Matsugaki, R.; Fujino, Y.",,37,16

EBV replicates in the differentiated layers of stratified keratinocytes but whether the other cell types of the airway epithelium are susceptible to EBV is unknown. Here, we demonstrate with primary nasopharyngeal cells grown at the air-liquid interface that the pseudostratified epithelium can be susceptible to EBV infection and we report that susceptible cell types with distinct EBV transcription profiles can be identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Although EBV infection in the nasopharynx has evaded detection in asymptomatic carriers, these findings demonstrate that EBV latent and lytic infection can occur in the cells of the nasopharyngeal epithelium.","Ziegler, Phillip; Bai, Yulong; Tian, Yarong; Abrahamsson, Sanna; Green, Anthony; Moore, John; Lee, Stella E.; Myerburg, Michael M.; Park, Hyun Jung; Tang, Ka-Wei; Shair, Kathy H.Y.",bioRxiv,37,24

It attempts to see if direct marketing via FPOs/FPCs helped Indian farmers to cope with adverse situations aroused in vegetable marketing. Design/methodology/approach: This study opted for mixed methods research. First, a granular data set comprising daily observation on wholesale price and the market arrival of vegetables were analysed. Descriptive statistics and Kalmogorov-Smirnov test were used to understand the severity of disruptions in the vegetable supply chain in India during the lockdown. Then, qualitative information from different stakeholders engaged in the vegetable marketing was collected through a phone survey and assessed using content analysis to comprehend how FPOs have helped farmer’s during this crisis. Findings: This paper confirms disruptions in the vegetable supply chain. Quantities of chosen vegetables arriving in the mandis were significantly lower than in the previous year for all phases of lockdown. Consequently, prices were much higher than in 2019–2020 for both the lockdown and subsequent phases unlock. Results further suggest that those farmers who are already in networks of FPOs/FPCs are able to get benefited. It was also observed that direct marketing through institutional supports is being more explored in the regions where FPOs/FPCs already exist. Research limitations/implications: Since it is an exploratory study involving a small sample, the research results may lack generalisability. Originality/value: This study provides scope for direct marketing through FPOs/FPCs in improving the food supply chain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Tripathi, A.; Bharti, N.; Sardar, S.; Malik, S.",Journal of Agribusiness in Developing and Emerging Economies,37,0

Despite their zoonotic potential, many of these viruses remain understudied due to not yet being cultured. While reverse genetic systems can facilitate virus rescue, this is often hindered by missing viral genome ends. A prime example is Lloviu virus (LLOV), an uncultured filovirus that is closely related to the highly pathogenic Ebola virus. Using minigenome systems, we complemented the missing LLOV genomic ends and identified cis-acting elements required for LLOV replication that were lacking in the published sequence. We leveraged these data to generate recombinant full-length LLOV clones and rescue infectious virus. Recombinant LLOV (rLLOV) displays typical filovirus features, as shown by electron microscopy. Known target cells of Ebola virus, including macrophages and hepatocytes, are permissive to rLLOV infection, suggesting that humans could be potential hosts. However, inflammatory responses in human macrophages, a hallmark of Ebola virus disease, are not induced by rLLOV. We also used rLLOV to test antivirals targeting multiple facets of the replication cycle. Rescue of uncultured viruses of pathogenic concern represents a valuable tool in our arsenal against pandemic preparedness.","Hume, Adam J; Heiden, Baylee; Olejnik, Judith; Suder, Ellen L; Ross, Stephen; Scoon, Whitney A; Bullitt, Esther; Ericsson, Maria; White, Mitchell R; Turcinovic, Jacquelyn; Thao, Tran TN; Hekman, Ryan M; Kaserman, Joseph E; Huang, Jessie; Alysandratos, Konstantinos-Dionysios; Toth, Gabor E; Jakab, Ferenc; Kotton, Darrell N; Wilson, Andrew A; Emili, Andrew; Thiel, Volker; Connor, John H; Kemenesi, Gabor; Cifuentes, Daniel; Mühlberger, Elke",bioRxiv,37,8

Having rapidly contained the health emergency in the immediate period, Seoul arguably mitigated the economic fallouts more successfully than the majority of advanced economies but could not avoid substantial losses. The far-reaching fallout of COVID-19 has been testing the country's energy transition pathway, as actors involved are facing difficult decisions amid more stringent financial constraints to deliver their ambitious targets, including achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Amid the combined effects of the pandemic and the global energy prices shocks, addressing the nexus between energy security on the supply side, affordability, and the safety of people's lives and property, has become even more pressing. Against this backdrop, natural gas has tailored a special role to bridge the low carbon re-alignment of the entire Korean energy system, also in the face of the current and future challenges to Korea's energy security.

After target recognition and Cas mediated cleavage of biotinylated ssDNA probe molecules, the probe molecules are bound to magnetic particles. A complimentary ssDNA oligonucleotide quantum dot conjugate is then added, which only hybridizes to un-cleaved probes on the magnetic beads. After separation of hybridized from unhybridized quantum dot conjugates by magnetic sequestration, the signal is measured fluorometrically to provide a signal proportional to the cleaved probes and therefore the amount of target nucleic acid. To demonstrate the power of this assay, a 250 bp DNA target sequence matching a portion of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome is used and a detection limit of ~0.5 nM is achieved without target amplification using a simple portable ultraviolet flashlight. The positive samples are readily confirmed by visual inspection, completely avoiding the need for complicated devices and instruments.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, managing T1D may be more demanding and new stressors and routines can impact sleep. We compared parental sleep pre-pandemic to the initial months of the pandemic. Methods: Parents (n=100, 98% mothers) of youth with T1D (M age = 6.7±1.6 yrs, M duration = 2.9±.5 yrs) who were in a behavioral RCT completed surveys at RCT completion and ≥ 6 months later in June/July 2020. They completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) adapted to include T1D-related sleep questions, and 2 sleep items from a COVID-19 survey. M A1c at RCT completion = 8.2±1.4. We compared pre-pandemic vs. 2020 data using χ2 and t tests. Results: Many parents (40%) reported moderate-extreme difficulty sleeping during the pandemic. From pre- to during the pandemic, PSQI Latency scores increased significantly and Duration and Daytime Dysfunction decreased. More parents had PSQI Global Scores above the clinical cut-off during the pandemic. See Table for details. Conclusions: Parents of children with T1D experienced increased sleep challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite lower T1D-related disruption and daytime impairment.

To spread all the scientific outcomes and data around the world, all the major scientific journals and databases are providing open access to their content across the globe. Due to the focused research, a considerable amount of multidimensional data has been generated in a very short time to understand the fundamental behavior of the virus, which is useful for novel therapeutic development. Many countries are working on vaccine development;however progress towards the novel drug pipeline is also parallelly going on to reduce the mortality rate. From a ∼30kb size viral genome, many different experimentally characterized and validated proteins are identified followed by 3D structure determination to explore the antiviral targets more rapidly, which is included in this chapter. Proteases are always found as promising antiviral target proteins and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, cysteine proteases such as 3CLpro (chymotrypsin-like protease) and PLpro (papain-like protease) serve the same. Both cysteine proteases are involved in the cleavage process of polypeptide coming out from the RNA genome of the virus, and this cleavage assists in the replication apparatus complex formation necessary for the viral existence. To target proteases, many molecular mechanics-based computational screening protocols have been applied to find the inhibitors against them;however, due to the inherent limitation (selectivity) in the approach, no major success has been achieved yet. In the present study, we have reviewed different computational methods applied in search of inhibitors against the targets of COVID-19. In addition, using our method CliquePharm, we have attempted to generate the multi-target specific ab-initio pharmacophore models to search for the specific novel inhibitors from a database of antiviral chemicals. Apo-structures of both cysteine proteases are used to design the different sizes and types of the pharmacophore models, which are further utilized to screen the locally setup chemical database to identify the multi-class specific inhibitors. With the help of this study, we were not only able to explore the commonly available interactions within the selected proteases to capture the multi-targeted drugs but also this approach will suppress the chance of any resistance against the designed inhibitors.","Kumar, P.; Ghosh, I.",Methods Pharmacol.

While the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the gold standard method to identify COVID-19, the use of x-ray radiography (CXR) has been widely used in the clinical workup for patients suspected of infection as an additional means of diagnosis and treatment response monitoring. CXR is available in almost every medical center across the world, allowing a quick and protected means of identifying potential COVID-19 cases to subject to quarantine procedures. However, the major challenge with the use of CXR in COVID-19 diagnosis is its low sensitivity and specificity in current radiological practice due to the similarities in clinical presentation to other diseases. Machine learning methods, particularly deep learning, have been shown to perform extremely well in a variety of classification tasks, often exceeding human performance.

In this work we show that this deep learning method can differentiate between COVID-19 related pneumonia and non-COVID-19 pneumonia, with high sensitivity and specificity.","Griner, D.; Zhang, R.; Tie, X.; Zhang, C.

This was qualitative research with key informants consisting of 14 SME managers in Cepaka Village, Kediri, Tabanan Bali. The differentiation was viewed from the basis of products, services, personnel, marketing channels and images as well as marketing 4.0 (digital marketing) implementation in aspects of Mapping Customer Path throughout the Five As concepts. On average, the income of the SMEs in Cepaka Village decreased by 50%. The differentiation strategy consisted of a cost leadership strategy, service variations, expansion of marketing channels and special promotions of 20-30%. Only 3% of SMEs added marketing personnel. The implementation of digital marketing with the Five As approach did not work as intended. Digital marketing had to be done because of the demands of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the impact from this digital marketing strategy has shifted and did not perform optimally. The purchasing decisions were not based on Aware, Appeal, Ask;however, the purchasing decisions were made because of the priority needs and impacts of Covid-19. There was no brand loyalty or repurchase. The implication of this research was to provide a reference for SMEs to prioritize operations in the Covid-19 pandemic or other emergency situations that disrupt the operations of SMEs.","Karta, Nlpa Wardani R.

Given heterogeneity in behaviors and risks, clinical characteristics associated with a positive diagnosis among patients with RMD seeking testing for Sars-CoV-2 remain less well studied. Objectives: Among patients with RMD receiving a Sars-CoV-2 PCR test, we aimed to identify RMD-related factors associated with a positive test result. Methods: Among patients seen at least once in the University of Washington (UW) rheumatology clinics between March 2018 to March 2020, we reviewed electronic medical records to identify patients undergoing Sars-CoV-2 PCR testing from March 1 through October 31, 2020. Patients with RMD were categorized into two groups: those who tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 and those who tested negative. We randomly selected patients from the negative group in a 2:1 ratio for further data abstraction. Student's t-test and Chi-squared tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively, between the groups. To determine the correlates of testing positive for Sars-CoV-2, specifically RMD medication use and disease activity, we constructed different multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, presence of comorbidities, body mass index, and smoking. Results: A total of 2768 RMD patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing within the UW system, of whom 43 (1.5%) were positive at least once. Three patients with incomplete information were excluded. Patients who tested positive had higher prevalence of end stage renal disease (ESRD)/chronic kidney disease (CKD) (24% versus 11%), had higher rates of active disease (24% versus 20%), were older (>55 years) (mean age 57.3 versus 54.8 years), male (63% versus 55%), non-white race/ethnicity (32% versus 26%), and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities (42% versus 31%) (Table 1). In the multivariable models, neither RMD medication use (versus no use, Table 1) nor high disease activity (vs low disease activity/remission) were statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 positivity. Among the 41 COVID-19 positive patients, a majority recovered without specific treatments, although approximately one third of the positive patients were hospitalized and three deaths were observed. Conclusion: In this study, patients who tested positive did not differ in many ways from those who tested negative.

Here, we retrospectively assess the prevalence of informative COVID trials launched in the first 6 months of the pandemic. Methods We created a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and prevention efficacy trials that were initiated from 2020-01-01 to 2020-06-30 using ClinicalTrials.gov registration records. We evaluated trials on 3 criteria of informativeness: potential redundancy, design quality and feasibility of patient-participant recruitment. The study protocol was prospectively registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/fp726/). Results We included 500 trials in our cohort, 58% of which were Phase 2 and 84.8% were directed towards the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Close to one third of trials met all three criteria and were deemed informative (29.0% (95% Confidence Interval 23.7-36.9)). The proportion of potentially redundant trials in our cohort was 4.1%. Over half of the trials in our cohort (56.2%) did not meet our criteria for high quality trial design. The proportion of trials with infeasible patient-participant recruitment was 22.6%. Conclusions Less than one third of COVID-19 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov during the first six months met all three criteria for informativeness. Shortcomings in trial design, recruitment feasibility and redundancy reflect longstanding weaknesses in the clinical research enterprise that were likely amplified by the exceptional circumstances of a pandemic.","Hutchinson, N.; Klas, K.; Carlisle, B.

The virus has affected people's lives bringing different consequences and perspectives linked to age, employment, standard of living, people's existential plans. The different responses to the emergency, in turn attributable to mechanisms of defense against fear, have led to the contrast between different needs and priorities and the emergence of social and cultural conflicts that were previously less obvious. Among these, it is appropriate that the pedagogical sciences pay particular attention to the divide that confronts the elderly to the younger generations, since, if not recognized with timing, it could lead to the breakdown of that intergenerational educational pact that continues to have so much value. In the pandemic crisis, the awareness of a common vulnerability could be the starting point for promoting a renewed cohesion and a dialogue between generations that can be characterized by empathy and mutual recognition.","Zannoni, Federico",Studi sulla Formazione,37,1

Selangor, an urbanised state in Malaysia, has been severely affected by COVID19. There is concern that patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) may have higher risk of infection, with increased mortality1. Objectives: To investigate patients' characteristics which are associated with 'feeling stressed' among patients with RD during the second wave of COVID19 infection in Selangor. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted over 3 weeks during the second wave of COVID19 infection in Malaysia. Patients with RD, scheduled for rheumatology clinic appointment in a rheumatology referral centre were invited to participate in this study. Personal and clinical data were collected by phone interview and from patients' medical records respectively. Patients were asked to grade their disease activity by giving a score from 0 (not active) to 10 (active). All patients were asked 'are you feeling stressed' and the answer was recorded as yes or no. Reasons explored for a yes answer, included financial, social disruption, physical illness and future uncertainties. Categorical and continuous data were analysed using chi-squared test and student t-test, respectively. A p-value of <0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results: Three hundred and sixty-one patients with various RD participated in this study. The mean age of these was 48.2 years (range between 16-80 years). More than half (54.3%) were Malay and other ethnicities were Chinese (25.5%), Indian (18.2%) and others (2%). A quarter of patients (24.7%) were not working (unemployed, retired and students) and a third of patients (32.1%) had unpaid work (mainly housewife). The other patients' characteristics are shown in Table 1. Eighty-three (23%) admitted to 'feeling stressed' and the stressors identified were physical illness in 34 (40.9%), social disruption in 23 (27.7%), financial problems in 23 (27.7%) and future uncertainties in 19 (22.9%). Patients' characteristics that were significantly different between patients who were 'feeling stressed' and not 'feeling stressed' were age, employment status and perceived disease activity (Table 1). Conclusion: The COVID19 pandemic has caused mental distress in a significant number of RD patients and associations were found with older age, having paid work and perceived disease activity. Issues that may influence patients' responses, including access to rheumatology care, medication and fear of getting infection were not explored in this study.","Baharuddin, H.; Lim, S. L.; Ch'ng, S.

During the course of the pandemic, the originally identified SARS-CoV-2 variant has been widely replaced by various mutant versions, which showed enhanced fitness due to increased infection and transmission rates [3, 4]. In order to find an explanation, why SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging mutated versions showed enhanced transfection efficiency as compared to SARS-CoV 2002, an improved binding affinity of the spike protein to human ACE has been proposed by crystal structure analysis and was identified in cell culture models [5-7]. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of various spike protein constructs with the human ACE2 was considered to be best described by a Langmuir based 1:1 stoichiometric interaction. However, we demonstrate in this report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 is best described by a two-step interaction, which is defined by an initial binding event followed by a slower secondary rate transition that enhances the stability of the complex by a factor of ∼190 with an overall KD of 0.20 nM. In addition, we show that the secondary rate transition is not only present in SARS-CoV-2 wt but is also found in B.1.1.7 where its transition rate is five-fold increased.","Sevenich, Marc M.; van den Heuvel, Joop; Gering, Ian; Mohrlüder, Jeannine; Willbold, Dieter",bioRxiv,37,23

As such they offer a case study of how meaning making occurs in contemporary periods of social crisis. While the neoliberal era is widely interpreted as period involving a process of desymbolisation in which meaning giving traditions are undermined, in this period of social crisis long-established and authoritative narratives drawn from collective memory circulated to articulate the meaning of the pandemic for the collective identity in the sense of its nature, character, boundaries, ‘others’, and moral duties and sacrifices that membership implied. Highly stereotyped images of the sacred moral core of the collective as represented by publicans who embodied qualities of age and maturity, rural, cultural-nationalist identity and a post Land War ideal of community-oriented owner-proprieters appeared. Similarly conventional representations of the immoral enemies within, who threaten to morally and literally infect the community, can be seen in representations of venues and drinkers who embody youth, the urban crowd and mixing. The ‘other’ through which identity is articulated against was represented through Britishness, which was shown as the source of the undesirable aspects of modernity.

Hybrid organizations are a debated topic in literature and have different strengths in responding to needs, mainly in the public interest. Nevertheless, there are not many studies that identify the impact and change generated by these organizations. After highlighting the gap in the literature, the study proposes an innovative approach that combines SIA, interview, interventionist approach and documental analysis. The breakdown of SIA through the five elements of the value chain (inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact) guarantees a linear definition of the value generated through change with procedural objectivity capable of grasping hybrid organizations’ complexity. The value generated or absorbed is the change generated by the impact measured based on the incidence of public resources allocated. Through the SIA and counterfactual approach, the civil service case study analysis highlights how the value generated by public resources can be measured or more clearly displayed in the measurement process itself.","Esposito, Paolo Brescia Valerio Fantauzzi Chiara Frondizi Rocco",Sustainability,37,1

Oncology healthcare professionals face challenges due to reorganization of cancer services and increasing health care requirements resulting in uncertainty and psychological stress. Aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of covid 19 pandemic on psychological well being of oncology clinicians in the MENA region. Methods: We randomly invited 1500 oncology clinicians including medical oncologists, clinical oncologists, radiation oncologists and surgical oncologists from 17 countries in the MENA region to complete a web based survey to determine the level of psychological stress during covid 19 pandemic from October 2020 to January 2021. The questionnaire was based on Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale (GAD-7) and WHO Well-being Index (WHO-5). The data was analyzed using SPSS version 21 and difference between groups was measured by T-test and ANOVA. Results:Overall 520 (35%) oncology clinicians including 368 (71%) males and 152 (29%) females participated in the survey. Most of the participants were medical oncologists (38%) from teaching institutions (76%) and the public sector (84%). 46% (n = 242) participants were 35- 45 years of age. Majority of clinicians reported moderate (45.6%) to severe (42.3%) anxiety on GAD-7 scale. Females had statistically higher levels of anxiety (average score;15.46 ±4.87, p = 0.04). On PSS, the majority of participants reported higher stress with average scores (29.64 ±3.83) for males and (30.23 ±4.62) for females. Average score for WHO wellbeing index was 62.95 (±20.52) for males and 74.3 (±20.87) for females denoting a preservation of general well being, even in a higher stress and anxiety situation. Female gender was significantly associated with anxiety level on GAD- 7 scale (p = 0.04), but this difference in stress level and well being was not observed on PSS (p = 0.134) and WHO well being index (p = 0.709). Clinicians of ages 25-35 years had significantly higher anxiety levels on GAD-7 scale (p = 0.004) and higher stress on PSS (p = 0.000). Age over 55 years was associated with lower levels of anxiety and stress on GAD-7 and PSS. Oncology clinicians working in public sector experienced significantly lower stress as compared to private sector on PSS scale (p = 0.041) Conclusions: Covid 19 pandemic has significantly increased the anxiety and stress levels among oncology clinicians in the MENA region. Anxiety and stress were higher in females and young clinicians. Clinicians over 55 years of age and oncologists working in the public sector reported less stress and anxiety. General well being of clinicians was well preserved even in a highly stressful and anxious situation.","Latif, M. F.; Azam, F.; Tirmazy, S. H.; Bashir, S.; Ibnshamsah, F.; Al Selwi, W.

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of these variants on severity of maternal infection and perinatal outcomes within the time-periods in which they predominated. Methods This national, prospective cohort study collated data on hospitalised pregnant women with symptoms of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the severity of infection and perinatal outcomes across the Wildtype (01/03/20-30/11/20), Alpha (01/12/20-15/05/21) and Delta dominant periods (16/05/21-11/07/21), using multivariable logistic regression. Findings Of 3371 pregnant women, the proportion that experienced moderate to severe infection significantly increased between Wildtype and Alpha periods (24.4% vs. 35.8%; aOR1.75 95%CI 1.48-2.06), and between Alpha and Delta periods (35.8% vs. 45.0%; aOR1.53, 95%CI 1.07-2.17). Compared to the Wildtype period, symptomatic women admitted in the Alpha period were more likely to require respiratory support (27.2% vs. 20.3%, aOR1.39, 95%CI 1.13-1.78), have pneumonia (27.5% vs. 19.1%, aOR1.65, 95%CI 1.38-1.98) and be admitted to intensive care (11.3% vs. 7.7%, aOR1.61, 95%CI 1.24-2.10). Women admitted during the Delta period had further increased risk of pneumonia (36.8% vs. 27.5%, aOR1.64 95%CI 1.14-2.35). No fully vaccinated pregnant women were admitted between 01/02/2021 when vaccination data collection commenced and 11/07/2021. The proportion of women receiving pharmacological therapies for SARS-CoV-2 management was low, even in those critically ill.

However, the impact of teaching feedback during hematologyoncology training has not been studied. We aimed to identify barriers in delivering and receiving highquality feedback in our fellowship program and to create a curriculum aimed at teaching fellows and faculty how to engage in more effective feedback conversations. Methods: This pilot study aimed at determining and addressing perceived barriers to high-quality feedback in the hematology-oncology fellowship program. A pre-intervention questionnaire, consisting of Likert scale and openended questions, was administered to identify barriers to giving feedback and to assess satisfaction with the quality of feedback received in our fellowship program. The results of the baseline questionnaire were utilized to build a virtual interactive three-session workshop provided by the ASCO Quality Training Program in which the importance of feedback and methods of providing effective feedback were taught. Topics included feedback set-up, low-inference observation, and a structured approach to reinforcing and modifying feedback. One month after the intervention the participants completed a follow up questionnaire. This project was developed through the ASH Medical Educators Institute. Results: Each questionnaire was completed by 11 participants. The two main barriers to high-quality feedback identified were the discomfort with both giving and receiving feedback, and the lack of protected time. At baseline only 54% of the participants reported they were comfortable giving feedback, increasing to 81% post- intervention. Pre-intervention, 81% of participants reported they did not have protected time for feedback, decreasing to 64% after the intervention and institution of weekly protected time for feedback. Half of the participants reported that the feedback was not actionable in the initial questionnaire, decreasing to 10% postintervention. Overall, fellows reported that their feedback was mostly focused on notes, followed by presentations and interpersonal skills. Faculty reported that most of the feedback they received was about time management and patient care. Conclusions: This pilot study helped address a major barrier to improvement and growth within our training program and confirmed that feedback skills must be taught and practiced. A 6-hour virtual workshop showed tangible results in the satisfaction with and quality of feedback given to both fellows and faculty. Our findings are salient as we completed the intervention during the COVID pandemic. Limitations of the study include its single-institutional design and sample size. A major challenge anticipated is sustainability, which will be addressed by maintaining periodic lectures and assigning protected time for feedback.","Schlam, I.; Sewaralthahab, S.; Peravali, M.; Chou, C.; Gilligan, T.

But shortly thereafter, inconsistencies in the results of further clinical trials raised doubts on the efficacy of these agents. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Remdesivir on hospitalized COVID-19 patients' outcomes. Material and methods: This study was an open-label, single-armed, clinical trial on hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had progressive respiratory symptoms despite receiving standard care. All patients received Remdesivir and their characteristics, outcomes, time of treatment initiation, and respiratory support stages during hospitalization were registered and followed up for 14 days. Results: 145 patients with a mean age of 52.89 +- 1.12 years enrolled in this study, 38 (26.2%) died at the end of 14 days period. The mean time interval from the onset of the symptoms to antiviral treatment was 10.63+-0.56 days. Thirty deceased patients (78.9%) were men, showing 2.8 times higher mortality chance compared to women (ORadj=2.77; 95%CI=1.08-7.09). The type of respiratory support on the first day of treatment initiation showed a significantly lower mortality chance in patients receiving O2 only than those who needed non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation (ORadj=3.91; 95%CI=1.64-9.32). The start time (early vs late administration) and duration (less or more than 7 days) of antiviral treatment had no statistically significant association with mortality or ventilation escalation among the patients (p-value > 0.05).

In this study, we aim to increase understanding of the spatial dimensions of new forms of decentralised energy systems that integrate electricity, storage, transportation, and heating. Drawing on workshops and secondary data from three, early-stage case studies funded under a UK government programme, we examine how stakeholders responsible for development construct the ‘local’ in Smart Local Energy System (SLES) demonstrators. We employ three analytical concepts to address this aim: emplacement, place-framing, and place/boundary-making. In terms of emplacement, stakeholders use place-based narratives that draw on distinctive infrastructural, social, ecological, and political characteristics to argue that diverse locations (Oxford city, Oxfordshire, and the Orkney Islands) are ‘suitable’ places for decentralised energy. Stakeholders frame projects around non-local goals of creating technological and business models for replication across the UK and worldwide, even if some community-centred benefits are recognized. Lastly, our findings on place-making show pragmatism in flexing ‘local’ boundaries in order to align with project objectives. The three analytical concepts provide a useful framework to uncover ‘local’ complexities of early-stage decentralised energy projects, and emphasise intersections of space, place, and justice that deserve further scrutiny, notably in later stages of project implementation.","Walker, Chad Devine-Wright Patrick Rohse Melanie Gooding Luke Devine-Wright Hannah Gupta Rajat",Energy Research &amp; Social Science,37,6

It identifies the risks and uncertainties of supply chains exposed by COVID-19 disruptions to businesses.FindingsCOVID-19 has affected Fisher and Paykel Healthcare from both the supply-side (upstream) and demand-side (downstream) perspectives. On the supply side, it has disrupted the supply of raw materials used in the manufacture of respiratory devices and the costs of importing such materials. On the demand side, it has disrupted market logistics and customer demand. This has subsequently affected production. Such disruptions can be overcome through the dissemination of appropriate accounting information for the different stages of the supply chain to the managers. Such accounting information can also be useful to external stakeholders for minimizing their risks.Originality/valueThe study attempts to create an awareness of the supply chain uncertainties faced by managers and stakeholders arising from exogenous shocks, such as a pandemic, and how these uncertainties can be mitigated by aligning accounting information flows with the supply chain activity flows.

Local recombination has been identified in a handful of porin genes to facilitate the rapid adaptation of bacterial cells. It remains unknown whether it is a common evolutionary mechanism in gram-negative bacteria for all or a majority of the outer membrane proteins. In this research, we investigated the β-barrel porin encoding genes in Escherichia coli that were reported under positive Darwinia selection. Besides fhuA that was found with ingenic local recombination predominantly previously, we identified four other genes, i.e., lamB, ompA, ompC and ompF, all showing the similar mosaic evolution patterns as in fhuA. Comparative analysis of the protein sequences disclosed a list of highly variable regions in each protein family, which are mostly located in the convex of extracellular loops and coinciding with the binding sites of various bacteriophages. For each of the porin family, mosaic recombination leads to various combinations of the HVRs with different sequence patterns, generating diverse protein groups. Structure modeling further indicated the conserved global topology for various groups of each porin family, but the extracellular surface varies a lot that is formed by individual or combinatorial HVRs. The conservation of global tertiary structure ensures the channel activity while the wide diversity of HVRs may assist bacteria avoiding the invasion of phages, antibiotics or immune surveillance factors. In summary, the study identified multiple bacterial porin genes with mosaic evolution, a likely general strategy, by which outer membrane proteins could facilitate the host bacteria to both maintain normal life processes and evade the attack of unflavored environmental factors rapidly. Importance Microevolution studies can disclose more elaborate evolutionary mechanisms of genes, appearing especially important for genes with multifaceted function such as those encoding outer membrane proteins. However, in most cases, the gene is considered as a whole unit and the evolutionary patterns are disclosed. In this research, we reported that multiple bacterial porin proteins follow mosaic evolution, with local ingenic recombination combined with spontaneous mutations based positive Darwinia selection, and conservation for most of the other regions. It could represent a common mechanism for bacterial outer membrane proteins. The study also provides insights on development of new anti-bacterial agent or vaccines.","Chen, Xiongbin; Cai, Xuxia; Chen, Zewei; Wu, Jinjin; Hao, Gaofeng; Luo, Quan; Zhu, Guoqiang; Koester, Wolfgang; White, Aaron P; Cai, Yi; Wang, Yejun",bioRxiv,37,23

An undirected cell and body distribution of nanocarriers can lead to unwanted delivery to other immune cell types like macrophages reducing the vaccine efficacy. An often-used approach to overcome this issue is the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with targeting moieties, such as antibodies, mediating cell type-specific interaction. Numerous studies could successfully prove the targeting efficiency of antibody-conjugated carrier systems in vitro, however, most of them failed when targeting DCs in vivo that is partly due to cells of the reticuloendothelial system unspecifically clearing nanocarriers from the blood stream via Fc receptor ligation. Therefore, this study shows a surface functionalization strategy to site-specifically attach antibodies in an orientated direction onto the nanocarrier surface. Different DC-targeting antibodies, such as anti-CD11c, anti-CLEC9A, anti-DEC205 and anti-XCR1, were conjugated to the nanocarrier surface at their Fc domains. Anti-mouse CD11c antibody-conjugated nanocarriers specifically accumulated in the targeted organ (spleen) over time. Additionally, antibodies against CD11c and CLEC9A proved to specifically direct nanocarriers to the targeted DC subtype, conventional DCs type 1. In conclusion, site-directed antibody conjugation to nanocarriers is essential in order to avoid unspecific uptake by non-target cells while achieving antibody-specific targeting of DC subsets. This novel conjugation technique paves the way for the development of antibody-functionalized nanocarriers for DC-based vaccination approaches in the field of cancer immunotherapy.","Simon, Johanna; Fichter, Michael; Kuhn, Gabor; Brückner, Maximilian; Kappel, Cinja; Schunke, Jenny; Grabbe, Stephan; Landfester, Katharina; Mailänder, Volker",bioRxiv,37,10

The results of the study showed that the transformations introduced in the organisation and realisation of the learning process were on the whole positively estimated by students, which means that the elements of distance learning should remain after the end of the lockdown restrictions. However, more research is needed to evaluate the diagnostic tools for preventing academic dishonesty.","Melnychenko, A.; Zheliaskova, T.",Advanced Education,37,28

In Brazil, one of the countries most severely impacted throughout the pandemic, a complex dynamics involving variants co-circulation and turnover events has been recorded with the emergence and spread of VOC Gamma in Manaus in late 2020. In this context, we present a genomic epidemiology investigation based on samples collected between December 2020 and May 2021 in the second major Brazilian metropolis, Rio de Janeiro. By sequencing 244 novel genomes through all epidemiological weeks in this period, we were able to document the introduction and rapid dissemination of VOC Gamma in the city, driving the rise of the third local epidemic wave. Molecular clock analysis indicates this variant has circulated locally since the first weeks of 2021 and only seven weeks were necessary for it to achieve a frequency above 70%, consistent with rates of growth observed in Manaus and other states. Moreover, a Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction indicates VOC Gamma spread throughout Brazil between December 2020 and January 2021, and that it was introduced in Rio de Janeiro through at least 13 events coming from nearly all regions of the country. Comparative analysis of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values provide further evidence that VOC Gamma induces higher viral loads (N1 target; mean reduction of Ct: 2.7, 95% CI = 2.0 - 3.4). This analysis corroborates the previously proposed mechanistic basis for this variant enhanced transmissibility and distinguished epidemiological behavior. Our results document the evolution of VOC Gamma and provide independent assessment of scenarios previously studied in Manaus, therefore contributing to the better understanding of the epidemiological dynamics currently being surveyed in other Brazilian regions.","Moreira, F.

The lockdown approach was adopted as a containment strategy as the disease itself has manifested severe social, economic, and psychiatric implications. Objectives To explore the perception and preparedness of international medical students residing in university hostels amid the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Design A semi-structured interview guide was developed in this qualitative study design. All the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and then analyzed for thematic contents by standard content analysis framework. Setting Interviews were conducted in university hostels in Punjab, Pakistan. Participants A total of 11 international medical students were interviewed face-to-face through the purposive sampling technique to obtain in-depth individual viewpoints. Results The thematic content analysis yielded five major themes: Familiarity with COVID-19, Perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19, Preparedness for safety against COVID-19, Barriers to lifestyle, and Psychological perspectives. A better general perception and preparedness among international medical students regarding COVID-19 was found. Good knowledge regarding the overview of COVID-19; adequate preventive approaches such as social distancing, use of masks, gloves, and sanitizers; and compliance with the lockdown measures were reported by the respondents. The pertinent issue raised by the respondents is the disturbance in normal routine due to distortion in social life and isolation that may cause psychological stress. Conclusions The findings from this study lighten the peoples perspectives that help the government to prepare public health strategies based on population-focused approaches. The present study demonstrates the respondents opinion on COVID-19 management by personal hygiene, social distancing, and complying with the lockdown measures. Furthermore, it demands that timely and evidence-based teaching-learning techniques should be adopted for students engagement which ensures mental health and self-motivation as well. Therefore, they can utilize their time productively which could have a long-term effect on their careers and healthcare services.","Khadka, S.; Usman, M.; Saleem, M.; Ali, M.; Rasheed, H.; Giri, S.; Saeed, H.

Even in 2021, countries are being ravaged by the virus, with no immediate end in sight. In fast-moving and uncertain situations, leaders face many questions for which they might not have any answers (Argenti, 2020). Therefore, the question is how leaders can manage the communication environment with clarity, consistency and empathy during this period of extreme disruption (Glinska, 2020). Crisis communication is generally defined as the accumulation and dissemination of information during crisis situations to alleviate the severity of the crisis. This study outlines and analyses the communication strategies and measures adopted by the management of one of the biggest manufacturing industries of the country, the Steel Authority of India Limited, Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), during this ongoing COVID-19 crisis. A survey on the efficacy of the communication measures adopted by the management was conducted on 345 employees. The results showed a high level of support for all the implemented communication measures. Yet employees at the junior level articulated a need for better communication exchange with the top management. They perceived their voices as going unheard and sought additional communication channels connecting them to the highest authority. Considering the feedback received from the employees, additional communication measures were adopted. RSP’s Mass Contact Exercise was revived in an online format. A mobile app was developed containing all information and guidelines that an employee would need regarding precautions, prevention, testing and treatment of COVID-19. Quick and clear communication at every juncture let RSP tide through arguably the toughest pandemic period. Thus, it should always be ensured that appropriate communication channels are effectively implemented for vital information to reach every corner of the organization.","Chattaraj, Dipak Mohanty Seemita Satpathy Archana",Vikalpa,37,8

Announcement abnormal returns are estimated using an event study methodology and the relation of ESG performance to shareholder value creation is tested with univariate and multivariate cross-sectional regressions.FindingsThis study provides evidence for a significant negative value effect of ESG performance for the shareholders of acquiring firms during the entire sample period. The negative effect appears to be stronger, as the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. This suggests that, during the pandemic-driven economic turmoil, the costs of sustainability activities outweigh any possible gains, providing evidence in support of the overinvestment hypothesis.Research limitations/implicationsThe results of the study have important implications for firms, investors and policymakers. Firms should be more cautious with regard to extensive investments in ESG activities, particularly during economic turmoil. For shareholders, the results suggest that ESG engagement is not a resilience factor in an exogenous shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of policymaking, the sustainability disclosure framework should remain voluntary allowing firms to report material ESG-related issues.

All nonessential travel, businesses, sporting activities and schools were closed. The elderly were advised to cocoon. The roadmap to easing the restrictions started in May. The lockdown measures resulted in people spending more time indoors, with impact on social and personal wellbeing This had the potential to increase alcohol consumption, self inflicted injuries and neglect. The purpose of our study is to analyze the variations in orthopedic trauma presentations during the pandemic compared to similar period in 2018 and 2019 Method: Retrospective data was collected from Orthopedic theatre registry of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co Louth, Ireland Patients operated by orthopedic trauma team in three months period (March, April & May) in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were selected for analysis and comparison Result: Total number of surgeries performed in March-May 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 551, 505 and 373 showing a significant reduction in 2020 as compared to previous years. Trauma surgeries performed on children in March-May 2018,2019 and 2020 were 132,131 and 90 respectively showing a similar downward trend.

Consequently, methodologically the official, public, and ethic research data were triangulated to analyze the Ministry’s understanding on educational equity in Finland. Discussion involved global pandemic ethic principles (transparency, participation, review and revisability). Hermeneutic methodology revealed imbalances. Ministry of Education and Culture failed regionally, as well as qualitatively, in its quantitative by-the-book policy. As the main finding, pandemic ethics were generally ignored by the Ministry. Ethic principles were not recognized – or were neglected. Furthermore, Ministry’s decision-making was unconditional, instead of being participatory and revising. Lacking transparency was revealed in rhetoric of “several” children, or probable “likelihood”, without argumentation. However, the policy could have been revisable with increasing evidence. Epistemic imbalances and hermeneutic injustice occurred regionally and qualitatively. Those involved all, both the vulnerable, and gifted pupils.

This book brings together case studies of the most influential of these foundations over the last one hundred years: the Rockefeller, Ford, and Gates’ Foundations, investigating their impact on education and research, health and agriculture. The book concludes by asking whether global south foundations such as Al Waleed Philanthropies, Tata Trusts, and those from China may point to the future of global philanthropic foundations. The sheer scale of resources that foundations can devote to their work results in significant influence in global politics, to the point that Foundations can drive and even set government policy.

This paper reports on FASD prevalence in a small sample. Methods: A two-phase active case ascertainment study was conducted in three mainstream primary schools in Greater Manchester, UK. Schools were located in areas that ranged from relatively deprived to relatively affluent. Initial screening of children aged 8-9 years used pre-specified criteria for elevated FASD risk (small for age; special educational needs; currently/previously in care; significant social/emotional/mental health symptoms). Screen positive children were invited for detailed ascertainment of FASD using gold standard measures. Results: Of 220 eligible children, 50 (23%) screened positive and 12% (26/220) proceeded to phase-two assessment. Twenty had a developmental disorder, four had FASD and four were assessed as possible FASD. The crude prevalence rate of FASD in these schools was 1.8% (95%CI: 1.0%,3.4%) and when including possible cases was 3.6% (2.1%,6.3%).

Despite the strong criticisms and deep-rooted concerns with the insufficiency of government response to Covid-19, together with a limited availability of PCR testing, the government’s concentration on the treatment of more serious patients, its focus on prevention of cluster transmission, and its soft lockdown without any legal sanctions might be sufficient to achieve the primary goal of keeping the death toll to the minimum. However, it is not clear whether it could be ultimately successful as the pandemic continues to unfold, nor is it clear whether Japan could respond effectively to the outbreak of a much more deadly disease in the future. The Japanese unique approach against Covid-19 might work out to prevent pandemic outbreaks and medical system collapse, but some problems and challenges remain. Japan surely needs to re-evaluate its response to Covid-19 and reconsider, in a holistic and systematic way, the entire infectious disease prevention system and the possibility of emergency powers during a public health crisis. © the several contributors 2021.","Ono, T.; Matsui, S.",Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts,37,16

Substitutions in the spike glycoprotein (S), such as Asn501Tyr and Glu484Lys, are likely key in several VOC. However, Asn501Tyr circulated for months in earlier strains and Glu484Lys is not found in B.1.1.7, indicating that they do not fully explain those fast-spreading variants. Here we use a computational systems biology approach to process more than 900,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, map their spatiotemporal relationships, and identify lineage-defining mutations followed by structural analyses that reveal their critical attributes. Comparisons to earlier dominant mutations and protein structural analyses indicate that increased transmission is promoted by epistasis, i.e., the combination of functionally complementary mutations in S and in other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We report that the VOC have in common mutations in non-S proteins involved in immune-antagonism and replication performance, such as the nonstructural proteins 6 and 13, suggesting convergent evolution of the virus. Critically, we propose that recombination events among divergent coinfecting haplotypes greatly accelerates the emergence of VOC by bringing together cooperative mutations and explaining the remarkably high mutation load of B.1.1.7. Therefore, extensive community distribution of SARS-CoV-2 increases the probability of future recombination events, further accelerating the evolution of the virus. This study reinforces the need for a global response to stop COVID-19 and future pandemics.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in critically ill adults with COVID[ndash]19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: COV[ndash]BARRIER was a global, phase 3, randomised, double[ndash]blind, placebo[ndash]controlled trial in patients with confirmed SARS[ndash]CoV[ndash]2 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04421027). This addendum trial added a critically ill cohort not included in the main COV[ndash]BARRIER trial. Participants on baseline IMV/ECMO were randomly assigned 1:1 to baricitinib 4[ndash]mg (n=51) or placebo (n=50) for up to 14 days in combination with standard of care (SOC). Prespecified endpoints included all[ndash]cause mortality through days 28 and 60, and number of ventilator[ndash]free days, duration of hospitalisation, and time to recovery through day 28. Efficacy and safety analyses included the intent[ndash]to[ndash]treat and safety populations, respectively. Findings: SOC included baseline systemic corticosteroid use in 86% of participants. Treatment with baricitinib significantly reduced 28[ndash]day all[ndash]cause mortality compared to placebo (39[middot]2% vs 58[middot]0%; hazard ratio [HR]=0[middot]54 [95%CI 0[middot]31[ndash]0 [middot]96]; p=0[middot]030). One additional death was prevented for every six baricitinib[ndash]treated participants. Significant reduction in 60[ndash]day mortality was also observed (45[middot]1% vs 62[middot]0%; HR=0[middot]56 [95%CI 0[middot]33[ndash]0[middot]97]; p=0[middot]027). Baricitinib[ndash]treated participants showed numerically more ventilator[ndash]free days (8.1 vs 5.5 days, p=0.21) and spent over 2 days less in the hospital than placebo[ndash]treated participants (23[middot]7 vs 26[middot]1 days, p=0[middot]050). The rates of infections, blood clots, and adverse cardiovascular events were similar between treatment arms. Interpretation: In critically ill patients with COVID[ndash]19 already receiving IMV/ECMO, treatment with baricitinib as compared to placebo (in combination with SOC, including corticosteroids) showed mortality HR of 0[middot]56, corresponding to a 44% relative reduction at 60 days. This is consistent with the mortality reduction observed in less severely ill hospitalised primary COV[ndash]BARRIER study population. Funding: Eli Lilly and Company. Research in context Evidence before this study We evaluated current and prior studies assessing the efficacy and safety of interventions in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and searched current PubMed using the terms [quot]COVID[ndash]19[quot], [quot]SARS[ndash]CoV[ndash]2[quot], [quot]treatment[quot], [quot]critical illness[quot], [quot]invasive mechanical ventilation[quot], [quot]baricitinib[quot], and [quot]JAK inhibitor[quot] for articles in English, published until December 1, 2020, regardless of article type. We also reviewed the NIH and IDSA COVID[ndash]19 guidelines and reviewed similar terms on clinicaltrials.gov. When the critical illness addendum study to COV[ndash]BARRIER study was designed, there was only one open[ndash]label study of dexamethasone showing mortality benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID[ndash]19 requiring IMV. Small studies of interleukin[ndash]6 inhibitors had shown no effect and larger trials were underway. Guidelines recommended use of dexamethasone with or without remdesivir and recommended against the use of interleukin[ndash]6 inhibitors, except in a clinical trial. Overall, there were no reported double[ndash]blind, placebo[ndash]controlled phase 3 trials which included corticosteroids as part of SOC investigating the efficacy and safety of novel treatments in the NIAID[ndash]OS 7 population. Baricitinib[apos]s mechanism of action as a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor was identified as a potential intervention for the treatment of COVID[ndash]19 given its known anti[ndash]cytokine properties and potential antiviral mechanism for targeting host proteins mediating viral endocytosis Data from the NIAID sponsored ACTT[ndash]2 trial showed that baricitinib when added to remdesivir improved time to recovery and other outcomes including mortality compared to placebo plus remdesivir. A numerically larger proportion of participants who received baricitinib plus remdesivir showed an improvement in ordinal scale compared to those who received placebo plus remdesivir at day 15 in participants requiring IMV (NIAID[ndash]OS score of 7) at baseline. We designed COV[ndash]BARRIER, a phase 3, global, double[ndash]blind, randomised, placebo[ndash]controlled trial, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in combination with SOC (including corticosteroids) for the treatment of hospitalised adults with COVID[ndash]19 who did not require mechanical ventilation (i.e., NIAID[ndash]OS 4[ndash]6). A significant reduction in mortality was found after 28 days between baricitinib and placebo (HR 0[middot]57, corresponding to a 43% relative reduction, p=0[middot]0018); one additional death was prevented per 20 baricitinib[ndash]treated participants. In the more severely ill NIAID[ndash]OS 6 subgroup, one additional death was prevented per nine baricitinib[ndash]treated participants (HR 0[middot]52, corresponding to a 48% relative reduction, p=0[middot]0065). We therefore implemented an addendum to the COV[ndash]BARRIER trial to evaluate the benefit/risk of baricitinib in the critically ill NIAID[ndash]OS 7 population and considered the sample size of 100 participants sufficient for this trial. Added value of this study This was the first phase 3 study to evaluate baricitinib in addition to the current standard of care (SOC), including antivirals, anticoagulants, and corticosteroids, in patients who were receiving IMV or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at enrolment. This was a multinational, randomised, double[ndash]blind, placebo[ndash]controlled trial in regions with high COVID[ndash]19 hospitalisation rates. Treatment with baricitinib reduced 28[ndash]day all[ndash]cause mortality compared to placebo (HR 0[middot]54, 95% CI 0[middot]31[ndash]0[middot]96; nominal p=0[middot]030), corresponding to a 46% relative reduction, and significantly reduced 60[ndash]day all[ndash]cause mortality (HR 0[middot]56, 95% CI 0[middot]33[ndash]0[middot]97; p=0[middot]027); overall, one additional death was prevented per six baricitinib[ndash]treated participants. Numerical improvements in endpoints such as number of ventilator[ndash]free days, duration of hospitalisation, and time to recovery were demonstrated. The frequency of serious adverse events, serious infections, and venous thromboembolic events was similar between baricitinib and placebo, respectively. The COV[ndash]BARRIER study overall trial results plus these COV[ndash]BARRIER addendum study data in mechanically ventilated and ECMO patients provide important information in context of other large, phase 3 randomised trials in participants with invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline. The RECOVERY study reported mortality of 29[middot]3% following treatment with dexamethasone compared to 41[middot]4% for usual care (rate ratio of 0[middot]64, corresponding to a 36% relative reduction) and 49% mortality in participants who received tocilizumab compared to 51% for usual care (rate ratio of 0[middot]93, corresponding to a 7% relative reduction). The ACTT[ndash]2 study reported 28[ndash]day mortality of 23[middot]1% and 22[middot]6% in the baricitinib plus remdesivir and placebo plus remdesivir groups, respectively, in this critically ill patient population; however, the primary outcome of this trial was time to recovery, so was not powered to detect a change in mortality. Implications of all the available evidence In this phase 3 addendum trial, baricitinib given in addition to SOC (which predominantly included corticosteroids) had a significant effect on mortality reduction by 28 days in critically ill patients, an effect which was maintained by 60 days. These data were comparable with those seen in the COV[ndash]BARRIER primary study population of hospitalised patients, but which excluded patients who required IMV or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at enrolment. These findings suggest that baricitinib has synergistic effects to other SOC treatment modalities including remdesivir and dexamethasone. Based on the available evidence, baricitinib is a novel treatment option to decrease mortality in hospitalised, critically ill patients with COVID[ndash]19 even when started late in the disease process after steroids, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO have already been implemented.","Ely, E.

Real-time prediction is key to prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections. Contacts between individuals drive infections, yet most prediction frameworks fail to capture the dynamics of contact. We develop a real-time machine learning framework that incorporates dynamic patient contact networks to predict patient-level hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs), which we test and validate on international multi-site datasets spanning epidemic and endemic periods. Methods. Our framework extracts dynamic contact networks from routinely collected hospital data and combines them with patient clinical attributes and background contextual hospital data to forecast the infection status of individual patients. We train and test the HOCI prediction framework using 51,157 hospital patients admitted to a UK (London) National Health Service (NHS) Trust from 01 April 2020 to 01 April 2021, spanning UK COVID-19 surges 1 and 2. We then validate the framework by applying it to data from a non-UK (Geneva) hospital site during an epidemic surge (40,057 total inpatients) and to data from the same London Trust from a subsequent period post surge 2, when COVID-19 had become endemic (43,375 total inpatients). Findings. Based on the training data (London data spanning surges 1 and 2), the framework achieved high predictive performance using all variables (AUC-ROC 0.89 [0.88-0.90]) but was almost as predictive using only contact network variables (AUC-ROC 0.88 [0.86-0.90]), and more so than using only hospital contextual (AUC-ROC 0.82 [0.80-0.84]) or patient clinical (AUC-ROC 0.64 [0.62-0.66]) variables. The top three risk factors we identified consisted of one hospital contextual variable (background hospital COVID-19 prevalence) and two contact network variables (network closeness, and number of direct contacts to infectious patients), and together achieved AUC-ROC 0.85 [0.82-0.88]. Furthermore, the addition of contact network variables improved performance relative to hospital contextual variables on both the non-UK (AUC-ROC increased from 0.84 [0.82-0.86] to 0.88 [0.86-0.90]) and the UK validation datasets (AUC-ROC increased from 0.52 [0.49-0.53] to 0.68 [0.64-0.70]). Interpretation. Our results suggest that dynamic patient contact networks can be a robust predictor of respiratory viral infections spreading in hospitals. Their integration in clinical care has the potential to enhance individualised infection prevention and early diagnosis.","Myall, A. C.; Price, J. R.; Peach, R.

We aimed to explore whether the social media information could help surveil and understand the characteristics of unmet non-COVID-19 health needs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan city. Methods: This was an observational study based on social media data. The study period was set during the 3 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. Non-COVID-19 urgent and emergent health needs in Wuhan city were derived from Sina Weibo-one of China's largest social media platforms. Lag Spearman correlation was used to investigate the epidemiological relationship between the COVID-19 outbreak and non-COVID-19 health needs. Patient's primary diseases and needed care were annotated and categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision. The delay time in seeking help was calculated and compared. Results: After screening 114,795 Weibo posts, a total of 229 patients with non-COVID-19 health needs were included in our study. There were significant correlations between the daily number of COVID-19 cases at a 10-day lag, deaths at a 5-day lag, and non-COVID-19 Weibo. The actual number of non-COVID-19 patients with urgent and emergent health needs was estimated to be about 6,966. Patients with non-COVID-19 health needs were skewed to those aged 50 to 70 years. The non-COVID-19 diseases were diverse, with 46.3% as non-neoplastic diseases and 53.7% as neoplasms. The most needed cares were palliative cancer care (22.7%), chemotherapy (18.8%), and critical care (17.0%). The median delay in seeking help was 3 days [interquartile range (IQR), 1 to 15 days] for acute care, and 18.5 days (IQR, 6 to 30 days) for cancer care. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings in Wuhan city indicated that the social media data might provide a viable option to surveil and understand the unmet health needs during an outbreak. Those heterogeneous health needs derived from the social media data might inspire a more resilient healthcare system to address the unmet needs promptly.","Yang, W. F.; Zheng, D. P.; Cheng, R. C.

Based on our analysis of data from a survey conducted in the United States, we find that DCs meaningfully predicted both operational levels and revenue. Furthermore, while the empirical literature suggests that SME size is positively related to DC efficacy, we found that this effect was reversed during COVID-19, as the positive link between DCs and performance was stronger for smaller SMEs.","Clampit, Jack A.; Lorenz, Melanie P.; Gamble, John E.; Lee, Jim",International Small Business Journal,37,33

We analyze in this article the mortality of the infection, the mortality rates of the disease the differences and importance between the estimated mortality and the counted mortality and, finally, the mortality commixed between influenza and COVID-19. The global IMR figures that are more in line with reality are approximately 0.7%. The true rate is likely to vary by geographic region. The mortality figures of the first wave were affected by the low diagnostic capacity as diagnostic tests by PCR were highly restricted. There were probably many more patients affected and died by COVID-19 than those reported, leading to an underestimation of mortality, explaining in the Spanish case the discrepancies between the excess mortality figures and the official figures reported by the Ministry of Health from Spain. A provisional summary of global hospital mortality from COVID-19 is 15% to 20%, but this figure can exceed 40% in patients admitted to the ICU. In any case, mortality rates vary between the different cohorts, reflecting differences in the confirmation of infection and identification of cases, different thresholds for hospitalization, and differences in prognosis. Hospital mortality ranges from less than 5% of hospitalized patients under 40 years of age to 35% for patients between 70 and 79 years of age and greater than 60% for patients in the age range of 80 to 89 years. The failure of civil society and its political leaders, by not taking the proper steps seriously to prevent viral transmission, has made nations more vulnerable. While the upcoming distribution of effective vaccines is undoubtedly a factor of hope for 2021, it must be said that this solution will not arrive soon enough to avoid the continued increase in hospitalizations.

However, it is widely acknowledged that the effects of focal cortical stimulation on behaviour can vary substantially between participants and even from trial to trial within individuals. Here we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in alertness can account for the variability in behavioural and neurophysiological responses to TMS. We combined single-pulse TMS with neural recording via electroencephalography (EEG) to quantify changes in motor and cortical reactivity with fluctuating levels of alertness defined objectively on the basis of ongoing brain activity. We observed rapid, non-linear changes in TMS-evoked neural responses – specifically, motor evoked potentials and TMS-evoked cortical potentials – as EEG activity indicated decreasing levels of alertness, even while participants remained awake and responsive in the behavioural task. IMPACT STATEMENT A substantial proportion of inter-trial variability in neurophysiological responses to TMS is due to spontaneous fluctuations in alertness, which should be controlled for during experimental and clinical applications of TMS.","Noreika, Valdas; Kamke, Marc R.; Canales-Johnson, Andrés; Chennu, Srivas; Bekinschtein, Tristan A.; Mattingley, Jason B.",bioRxiv,37,26

Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) appears to be an excellent model for the study of the relationship between viral-induced immunodeficiency and chronic disease development. (C57BL/6 x A/J)F1 mice surviving acute hepatitis develop a chronic disease characterized by T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies, viral persistence in various organs including the brain, spleen and thymus, and death within 3 months postinfection (p.i.). We have reported that T- or B-cell deficiencies, observed in MHV3 chronically infected (C57BL/6 x A/J)F1 mice, can be partially or totally thwarted by adoptive transfer of CD4+, CD8+ and/or B cells, at 15 days p.i. in mice surviving the acute phase of the disease. Adoptive transfer of syngeneic CD4+ and/or CD8+ allowed a partial restoration of the T-cell deficiencies, as characterized by thymic atrophy, decrease in splenic T cells, and in all thymocyte subpopulations. B-cell immunodeficiency, as defined by a decrease in splenic B cells, as well as in the bone marrow pre-B- and B-cell compartments, and the occurrence of abnormally larger forms of bone marrow pre-B and B cells, were partially thwarted by B-cell treatment only. Splenic B cells and the bone marrow B-cell compartment, respectively, returned partially or totally to normal values, whereas the pre-B-cell compartment remained depleted in infected mice treated with B cells. Levels of all immunoglobulin classes returned to normal values in MHV3 chronically infected mice when treated with CD4+ in combination with CD8+ cells. All T- and/or B-cell treatments, however, were sufficient to thwart the process of the chronic disease, and favoured the survival of mice for up to 6 months p.i.","Lamontagne, L; Jolicoeur, P; Decarie, D; Menezes, J",,37,5

Likelihood ratios convert a clinical opinion of pre-test probability to post-test probability, independently of prevalence of disease in the test population. METHODS: The authors examined results of PPA (Positive Percent Agreement, sensitivity) and NPA (Negative Percent Agreement, specificity) from 73 laboratory experiments for molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 as reported to the FIND database, and for two manufacturers’ claims in FDA EUA submissions. PPA and NPA were converted to likelihood ratios to calculate post-test probability of disease based on clinical opinion of pre-test probability. Confidence intervals were based on the number of samples tested. An online calculator was created to help clinicians identify false-positive, or false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results for COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Laboratory results from the same test methods did not mirror each other or the manufacturer. Laboratory studies showed PPA from 17% to 100% and NPA from 70.4% to 100%. The number of known samples varied 8 to 675 known patient samples, which greatly impacted confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: Post-test probability of the presence of disease (true-positive or false-negative tests) varies with clinical pre-test probability, likelihood ratios and confidence intervals.

METHODS Peripheral blood from 162 cases of SARS, 30 cases of mycoplasma pneumonia and 30 healthy adult volunteers were measured for the number of total B cells (CD19+ B cell), CD5 positive B cells (B1 cell) and mean fluorescent intensity of CD40 on B cell (CD40MF) using tri-color flow cytometry to analyze the distribution of the above parameters in SARS, mycoplasma pneumonia and healthy adult volunteers and their relation to the severity of SARS. RESULTS The number of total B cells of clinically diagnosed SARS was (292 +/- 181) x 10(6)/L, significantly greater than that of healthy adults which was (200 +/- 65) x 10(6)/L (F = 6.17, P < 0.05) but smaller than that of patients infected with mycoplasma pneumonia which was (359 +/- 168) x 10(6)/L (F = 6.28, P < 0.05).

To date, no reports compare the efficacy of spinal anesthesia (SA) with that of GA for laparoscopic hernia repairs. The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical outcome of TEP inguinal hernia repair performed when the patient was treated under SA with that performed under GA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July 2015 and July 2016, 50 patients were prospectively randomized to either the GA TEP group (Group I) or the SA TEP group (Group II). Propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium, sevoflurane, and tracheal intubation were used for GA. Hyperbaric bupivacaine (15 mg) and fentanyl (10 µg) were used for SA to achieve a sensorial level of T3. Intraoperative events related to SA, operative and anesthesia times, postoperative complications, and pain scores were recorded. Each patient was asked to evaluate the anesthetic technique by using a direct questionnaire filled in 3 months after the operation. RESULTS All the procedures were completed by the allocated method of anesthesia as there were no conversions from SA to GA. Pain was significantly less for 1 h (P<0.0001) and 4 h (P=0.002) after the procedure for the SA and GA groups, respectively. There was no difference between the two groups regarding complications, hospital stay, recovery, or surgery time. Generally, patients were more satisfied with SA than GA (P<0.020). CONCLUSION TEP inguinal hernia repair can be safely performed under SA, and SA was associated with less postoperative pain, better recovery, and better patient satisfaction than GA.","Donmez, Turgut; Erdem, Vuslat Muslu; Sunamak, Oguzhan; Erdem, Duygu Ayfer; Avaroglu, Huseyin Imam",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,37,28

RECENT FINDINGS During the review period there have been new reports on the prevalence, clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of dementia in its various forms, epidemiological findings on depression, and psychological autopsy analyses of suicidal behaviors and psychiatric morbidities. New studies in social psychiatry have been conducted, especially on the trends of transgenerational support of the elderly and of interventions that may reduce psychiatric disease burdens and promote mental health in later life. SUMMARY These research findings support a better understanding of the prevalence, nature, and underlying risk and protective factors of the major psychiatric morbidities in the studied regions. Further exploration of the epidemiological profile of mental disorders in rural areas, research on the direct and indirect costs of psychogeriatric conditions, and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability of early detection programs, treatment and rehabilitation models are warranted.","Chiu, Helen Fung-Kum; Tsoh, Joshua; Lam, Linda Chiu-Wa",Current opinion in psychiatry,37,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five male patients were evaluated; 4 presented with obstructive jaundice and 1 had unexplained loss of weight. The mean age was 66 years (range, 40 to 77). All had CT scan abdomen imaging which did not show any obvious pancreatic tumour. EUS with FNA was done for all cases when indicated. Surgical findings, if any, were obtained and compared to EUS findings. RESULTS EUS easily detected the pancreatic tumour in all 5 cases. The tumour sizes detected ranged from 27 to 40 mm in diameter. These corresponded fairly accurately with that of surgical findings for all 3 who had surgery. EUS reported 3 cases with pathological lymph node involvement. All 5 cases were confirmed by FNA or surgery. EUS was also accurate in 4 cases, which reported the absence of portal vein or superior mesenteric vein invasion. Surgical documentation could not verify the fifth case. There were no complications at all from the EUS with/without FNA. CONCLUSION This case series showed that EUS with/without FNA appears to be useful and safe in diagnosing and staging pancreatic head tumours not detectable by CT scanning.","Yim, H B; Yap, W M; Chong, P Y","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",37,16

These pandemic viral diseases originated in South East Asia. Many human and animal lives were lost. Economic damages due to the pandemics were also very large. The question arises of why did the pandemics originate from South East Asian areas. Human influenza A consists of many sub-types of coronaviruses including the SARS virus and the avian influenza (H5N1) that are all variants of RNA of avian coronavirus. Variants are formed during infection of a coronavirus through not only birds but also mammals, including human beings. There are hot spots where viral infection rates are accelerated among birds, mammals and human beings. Suspicious areas are in South East Asia, where living conditions of birds, mammals and human beings are so close that there are always risks of viral infection. When we see the living conditions of farmers in southern China, northern Vietnam, Laos and northern Myanmar, they commonly raise ducks/chickens with pigs sharing ponds into which they discharge household wastewater, including human excreta, and pig excreta that are significant carriers of viruses. Bird faeces are also key carriers of the viruses. In the ponds, they raise ducks and conduct fish culture. Other important players are migrating birds from North Asia, which are principal vectors of avian influenza viruses. There is an urgent necessity of improving human and ecological health in South East Asia to control viral infection among birds, mammals and human beings. We can hinder the vicious cycle of virus infection through water contamination in ponds by providing good human, pig and chicken sanitation. It is easy to provide good sanitation practices for human, pigs and chickens, introducing collection and treatment of excreta. Our modern water technology can find good solutions for the problem.","Matsui, S",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,37,16

Extended-host-range variants of MHV strain A59 were previously obtained from persistently infected cells (J. H. Schickli, B. D. Zelus, D. E. Wentworth, S. G. Sawicki, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 71:9499-9504, 1997). These variant viruses contain several mutations in the S protein that confer to the viruses the ability to enter cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner (C. A. de Haan, Z. Li, E. te Lintelo, B. J. Bosch, B. J. Haijema, and P. J. M. Rottier, J. Virol. 79:14451-14456, 2005). While the parental MHV-A59 is fully dependent on murine CEACAM1a for its entry, viruses carrying the variant mutations in the amino-terminal part of their S protein had become dependent on both CEACAM1a and heparan sulfate. Substitutions in a restricted, downstream part of the S protein encompassing heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) and putative fusion peptide (FP) did not alter the CEACAM1a dependence. However, when the mutations in both parts of the S protein were combined, the resulting viruses became independent of CEACAM1a and acquired the extended host range. In addition, these viruses showed a decreased binding to and inhibition by soluble CEACAM1a. The observations suggest that the amino-terminal region of the S protein, including the receptor-binding domain, and a region in the central part of the S protein containing HR1 and FP, i.e., regions far apart in the linear sequence, communicate and may even interact physically in the higher-order structure of the spike.","de Haan, Cornelis A M; Te Lintelo, Eddie; Li, Zhen; Raaben, Matthijs; Wurdinger, Tom; Bosch, Berend Jan; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,37,5

Yet few studies (to date) have specifically addressed risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a high-risk subgroup of older US adults having one or more chronic diseases. Our hypothesis is that medications having 'off-target' anti-inflammatory effects may play a role in modulating the immune response in COVID-19 infection. We analyzed baseline risk factors associated with respiratory failure or death in 55 older adult US military veterans hospitalized for COVID-19 infection during (March-June 2020) the peak of the pandemic in New Jersey. Fifty-three percent (29/55) of patients experienced respiratory failure and thirty-one percent (17/55) died. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, baseline neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P=0.0035) and body mass index (P=0.03) were significant predictors of the risk for respiratory failure. Age (P=0.05) and non-use (vs. use) of psychotropic medications having serotonin 2A receptor antagonist properties (odds ratio 5.06; 95% confidence intervals 1.18-21.7; P= 0.029) was each a significant predictor of an increased risk of death. There was a significant interaction effect of age and non-use (vs.. use) of psychotropic serotonin 2A receptor antagonist medications on the odds ratio (OR) for death (P=0.011). In selected, ventilator-dependent COVID-19 pneumonia patients treated with psychotropic serotonin 2A receptor antagonist medications to control agitation and ICU delirium, there was an apparent positive association between medication use and significant rise in the absolute lymphocyte count and decrease in the neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio. Taken together, these data are the first to suggest that certain psychotropic medications used in the treatment of chronic psychiatric illness and/or for acute delirium are inversely associated with mortality in severe COVID-19 infection by unknown mechanism which may involve (in part) immunomodulatory effects.","Zimering, Mark B; Razzaki, Tanzila; Tsang, Tiffany; Shin, John J","Endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism journal",37,22

Earlier studies from our and other groups identified two regions of the TGEV S (220K) protein possibly implicated in such functions. The first of these corresponds to the 224 amino acid N-terminal region which is deleted in PRCV, the respiratory variant of TGEV. We have examined the pathogenicity for the newborn piglet of a series of neutralization escape mutants encoding an S protein mutated in this region. Several amino acid changes were correlated with a dramatic loss of enterovirulence, thus indicating that crucial determinants are associated with this domain of S. The second region of potential relevance is the major neutralization domain. Baculovirus-vectored expression of 150 to 220 amino acid-long stretches encompassing this region, which is encoded by both TGEV and PRCV, was performed. The resultant recombinant proteins were shown to react with the cognate antibodies and to bind APN specifically, thus localizing the receptor-binding site on the S primary structure. Altogether these data lend support to the view that a domain of S protein structurally distinct from the receptor binding site is required for the virus to express its enteric tropism.","Laude, H; Godet, M; Bernard, S; Gelfi, J; Duarte, M; Delmas, B",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,37,6

METHODS Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected from 1185 hospitalized children with ALRTI at the People's Hospital of Hunan province, between September 2008 and October 2010. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to screen for coronavirus NL63, which is a 255 bp fragment of a part of N gene. All positive amplification products were confirmed by sequencing and compared with those in GenBank. RESULTS The overall frequency of coronavirus NL63 infection was 0.8%, 6 (60%) out of the coronavirus NL63 positive patients were detected in summer, 2 in autumn, 1 in spring and winter, respectively. The patients were from 2 months to two and a half years old. The clinical diagnosis was bronchopneumonia (60%), bronchiolitis (30%), and acute laryngotracheal bronchitis (10%). Four of the 10 cases had critical illness, 4 cases had underlying diseases, and 7 cases had mixed infection with other viruses. The homogeneity of coronavirus NL63 with those published in the GenBank at nucleotide levels was 97%-100%. CONCLUSION Coronavirus NL63 infection exists in hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Changsha. Coronavirus NL63 infections are common in children under 3 years of age. There is significant difference in the infection rate between the boys and the girls: the boys had higher rate than the girls. The peak of prevalence of the coronavirus NL63 was in summer. A single genetic lineage of coronavirus NL63 was revealed in human subjects in Changsha. Coronavirus NL63 may also be one of the lower respiratory pathogen in China.","Zhang, Fei; Zhang, Bing; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Gao, Han-Chun; Zhao, Xin; Zhong, Li-Li; Zhou, Qiong-Hua; Hou, Yun-De; Duan, Zhao-Jun",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,37,5

In mammals, passive immunity is provided by neutralizing antibodies passed to the offspring via the placenta or the milk as immunoglobulin G and secreted immunoglobulin A. With the long-term goal of producing virus-resistant livestock, we have generated mice carrying transgenes that encode the light and heavy chains of an antibody that is able to neutralize the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM). MHV-JHM causes acute encephalitis and acute and chronic demyelination in susceptible strains of mice and rats. Transgene expression was targeted to the lactating mammary gland by using the ovine beta-lactoglobulin promoter. Milk from these transgenic mice contained up to 0.7 mg of recombinant antibody/ml. In vitro analysis of milk derived from different transgenic lines revealed a linear correlation between antibody expression and virus-neutralizing activity, indicating that the recombinant antibody is the major determinant of MHV-JHM neutralization in murine milk. Offspring of transgenic and control mice were challenged with a lethal dose of MHV-JHM. Litters suckling nontransgenic dams succumbed to fatal encephalitis, whereas litters suckling transgenic dams were fully protected against challenge, irrespective of whether they were transgenic. This demonstrates that a single neutralizing antibody expressed in the milk of transgenic mice is sufficient to completely protect suckling offspring against MHV-JHM-induced encephalitis.","Kolb, A F; Pewe, L; Webster, J; Perlman, S; Whitelaw, C B; Siddell, S G",Journal of virology,37,16

In these enveloped viruses, the filamentous nucleocapsid is formed by the association of nucleocapsid (N) protein with single-stranded viral RNA. The N protein is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein also implicated in viral genome replication and in modulating cell signaling pathways. We describe the structure of the two proteolytically resistant domains of the N protein from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype coronavirus. These domains are located at its N- and C-terminal ends (NTD and CTD, respectively). The NTD of the IBV Gray strain at 1.3-A resolution exhibits a U-shaped structure, with two arms rich in basic residues, providing a module for specific interaction with RNA. The CTD forms a tightly intertwined dimer with an intermolecular four-stranded central beta-sheet platform flanked by alpha helices, indicating that the basic building block for coronavirus nucleocapsid formation is a dimeric assembly of N protein. The variety of quaternary arrangements of the NTD and CTD revealed by the analysis of the different crystal forms delineates possible interfaces that could be used for the formation of a flexible filamentous ribonucleocapsid. The striking similarity between the dimeric structure of CTD and the nucleocapsid-forming domain of a distantly related arterivirus indicates a conserved mechanism of nucleocapsid formation for these two viral families.","Jayaram, Hariharan; Fan, Hui; Bowman, Brian R; Ooi, Amy; Jayaram, Jyothi; Collisson, Ellen W; Lescar, Julien; Prasad, B V Venkataram",Journal of virology,37,9

The structures at the 3' end of the viral genome are highly conserved among divergent flaviviruses, suggesting that they may function as cis-acting signals for RNA replication and, as such, might specifically bind to cellular or viral proteins. UV cross-linking experiments were performed to identify the proteins that bind with the JEV plus-strand 3' noncoding region (NCR). Two proteins, p71 and p110, from JEV-infected but not from uninfected cell extracts were shown to bind specifically to the plus-strand 3' NCR. The quantities of these binding proteins increased during the course of JEV infection and correlated with the levels of JEV RNA synthesis in cell extracts. UV cross-linking coupled with Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the p110 and p71 proteins were JEV NS5 and NS3, respectively, which are proposed as components of the RNA replicase. The putative stem-loop structure present within the plus-strand 3' NCR was required for the binding of these proteins. Furthermore, both proteins could interact with each other and form a protein-protein complex in vivo. These findings suggest that the 3' NCR of JEV genomic RNA may form a replication complex together with NS3 and NS5; this complex may be involved in JEV minus-strand RNA synthesis.","Chen, C J; Kuo, M D; Chien, L J; Hsu, S L; Wang, Y M; Lin, J H",Journal of virology,37,16

After instrumentation and recording baseline data, diarrhea and dehydration were induced by administering milk replacer [16.5 mL/kg of body weight (BW), PO], sucrose (2 g/kg in a 20% aqueous solution, p.o.), spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg, PO) every 8 h, and furosemide (2 mg/kg, i.m., q6h). Calves were administered sucrose and diuretic agents for 48 h to induce diarrhea and severe dehydration. Clinical changes after 48 h were severe watery diarrhea, severe depression, and marked dehydration (mean, 14% BW loss). Cardiac output, stroke volume, mean central venous pressure, plasma volume, thiocyanate space, blood pH and bicarbonate concentration, base excess, serum chloride concentration, and fetlock temperature were decreased. Plasma lactate concentration, hematocrit, and serum potassium, creatinine, phosphorus, total protein and albumin concentrations were increased. This non-infectious calf diarrhea protocol has a 100% response rate, while providing a consistent and predictable hypovolemic state with diarrhea that reflects most of the clinicopathologic changes observed in osmotic/maldigestive diarrhea caused by infection with rotavirus, coronavirus or cryptosporidia. Limitations of the protocol, when compared to infectious diarrhea models, include failure to induce a severe metabolic acidosis, absence of hyponatremia, renal instead of enteric loss of chloride, renal as well as enteric loss of free water, absence of profound clinical depression and suspected differences in the morphologic and functional effect on intestinal epithelium. Despite these differences, the sucrose/diuretic protocol should be useful in the initial screening of new treatment modalities for calf diarrhea. To confirm their efficacy, the most effective treatment methods should then be examined in calves with naturally-acquired diarrhea.","Walker, P G; Constable, P D; Morin, D E; Drackley, J K; Foreman, J H; Thurmon, J C",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,37,31

Despite widespread implementation, there is little robust evidence about cost-effectiveness, clinical benefits, and impact on quality and safety of critical care telemedicine. The primary objective was to determine the impact of critical care telemedicine (with clinical decision support available 24/7) on intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality and length of stay in adults and children. The secondary objectives included staff and patient experience, costs, protocol adherence, and adverse events. METHODS Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library databases, Health Technology Assessment Database, Web of Science, OpenGrey, OpenDOAR, and the HMIC through to December 2015. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were eligible for inclusion. Eligible studies reported on differences between groups using the telemedicine intervention and standard care. Two review authors screened abstracts and assessed potentially eligible studies using Cochrane guidance. RESULTS Two controlled before-after studies met the inclusion criteria. Both were assessed as high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible as we were unable to disaggregate data between the two studies. One study used a non-randomised stepped-wedge design in seven ICUs. Hospital mortality was the primary outcome which showed a reduction from 13.6 % (CI, 11.9-15.4 %) to 11.8 % (CI, 10.9-12.8 %) during the intervention period with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.40 (95 % CI, 0.31-0.52; p = .005).

This article offers a critical analysis of the Physician Charter from the perspective of the traditional values of medicine as articulated in medical oaths and championed by leaders of past generations, exemplified by William Osler. The authors argue that medical professionalism should reflect the values of a virtue-based ethic that stresses compassion and beneficence, rather than the values of a duty-based ethic.

Little is known about the mucosal and systemic sites of replication and lesions which follow an aerosol exposure to H. parasuis. In this experiment 5-week-old cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs were inoculated intranasally with an inoculum containing 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units of H. parasuis. Two principals and one control pig were necropsied at 12, 36, 84, and 108 hours postinoculation (PI) and samples obtained for bacteriologic culture and microscopic examination. Inoculated pigs developed clinical signs of inappetence, reluctance to move, lameness, and a serous nasal discharge. Macroscopic findings included a fibrinous polyserositis and polyarthritis 36 hours PI which became progressively more severe at 84 and 108 hours PI. No lung lesions were grossly visible. Microscopic lesions included a mild purulent rhinitis at each post inoculation interval and fibrinous to fibrinopurulent synovitis and serositis at 36, 84, and 108 hours PI. A focal suppurative bronchopneumonia was observed in one pig examined at 36 hours PI. The nasal cavity and trachea were the only mucosal sites from which H. parasuis was reisolated. Haemophilus parasuis was isolated from the blood and systemic sites at 36, 84, and 108 hours PI.

During viral and target cell membrane fusion, the heptad repeat (HR) regions of the S2 subunit assume a trimer-of-hairpins structure, positioning the fusion peptide in close proximity to the C-terminal region of the ectodomain. The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes; however, the exact mechanism is unclear. Here, we characterize an aromatic amino acid rich region within the ectodomain of the S2 subunit that both partitions into lipid membranes and has the capacity to perturb lipid vesicle integrity. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that peptides analogous to the aromatic domains of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the human CoV OC43 S2 subunits, did not have a propensity for a defined secondary structure. These peptides strongly partitioned into lipid membranes and induced lipid vesicle permeabilization at peptide/lipid ratios of 1:100 in two independent leakage assays. Thus, partitioning of the peptides into the lipid interface is sufficient to disorganize membrane integrity. Our study of the S2 aromatic domain of three CoVs provides supportive evidence for a functional role of this region. We propose that, when aligned with the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains during membrane apposition, the aromatic domain of the CoV S protein functions to perturb the target cell membrane and provides a continuous track of hydrophobic surface, resulting in lipid-membrane fusion and subsequent viral nucleocapsid entry.","Sainz, Bruno; Rausch, Joshua M; Gallaher, William R; Garry, Robert F; Wimley, William C",Biochemistry,37,33

We report the identification of a second nsP3 mutant from among the A complementation group of Sindbis virus (SIN) heat-resistant strain, ts RNA-negative mutants. The ts138 mutant possessed a change of G4303 to C, predicting an Ala68-to-Gly alteration that altered a conserved His-Ala-Val tripeptide in the ancient (pre-eukaryotic), ""X"" or histone 2A phosphoesterase-like macrodomain that in SIN encompasses nsP3 residues 1 to 161 and whose role is unknown. We undertook comparative analysis of three nsP3 N-terminal region mutants and observed (i) that nsP3 and nsP2 functioned initially as a single unit as deduced from complementation analysis and in agreement with our previous studies, (ii) that the degree of phosphorylation varied among the nsP3 mutants, and (iii) that reduced phosphorylation of nsP3 correlated with reduced minus-strand synthesis. The most striking phenotype was exhibited by ts4 (Ala268 to Val), which after shift to 40 degrees C made significantly underphosphorylated P23/nsP3 and lost selectively the ability to make minus strands. After shift to 40 degrees C, mutant ts7 (Phe312 to Ser) made phosphorylated P23/nsP3 and minus strands but failed to increase plus-strand synthesis. Macrodomain mutant ts138 was intermediate, making at 40 degrees C partially phosphorylated P23/nsP3 and reduced amounts of minus strands. The mutants were able to assemble their nsPs at 40 degrees C into complexes that were membrane associated. Our analyses argue that P23/P123 phosphorylation is affected by macrodomain and Ala268 region sequences and in turn affects the efficient transcription of the alphavirus genome.","Dé, Indra; Fata-Hartley, Cori; Sawicki, Stanley G; Sawicki, Dorothea L",Journal of virology,37,6

The presenting symptoms of dialysis patients were similar to the controls. With appropriate protection measures, hemodialysis was performed in a dedicated area of the SARS isolation ward, while PD was continued as intermittent PD. In all seven patients with PD effluent tested, SARS-related coronavirus (CoV) could not be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture. Three dialysis patients had persistent positive stool PCR after 5 wk, whereas all nondialysis patients had negative stool PCR after 1 wk. Despite dosage adjustment, ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia was more severe in the dialysis patients. Dialysis patients required longer hospitalization than the controls, but the mortality was similar. With appropriate protective measures, dialysis could be safely performed. Dialysis patients with SARS often require prolonged hospitalization. Furthermore, these patients may have an extended period of viral shedding, which should be carefully monitored for the purpose of infection control.","Kwan, Bonnie Ching-Ha; Leung, Chi-Bon; Szeto, Cheuk-Chun; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Cheng, Yuk-Lun; Yu, Alex Wai-Yin; Li, Philip Kam-Tao",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,37,17

SOURCES OF DATA Articles published on this subject between 1999 and 2005 were searched in the MEDLINE database. Books, manuals and statements on child environmental health, issued by institutions such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, were also reviewed. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS There has been a growing concern in the last few years with the exposure of children to environmental chemicals. Around 85,000 synthetic chemicals are produced today, and 2,800 of them are mass-produced. There is little knowledge regarding their effects on developing organisms. Children have a greater exposure to environmental pollutants than adults, because their metabolic needs and behaviors (e.g.: crawling, bringing objects to the mouth, playing closer to the ground) put them at special risk of contact with chemicals when they breathe, eat, drink or play. Heavy metals, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants and, at home, environmental tobacco smoke have been associated with the increasing number of diseases such as asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders and childhood cancer. CONCLUSION Screening of risk situations using tools such as Environmental History has been stimulated alongside a greater commitment of pediatricians towards measures that can reduce the exposure of children and adolescents to environmental chemicals.","Mello-da-Silva, Carlos Augusto; Fruchtengarten, Ligia",Jornal de pediatria,37,30

Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that PABP2 was predominantly a cytoplasmic soluble protein in healthy plants. However, in TuMV-infected plants, a subpopulation of PABP2 was membrane associated or was localized in the nucleus. Confocal microscopy experiments indicated that PABP2 was partially retargeted to the nucleolus in the presence of TuMV VPg-Pro. In addition, the membrane association of PABP2 during TuMV infection resulted from the internalization of the host protein in 6K-VPg-Pro-induced vesicles, as shown by a combination of confocal microscopy and sucrose gradient fractionation experiments. This redistribution of an important translation initiation factor to the nucleolus and to membrane structure likely underlies two important processes of the TuMV replication cycle.","Beauchemin, Chantal; Laliberté, Jean-François",Journal of virology,37,5

Despite this progress, early readmission rates after PD have been reported as high as 50%. Few reports have delineated factors associated with readmission after PD. METHODS The medical records of 6 high-volume institutions were reviewed for patients who underwent PD between 2005 and 2010. Data collection included patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, and perioperative factors. Analysis included readmissions up to 90 days after PD. RESULTS A total of 1302 patients underwent PD across all institutions. The 30-day and 90-day readmission rates were 15% and 19%, respectively. The most common reasons for 30-day readmission included infectious complications (n = 65) and delayed gastric emptying (n = 29). The most common reasons for readmission after 90 days included wound infections and intra-abdominal abscess (n = 75) and failure to thrive (n = 38). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher readmission rates included a preoperative diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, higher transfusion requirements, and postoperative complications including intra-abdominal abscess and pancreatic fistula (all P < 0.02). Factors not associated with higher readmission rates included advanced age, body mass index, cardiovascular/pulmonary comorbidities, diabetes, steroid use, Whipple type (standard vs pylorus preserving PD), preoperative endobiliary stenting, and vascular reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS These multi-institutional data represent a large experience of PD without the biases typically of single center studies. Factors related to infection, nutritional status, and delayed gastric emptying were the most common reasons for readmission after PD. Postoperative complications including pancreatic fistula predicted higher rates of readmission.","Ahmad, Syed A; Edwards, Michael J; Sutton, Jeffrey M; Grewal, Sanjeet S; Hanseman, Dennis J; Maithel, Shishir K; Patel, Sameer H; Bentram, David J; Weber, Sharon M; Cho, Clifford S; Winslow, Emily R; Scoggins, Charles R; Martin, Robert C; Kim, Hong Jin; Baker, Justin J; Merchant, Nipun B; Parikh, Alexander A; Kooby, David A",Annals of surgery,37,17

The aim of this statement is to outline the profiles of the medical legal liability, with a focus on the figure of the vaccinating physician, in criminal, civil, and disciplinary terms, based on the Italian legislation in force. The vaccinating doctor responds for his work in the field of vaccination in the same way as any other health service should perform (diagnostic, therapeutic, etc.). Helpful in this context is the adoption of the L. 76/2021; it was developed to find a balance between safeguarding the person privacy and greater guarantees for the doctor. This law introduces a criminal shield that can put a limit to litigation, curbing the phenomenon of so-called defensive medicine. The climate of uncertainty and fear of legal repercussions for the doctors, and the constant updating and redefinition of the indications of operability in the vaccination campaigns, underline the need to focus on the knowledge of the responsibilities and the safeguard of the vaccinating doctors. In addition to the regulatory cornerstones, the statement also addresses the issue of informed consent and the role of the occupational doctor as a central figure in the vaccination campaign in the workplace.","Beccia, Flavia; Amantea, Carlotta; Rossi, Maria Francesca; Daniele, Alessandra; Santoro, Paolo Emilio; Borrelli, Ivan; Marazza, Marco; Boccia, Stefania; Ricciardi, Walter; Moscato, Umberto",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,37,1

A cDNA representing the nucleocapsid protein (VP-1) gene located at the 3' terminus of the viral genome (E. K. Godeny, D. W. Speicher, and M. A. Brinton, Virology 177:768-771, 1990) hybridized to viral genomic RNA of about 13 kb plus seven subgenomic RNAs ranging in size from about 1 to about 3.6 kb. Two other cDNA clones hybridized only to the four or five largest subgenomic RNAs, respectively. In contrast, two cDNAs encoding continuous open reading frames with replicase and zinc finger motifs hybridized only to the genomic RNA. The replicase motif exhibited 75% amino acid identity to that of the 1b protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV) and 44% amino acid identity to those of the 1b proteins of coronaviruses and Berne virus. Combined, the results indicate that LDV replication involves formation of a 3'-coterminal-nested set of mRNAs as observed for coronaviruses and toroviruses as well as for EAV, with which LDV shares many other properties. Overall, LDV, like EAV, possesses a genome organization resembling that of the coronaviruses and toroviruses.

Although present in infected cells, there was no VP70 in purified virus. Trypsin treatment of infected cells removed 80 to 90% of VP70 as well as its products VGP48 and GP26. This suggested that most of the VP70 in the cell is located on the plasma membrane. The glycoproteins of purified RS virus (GP1, VGP48 and GP26) contain mannose, galactose and fucose as well as glucosamine, but the quantity of mannose in GP1 is low when compared to that of the other three sugars. The effects that follow the treatment of infected cells with the glycosylation inhibitors tunicamycin and monensin, and the treatment of the immunoprecipitated product of pulse-chase experiments with endonuclease H demonstrated that VP70 and its products contained N-linked oligosaccharides, and that the oligosaccharides of the mature VGP48 subunit were of the complex type, while GP1 contained both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. The non-glycosylated forms of VP70 and GP1 have estimated mol. wt. of 50K and 33K respectively.

We systematically review the medical literature in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of colorectal ESD. Patients and methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid, CINAHL, and Cochrane for studies reporting on the clinical efficacy and safety profile of colorectal ESD. Results: Included in this study were 13833 tumors in 13603 patients (42 % female) who underwent colorectal ESD between 1998 and 2014. The R0 resection rate was 83 % (95 % CI, 80 - 86 %) with significant between-study heterogeneity (P < 0.001) which was partly explained by difference in continent (P = 0.004), study design (P = 0.04), duration of the procedure (P = 0.009), and, marginally, by average tumor size (P = 0.09). Endoscopic en bloc and curative resection rates were 92 % (95 % CI, 90 - 94 %) and 86 % (95 % CI, 80 - 90 %), respectively. The rates of immediate and delayed perforation were 4.2 % (95 % CI, 3.5 - 5.0 %) and 0.22 % (95 % CI, 0.11 - 0.46 %), respectively, while rates of immediate and delayed major bleeding were 0.75 % (95 % CI, 0.31 - 1.8 %) and 2.1 % (95 % CI, 1.6 - 2.6 %). After an average postoperative follow up of 19 months, the rate of tumor recurrence was 0.04 % (95 % CI, 0.01 - 0.31) among those with R0 resection and 3.6 % (95 % CI, 1.4 - 8.8 %) among those without R0 resection. Overall, irrespective of the resection status, recurrence rate was 1.0 % (95 % CI, 0.42 - 2.1 %). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis, the largest and most comprehensive assessment of colorectal ESD to date, showed that colorectal ESD is safe and effective for colorectal tumors and warrants consideration as first-line therapy when an expert operator is available.","Akintoye, Emmanuel; Kumar, Nitin; Aihara, Hiroyuki; Nas, Hala; Thompson, Christopher C",Endoscopy international open,37,17

Approaches such as the Wells-Riley equation, competing-risks model, and Von Foerster equation are used to prioritize control-measure efforts. Here we formulate how to integrate those three different types of functional relationship to construct easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret critical-control lines that help determine optimally the intervention strategies for containing airborne infections. We show that a combination of assigned effective public health interventions and enhanced engineering control measures would have a high probability for containing airborne infection. We suggest that integrated analysis to enhance modelling the impact of potential control measures against airborne infections presents an opportunity to assess risks and benefits. We demonstrate the approach with examples of optimal control measures to prioritize respiratory infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, measles, and chickenpox.","Liao, C M; Chen, S C; Chang, C F",Epidemiology and infection,37,24

Studies of sublethal virus infections of aged mice closely mirror the human situation: there is a delay in clearance of virus. The delay in virus clearance is accompanied by a delay and a decrease in T-cell response, particularly of CD8(+) T cells. Intrinsic alterations of T cells of aged mice contribute to this decrease in virus-specific T-cell response; however, evidence suggests that environmental or innate components of the aged host also influence this age-associated decline in clearance of virus. While the changes in the adaptive immune response have been carefully described, the early events in the generation of the T-cell response after virus infection have received limited attention. Importantly, age-associated changes in the innate response to virus infection, particularly production of and response to interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta, cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production by natural killer cells, interleukin-12 induction, and depletion of non-specific T cells early during virus infection need further evaluation.","Murasko, Donna M; Jiang, Jiu",Immunological reviews,37,1

BACKGROUND Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) dramatically demonstrates the global havoc that can be wreaked by a newly emerging infectious disease. The current literature either has a predominantly biomedical focus or deals with the psychological impact on healthcare workers. Published studies on the lived experience of nurses caring for SARS patients are currently lacking. DESIGN A phenomenological design. METHODS Using methods consistent with Husserl's philosophy, eight Registered Nurses working in three regional hospitals in Hong Kong were invited to participate in sharing their lived experience of caring for SARS patients and data were analysed using Colaizzi's approach. RESULTS The three major themes explicated were: the various emotions experienced in caring for SARS patients, the concept of uncertainty and revisiting the 'taken for granted' features of nursing. CONCLUSION These themes, when taken together, describe the essence of the voyage undertaken by nurses who cared for SARS patients during the outbreak. The findings of this study indicate that extensive and ongoing support is needed to prepare and enable nurses to care for SARS patients during a crisis and make it easier for nurses to deal with the various uncertainties. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The essence of caring for SARS patients is highlighted in this study. The experience of caring for SARS patients prompts nurses to find meaning in their experience(s), and to develop knowledge and attitudes on how best to care for patients and prepare for a new crisis in the future. This paper considers a more in-depth understanding of the lived experience of nurses during the crisis and the relevance of this perspective for education and support of nurses.","Chung, Betty Pui Man; Wong, Thomas Kwok Shing; Suen, Esther Suk Bing; Chung, Joanne Wai Yee",Journal of clinical nursing,37,33

Maintaining people's functional capacity as they grow older is essential to provide quality of life for the years they have gained, acting on factors that are modifiable and therefore subject to intervention, such as frailty. This is why it was one of the prioritised interventions in the Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy of the Spanish NHS, which began in 2013. In the collective effort to meet the challenge of addressing frailty, the Autonomous Communities and Cities (AACC) have played a key role in implementing actions on the prevention of frailty and falls in the elderly. The 2019 evaluation of the 3 Consensus document on frailty and falls prevention among the elderly showed very positive data, with high or very high implementation in the AACC. The COVID-19 pandemic has also conditioned the approach to frailty. Frailty has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of illness and death, while COVID-19 has been shown to be a frailty generator. To facilitate the care of the elderly and the approach to frailty, the Ministry of Health, within the EPSP Frailty and Falls Working Group, developed the document of Recommendations for the approach to frailty in the health crisis situation generated by the COVID-19. The future of the approach to frailty in the EPSP is set out in the Roadmap for Addressing Frailty, developed in the framework of the EPSP and the ADVANTAGE Joint Action, which aims to contribute to making frailty a public health priority and to promote its approach at population and individual level, including prevention, early population detection and surveillance/monitoring, from an integrated and coordinated model of care, without forgetting the strengthening of training and research. In the current situation of tension in the socio-health system, which has manifested itself since the COVID-19 crisis, it is necessary to articulate how to continue to provide quality care, not only for the acute situation, but also for other situations such as frailty, care for chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes and physical, mental and social needs. A disability-free life expectancy must be based on the promotion of active and healthy ageing to ensure that older people maintain maximum functional capacity. To this end, it is essential to assess and prevent or reverse frailty, avoiding progression to disability and further overburdening of the system, individuals, families and society as a whole.","Pola Ferrández, Elena; Justo Gil, Soledad; Zuza Santacilia, Inés; Gil Tarragato, Sara; Campos Esteban, Pilar",Revista espanola de salud publica,37,8

In an ELISA against FECV and FIPV, the activity against both viruses was removed at the same rate; thus, no FIPV-specific antibodies could be identified. By gel electrophoresis-derived ELISA, the responses of cats surviving FIPV exposure were compared with those of cats succumbing to FIPV exposure to determine whether survival could be correlated with an antibody response against a particular virus protein. Results indicated that both groups responded in the same way to the matrix envelope protein and nucleocapsid proteins. Even though the response to peplomer in each group was weak, the survivor group responded better to this protein. Furthermore, the response of this group to the peplomer protein had the highest correlation with virus neutralization titer.","Ingersoll, J D; Wylie, D E",American journal of veterinary research,37,16

With respect to naturally occurring animal disease outbreaks, North America, while not as adversely affected by epizootics as other regions, has had its fair share of such outbreaks of both 'traditional' and emerging animal diseases. The traditional category includes such diseases as anthrax, classical swine fever, bluetongue, brucellosis, foot and mouth disease, and the family of equine encephalomyelitis viruses. The emerging diseases include relatively more recent culprits such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, poultry enteritis mortality syndrome, and newly discovered examples of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Additionally, several serious diseases of human beings that involve animal vectors or reservoirs occur naturally in North America or have emerged in recent decades; these include plague, hantavirus, monkeypox, West Nile virus and avian-derived influenza. At the same time, there have been very few intentional attacks on livestock using biological agents and no recorded cases in North America of animals intentionally being used to transmit disease to humans. According to the historical record, therefore, naturally occurring emerging zoonoses probably constitute the greatest threat in terms of biological disasters with animal origins. However, some of the general trends in terrorist activity, such as the intensification of activities by animal rights extremists against facilities undertaking animal research, mean that the possibility of intentional animal-related biological disasters should not be discounted.","Ackerman, G A; Giroux, J",Revue scientifique et technique,37,28

METHODS The retrospective analyses were made on 12 dead cases and 32 recovered cases with SARS. RESULTS The mean age was 67 years old in 12 dead cases with SARS and was 42 in recovered control group. There were 1-5 other basic diseases in 5 cases of death group. The states of dead patients were severe and the deterioration of patients' condition was rapid. The CD 4 and CD 8 T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were (416.6+/-235.0) cells/microl and (296.1+/-181.5)cells/microl in survival patients and (143.8+/-78.1)cells/microl, (103.6+/-63.2) cells/microl in dead patients, they often decreased compared to the normal values, especially in dead cases. Five cases were infected with bacteria in 12 dead cases, among them 3 were infected with fungus and 2 were septicemia. In dead group, the occurrence rates of electrolyte maladjustment and kidney injury were 41.67 percent. Invasive ventilation was used in 10 cases and death rate was 80.0 percent, among them 5 patients were infected with bacteria. None was dead in the patients with non-invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION The age and basic diseases are the main mortal risk factors in SARS. Other risk factors include the decline of immune function, secondary infection, complications and use of invasive ventilation.","Liu, Hui-yuan; Shi, Yu-ming",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,37,19

This population is known to have a high incidence of dental disease, but unfortunately oral health is a significant unmet health need in many cases.

Undergraduate students receive hands-on clinical training in dental management of persons with disabilities, the majority of whom have a developmental disability and could receive care in a community-based dental practice. This program has been successful, but access to community care is still an issue for the population served. Two new initiatives have been introduced in an attempt to develop personal links between persons with disabilities and future dentists, the first a series of lectures given by persons with disabilities and the second a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness of the need for dental care for persons with disabilities. Among other activities, the organization sponsors a community-based event called Sharing Smiles Day, which brings together dental students and persons with disabilities in a carnival-like setting where the emphasis is on personal interactions. Dental preventive education is also provided but is of secondary importance.

Although IBV has been indicated as a possible cause of the formation of calcium stones in the epididymus of roosters, a definitive association has not been confirmed. This report describes the detection of IBV and aMPV in the testes of roosters from a Brazilian poultry broiler breeder's flock with epididymal stones and low fertility. Samples of testis, trachea, and lungs from breeder males aged 57 wk were positive for IBV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation and testis samples were also positive for aMPV by RT-PCR. The inoculation of testis samples into embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic cavity resulted in curled, hemorrhagic, and stunted embryos typical of IBV infection. The allantoic fluid was positive by RT-PCR aimed to amplify the region coding for the S1 subunit of the IBV S gene, but it was not positive for aMPV. Sequence analysis of the amplified fragment revealed a close relationship with European IBV genotype D274, previously unreported in Brazil. These results indicate that IBV and perhaps aMPV are likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of the testicular disease described and should be regarded as factors that can influence male fertility disease in chickens.","Villarreal, L Y B; Brandão, P E; Chacón, J L; Assayag, M S; Maiorka, P C; Raffi, P; Saidenberg, A B S; Jones, R C; Ferreira, A J P",Avian diseases,37,27

PS-SPCLs have been surveyed for furin, proprotein convertase (PC)2, PC1/3, and PACE4 and proven efficient to identify potent peptidyl inhibitors in the low nanomolar range for furin and PC1/3. We report herein the screenings of nonamidated and acetylated hexapeptide PS-SPCLs for PC5/6A and PC7. The L-configuration library surveys distinctively revealed that L-Arg, L-Lys, and sometimes L-His in all six positions would generate the most potent inhibitors for both enzymes. Based on this clear polybasic preference, L-poly-Arg peptides ranging from four to nine residues were assayed. Inhibitory potency of these polybasic peptides increased with chain length, making nona-l-Arg a potent nanomolar inhibitor of PC5/6A and PC7 (Ki of 150 and 120 nM). PC5/6 and PC7 inhibition by nona-l-arginine was equivalent to that of furin (Ki of 114 nM) (J Biol Chem 275: 36741-36749, 2000). Nona-d-arginine was a more potent inhibitor of PC5/6 and PC7 than its levorotatory version (Ki of 19 and 81 nM), reminiscent of furin (Ki of 1.3 nM) (J Biol Chem 279:36788-36794, 2004). Our data indicate that certain poly-arginine peptides represent potent inhibitors targeting PCs of the constitutive secretory pathway (furin, PC5/6, and PC7). We conclude that basic residues within PC peptide inhibitors might be responsible for targeting PCs in general and for inhibitory potency, but that select amino acid changes will be necessary to acquire true specificity toward a single PC.","Fugere, Martin; Appel, Jon; Houghten, Richard A; Lindberg, Iris; Day, Robert",Molecular pharmacology,37,12

In addition to the genome, infected cells contain subgenomic mRNAs that form a 3' co-terminal nested set with the genome. In addition to their common 3' ends, the genome and the subgenomic mRNAs contain an identical 5' leader sequence. The transcription mechanism that coronaviruses use to produce subgenomic mRNA is not known and has been the subject of speculation since sequencing of the subgenomic mRNAs showed they must arise by discontinuous transcription. The current model called leader-primed transcription has subgenomic mRNAs transcribed directly from genome-length negative strands. It was based on the failure to find in coronavirus infected cells subgenome-length negative strands or replication intermediates containing subgenome-length negative strands. Clearly, these structures exist in infected cells and are transcriptionally active. We proposed a new model for coronavirus transcription which we called 3' discontinuous extension of negative strands. This model predicts that subgenome-length negative strands would be derived directly by transcription using the genome RNA as a template. The subgenome-length templates would contain the common 5' leader sequence and serve as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs. Our findings include showing that: 1. Replication intermediates (RIs) containing subgenome-length RNA exist in infected cells and are separable from RIs with genome-length templates. The RFs with subgenome-length templates are not derived by RNase treatment of RIs with genome-length templates. 2. The subgenome-length negative strands are formed early in infection when RIs are accumulating and the rate of viral RNA synthesis is increasing exponentially. 3. Subgenome-length negative strands contain at their 3' ends a complementary copy of the 72 nucleotide leader RNA that is found in the genome only at their 5' end. 4. RIs with subgenomic templates serve immediately as templates for transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. Because subgenomic mRNAs are not replicated, i.e., copied into negative strands that in turn are used as templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis, we propose that the subgenome-length negative strands must arise directly by transcription of the genome and acquire their common 3' anti-leader sequence after polymerase jumping from the intergenic regions to the leader sequence at the 5' end of the genome. This would make negative strand synthesis discontinuous and subgenomic mRNA synthesis continuous, which is the opposite of what was proposed in the leader primed model.","Sawicki, S G; Sawicki, D L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,37,14

MATERIAL OF STUDY From January 2003 to July 2013, 20 patients were treated by laparoscopic approach for distal pancreatic lesions. Nine patients underwent laparoscopic pancreatic tumorectomy (LPT) (Group A) for insulinoma (mean lesion diameter 1.2 cm, range, 0.5-2) and 11 patients underwent spleen preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (SP-LDP) (Group B) for ductal adenocarcinoma (pT1N0R0) (1), cystic mucinous neoplasm (5), serous cystadenoma (4) and lymphoepithelial cysts (1). RESULTS Mean operative time was 94.3 minutes (range 80-110) for Group A and 164 minutes (range 90-240) for Group B. Intraoperative bleeding occurred in 4 cases (20%) and was easily controlled by laparoscopy. Conversion to open surgery was not required in any case. Morbidity was observed in 2 patients (18%) in Group A: pancreatic fistula (1) and peritoneal fluid collection (1); and a peritoneal fluid collection occurred in one patients (11%) in Group B. Mean hospital stay was 6.8 days (range 3-11) in Group A and 6.5 days (range 3-10) in Group B. Mortality was nil. At a mean follow-up of 82 months (range 15-141) local recurrence and distant metastases were not observed. DISCUSSION LDP is a valid treatment showing the same rate of complication to open surgery but allowing the advantages of a minimally invasive procedure.

Accurately quantifying thrombotic risk may assist prognosis and guide appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Observational studies have estimated the rate of thrombosis in both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19, and how this corresponds to the severity of illness. In this review, we provide an overview of the incidence and prevalence of arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19 and highlight the limitations in the studies to date. Asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and those with mild symptoms are at very low risk of thrombotic complications. However, rates of thrombosis are substantially increased in hospitalised patients, and are strikingly high in those patients who are critically-ill requiring treatment on the intensive care unit and especially those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinicians managing such patients need to be aware of these risks and take appropriate steps with respect to thromboprophylaxis and heightened clinical vigilance. Large prospective observational studies will more accurately quantify thrombotic rate, and randomized controlled trials are currently investigating optimal thromboprophylactic strategies.","Jenner, William J; Gorog, Diana A",J. thromb. thrombolysis,37,24

We assessed whether the implementation of a home treatment algorithm - designed based upon on a pathophysiologic and pharmacologic rationale - during the initial, mild phase of COVID-19, could effectively reduce hospital admissions. MethodsThis fully academic, matched-cohort study evaluated outcomes in 108 consecutive consenting patients with mild COVID-19 managed at home by their family doctors from January 2021 to May 2021, according to the proposed treatment algorithm and in 108 age-, sex-, and comorbidities-matched patients who were given other therapeutic schedules (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04854824). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. ResultsOne (0.9%) patient in the recommended cohort and 12 (11.1%) in the control cohort were admitted to hospital (P=0.0136). The proposed algorithm reduced, by 85%, the cumulative length of hospital stays (from 141 to 19 days) and related costs (from {euro} 60.316 to {euro} 9.058). Only 9.8 patients needed to be treated with the recommended algorithm to prevent one hospitalization event. The rate of resolution of major symptoms was numerically, but not significantly, higher in the recommended compared to the control cohort (97.2% versus 93.5%, respectively; P=0.322). Other symptoms lingered in a lower proportion of patients in the recommended than in the control cohort (20.4% versus 63.9%, respectively; P<0.001), and for a shorter period. ConclusionThe adoption of the proposed outpatient treatment algorithm during the early, mild phase of COVID-19 reduced the incidence of subsequent hospitalization and related costs.","Consolaro, Elena; Suter, Fredy; Rubis, Nadia; Pedroni, Stefania; Moroni, Chiara; Pasto, Elena; Paganini, Maria Vittoria; Pravettoni, Grazia; Cantarelli, Umberto; Perico, Norberto; Perna, Annalisa; Peracchi, Tobia; Ruggenenti, Piero; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",,37,17

We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23 ± 6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87 ± 4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","Zou, Xiaojing; Li, Shusheng; Fang, Minghao; Hu, Ming; Bian, Yi; Ling, Jianmin; Yu, Shanshan; Jing, Liang; Li, Donghui; Huang, Jiao",Crit. care med,37,1

Methods: Surgical techniques were performed ex vivo using the electrosurgical device, scalpel, and mechanized drill on the muscle and bone of commercially available chicken. The liquid and gas dynamics were observed using a high-speed high-resolution Photron SA5 camera (0.125 to 8 ms temporal resolution, 0.016 to 0.054 mm/pixel spatial resolution) and stroboscopic lighting (Veritas 120 E LED Constellation). The analysis was performed using in-house algorithms and ImageJ software. Results: The use of a mechanized drill at 35000 rpm and a 3 mm fluted burr generated aerosol with particle size 50 to 550 microns with a spread of 1.8 m radius. Surgical smoke was generated by an electrosurgical device in both cutting and coagulation modes. Dispersion of the smoke could be controlled significantly by the use of suction, mean smoke spread ratio being 0.065 without suction and 0.002 with use of suction within 2 cm. Conclusion: The quantification of the aerosol generation will help surgeons take practical decisions in their surgical techniques in the pandemic era.","Gupta, Roshmi; Pandey, Khushboo; Thomas, Rwituja; Basu, Saptarshi; Shetty, Bhujang; Shetty, Rohit; Roy, Abhijit Sinha",Indian J Ophthalmol,37,8

The second consideration includes defining ""persistent"" (symptoms experienced at the acute phase and continuing after without remission period) and ""delayed-onset"" (symptoms not experienced at the acute phase of the infection but appearing after a ""latency period""). This model integrates predisposing individual factors, biological factors associated to the severity of disease, hospitalization/treatment factors, and outbreak surrounding factors which may promote post-COVID.

From March to May 2020, 261 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated, including 41 SOT recipients. Of these, thirty-two were kidney recipients, 4 liver, 3 heart and 2 combined kidney-liver transplants. Median time from transplantation to COVID-19 diagnosis was 6 years. Thirteen SOT recipients (32%) required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and 5 patients died (12%). Using a propensity score match analysis, we found no significant differences between SOT recipients and non-transplant patients. Older age (OR 1.142; 95% [CI 1.08-1.197]) higher levels of C-reactive protein (OR 3.068; 95% [CI 1.22-7.71]) and levels of serum creatinine on admission (OR 3.048 95% [CI 1.22-7.57]) were associated with higher mortality.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of sintilimab with placebo, both in combination with such chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03607539). METHODS: A total of 397 patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase genomic aberration were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either sintilimab 200 mg or placebo plus pemetrexed and platinum once every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by sintilimab or placebo plus pemetrexed therapy. Crossover or treatment beyond disease progression was allowed. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) as judged by an independent radiographic review committee. RESULTS: As of November 15, 2019, the median follow-up was 8.9 months. The median PFS was significantly longer in the sintilimab-combination group than that in the placebo-combination group (8.9 versus 5.0 mo; hazard ratio, 0.482, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.362-0.643; p < 0.00001). The confirmed objective response rate was 51.9% (95% CI: 45.7%-58.0%) in the sintilimab-combination group and 29.8% (95% CI: 22.1%-38.4%) in placebo-combination group. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 61.7% in sintilimab-combination group and 58.8% in placebo-combination group. CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients with previously untreated, locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the addition of sintilimab to chemotherapy with pemetrexed and platinum resulted in considerably longer PFS than with chemotherapy alone with manageable safety profiles.","Yang, Yunpeng; Wang, Zhehai; Fang, Jian; Yu, Qitao; Han, Baohui; Cang, Shundong; Chen, Gongyan; Mei, Xiaodong; Yang, Zhixiong; Ma, Rui; Bi, Minghong; Ren, Xiubao; Zhou, Jianying; Li, Baolan; Song, Yong; Feng, Jifeng; Li, Juan; He, Zhiyong; Zhou, Rui; Li, Weimin; Lu, You; Wang, Yingyi; Wang, Lijun; Yang, Nong; Zhang, Yan; Yu, Zhuang; Zhao, Yanqiu; Xie, Conghua; Cheng, Ying; Zhou, Hui; Wang, Shuyan; Zhu, Donglei; Zhang, Wen; Zhang, Li",J. thorac. oncol,37,16

It would be of utmost importance to explore if the most routinely used tests could serve as an aid in determining patient's clinical status or predicting severity of the disease. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 506 Covid-19 positive patients and 200 controls over a period of two months (June and July 2020). The cases were sub-classified based on disease severity into mild to moderate (n=337), severe (n=118) and very severe (n=51) and based on survivor status into survivors (n=473) and non-survivors (n=33). Results: There were statistically significant differences in WBC count, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC), Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), plateletlymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) Red blood cell distribution width (RDW-SD) and RDW CV between covid cases vs controls;among the clinical subgroups and among the survivors and non-survivors. There was a significant strong positive correlation between various parameters, that is, NLR and MLR (r: 0.852, P=0), MPV and PDW (r: 0.912, P=0), MPV and PLCR (r: 0.956, P=0), PDW and PLCR (r: 0.893, P=0). NLR (AUC: 0.676, P=0) was the best single parameter and NLR+RDW-CV was best combination parameter as per area under curve (0.871) of ROC to distinguish severe from mild to moderate disease. Conclusions: Leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and monocytosis were characteristic findings in covid cases while NLR and NLR+RDW-CV emerged as the most effective single and combination CBC parameters in distinguishing mild to moderate and severe cases respectively.","Pujani, M.; Raychaudhuri, S.; Verma, N.; Kaur, H.; Agarwal, S.; Singh, M.; Jain, M.; Chandoke, R.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in daily clinical practice using a nationwide Dutch cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced CaP. BASIC PROCEDURES: Patients were invited to complete the EPIC-26 questionnaire before treatment (baseline) and at 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. We calculated the mean EPIC-26 domain scores, stratified by treatment modality (i.e., radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and no active treatment), and the proportions of patients with UI (defined as &#8805; 2 pads per day) and ED (defined as erections not firm enough for sexual intercourse). Logistic regression modeling was used to explore the factors related to UI and ED after surgery. MAIN FINDINGS: In total 1,759 patients participated in this study. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy experienced clinically relevant worsening in the urinary incontinence domain. After excluding patients who reported UI at baseline, 15% of patients with prostatectomy reported UI 24 months after diagnosis. Only comorbidity was associated with UI in surgically treated patients. Regardless of treatment, patients reported a clinically significant reduced sexual functioning over time. Before treatment, 54% of patients reported ED. Among the 46% remaining patients, 87% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy reported ED 24 months after diagnosis, 41% after radiotherapy, and 46% in patients without active treatment. Bilateral nerve-sparing surgery was the only factor associated with ED after 24 months. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: UI and ED frequently occur in patients with localized and locally advanced CaP, in particular after radical prostatectomy. The higher occurrence rate of UI and ED, compared with clinical trial participants, supports the importance of real-world data, which can be used for local treatment recommendations and patient information, but also to evaluate effects of future initiatives, such as treatment centralization and research aimed at improving functional outcomes.","Vernooij, R W M; Cremers, R G H M; Jansen, H; Somford, D M; Kiemeney, L A; van Andel, G; Wijsman, B P; Busstra, M B; van Moorselaar, R J A; Wijnen, E M; Pos, F J; Hulshof, M C C M; Hamberg, P; van den Berkmortel, F; Hulsbergen-van de Kaa, C A; van Leenders, G J L H; Fütterer, J J; van Oort, I M; Aben, K K H",Urol. oncol,37,21

We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach ('Test-to-Care' Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. METHODS: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team, which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. RESULTS: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time-this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. CONCLUSIONS: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by socioeconomically vulnerable populations.","Kerkhoff, Andrew D; Sachdev, Darpun; Mizany, Sara; Rojas, Susy; Gandhi, Monica; Peng, James; Black, Douglas; Jones, Diane; Rojas, Susana; Jacobo, Jon; Tulier-Laiwa, Valerie; Petersen, Maya; Martinez, Jackie; Chamie, Gabriel; Havlir, Diane V; Marquez, Carina",PLoS One,37,16

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest can verify infection in patients with clinical symptoms and a negative test result, accelerating treatment and actions to prevent further contagion. However, CT employs ionising radiation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate protocol settings, associated radiation exposure, image quality and diagnostic performance of a low-dose CT protocol in a university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest CT examinations were performed on a single scanner (Somatom Definition Edge, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) in 105 symptomatic patients (60 male, 45 female). Images were evaluated with regard to protocol parameters, image quality, radiation exposure and diagnostic accuracy. Serial RT-PCR served as the standard of reference. Based on this reference standard sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CT with 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS: The mean effective dose was 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv (0.7-2.9 mSv) for the patient cohort (mean age 66.6 ± 16.7 years (19-94 years), mean body mass index (BMI) 26.6 ± 5.3 kg m-2 (16-46 kg/m2)). A sensitivity of 100 [95% CI: 82-100]%, a specificity of 78 [95% CI: 68-86]%, a positive predictive value of 50 [95% CI: 33-67]% and a negative predictive value of 100 [95% CI: 95-100]% were obtained. No COVID-19 diagnoses were missed by CT. Image noise did not strongly correlate with BMI or patient diameter and was rated as average. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a robust imaging procedure with a chest CT protocol for confident diagnosis of COVID-19. Even for an overweight patient cohort, an associated radiation exposure of only 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv was achieved with sufficient diagnostic quality to exclude COVID-19.","Steuwe, Andrea; Rademacher, Christin; Valentin, Birte; Köhler, Marie-Helen; Appel, Elisabeth; Keitel, Verena; Timm, Jörg; Antoch, Gerald; Aissa, Joel",J Radiol Prot,37,16

METHODS: A clinical audit was undertaken examining the evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 with negative SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, with comparison to WHO recommendations. A retrospective chart review was undertaken for 90 patients examining investigations, in particular CT, used to clarify the diagnosis. RESULTS: Ninety patients underwent additional investigation. Seventy-five per cent adherence to WHO recommendations was observed. Fifty-two men (57.78%) and 38 (42.22%) women were investigated, with a median age of 69 years (range 20-96 years). Seventy-nine chest CT examinations demonstrated positive, indeterminate, and negative rates for COVID-19 of 3.79%, 24.1%, and 72.15% respectively. Three patients had discordant swab results with initially negative and subsequently positive results for SARS-CoV-2, resulting in false-negative rates of 5.1% for those retested.

Market expectations plummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass unemployment. Governments provide huge financial aid programmes to mitigate the economic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with such policy measures, it is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this study, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks related to COVID-19. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This alternative data set can complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving crisis as it allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary findings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to distinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on natural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are summarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through the economy. The tracking tool is updated weekly. It could provide relevant empirical data to inform models on the economic effects of the crisis. Such complementary empirical information could ultimately help policymakers to effectively target financial support in order to mitigate the economic shocks of the crisis.","Stephany, Fabian; Stoehr, Niklas; Darius, Philipp; Neuhauser, Leonie; Teutloff, Ole; Braesemann, Fabian",,37,1

A transparent, disposable plastic drape is set up as a curtain and serves as an impermeable barrier between the caregiver and healthcare provider performing the casting or tenotomy. The plastic drape is cheap (< US$ 1.5), easily available and can be used effectively even in low- and middle-income countries which have a high patient load. We have utilized these innovative techniques in 43 consecutive patients since clinic re-opening and are satisfied that they are effective, economical and easily reproducible even in countries with limited resources.

In this work, we investigate the benefit of using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance, and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification, respectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation applied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new application of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc interpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19 classification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings. We also identify the limitations of our strategy that can be explored for further research in future.","Wang, Ella Y.; Som, Anirudh; Shukla, Ankita; Choi, Hongjun; Turaga, Pavan",,37,16

However, the co-assembly scenario where one of the peptide building blocks simultaneously forms a hydrogel is yet to be studied. Herein, we investigated the co-assembly formation of a minimalistic dipeptide, diphenylalanine (FF), and Fmoc-diphenylalanine (FmocFF) within the 3D fibrous matrix of FmocFF hydrogel. The overlapping peptide sequence between the two building blocks leads to their co-assembly within the gel state modulating the nature of the FF crystals. Consequently, we observe the formation of branched microcrystalline aggregates with an atypical curvature, in contrast to the FF assemblies obtained from aqueous solution. Using optical microscopy, we demonstrate the sigmoidal kinetic growth profile of these aggregates. Microfluidics and ToF-SIMS experiments reveal the presence of co-assembled structures of FF and FmocFF in the crystalline aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulation was further used to decipher the mechanism of co-assembly formation. This study introduces a simple methodology to investigate the kinetics of amyloidogenic structure formation in the hydrogel state and their in vitro modulation using the supramolecular co-assembly paradigm.","Chakraborty, Priyadarshi; Tang, Yiming; Guterman, Tom; Arnon, Zohar A; Yao, Yifei; Wei, Guanghong; Gazit, Ehud",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,37,24

Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18-55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18·5-30·0 kg/m2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1â×â107 plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1â×â108 PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-Î³-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 FINDINGS: From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime-boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1-3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=0·86 [95% CI 0·6960-0·9427], p=0·0001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime-boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose-effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

Despite intense testing, 53% (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. The data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, however low ranges (0-25%) required a net reproduction number for individuals progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of at least 15.

Taking the medical history for typical COVID-19 symptoms and PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing have become established as screening procedures. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical appearance of SARS-CoV-2-PCR positive patients and to determine the SARS-CoV-2 contact risk for health care workers (HCW). METHODS: The retrospective study included n = 2283 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from n = 1725 patients with otorhinolaryngological (ORL) diseases performed from March to November 2020 prior to inpatient treatment. In addition, demographic data and medical history were assessed. RESULTS: n = 13 PCR tests (0.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The positive rate showed a significant increase during the observation period (p < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical symptoms that led to a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 before PCR testing. The patients were either asymptomatic (n = 4) or had symptoms that were interpreted as symptoms typical of the ORL disease or secondary diagnoses (n = 9). CONCLUSION: The identification of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is a considerable challenge in clinical practice. Our findings illustrate that taking a medical history alone is of limited value and cannot replace molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for patients with ORL diseases. Our data also demonstrate that there is a high probability of contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in everyday clinical practice, so that the use of personal protective equipment, even in apparently ""routine cases"", is highly recommended.","Weiss, Roxanne; Guchlerner, Leon; Loth, Andreas G; Leinung, Martin; Wicker, Sabine; Kempf, Volkhard A J; Berger, Annemarie; Rabenau, Holger F; Ciesek, Sandra; Stöver, Timo; Diensthuber, Marc",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,37,1

We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID- 19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19. Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to low IDVI (i.e. &#8804;0.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be on high alert and develop COVID- 19 response plans as soon as permitting.","Bisanzio, Donal; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Bogoch, Isaac I; Brewer, Thomas; Brownstein, John S; Reithinger, Richard",Geospatial Health (Testo stamp.),37,26

FINDINGS: Seven studies met eligibility criteria: one evaluated the effects of heat and chemical interventions applied after mask use on mask performance, and six evaluated interventions applied prior to mask use to enhance antimicrobial properties and/or mask performance. Mask performance and germicidal effects were evaluated with heterogeneous test conditions. Safety outcomes were infrequently evaluated. Mask performance was best preserved with dry heat decontamination. Good germicidal effects were observed in salt-, N-halamine-, and nanoparticle-coated masks.

However, large-scale changes of the kinetochore architecture (such as its shape or dimensions) may also contribute to the value of delta. To assess contributions of these non-elastic changes, we compare behaviour of delta values in human kinetochores with small yet mechanically malleable kinetochores against compound kinetochores in Indian muntjac (IM) cells whose architecture remains constant. Due to the micrometre-scale length of kinetochore plates in IM, their shape and orientation are discernible in conventional light microscopy, which enables precise measurements of IKT independent of contributions from changes in overall architecture of the organelle. We find that delta in IM kinetochores remains relatively constant when microtubule-mediated forces are suppressed by Taxol, but it prominently decreases upon detachment of microtubules. By contrast, large decreases of delta observed in Taxol-treated human cells coincide with prominent changes in length and curvature of the kinetochore plate. These observations, supported by computational modelling, suggest that at least 50% of the decrease in delta in human cells reflects malleable reorganization of kinetochore architecture rather than elastic recoil due to IKT.","Renda, Fioranna; Magidson, Valentin; Tikhonenko, Irina; Fisher, Rebecca; Miles, Christopher; Mogilner, Alex; Khodjakov, Alexey",Open Biol,37,16

To guide this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research. Here, we give an overview of the main approaches behind KnetMiner and we report plant-centric case studies for identifying genes, gene networks and trait relationships in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), as well as, an evidence-based approach to rank candidate genes under a large Arabidopsis thaliana QTL.

Natural compounds with a great diversity of chemical structures may provide an alternative approach for the discovery of new antivirals. In fact, numerous flavonoids were found to have antiviral effects against SARS-and MERS-CoV by mainly inhibiting the enzymes 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). In this review, we specifically focused on the search for flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds, which are proven to be effective against human CoVs. We therefore summarized and analyzed the latest progress in research to identify flavonoids for antiviral therapy and proposed strategies for future work on medicinal plants against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

Initial measures to reduce the burden to the health care system during the pandemic included deferring elective surgery. These damage control measures did not take into account the mid- and long-term implications. Management of congenital anomalies can be time sensitive with delays resulting in permanent disability, morbidity and increased costs to the healthcare system. This study reports the results of using a novel scoring system that enables triage of time sensitive congenital anomalies and pediatric surgical conditions and how implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) principles allowed optimization of resources and reduced the burden to the system while allowing for appropriate care of pediatric patients with urgent urologic surgical conditions. METHODS: We present a prospective case series of patients with congenital urological conditions scheduled and taken to surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. All pediatric urology cases that were pending and or scheduled for surgery at the moment the pandemic struck as well as all cases that presented to the emergency department with urological conditions were triaged and included for analysis using a modified Medically Necessary, Time-Sensitive Procedures: Scoring System (MeNTS). A modified MeNTS was implemented for pediatric patients, giving more priority to the impact of deferring surgical intervention on patient's prognosis. An individualized evaluation using this scoring system was applied to each patient. Intra- and postoperative ERAS® principles were applied to all cases operated during the pandemic between March 20th and April 24th to reduce the burden to the healthcare system. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were triaged and included for analysis with a mean age of 6.47 years of age. Adjusted MeNTS showed that all clinically emergent cases had a score of 12 or less. Cases that could be postponed for 2 weeks but no longer had a score between 13 and 15. The ones that could wait 6 weeks or longer had scores higher than 16. Score results were not the same for similar procedures and individualized assessments resulted in scores based on an individual patient's conditions. From the total cases, implementation of ERAS® principles increased outpatient procedures from 68 to 90.4%. CONCLUSION: Our results provide a novel triaging method to rank pediatric urological surgical management based on individualized patient's clinical conditions. Cutoff values of 12 and 16 allowed appropriate triage preventing the postponement of urgent urologic cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementation of ERAS® principles allowed for these procedures to be done in the outpatient setting, preserving valuable healthcare resources. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective cohort study.

To assess the clinical significance of Aspergillus species in respiratory samples of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, we implemented routine screening for Aspergillus in tracheal aspirate (TA). PATIENTS/METHODS: From all adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), TA samples were collected twice a week for Aspergillus screening by PCR and or culture. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling was performed in patients with a positive screening result if possible. Clinical information was obtained from the electronic patient record and patients were categorised according to the recently published consensus case definition for CAPA. RESULTS: Our study population consisted of 63 predominantly (73%) male patients, with a median age of 62 years and total median ICU stay of 18 days. Aspergillus species were present in TA screening samples from 15 patients (24%), and probable CAPA was diagnosed in 11 (17%) patients. Triazole resistance was detected in one patient (14%). Concordance between TA and BAL was 86%, and all TA culture positives were confirmed in BAL. We were able to withhold treatment in three of fifteen patients with positive screening (20%) but negative BAL results. CONCLUSIONS: Positive culture, molecular detection and or antigen detection of Aspergillus species do not equal infection. Until we understand the clinical relevance of Aspergillus species detected in respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients, minimal-invasive screening by TA is a feasible method to monitor patients. Positive screening results should be an indication to perform a BAL to rule out upper airway colonisation.","van Grootveld, Rebecca; van Paassen, Judith; de Boer, Mark G J; Claas, Eric C J; Kuijper, Ed J; van der Beek, Martha T",Mycoses,37,23

Some, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH), have indicated significant differences between patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants (101) were divided into a control group of healthy individuals and, following diagnosis, patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis, and aggressive periodontitis. Compounds reflecting tissue destruction, inflammatory processes or antioxidant responses, such as sirtuins (SIRT-1, SIRT-2), metalloproteinases (MMP), SOD, GPx, GSH, and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in saliva. RESULTS: SIRT-2 levels were significantly increased in all patients. In patients with gingivitis, MMP (p<0.05) and GPx (p<0.01) were significantly increased. In patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis, SOD activities were increased (p<0.001) while GPx and GR were decreased (p<0.001). Relative activities of MMP were higher in patients with aggressive periodontitis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of SIRT-2 and SOD clearly showed increased levels of oxidative stress in cases of periodontitis with a subsequent inhibition of other antioxidant enzymes. Levels of GSH suggest reversibility of the conditions with appropriate intervention. With the assessment of the trends of these selected antioxidant markers, it is possible to determine the prognosis of the disease.","Kluknavská, J; Krajcíková, K; Bolerázska, B; Maslanková, J; Ohlasová, J; Timková, S; Drotárová, Z; Vasková, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,37,2

Importantly, there was a stock price crash on Monday, March 9, 2020, followed by a similar crash one week later. Leading global indices substantially dropped. Based on previous research indicating that the news media may elicit effects on stock prices, we hypothesized that the amount of news coverage about COVID-19 within a given country would predict the size of the stock price drop in that country. Using data for N = 58 nations from five continents, we observed average stock price drops of 6.57% (week 1) and 6.43% (week 2). Using a cross-national correlational approach, we found a positive relationship between the amount of news coverage about COVID-19 and the extent of the stock price drop. Actual severity within a given country (indicated by the number of confirmed cases and deaths, based on data provided by the World Health Organization) and public attention (indicated by COVID-19-related Internet search engine volume) did not predict the extent of the stock price drop in multivariate analyses. Correlational evidence is consistent with the idea that intensive media reporting on a threatening pandemic with uncertain negative consequences on health, social life, and the economy may provoke substantial reactions in the market, with as yet unknown indirect effects on public health. However, the causal order of media attention and stock price drops should be assessed with caution.","Arendt, Florian; Mestas, Manina",Health Commun,37,16

A bidding strategy naively pursuing these easily observable metrics, however, fails to optimize the profitability of the advertisers. Rather, the bidding strategy that leads to the maximum revenue is a strategy pursuing the performance lift of showing ads to a specific user. Therefore, it is essential to predict the lift-effect of showing ads to each user on their target variables from observed log data. However, there is a difficulty in predicting the lift-effect, as the training data gathered by a past bidding strategy may have a strong bias towards the winning impressions. In this study, we develop Unbiased Lift-based Bidding System, which maximizes the advertisers' profit by accurately predicting the lift-effect from biased log data. Our system is the first to enable high-performing lift-based bidding strategy by theoretically alleviating the inherent bias in the log. Real-world, large-scale A/B testing successfully demonstrates the superiority and practicability of the proposed system.","Moriwaki, Daisuke; Hayakawa, Yuta; Munemasa, Isshu; Saito, Yuta; Matsui, Akira",,37,22

One of the measures implemented in organisations in response to the pandemic was remote work (work from home). This study, based on 40 interviews with employees from two different public sector organisations in Austria, analyses their experiences and insights during and after the first lockdown period in order to understand how remote work is perceived to influence organisational and digital culture. The results address important dimensions of remote work that need to be considered by public sector organisations, for instance in their organisational strategies. Remote work will significantly change ways of working, processes, collaboration and interaction, dimensions that influence the organisational and digital culture of an organisation, and hence will accelerate its digital transformation. On one hand, such changes in public sector organisations reflect substantial challenges, on the other hand, they can provide competitive advantages, as organisations offering remote work can be perceived as modern and attractive employers. © 2021 ACM.","Edelmann, N.; Schossboeck, J.; Albrecht, V.","22nd Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research: Digital Innovations for Public Values: Inclusive Collaboration and Community, DGO 2021",37,8

OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric asthma services and on disease burden in their patients. METHODS: An online survey was sent to members of the Pediatric Asthma in Real Life think tank and the World Allergy Organization Pediatric Asthma Committee. It included questions on service provision, disease burden, and the clinical course of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection among children with asthma. RESULTS: Ninety-one respondents, caring for an estimated population of more than 133,000 children with asthma, completed the survey. COVID-19 significantly impacted pediatric asthma services: 39% ceased physical appointments, 47% stopped accepting new patients, and 75% limited patients' visits. Consultations were almost halved to a median of 20 (interquartile range, 10-25) patients per week. Virtual clinics and helplines were launched in most centers. Better than expected disease control was reported in 20% (10%-40%) of patients, whereas control was negatively affected in only 10% (7.5%-12.5%). Adherence also appeared to increase. Only 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported among the population; the estimated incidence is not apparently different from the reports of general pediatric cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Outcomes may even have improved, possibly through increased adherence and/or reduced exposures. Clinical services have rapidly responded to the pandemic by limiting and replacing physical appointments with virtual encounters.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Custovic, Adnan; Deschildre, Antoine; Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Phipatanakul, Wanda; Wong, Gary; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Agache, Ioana; Bacharier, Leonard; Bonini, Matteo; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A; Chen, Zhimin; Craig, Timothy; Ducharme, Francine M; El-Sayed, Zeinab Awad; Feleszko, Wojciech; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Garcia-Marcos, Luis; Gern, James E; Goh, Anne; Gómez, René Maximiliano; Hamelmann, Eckard H; Hedlin, Gunilla; Hossny, Elham M; Jartti, Tuomas; Kalayci, Omer; Kaplan, Alan; Konradsen, Jon; Kuna, Piotr; Lau, Susanne; Le Souef, Peter; Lemanske, Robert F; Mäkelä, Mika J; Morais-Almeida, Mário; Murray, Clare; Nagaraju, Karthik; Namazova-Baranova, Leyla; Garcia, Antonio Nieto; Yusuf, Osman M; Pitrez, Paulo M C; Pohunek, Petr; Pozo Beltrán, Cesar Fireth; Roberts, Graham C; Valiulis, Arunas; Zar, Heather J",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,37,1

We have conducted a survey to analyze caseload and measures to adapt indications for a perception of crisis. METHODS: We constructed a questionnaire to survey a snapshot of neurosurgical activity, resources, and indications during 1 week with usual activity in December 2019 and 1 week during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in March 2020. The questionnaire was sent to 34 neurosurgical departments in Europe; 25 departments returned responses within 5 days. RESULTS: We found unexpectedly large differences in resources and indications already before the pandemic. Differences were also large in how much practice and resources changed during the pandemic. Neurosurgical beds and neuro-intensive care beds were significantly decreased from December 2019 to March 2020. The utilization of resources decreased via less demand for care of brain injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage, postponing surgery and changed surgical indications as a method of rationing resources. Twenty departments (80%) reduced activity extensively, and the same proportion stated that they were no longer able to provide care according to legitimate medical needs. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical centers responded swiftly and effectively to a sudden decrease of neurosurgical capacity due to relocation of resources to pandemic care. The pandemic led to rationing of neurosurgical care in 80% of responding centers. We saw a relation between resources before the pandemic and ability to uphold neurosurgical services. The observation of extensive differences of available beds provided an opportunity to show how resources that had been restricted already under normal conditions translated to rationing of care that may not be acceptable to the public of seemingly affluent European countries.","Mathiesen, T; Arraez, M; Asser, T; Balak, N; Barazi, S; Bernucci, C; Bolger, C; Broekman, M L D; Demetriades, A K; Feldman, Z; Fontanella, M M; Foroglou, N; Lafuente, J; Maier, A D; Meyer, B; Niemelä, M; Roche, P H; Sala, F; Samprón, N; Sandvik, U; Schaller, K; Thome, C; Thys, M; Tisell, M; Vajkoczy, P; Visocchi, M",Acta Neurochir (Wien),37,16

Delayed or eliminated care may place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE.­: To identify opportunities for laboratory test stewardship to close potential gaps in care created by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN.­: The study was a retrospective time series design examining laboratory services received before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large metropolitan health system serving women and children. RESULTS.­: Laboratory test volumes displayed 3 distinct patterns: (1) a decrease during state lockdown, followed by near-complete or complete recovery; (2) no change; and (3) a persistent decrease. Tests that diagnose or monitor chronic illness recovered only partially. For example, hemoglobin A1c initially declined 80% (from 2232 for April 2019 to 452 for April 2020), and there was a sustained 16% drop (28-day daily average 117 at August 30, 2019, to 98 at August 30, 2020) 4 months later.

Laboratory professionals have access to data that can provide insight into clinical practice and identify pandemic-related gaps in care. During the pandemic, the biggest patient threat is underuse, particularly among tests to manage chronic diseases and for traditionally underserved communities and people of color.

We describe how the pandemic affected Emergency Department (ED) accesses in a tertiary children's hospital, composed by two different pediatric centers, one located in Rome's city center and the second, Palidoro (regional COVID-19 center), in its surrounding metropolitan area, both in the Lazio region, analyzing the profile of admitted patients during the pandemic period in terms of their general characteristics (at presentation in the ED's) and urgent hospitalizations compared to prepandemic period. METHODS: The study compare the period between the 21st of February and the 30th of April 2020, covering the three phases of the national responses (this period will be referred to as the pandemic period) with the same period of 2019 (prepandemic period). The study analyzes the number of ED visits and urgent hospitalizations and their distribution according to selected characteristics. RESULTS: The reduction of ED visits was 56 and 62%, respectively in Rome and Palidoro centers. The higher relative decline was encountered for Diseases of Respiratory System, and for Diseases of the Nervous System and Sense Organs. A doubling of the relative frequency of hospitalizations was observed, going from 14.2 to 24.4% in Rome and from 6.4 to 10.3% in Palidoro. In terms of absolute daily numbers the decrease of urgent hospitalizations was less sharp than ED visits. For pathologies such as peritonitis, tumors or other possible life-treathening conditions we did not observe a significative increase due to delayed access. CONCLUSIONS: In the pandemic period there was a general reduction in the number of children referred to ED, such reduction was greater in low-acuity levels. The reduction for respiratory tract infections and other communicable diseases during school closure and the national lockdown must make us reflect on the possible impact that these conditions may have on the health system, in particular the ED, at the reopening of schools. The major problem remains the fear for possible diagnostic delays in life-threatening or crippling diseases; our study doesn't demonstrate an increase in number or significant delay in some serious conditions such as tumors, peritonitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, ileo-colic intussusception and testis/ovary torsion. A continuous, deep re-organizational process step by step of the ED is nececessary in the present and upcoming pandemic situation.","Raucci, Umberto; Musolino, Anna Maria; Di Lallo, Domenico; Piga, Simone; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Pisani, Mara; Rossi, Francesco Paolo; Reale, Antonino; Ciofi Degli Atti, Marta Luisa; Villani, Alberto; Raponi, Massimiliano",Ital J Pediatr,37,22

Only 16% of respondents vaccinated this year also received SIV before the last season (2019/20), with the proportion of physicians (19%) being statistically significantly higher than that of non-physicians (13%, p = .045) and the proportion of chronically ill HCWs (22%) being higher than that of healthy individuals (13%, p = .004). Most frequently, respondents' motivation to get vaccinated this year was self-protection (61%), that is concerns about contracting influenza together with COVID-19 or alone, followed by family protection (58%) and patient protection (53%). In conclusion, COVID-19 contributed to an increased demand for SIV among HCWs and the threat of contracting it together with influenza was the most frequent motive.","Stepánek, Ladislav; Nakládalová, Marie; Vildová, Helena; Boriková, Alena; Janosíková, Magdaléna; Ivanová, Katerina",Hum Vaccin Immunother,37,2

It is presumed that the effect of reducing interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) by RAAS modulation. We investigated changes in angiotensin II and IL-6 levels in four COVID-19 patients treated with ARBs. Case Presentation. Cases 1 and 2 were who had not received ARBs before and were newly administered ARBs. Case 3 restarted ARBs after discontinuation for 7 days, and case 4 received an increased dose of ARBs. The mean in angiotensin II levels (607.5 pg/mL, range: 488-850 pg/mL, reference range < 100 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP) (10.58 mg/dL, range 4.45-18.05 mg/dL), and IL-6 (55.78 pg/mL, range: 12.86-144.82 pg/mL, reference range < 7 pg/mL) was observed at the admission in all patients. Upon clinical improvement, the mean decrease in CRP (1.02 mg/dL, range 0.06-3.78 mg/dL) and IL-6 (5.63 pg/mL, range 0.17-20.87 pg/mL) was observed in all patients. Conversely, angiotensin II levels gradually increased. Conclusion: This report supports the potential benefit of ARBs to improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients by controlling RAAS dysfunction.","Lee, Su Jin; Kim, Taehwa; Cho, Woo Hyun; Jeon, Doosoo; Lim, Seungjin",J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst,37,26

This virus has spread worldwide in a short duration and forced the world to face unprecedented life and economic loss. To date, there are no known specific drugs to combat this virus and the process for new drug development is lengthy. Most promising candidates, which emerged as potential leads, were abandoned in the later phases of clinical trials. Repurposing of already approved drugs for other therapeutic applications can be done only after extensive testing for safety and efficacy. With no definite therapeutics in the horizon, natural products are in extensive use arbitrarily as anti-viral agents and immune boosters. For ages it has been known that most natural products possess potent anti-viral activity and it is no different for SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown that natural products display inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. In silico studies have shown that various natural products have strong binding affinity for and inhibitory action on the non-structural proteins of the virus, namely PLPRO, MPRO, and RdRp, and structural proteins such as spike (S) protein. Since the virus utilizes the transmembrane ACE2 receptor of the host cell, it also proves to be a valid target for drug development. In this review promising targets for drug development against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-viral activities of some of the known natural products are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Chakravarti, R.; Singh, R.; Ghosh, A.; Dey, D.; Sharma, P.; Velayutham, R.; Roy, S.; Ghosh, D.",RSC Advances,37,1

CC appears to be closely interrelated with air pollution, as some pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and black carbon are naturally occurring greenhouse gases. Air pollution may enhance the allergenicity of some plants and, also, has an adverse effect on respiratory health. Children are a uniquely vulnerable group that suffers disproportionately from CC burden. The increasing global warming related to CC has a big impact on plants' lifecycles, with earlier and longer pollen seasons, as well as higher pollen production, putting children affected by asthma and allergic rhinitis at risk for exacerbations. Extreme weather events may play a role too, not only in the exacerbations of allergic respiratory diseases but, also, in favouring respiratory infections. Even though paediatricians are already seeing the impacts of CC on their patients, their knowledge about CC-related health outcomes with specific regards to children's respiratory health is incomplete. This advocates for paediatricians' increased awareness and a better understanding of the CC impact on children's respiratory health. Having a special responsibility for children, paediatricians should actively be involved in policies aimed to protect the next generation from CC-related adverse health effects. Hence, there is an urgent need for them to take action and successfully educate families about CC issues. This paper aims at reviewing the evidence of CC-related environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and extreme events on respiratory allergic diseases and respiratory infections in children and proposing specific actionable items for paediatricians to deal with CC-related health issues in their clinical practice.","Di Cicco, Maria Elisa; Ferrante, Giuliana; Amato, Doriana; Capizzi, Antonino; De Pieri, Carlo; Ferraro, Valentina Agnese; Furno, Maria; Tranchino, Valentina; La Grutta, Stefania",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),37,24

Across two studies we examined whether trait pathogen avoidance (operationalized as perceived vulnerability to disease; PVD) was linked with responses to COVID-19 and preventative behaviors. In Study 1, PVD was positively associated with stronger reactions to the threat of COVID-19, including increased anxiety, perceptions that people should alter their typical behavior, as well as reported importance of engaging in proactive and social distancing behaviors. In Study 2, PVD was again associated with increased anxiety, as well as more vigilant behavior when grocery shopping, fewer trips to the store, and fewer face-to-face interactions. These associations remained significant when controlling for the Big-5 personality traits. Although the two subscales of PVD (germ aversion and perceived infectability) were often parallel predictors, several differences between the subscales emerged.

The objective of this study is to quantify our experience of telestroke (TS) consults at a large tertiary comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed TS consults of patients presenting to our neuroscience network. Those with a confirmed diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemia attack were included. Data were compared from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, which include consults prepandemic and during the crisis. Results: A total of 1,982 TS consults were provided in 1 year. Prepandemic, the mean monthly consults were 148. In April 2020, only 59 patients were seen (49% decline). Mobile stroke unit consults decreased by 72% in the same month. The 30-day moving average of patients seen per day was between five and six prepandemic declined to between two and three in April, and then began to uptrend during May. The mean percentage of patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was 16% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 31% in April 2020. The mean percentage of patients receiving endovascular therapy was 10% from April 2019 to March 2020 and increased to 19% in April 2020. Conclusions: At our large tertiary comprehensive stroke center, we observed a significant and rapid decline in TS consults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain of the reasons for the decline, but a fear of contracting coronavirus, social distancing, and isolation likely played a major role. Further research must be done to elucidate the etiology of this decline.","Shah, Syed Omar; Dharia, Robin; Stazi, Jaime; DePrince, Maureen; Rosenwasser, Robert H",Telemed. j. e. health,37,1

The sensors combine a solution-processable conjugated polymer in the transistor channel and high-density and orientation-controlled bioconjugation of nanobody-SpyCatcher fusion proteins on disposable gate electrodes. The devices provide results after 10 min of exposure to 5 µl of unprocessed samples, maintain high specificity and single-molecule sensitivity in human saliva and serum, and can be reprogrammed to detect any protein antigen if a corresponding specific nanobody is available. We used the sensors to detect green fluorescent protein, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike proteins, and for the COVID-19 screening of unprocessed clinical nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples with a wide range of viral loads.","Guo, Keying; Wustoni, Shofarul; Koklu, Anil; Díaz-Galicia, Escarlet; Moser, Maximilian; Hama, Adel; Alqahtani, Ahmed A; Ahmad, Adeel Nazir; Alhamlan, Fatimah Saeed; Shuaib, Muhammad; Pain, Arnab; McCulloch, Iain; Arold, Stefan T; Grünberg, Raik; Inal, Sahika",Nat Biomed Eng,37,1

This novel simulation model was designed to produce an air leak by passing air through and agitating a fluorescent fluid. The air leak volume and amount of fluorescent fluid were tested in various combinations and aerosolisation was assessed at 10-minute intervals using the ultraviolet light. The following chest drainage systems were compared: (1) single-chamber chest drainage system, (2) 3-compartment wet-dry suction chest drainage system, (3) digital drainage and monitoring system. The impact of suction (-2 and -4 kPa) in generating aerosolised particles was tested as well. A total number of 187 of 10-minute interval measurements were performed. The single-chamber chest drainage system generated the largest number of aerosolised particles at different air leak volumes and drainage output. The 3-compartment wet-dry suction system and the digital drainage and monitoring system did not generate any identifiable aerosolised particles at any of the air leak or drain output volumes considered. Suction applied to the chest drainage systems did not have an effect on aerosolisation. Aerosol generation in the simulated air-leak model demonstrated the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the clinical setting. Full personal protective equipment must be used in patients with an air leak. Single-chamber chest drainage system generates the highest rate of aerosolised particles and it should not be used as an open system in patients with an air leak.","Mustaev, Muslim; Bille, Andrea; Hasan, Mehdi; Garg, Sheena; Pontiki, Antonia A; Darwish, Omar; Lucchese, Gianluca",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,37,20

Induced heat shock is associated with feeding behaviour, reproduction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that causes oxidative damage. In this experiment, we examined the lethal and sublethal effects of heat shock on reproduction, feeding behaviour and antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidases (POD) in P. solenopsis. Results showed that males were highly susceptible to heat shock treatments than females, as LTemp50 values were 43.8 °C for males and 45.11 °C for females. Heat shock events non-significantly affected the fecundity in female only treated adults and significantly affected the both sexes heat treated adults, it increased the xylem feeding duration, percentage of xylem feeding adults and reduce the phloem feeding duration and percentage of phloem feeding adults. Similarly it alter the antioxidant enzymes activities, an increase of CAT, SOD and POD activities were noticed in response to highest intensity of heat shock while a reduction of CAT and SOD activity were noticed in response to lowest intensity of heat shock compared to control (30 °C). These results suggest that heat shock may result in loss of body water and induce oxidative stress in P. solenopsis. However, antioxidant enzymes play a significant role in overcoming the oxidative damage.","Waqas, Muhammad Saad; Elabasy, Asem Saad Saad; Shoaib, Ali Ahmed Zaky; Cheng, Xinlai; Zhang, Qianqian; Shi, Zuhua",J Therm Biol,37,1

People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS: We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death. In those admitted to hospital, biomarkers of cardiac stress or injury are often abnormal, and the incidence of a wide range of cardiovascular complications is substantial, particularly arrhythmias (22 studies, n = 13,115, weighted mean incidence (WMI) 9.3%), heart failure (20 studies, n = 29,317, WMI: 6.8%) and thrombotic complications (VTE: 16 studies, n = 7700, WMI: 7.4%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review indicates that cardiometabolic comorbidities are common in people who are hospitalised with a COVID-19 infection, and cardiovascular complications are frequent.

Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced health and wellness across the globe and caused nearly three million deaths. This study focuses on informal caregivers of people with dementia, a disease that affects about 50 million older adults worldwide and requires much caregiving support. Objective: Examine the current literature on the impact of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of informal caregivers for people with dementia. Method: This rapid review was conducted across five electronic databases for quantitative and qualitative articles published through March 15, 2021. Results: The 10 studies included in this review reported quantitative descriptive data from across the globe;however, no studies existed from the U.S. or East Asia countries. All of the studies examined the psychological rather than physical impact of COVID-19 and highlighted risk and protective factors in the areas of psychosocial (resilience, neuropsychiatric, and social isolation), sociodemographic (gender and education), and environmental (home confinement, living arrangement, and dementia stage). Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a considerable negative impact on the psychological well-being of informal caregivers of people with dementia, namely causing more depression and anxiety than pre-pandemic.","Hughes, M.

We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs following the fall infection surge in Minnesota, and before and after COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, we assessed demographic and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsWe conducted two rounds of seroprevalence testing among a cohort of HCWs: samples in round 1 were collected from 11/22/20 - 02/21/21 and in round 2 from 12/18/20 - 02/15/21. Demographic and occupational exposures assessed with logistic regression were age, sex, healthcare role and setting, and number of children in the household. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. A secondary outcome, SARS-CoV-2 infection, included both seropositivity and self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. ResultsIn total, 459 HCWs were tested. 43/454 (9.47%) had a seropositive sample 1 and 75/423 (17.7%) had a seropositive sample 2. By time of sample 2 collection, 54% of participants had received at least one vaccine dose and seroprevalence was 13% among unvaccinated individuals. Relative to physicians, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in other roles were increased (Nurse Practitioner: OR[95%CI] 1.93[0.57,6.53], Physicians Assistant: 1.69[0.38,7.52], Nurse: 2.33[0.94,5.78], Paramedic/EMTs: 3.86[0.78,19.0], other: 1.68[0.58,4.85]). The workplace setting was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (p=0.04). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among HCWs reporting duties in the ICU vs. those working in an ambulatory clinic was elevated: OR[95%CI] 2.17[1.01,4.68]. ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in HCW increased during our study period which was consistent with community infection rates. HCW role and setting -- particularly working in the ICU -- is associated with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wiggen, Talia D; Bohn, Bruno; Ulrich, Angela K; Stovitz, Steven D; Strickland, Ali J; Naumchik, Brianna Mae; Walsh, Sara; Smith, Stephen; Baumgartner, Brett; Kline, Susan; Yendell, Stephanie; Hedberg, Craig; Beebe, Timothy J; Demmer, Ryan T",,37,23

(2) Method: Computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) was used to survey a sample of 1001 Poles selected using quota sampling. (3) Results: Using cluster analysis, three types of attitudes were distinguished, people being classified as ""involved"" (48.1%), ""cautious"" (27.4%), or ""indifferent"" (24.6%). The result of greatest interest was the absence of any attitude indicating an extremely dismissive posture toward COVID-19. Three logistic regression analyses, comparing people displaying each attitude with those comparing the other two attitudes combined, showed that an involved attitude was likely to be associated with being female, being in a poorer financial situation, but having relatively high life satisfaction. A cautious attitude was more likely to appear in places with fewer residents and among people in a favorable financial situation, and that an indifferent attitude was more likely to be associated with being male and having lower life satisfaction.

Baseline data and dynamic change were compared between two groups and a decision-tree algorithm was developed to determine the cut-off value for classification. Results: 93 patients were finally included and were divided into common group (n = 76) and severe group (n = 17) based on current criteria. Compared with common patients, severe patients experienced shorter advanced stage, peak time and plateau, but longer absorption stage. The dynamic change of volume and density coincided with the clinical course. The interquartile range of volumetric percentage of the two groups were 1.0-7.2% and 11.4-31.2%, respectively. Baseline volumetric percentage of infection was significantly higher in severe group, and the cut-off value of it was 10.10%. Conclusions: Volumetric percentage between severe and common patients was significantly different. Because serial CT scans are systemically performed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this quantitative analysis can simultaneously provide valuable information for physicians to evaluate their clinical course and classify common and severe patients accurately.","Yang, Chongtu; Cao, Guijuan; Liu, Fen; Liu, Jiacheng; Huang, Songjiang; Xiong, Bin",Chin J Acad Radiol,37,26

The objective of this study was to determine for the first time whether a short-term supplementation with ubiquinol could have a modulating effect on bone turnover and energy metabolism associated with strenuous exercise. The participants (n = 100 healthy and well-trained firemen) were randomly divided into two groups: ubiquinol group (ubiquinol (200 mg day-1)) and control group (placebo) for two weeks. The protocol consisted of conducting two identical strenuous exercise tests with a rest period between tests of 24 h. Blood samples were collected before supplementation (basal value) (T1), after supplementation (T2), after the first physical exercise test (T3), after 24 h of rest (T4), and after the second physical exercise test (T5). Parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin (OC), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), sclerotin (SOST), alkaline phosphatase (AP), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), insulin, leptin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-Î³ coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;) were determined. Our protocol increased ACTH, SOST, PTH and OC levels, while it decreased OPN. This protocol also increased adrenaline, noradrenaline and PCG-1&#945;, and decreased insulin. After ubiquinol supplementation, PTH, OC, OPG, alkaline phosphatase, leptin, insulin, noradrenaline and PGC-1&#945; levels increased in the supplemented group compared to the control group after the exercise protocol. Strenuous exercise has a clear effect on energy metabolism and bone turnover. These effects are modulated by ubiquinol supplementation, which especially increases the biomarkers of bone formation during strenuous exercise. In addition, ubiquinol has a beneficial effect on the mobilization of energy sources, fact that it could represent an ergogenic and physiological advantage for skeletal muscles.","Diaz-Castro, Javier; Mira-Rufino, Pablo Javier; Moreno-Fernandez, Jorge; Chirosa, Ignacio; Chirosa, Javier Luis; Guisado, Rafael; Ochoa, Julio J",Food funct,37,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three professional WhatsApp groups of Jordanian dentists were reviewed and analyzed for inquiries posted during the period from January to May 2020. Inquiries were sent from patients to their dentists who posted these inquiries to the professional WhatsApp dental groups for consultation and professional advice. All queries regarding oral infections and antimicrobial prescribing were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Three WhatsApp professional groups with a total numbers of members of 750 dentists who posted queries about their patients were included in this study. Dentist members posted queries about their patients to these professional WhatsApp groups. There was a total of 32 inquiries regarding oral lesions and 11 consultations regarding prescribing and dental management of medically compromised patients giving a total of 43 consultations. Among which there were 19 inquiries on oral infections and 9 inquiries on antimicrobial prescribing giving a total of 28 consultations. Most common inquiries were on bacterial infections (localized dentoalveolar abscess, pericoronitis, cellulitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia of the tongue), viral herpetic infections, and Candida infections (erythematous and pseudomembranous candidiasis). CONCLUSIONS: Many dental practitioners cannot distinguish the correct diagnostic features of oral infections particularly viral and fungal infections. Continuing education should be considered to focus on clinical manifestations of various oral infections. Further, educational activities that focus on variations in treatment protocols for various infections should be introduced particularly those that concern indications for antimicrobial prescribing.","Dar-Odeh, Najla; Babkair, Hamzah; Alnazzawi, Ahmad; Abu-Hammad, Shaden; Abu-Hammad, Abdalla; Abu-Hammad, Osama",European journal of dentistry,37,1

COVID-19 is now known as a pandemic threat to global public health. It possesses a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to mild, moderate, and ultimately severe pneumonia accompanied by multi-organ system dysfunction that can cause the death of the afflicted patients. The host immune system plays a critical role in defending against potentially pathogenic microorganisms such as coronaviruses, and it eliminates and eradicates these invading agents by triggering effective immune responses. However, there exists evidence indicating that in critically ill cases of the COVID-19, dysregulated immune responses and hyper-inflammation lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Achieving a profound understanding of the pathological immune responses involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 will boost our comprehending of disease pathogenesis and its progression toward severe form, contributing to the identification and rational design of effective therapies.

Healthcare-acquired infection has been reported in similar epidemics, but there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs and their associated clinical outcomes in the United States. METHODS: We established two high-throughput employee testing centers in Seattle, Washington with drive-through and walk-through options for symptomatic employees in the University of Washington Medicine system and its affiliated organizations. Using data from these testing centers, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic employees and describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes among employees with COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 12 and April 23, a total of 3,477 symptomatic employees were tested for COVID-19 at two employee testing centers; 185 (5.3%) employees tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was similar when comparing frontline HCWs (5.2%) to non-frontline staff (5.5%). Among 174 positive employees reached for follow-up at least 14 days after diagnosis, 6 reported COVID-related hospitalization; all recovered. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, we observed that the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among symptomatic HCWs was comparable to that of symptomatic non-frontline staff.

With the United States leading the path in terms of case incidence, it is important to investigate how weather variables influence the spread of the disease in the country. This paper assembles a detailed and comprehensive dataset comprising COVID-19 cases and climatological variables for all counties in the continental U.S. and uses a developed econometric approach to estimate the causal effect of certain weather factors on the growth rate of infection. The results indicate a non-linear and significant negative relationship between the individual weather measures and the growth rate of COVID-19 in the U.S. Specifically, the paper finds that a 1 °C rise in daily temperature will reduce daily covid growth rate in the U.S. by approximately 6 percent in the following week, while a marginal increase in relative humidity reduces the same outcome by 1 percent over a similar period. In comparison, a 1 m/s increase in daily wind speed will bring about an 8 percent drop in daily growth rate of COVID-19 in the country. These results differ by location and are robust to several sensitivity checks, so large deviations are unexpected.","Emediegwu, Lotanna E",J Environ Manage,37,1

We add additional new properties for the incidence rate restricted Poisson probability distribution. With new properties, our method becomes feasible to comprehend not only the patterns of the prevalence rate of the COVID-19's infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality but also to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of social distancing, healthcare management's efforts to hospitalize the patients, the patient's immunity to recover, and lastly the unfortunate mortality itself. To make regional comparisons (as the people's movement is far more frequent within than outside the regional zone on daily basis), we group the COVID-19 data in terms of eastern, central, mountain, and pacific zone states. Several non-intuitive findings in the data results are noticed. They include the existence of imbalance, different vulnerability, and risk reduction in these four regions. For example, the impact of healthcare efforts is high in the recovery category in the pacific states. The impact is less in the hospitalization category in the mountain states. The least impact is seen in the infectivity category in the eastern zone states. A few thoughts on future research work are cited. It requires collecting rich data on COVID-19 and extracting valuable information for better public health policies.","Shanmugam, Ramalingam",J Healthc Inform Res,37,27

The study aimed to monitor in-depth the feasibility of the regulations and their impact on the well-being of residents, their visitors, and healthcare staff. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study in 5 of the 26 facilities; the facilities were affiliated to an academic network of nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Visitors and healthcare professionals. INTERVENTION: Allowing visitors using local regulations based on national guidelines. MEASUREMENTS: Digital questionnaire, analyzing documentation such as infection prevention control protocols, attending meetings of COVID-19 crisis teams, in-depth telephone or in-person interviews with visitors and healthcare professionals, and on-site observations. RESULTS: National guidelines were translated with great variety into local care practice. Healthcare professionals agreed that reopening would increase the well-being of the residents and their loved ones. However, there were also great worries for increasing workload, increasing the risk of emotional exhaustion, and the risk of COVID-19 infections. Compliance with local regulations was generally satisfactory, but maintaining social distance and correctly wearing face masks appeared to be difficult. Care staff remained ambivalent for fear of infections. In general, allowing visitors was experienced as having a positive impact on the well-being of all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some residents with dementia showed negative effects. CONCLUSION: The complete lockdown of Dutch nursing homes had a substantial impact on the well-being of the residents. The reopening was welcomed by all stakeholders, but provided a high organizational workload as well as feelings of ambivalence among care staff. In the second wave, a more tailored approach is being implemented. However, facilities are sometimes still struggling to find the right balance between infection control and well-being.","Koopmans, Raymond T C M; Verbeek, Hilde; Bielderman, Annemiek; Janssen, Meriam M; Persoon, Anke; Lesman-Leegte, Ivonne; Sizoo, Eefje M; Hamers, Jan P H; Gerritsen, Debby L",Int Psychogeriatr,37,10

Unlike many institutions around the world, the traditional form of teaching in Albania before the Covid-19 pandemic was face-to-face where both lectures and seminars were attended physically in the classroom. However, the Covid-19 pandemic imposed on them the necessity to move from auditoriums to e-learning immediately without any preparation. This paper aims to investigate the Albanian learners’ attitudes and perceptions of synchronous e-learning during the second semester of the 2019 – 2020 academic year. A survey consisting of 15 questions was distributed to a total of 168 undergraduate and graduate learners in 2 public universities in Albania. Results from the study showed that the learners preferred face-to-face learning over synchronous learning. The lack of motivation, low level of interaction with their instructors and peers, and the feeling of isolation were their main concerns. Meanwhile, the learners appreciated the fact that e-learning helped them to improve their computer and internet skills.

Unless the intermediate host necessary for completing a natural zoonotic jump is identified, the dual-use gain-of-function research practice of viral serial passage should be considered a viable route by which the novel coronavirus arose. The practice of serial passage mimics a natural zoonotic jump, and offers explanations for SARS-CoV-2's distinctive spike-protein region and its unexpectedly high affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), as well as the notable polybasic furin cleavage site within it.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether customizing of public service announcements (PSAs) providing health guidelines to match individuals' identities increases their compliance. METHODS: We conducted a within- and between-subjects, randomized controlled cross-sectional, web-based study in July 2020. Participants viewed two PSAs: one advocating wearing a mask in public settings and one advocating staying at home. The control PSA only provided information, and the treatment PSAs were designed to appeal to the identities held by individuals; that is, either a Christian identity or an economically motivated identity. Participants were asked about their identity and then provided a control PSA and treatment PSA matching their identity, in random order. The PSAs were of approximately 100 words. RESULTS: We recruited 300 social media users from Amazon Mechanical Turk in accordance with usual protocols to ensure data quality. In total, 8 failed the data quality checks, and the remaining 292 were included in the analysis. In the identity-based PSA, the source of the PSA was changed, and a phrase of approximately 12 words relevant to the individual's identity was inserted. A PSA tailored for Christians, when matched with a Christian identity, increased the likelihood of compliance by 12 percentage points. A PSA that focused on economic values, when shown to individuals who identified as economically motivated, increased the likelihood of compliance by 6 points. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media to deliver COVID-19 public health announcements customized to individuals' identities is a promising measure to increase compliance with public health guidelines.

METHODS: An expert panel was assembled from the recently convened ACR RA disease activity and functional status measures working groups to summarize strategies for implementation of ACR recommended RA disease activity (Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI], 28-joint Disease Activity Score [DAS28-ESR/CRP], Patient Activity Scale [PAS-II], Simplified Disease Activity Index [SDAI], Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 [RAPID3]) and functional status (Health Assessment Questionnaire-II [HAQ-II], Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire [MDHAQ], PROMIS physical function 10-item short form [PROMIS PF-10]) measures in telehealth settings. RESULTS: Measures composed of patient-reported items (disease activity: PAS-II, RAPID3; functional status: HAQ-II, MDHAQ, PROMIS PF-10) require minimal modification for use in telehealth settings. Measures requiring formal joint counts (CDAI, DAS28-ESR/CRP, and SDAI) can be calculated using patient-reported swollen and tender joint counts. When the feasibility of lab testing is limited, CDAI can be used in place of the SDAI and scoring modifications of the DAS28-ESR/CRP without the acute phase reactant are available. Assessment of the validity of these modifications is limited. Implementation of these measures can be facilitated by electronic health record collection, mobile applications, and provider/staff administration during telehealth visits. CONCLUSIONS: ACR recommended RA disease activity and functional status measures can be adapted for use in telehealth settings to support high-quality clinical care.

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19 and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resource optimisation is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography.We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from seven cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the deep learning system, making it learn lung features. Following this, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19 (471 had follow-up for >5â days) and 342 with other pneumonia) from six cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system.In the four external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC 0.87 and 0.88, respectively) and viral pneumonia (AUC 0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time had significant difference (p=0.013 and p=0.014, respectively). Without human assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening of COVID-19 and identifying potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.","Wang, Shuo; Zha, Yunfei; Li, Weimin; Wu, Qingxia; Li, Xiaohu; Niu, Meng; Wang, Meiyun; Qiu, Xiaoming; Li, Hongjun; Yu, He; Gong, Wei; Bai, Yan; Li, Li; Zhu, Yongbei; Wang, Liusu; Tian, Jie",Eur. respir. j,37,1

Alternative do-it-yourself respirators (ADR) emerge, without any proof of protection. Objective Verify seal potential of two ADR compared to a common FFP2 respirator. Design Quality assessment pilot study. Setting Tertiary Care Hospital. Participants Ten anaesthesiology residents. Interventions Participants performed quantitative face-fit tests (QNFT) with three respirators to evaluate seal. A common FFP2 respirator was used as baseline (control group). ADR tested in this study are an Anaesthesia Face Mask (AFM) and a full-face Modified Snorkelling Mask (MSM) with a 3D-printed connector, both in conjunction with a breathing system filter. Main outcome measures Non-inferior seal performance of ADR over FFP2, assessed by calculated QNFT based on measured individual fit factors, as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Results For each respirator a total of 90 individual fit factor measurements were taken. Within the control group, seal failed in 37 (41%) measurements but only in 10 (11%) within the AFM group and in 6 (7%) within the MSM group (P < 0.001 respectively). However, when calculating the final, mean QNFT results, no statistically significant difference was found between respirators. Successful QNFT were determined for 5 out of 10 participants in the control group, for 8 in the AFM group (P = 0.25) and for 7 in the MSM group (P = 0.69). Conclusion Both ADR do have the potential to provide non inferior seal compared to a common FFP2 respirator. While AFM respirators are easily assembled, snorkelling masks must undergo significant but feasible modifications. Our results suggest that those ADR masks might be further investigated as they seem to be viable alternatives for situations when certified respirators are not available.","Pettinger, M.; Momeni, M.; Michaud, C.; Van Dyck, M.; Kahn, D.; Lemaire, G.",,37,29

The role of the NF‐kB pathway in these cellular processes remains poorly characterized. When investigated in VERO‐E6 cells, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was found to markedly stimulate NF‐kB protein expression and activity. NF‐kB activation occurs early in the infection process (6 hpi) and it is associated with increased MAPK signaling and expression of the UPR inducer IRE‐1α. These signal transduction processes characterize the cellular stress response to the virus promoting a pro‐inflammatory environment and caspase activation in the host cell. Inhibition of viral replication by the viral protease inhibitor Nelfinavir reverts all these molecular changes also stimulating c‐Jun expression, a key component of the JNK/AP‐1 pathway with important role in the IRE‐1α‐mediated transcriptional regulation of stress response genes with anti‐inflammatory and cytoprotection function. The present study demonstrates that UPR signaling and its interaction with cellular MAPKs and the NF‐kB activity are important aspects of SARS‐CoV‐2‐host cell interaction that deserve further investigation to identify more efficient therapies for this viral infection.","Bartolini, Desirée; Stabile, Anna Maria; Vacca, Carmine; Pistilli, Alessandra; Rende, Mario; Gioiello, Antimo; Cruciani, Gabriele; Galli, Francesco",IUBMB Life,37,33

SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. In order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2’ site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication. Our data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","Bestle, Dorothea; Heindl, Miriam Ruth; Limburg, Hannah; van, Thuy Van Lam; Pilgram, Oliver; Moulton, Hong; Stein, David A.; Hardes, Kornelia; Eickmann, Markus; Dolnik, Olga; Rohde, Cornelius; Becker, Stephan; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Garten, Wolfgang; Steinmetzer, Torsten; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva",bioRxiv,37,1

Evidence for the need of such change has accumulated over the past six decades from the laboratory experiments and field tests conducted by plant pathologists and plant virologists working with different plant viruses, and, in particular, from research on Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). A direct confirmation of such close protection came with the finding that “pre-immunization” of citrus plants with the variants of the T36 strain of CTV but not with variants of other virus strains was providing protection against a fluorescent protein-tagged T36-based recombinant virus variant. Under natural conditions close protection is functional and is closely associated both with the conservation of the CTV genome sequence and prevention of superinfection by closely similar isolates. It is suggested that the mechanism is primarily directed to prevent the danger of virus population collapse that could be expected to result through quasispecies divergence of large RNA genomes of the CTV variants continuously replicating within long-living and highly voluminous fruit trees. This review article provides an overview of the CTV cross-protection research, along with a discussion of the phenomenon in the context of the CTV biology and genetics.","Folimonova, Svetlana Y.; Achor, Diann; Bar-Joseph, Moshe",Viruses,37,1

It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the COVID-19-related autoimmune/rheumatic disorders reported between January and September 2020. In particular, we investigated the cases of incident hematological autoimmune manifestations, connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome/antibodies, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like syndromes, acute arthritis, autoimmune-like skin lesions, and neurologic autoimmune conditions such as Guillain–Barré syndrome. We screened 6263 articles and report herein the findings of 382 select reports which allow us to conclude that there are 2 faces of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, that include a benign virus controlling immune response and a many faceted range of dysregulated multi-tissue and organ directed autoimmune responses that provides a major challenge in the management of this viral disease. The number of cases for each disease varied significantly while there were no reported cases of adult onset Still disease, systemic sclerosis, or inflammatory myositis.","Novelli, Lucia; Motta, Francesca; De Santis, Maria; Ansari, Aftab A.; Gershwin, M.

However, security and privacy become the main concerns of IoMT due to the limited computational capability, memory space and energy constraint of medical sensors, leading to the in-feasibility for conventional cryptographic approaches, which are often computationally-complicated. In contrast to cryptographic approaches, friendly jamming (Fri-jam) schemes will not cause extra computing cost to medical sensors, thereby becoming potential countermeasures to ensure security of IoMT. In this paper, we present a study on using Fri-jam schemes in IoMT. We first analyze the data security in IoMT and discuss the challenges. We then propose using Fri-jam schemes to protect the confidential medical data of patients collected by medical sensors from being eavesdropped. We also discuss the integration of Fri-jam schemes with various communication technologies, including beamforming, Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) and full duplexity. Moreover, we present two case studies of Fri-jam schemes in IoMT. The results of these two case studies indicate that the Fri-jam method will significantly decrease the eavesdropping risk while leading to no significant influence on legitimate transmission.","Li, Xuran; Dai, Hong-Ning; Wang, Qubeijian; Imran, Muhammad; Li, Dengwang; Imran, Muhammad Ali",Comput Commun,37,1

The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004) Methods: The study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 microgram, 7.5 microgram, and 15 microgram) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42. Results: A total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN-gamma and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-gamma and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 microgram CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were ~10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 microgram)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations","Ward, B.

Quality assurance metrics for these RT-PCR tests are still evolving as testing becomes widely implemented. As testing increases, it is important to understand performance characteristics and the errors associated with these tests. Here, we investigate a high-throughput, laboratory developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay to determine if modeling can generate quality control metrics that identify false positive (FP) results due to contamination. This study reviewed repeated clinical samples focusing on positive samples that test negative upon re-extraction and PCR, likely representing false positives. To identify and predict false positive samples, we constructed machine learning derived models based on the extraction methodology used. These models identified variables associated with false positive results across all methodologies, with sensitivities for predicting FP results ranging between 67-100%. Application of the models to all results predicted a total FP rate of 0.08% across all samples, or 2.3% of positive results, similar to reports for other RT-PCR tests for RNA viruses. These models can predict quality control parameters, enabling laboratories to generate decision trees that reduce interpretation errors, allow for automated reflex testing of samples with a high FP probability, improve workflow efficiency and increase diagnostic accuracy for patient care.","Martinez, Ryan John; Pankratz, Nathan; Schomaker, Matthew; Daniel, Jerry; Beckman, Kenneth; Karger, Amy Beth; Thyagarajan, Bharat; Ferreri, Patricia; Yohe, Sophia Louise; Nelson, Andrew Cook",J Mol Diagn,37,5

The increased circulation and spread in the Americas of VEEV and other encephalitic arboviruses, such as eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, underscore the need for research aimed at characterizing the pathogenesis of viral encephalomyelitis for the development of novel medical countermeasures. The host-pathogen dynamics of VEEV Trinidad donkey-infected human astrocytoma U87MG cells were determined by carrying out RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of poly(A) and mRNAs. To identify the critical alterations that take place in the host transcriptome following VEEV infection, samples were collected at 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection and RNA-Seq data were acquired using an Ion Torrent PGM platform. Differential expression of interferon response, stress response factors, and components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was observed. The protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR was activated, as the expression of both activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CHOP (DDIT3), critical regulators of the pathway, was altered after infection. Expression of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) was induced in a PERK-dependent manner. EGR1(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrated lower susceptibility to VEEV-induced cell death than isogenic wild-type MEFs, indicating that EGR1 modulates proapoptotic pathways following VEEV infection. The influence of EGR1 is of great importance, as neuronal damage can lead to long-term sequelae in individuals who have survived VEEV infection. IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses represent a group of clinically relevant viruses transmitted by mosquitoes to humans. In severe cases, viral spread targets neuronal tissue, resulting in significant and life-threatening inflammation dependent on a combination of virus-host interactions. Currently there are no therapeutics for infections cause by encephalitic alphaviruses due to an incomplete understanding of their molecular pathogenesis. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an alphavirus that is prevalent in the Americas and that is capable of infecting horses and humans. Here we utilized next-generation RNA sequencing to identify differential alterations in VEEV-infected astrocytes. Our results indicated that the abundance of transcripts associated with the interferon and the unfolded protein response pathways was altered following infection and demonstrated that early growth response 1 (EGR1) contributed to VEEV-induced cell death.","Baer, Alan; Lundberg, Lindsay; Swales, Danielle; Waybright, Nicole; Pinkham, Chelsea; Dinman, Jonathan D.; Jacobs, Jonathan L.; Kehn-Hall, Kylene",J Virol,37,30

Novel methods of oxygen delivery could mitigate that risk. Oxygen hoods/helmets may improve: O(2)-saturation (SaO2), reduce in-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates, and reduce length of hospitalization in hypoxic Covid-19 patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems. METHODS: . DESIGN: Prospective Controlled Cohort Study. SETTING: Single Center. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were reviewed and 136/347 patients met inclusion criteria. STUDY PERIOD: 3/6/2020 to 5/1/2020. 136 participants completed the study with known status for all outcome measures. INTERVENTION OR EXPOSURE: Oxygen hoods/helmets as compared to conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): 1) Pre and post change in oxygen saturation (SaO(2)). 2) In-hospital Intubation. 3) In-hospital Mortality. 4) Length of hospitalization. RESULTS: 136 patients including 58-intervention and 78-control patients were studied. Age, gender, and other demographics/prognostic indicators were comparable between cohorts. Oxygen hoods averted imminent intubation/MV in all 58 COVID-19 patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems with a mean improvement in SaO(2) of 8.8%, p < 0.001. MV rates were observed to be higher in the control 37/78 (47.4%) as compared to the intervention cohort 23/58 (39.7%), a difference of 7.7%, a 27% risk reduction, not statistically significant, OR 95%CI 0.73 (0.37 to 1.5). Mortality rates were observed higher in the control 54/78 (69.2%) as compared to the intervention cohort 36/58 (62.1%), a difference of 7.1%, a 27% risk reduction, not statistically significant OR 95%CI 0.73 (0.36 to 1.5). CONCLUSION: Oxygen hoods demonstrate improvement in SaO(2) for patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen-delivery systems and prevented imminent mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates were reduced with the use of oxygen hoods but not found to be statistically significant. The oxygen hood is a safe, effective oxygen-delivery system which may reduce intubation/MV and mortality rates. Their use should be considered in treating hypoxic COVID-19 patients.

This national survey investigated the prevalence of burnout in U.S. medical students interested in pursuing neurosurgical residency during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 24-question survey was sent to all American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) medical student chapter members. The abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) was used to measure the following burnout metrics: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Bivariate analyses were conducted and multivariate analyses were performed using a logistic regression models. RESULTS: 254 medical students were included (response rate of 14.5%). The majority were male (55.1%), White (66.1%), and between their 2nd and 3rd years in medical school (62.6%). Burnout was identified in 38 (15.0%) respondents, a rate lower than reported in the pre-COVID era. In multivariate analysis, burnout was significantly associated with choosing not to pursue, or feeling uncertain about pursuing, a medical career again if given the choice (OR = 3.40, p = 0.0075), having second thoughts about choosing to pursue neurosurgery (OR = 3.47, p = 0.0025), attending a medical program in the Northeast compared to the Southeast (OR = 0.32, p = 0.027) or Southwest U.S. (OR = 0.30, p = 0.046), and indicating that one’s future clinical performance will have worsened due to COVID-19 (OR = 2.71, p = 0.025).

Since the discovery of ligase chain reaction (LCR) in the late nineties, it became one of the most favored platforms for detecting these variants and also for genotyping low abundant contaminants. Recent and powerful modifications with the integration of various detection strategies such as electrochemical and magnetic biosensors, nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots, quartz crystal and leaky surface acoustic surface biosensors, DNAzyme, rolling circle amplification (RCA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), surface enhanced raman scattering (SERS), chemiluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer have been introduced to both LCR and ligation based amplifications to enable high-throughput and inexpensive multiplex genotyping with improved robustness, simplicity, sensitivity and specificity. In this article, classical and up to date modifications in LCR and ligation based amplifications are critically evaluated and compared with emphasis on points of strength and weakness, sensitivity, cost, running time, equipment needed, applications and multiplexing potential. Versatile genotyping applications such as genetic diseases detection, bacterial and viral pathogens detection are also detailed.

As per the analysis of covariance the income loss and remittances unsent amount was higher amongst the elderly labourers engaged in professions which remained non‐operational during lockdown period. Further, the additional days of joblessness increased their hardship in terms of income and remittances. With coronavirus being more than a health crisis, in short term it is necessary to minimise the loss of life, forwarding social and financial security for the families of migrant labourers and vulnerable sections for extended period of crisis, strategies for supporting agriculture and allied activities, promotion of small and medium‐size enterprises, imparting skill training for the unemployed and reverse migrant labourers, financial assistance for self‐employment may be helpful. Suitable coordination of monetary and fiscal policy would be helpful for reducing the unemployment heading from the recessionary trend of the economy in the long run.","Guha, Pradyut; Islam, Bodrul; Hussain, Md Aktar",J Public Aff,37,16

There is a paucity of data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. In this paper, we sought to provide an epidemiologic description of patients who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Vietnam. Methods. Data were abstracted from the wikipedia's COVID-19 information resource and Johns Hopkins University Dashboard. Demographic data and treatment status were obtained for each patient in each day. The coverage period was from 23/1/2020 to 10/4/2020. Descriptive analyses of incident cases were stratified by gender and age group. The estimation of the reproduction ratio was done with a bootstrap method using the R statistical environment. Results. During the coverage period, Vietnam has recorded 257 cases of COVID-19. Approximately 54% of the cases were women. The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 3 months to 88 years), with 78% of patients aged 49 or younger. About 66% (n = 171) of patients were overseas tourists (20%) and Vietnamese students or workers returning from overseas (46%). Approximately 57% (n = 144) of patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. There have been no mortality. The reproduction ratio was estimated to range between 0.95 and 1.24. Conclusion. These data indicate that a majority of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam was imported cases in overseas tourists and young students and workers who had returned from overseas.","Nguyen, Huy G; Nguyen, Tuan V",,37,16

METHODS: We designed a randomized clinical trial enrolling 120 patients with a BMI≥32.5 kg/m(2) after LSG. They were randomized into two groups to be administered with omeprazole by rapid intravenous injection (group A) or by continuous micropump infusion (group B). The plasma concentration of omeprazole was monitored upon initiating administration. Change in intragastric pH and gastrointestinal symptoms during follow-up served as indicators for therapeutic evaluation. RESULTS: Patients in the two groups showed no difference in the AUC curves (P=0.25), but group A had significantly higher peak concentration (P<0.001), and shorter time to reach peak concentration after administration (P<0.001), compared to group B. Before and after the administration of omeprazole, the average change in intragastric pH was much lower in group A (0.031 ± 0.61) than in group B (0.48 ± 0.74) (P=0.004). The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was similar between the two groups (P=0.85); however, the average duration of remaining symptoms was longer in group A (3.97 months; 95% CI, 2.90–5.04) than in group B (2.82 months; 95% CI, 2.01–3.63) (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: Continuous micropump infusion of omeprazole may improve the outcomes in patients with obesity after LSG.

This paper focuses on increasing accessibility through the development of a video-based, pediatric teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) practice model that was developed in a private practice 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: ‘Design thinking’ methodology to problem-solving was utilized to innovate the traditional neuropsychology practice model in under-served areas who may have limited financial and healthcare resources. The practice model approach to include a virtual diagnostic clinic with increased patient and provider efficiency was created to enhance accessibility for patients and sustainability for providers. RESULTS: Video-based TeleNP screenings were conducted for 67 children with developmental (i.e., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder) and language disorders, as well as concussion and psychiatric diagnoses. Additional comorbidities were identified in 65.6% of children. Follow-up data approximately 2 months later revealed 98.5% of children were receiving new interventions as a result of the video-based TeleNP assessment. CONCLUSION: Video-based TeleNP benefits the consumer as it can reduce wait times, decrease family financial burden (i.e., travel and parent time off work), expedite referrals for interventions, and provide geographically under-served populations access to providers who are linguistically and culturally responsive. For providers, this model revealed improvements with direct implications for cost-saving, thereby facilitating long-term economic sustainability within a private practice healthcare marketplace.","Salinas, Christine M; Bordes Edgar, Veronica; Berrios Siervo, Gretchen; Bender, Heidi A",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,37,11

In this study, we have tested potential BPA detoxification with Korean pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) extract, stimulators of ADH and ALDH, as well as arbutin, a reference compound in the pears, on the micropillar/microwell chip platform with human liver cells. Surprisingly, the toxicity of BPA was reduced in the presence of Korean pear extract, indicated by significantly increased IC(50) values. The IC(50) value of BPA with Korean pear extract tested against HepG2 cells was shifted from 151 to 451 μM, whereas those tested against Hep3B cells was shifted from 110 to 204 μM. Among the tested various concentrations, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL of the extract significantly reduced BPA toxicity (Ps < 0.05). However, there was no such detoxification effects with arbutin.

We have analyzed Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine integrity under different movement conditions to provide information that may improve the distribution of vaccines to the target population. METHODS: Syringes of reconstituted Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were prepared in a laminar flow chamber to be subjected to a stability analysis in order to evaluate the impact of movement conditions on mRNA integrity. RNA integrity was checked by the lack of RNA peaks under the original mRNA peak in the electropherogram resulting from potential fragments from RNA degradation. Samples were then exposed for 180 min at room temperature (21±1C°, 55±10% of humidity) under different movement conditions. RESULTS: We report that the integrity of the mRNA of the COVID-19 reconstituted vaccines after continuous moderate movement at room temperature is maintained for at least three hours with values of fluorescence units (FU) under the original mRNA peak of 0.38±0.06 in Pfizer-BioNTech and 0.96±1.18 FU in Moderna, equal to the values obtained without movement (0.36±0.08 FU in Pfizer-BioNTech and 1.12±0.19 FU in Moderna). In contrast, the integrity of these vaccines exposed to repeated Vortex shaking was significantly impaired (p<0.001) with values under the original mRNA peak of 1.34±0.31 FU for the Pfizer-BioNTech and 5.03±1.16 FU for the Moderna samples. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of these reconstituted vaccines here reported may improve the efficiency in the ground transportation and distribution of the vaccines, which may lead to shorter and more homogeneous vaccination in cities and rural areas.","Grau, Santiago; Ferrández, Olivia; Martín-García, Elena; Maldonado, Rafael",Clin Microbiol Infect,37,16

There has been minimal information on how COVID-19 has affected exercise testing in pediatric patients. DESIGN: A web-based survey was designed and sent to pediatric exercise testing laboratories in the United States and Canada. Questions were designed to understand the initial and ongoing adaptations made by pediatric exercise testing laboratories in response to COVID-19. Results were analyzed as frequency data. RESULTS: There were responses from 42% (35/85) of programs, with 68% (23/34) of laboratories discontinuing all exercise testing. Of the 23 programs that discontinued testing, 15 (65%) are actively working on triage plans to reopen the exercise laboratory. Personal protective equipment use include gloves (96%; 25/26), surgical masks (88%; 23/26), N-95 masks (54%; 14/26), face shields (69%; 18/26), and gowns (62%; 16/26). Approximately 47% (15/32) of programs that typically acquire metabolic measurements reported either ceasing or modifying metabolic measurements during COVID-19. Additionally, 62% (16/26) of the programs that previously obtained pulmonary function testing reported either ceasing or modifying pulmonary function testing. Almost 60% of respondents expressed a desire for additional guidance on exercise laboratory management during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric exercise testing laboratories largely closed during the early pandemic, with many of these programs either now open or working on a plan to open. Despite this, there remains heterogeneity in how to minimize exposure risks to patients and staff. Standardization of exercise testing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic may help reduce some of these differences.","Powell, Adam W.; Mays, Wayne A.; Curran, Tracy; Knecht, Sandra K.; Rhodes, Jonathan",World J Pediatr Congenit Heart Surg,37,1

Adaptation strategies prioritizing COVID-19 patients included triage of patients and reduction or re-allocation of other services. The aim of our survey was to provide a real time international snapshot of modifications of breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was developed by a multidisciplinary group on behalf of European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists and distributed via breast cancer societies. One reply per breast unit was requested. RESULTS: In ten days, 377 breast centres from 41 countries completed the questionnaire. RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment was reported by 44.8% of the institutions. The estimated time interval between diagnosis and treatment initiation increased for about 20% of institutions. Indications for primary systemic therapy were modified in 56% (211/377), with upfront surgery increasing from 39.8% to 50.7% (p<0.002) and from 33.7% to 42.2% (p<0.016) in T1cN0 triple-negative and ER-negative/HER2-positive cases, respectively. Sixty-seven percent considered that chemotherapy increases risks for developing COVID-19 complications. Fifty-one percent of the responders reported modifications in chemotherapy protocols. Gene-expression profile used to evaluate the need for adjuvant chemotherapy increased in 18.8%. In luminal-A tumours, a large majority (68%) recommended endocrine treatment to postpone surgery. Postoperative radiation therapy was postponed in 20% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer management was considerably modified during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, it is accepted in most cases that T-cell deficient hosts die of acute infection because of the impaired ability of the innate immune system to control pathogens. Recent studies, however, reveal that adaptive immune cells actively dampen initial innate responses. In contrast to current understanding, there is now evidence that an insufficient number of T cells results in loss of control of innate immune responses. This raises new questions regarding the, as of yet underappreciated, role of the adaptive immune system in early infection and inflammation.","Zhao, Jie; Yang, Xuanming; Auh, Sogyong L.; Kim, Kwang Dong; Tang, Hong; Fu, Yang-Xin",Trends Immunol,37,5

We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 re‐infections in the general population in Austria. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS‐CoV‐2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS‐CoV‐2 re‐infections of COVID‐19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re‐infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive. RESULTS: We recorded 40 tentative re‐infections in 14 840 COVID‐19 survivors of the first wave (0.27%) and 253 581 infections in 8 885 640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85%) translating into an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a relatively low re‐infection rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 in Austria. Protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 after natural infection is comparable with the highest available estimates on vaccine efficacies. Further well‐designed research on this issue is urgently needed for improving evidence‐based decisions on public health measures and vaccination strategies.","Pilz, Stefan; Chakeri, Ali; Ioannidis, John PA; Richter, Lukas; Theiler‐Schwetz, Verena; Trummer, Christian; Krause, Robert; Allerberger, Franz",Eur J Clin Invest,37,1

Recently, very divergent hantaviruses have been discovered in distinct species of bats worldwide, but their association with human disease remains unclear. Considering the low success rates of detecting hantavirus RNA in bat tissues and that to date no hantaviruses have been isolated from bat samples, immunodiagnostic tools could be very helpful to understand pathogenesis, epidemiology, and geographic range of bat-borne hantaviruses. In this sense, we aimed to identify in silico immunogenic B-cell epitopes present on bat-borne hantaviruses nucleoprotein (NP) and verify if they are conserved among them and other selected members of Mammantavirinae, using a combination of (the three most used) different prediction algorithms, ELLIPRO, Discotope 2.0, and PEPITO server. To support our data, we in silico modeled 3D structures of NPs from representative members of bat-borne hantaviruses, using comparative and ab initio methods due to the absence of crystallographic structures of studied proteins or similar models in the Protein Data Bank. Our analysis demonstrated the antigenic complexity of the bat-borne hantaviruses group, showing a low sequence conservation of epitopes among members of its own group and a minor conservation degree in comparison to Orthohantavirus, with a recognized importance to public health. Our data suggest that the use of recombinant rodent-borne hantavirus NPs to cross-detect antibodies against bat- or shrew-borne viruses could underestimate the real impact of this virus in nature.","de Oliveira, Renata Carvalho; Fernandes, Jorlan; de Sampaio Lemos, Elba Regina; de Paiva Conte, Fernando; Rodrigues-da-Silva, Rodrigo Nunes",Viruses,37,1

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with Lycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation treatments, and microbial diversity studies.

A total of 160 patients with COVID-19 in whom serum ferritin, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had been analyzed at admission were included. RESULTS: We found that ferritin, LDH, ALC, and CRP predicted with 88% accuracy the probability of early MIV. Results indicated that LDH showed the greater area under the curve (AUC), with a value of 89.1%. Using the AUC, we established cutoff values for clinical application.

Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) is an ideal model for studying the interaction between avian viruses and their hosts. To establish a methodological platform for RNAi studies in CEF, three plasmid vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeted against the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) NP gene were constructed. One of them, ndv1, was proven effective on blocking viral replication in CEF and chicken embryos. Four hours prior to infection with NDV, the CEF was transfected with the plasmids by Silent-fect. An unrelated shRNA sequence (HK) was used in mock transfection. The expression of a potent shRNA resulted in up to 2.3, 21.1 and 9.8 fold decreases in NP gene expression at 3, 6 and 9 h post infection in CEF, respectively. The ndv1 was able to completely inhibit the replication of the virus in CEF within 48 post infection. Furthermore, the pathological changes in CEF caused by NDV were delayed, and the degree of pathological changes was lighter compared with the mock transfection in the presence of ndv1. When the complex of shRNA-Silent-fect and NDV was co-injected into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated eggs with 10(5) or 10(6) ELD(50) NDV, NDV replication was decreased by 94.14% and 62.15% after 17 h, respectively. These findings suggest that the newly synthesized NP protein is critical for NDV transcription and replication and provide a basis for identifying the functions of viral genes and screening for effective siRNAs against viruses in CEF and chicken embryo by RNAi.","Yue, Hua; Li, Dingfei; Fu, Anjing; Ma, Li; Yang, Falong; Tang, Cheng",Front Biol China,37,1

Next, we constructed another mutant, KDKE(4A)-SYA, by abolishing the endocytosis signal of the spike protein of KDKE(4A). Compared with icPC22A, the KDKE(4A) and KDKE(4A)-SYA mutants replicated less efficiently in vitro but induced stronger type I and type III interferon responses. The pathogenesis and immunogenicities of the mutants were evaluated in gnotobiotic piglets. The virulence of KDKE(4A)-SYA and KDKE(4A) was significantly reduced compared with that of icPC22A. Mortality rates were 100%, 17%, and 0% in the icPC22A-, KDKE(4A)-, and KDKE(4A)-SYA-inoculated groups, respectively. At 21 days postinoculation (dpi), all surviving pigs were challenged orally with a high dose of icPC22A. The KDKE(4A)-SYA- and KDKE(4A)-inoculated pigs were protected from the challenge, because no KDKE(4A)-SYA- and one KDKE(4A)-inoculated pig developed diarrhea whereas all the pigs in the mock-inoculated group had severe diarrhea, and 33% of them died. Furthermore, we serially passaged the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant in pigs three times and did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations. The data suggest that KDKE(4A)-SYA may be a PEDV vaccine candidate. IMPORTANCE PEDV is the most economically important porcine enteric viral pathogen and has caused immense economic losses in the pork industries in many countries. Effective and safe vaccines are desperately required but still not available. 2′-O-MTase (nsp16) is highly conserved among coronaviruses (CoVs), and the inactivation of nsp16 in live attenuated vaccines has been attempted for several betacoronaviruses. We show that inactivation of both 2′-O-MTase and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein is an approach to designing a promising live attenuated vaccine for PEDV. The in vivo passaging data also validated the stability of the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant. KDKE(4A)-SYA warrants further evaluation in sows and their piglets and may be used as a platform for further optimization. Our findings further confirmed that nsp16 can be a universal target for CoV vaccine development and will aid in the development of vaccines against other emerging CoVs.","Hou, Yixuan; Ke, Hanzhong; Kim, Jineui; Yoo, Dongwan; Su, Yunfang; Boley, Patricia; Chepngeno, Juliet; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.; Wang, Qiuhong",Journal of Virology,37,1

Applying this system to study three variants of concern, we estimate that B.1.1.7 has a 46.6% (95% CI: 32.3–54.6%) transmissibility increase but nominal immune escape from protection induced by prior wild-type infection; B.1.351 has a 32.4% (95% CI: 14.6–48.0%) transmissibility increase and 61.3% (95% CI: 42.6–85.8%) immune escape; and P.1 has a 43.3% (95% CI: 30.3–65.3%) transmissibility increase and 52.5% (95% CI: 0–75.8%) immune escape. Model simulations indicate that B.1.351 and P.1 could outcompete B.1.1.7 and lead to increased infections.

Our goal is to report clinical features and treatment for patients presenting with voice, airway, and/or swallowing concerns postacute COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. METHODS: Patients presenting with laryngeal issues following recovery from COVID-19 were included after evaluation by our laryngology team. Data were collected via retrospective chart review from March 1, 2020, to April 1, 2021. This included details of the patient’s COVID-19 course, initial presentation to laryngology, and subsequent treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty (83%) patients were hospitalized, and 18 required endotracheal intubation for a median (range) duration of 14 days (6-31). Ten patients underwent tracheostomy. Patients were evaluated at a median 107 days (32-215) after their positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. The most common presenting concerns were dysphonia (n = 19, 79%), dyspnea (n = 17, 71%), and dysphagia (n = 6, 25%). Vocal fold motion impairment (50%), early glottic injury (39%), subglottic/tracheal stenosis (22%), and posterior glottic stenosis (17%) were identified in patients who required endotracheal intubation. Patients who did not need intubation were most frequently treated for muscle tension dysphonia (67%). CONCLUSION: Patients may develop significant voice, airway, and/or swallowing issues postacute COVID-19. These complications are not limited to patients requiring intubation or tracheostomy. Multidisciplinary laryngology clinics will continue to play an integral role in diagnosing and treating patients with COVID-19–related laryngeal sequelae.","Neevel, Andrew J.; Smith, Joshua D.; Morrison, Robert J.; Hogikyan, Norman D.; Kupfer, Robbi A.; Stein, Andrew P.",OTO Open,37,16

Here, we explored the role of CCR5 and its ligands across the immunologic spectrum of COVID-19. We used a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the immunologic phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 224 individuals including healthy controls and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We assessed the plasma and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 29 healthy controls, 26 Mild-Moderate COVID-19 individuals, 48 Severe COVID-19 individuals, and 121 individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients from each group. B-cells were significantly elevated compared to healthy control individuals (P<0.001) as was the CD14+, CD16+, CCR5+ monocytic subset (P<0.001). CD4 and CD8 positive T-cells expressing PD-1 as well as T-regulatory cells were significantly lower than healthy controls (P<0.001 and P=0.01 respectively). CCL5/RANTES, IL-2, IL-4, CCL3, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and VEGF were all significantly elevated compared to healthy controls (all P<0.001). Conversely GM-CSF and CCL4 were in significantly lower levels than healthy controls (P=0.01). Data were further analyzed and the classes were balanced using SMOTE. With a balanced working dataset, we constructed 3 random forest classifiers: a multi-class predictor, a Severe disease group binary classifier and a PASC binary classifier. Models were also analyzed for feature importance to identify relevant cytokines to generate a disease score. Multi-class models generated a score specific for the PASC patients and defined as S1 = (IFN-γ + IL-2)/CCL4-MIP-1β. Second, a score for the Severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (IL-6+sCD40L/1000 + VEGF/10 + 10*IL-10)/(IL-2 + IL-8). Severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While PASC patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells.","Patterson, Bruce K.; Guevara-Coto, Jose; Yogendra, Ram; Francisco, Edgar B.; Long, Emily; Pise, Amruta; Rodrigues, Hallison; Parikh, Purvi; Mora, Javier; Mora-Rodríguez, Rodrigo A.",Front Immunol,37,16

Parental co-participation has a major impact on children’s health consequences. This study addressed a gap in the research by investigating daily parental co-participation in children’s digital media use and physical play, using the family ecological model theoretical framework. The participants in this nationally representative cross-sectional study were 2512 Finnish parents with two- to six-year-old children. Parents completed a questionnaire. Sociodemographic correlates of co-participation and of the awareness of guidelines regarding co-participation and correlation between co-participation in digital media use and physical play were analysed. Parental co-participation in physical play and digital media use correlated positively. Lower parental age, male parental gender, Finnish and Swedish languages, a fewer number of children, and a male child gender were associated with more co-participation in one or both activities, and parental female gender and low family income were associated with more awareness. The awareness of guidelines was not associated with co-participation in digital media use. There were sociodemographic differences in parental co-participation. From a health counselling perspective, parents may benefit from national recommendations on digital media use and physical activity, but adherence to guidelines depends on the family context.","Hasanen, Elina; Koivukoski, Henriikka; Kortelainen, Lauri; Vehmas, Hanna; Sääkslahti, Arja",Int J Environ Res Public Health,37,16

In the quantitative (dominant) phase, 32 participants completed pre-post surveys and 10 of those participants completed the follow-up semi-structured interviews. Paired samples t-tests and McNemar’s test determined bivariate differences between pre- and post-surveys. Thematic analyses determined emerging themes to further understand these differences. There was a significant increase in: (1) perceived advantages of clinical trials pretest (M = 26.63, SD = 5.43) and post-test (M = 28.53, SD = 4.24, p < .01); and (2) in trust in medical researchers from pre to post (M = 36.16, SD = 10.40 vs. M = 27.53, SD = 9.37, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in pre- and post-tests as it relates to perceived disadvantages of clinical trials and willingness to participate. Qualitative analysis yielded the following themes: (1) sharing research results and the impact on attitudes towards research; (2) community listening sessions: a trust building strategy; and (3) satisfaction with the community listening session.

Secondary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality. Methods: Patients under treatment with double (DT) and triple therapy (TT) for COVID-19 were consecutively included in this prospective observational study. Serial in-hospital electrocardiograms were performed to measure QTc at baseline and during therapy. Results: 168 patients (±66.2 years old) were included: 32.1% received DT and 67.9% received TT. The mean baseline QTc was 410.33 ms. Patients under DT and TT prolonged QTc interval respect baseline values (p < 0.001), without significant differences between both therapy groups (p = 0.748).

The most common manifestation of SARS-CoV2 infection (Coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) is viral pneumonia with varying degrees of respiratory compromise and up to 40% of hospitalized patients might develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Several clinical trials evaluated the role of corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 ARDS with conflicting results. We designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of early intravenous dexamethasone administration on the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 28 days after randomization in adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to confirmed or probable COVID-19. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, stratified, multicenter, open-label, controlled trial including 350 patients with early-onset (less than 48h before randomization) moderate or severe ARDS, defined by the Berlin criteria, due to COVID-19. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either standard treatment plus dexamethasone (intervention group) or standard treatment without dexamethasone (control group). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20mg IV once daily for 5 days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg IV once daily for additional 5 days or until Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharge, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days within 28 days after randomization, defined as days alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality rates at day 28, evaluation of the clinical status at day 15 assessed with a 6-level ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation duration from randomization to day 28, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score evaluation at 48h, 72h and 7 days and ICU-free days within 28.

The developed and developing countries are facing the burden equally and no proven treatment options available. Recent studies suggest the plausibility of vitamin D therapy and prophylaxis for COVID-19, in the setting where the deficiency is more prevalent. Though evaluation of vitamin D status is not a routine in India, the present study focuses on the level of Vitamin d among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study was a hospital-based cross-sectional to find the status of vitamin D among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital, Patna, Bihar, India. The demographic, comorbidity data were taken, and the level of vitamin D was measured by a chemiluminescence-based immunoassay analyzer. The analysis compared the level of deficiency and insufficiency among different groups of COVID-19 patients. The role of DM and HTN as risk factors for mortality was compared. RESULTS: Among the total study participants (156), 42.31% were obese and 17.31% were severe as per clinical severity. The total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 58.97% and insufficiency was 89.1%. The prevalence was found high among male (61.02%), overweight (65.52%), and severe (62.96%) patients. The severity increases with advanced age (p<0.05) and important risk factors for mortality are DM, HTN, and advanced age. CONCLUSION: The level of vitamin D can be assessed for the prognosis of COIVD-19 patients and help to modify the treatment protocol.

To curb transmission many countries have adopted social distancing measures and travel restrictions. Estimating the effect of these measures in each context is challenging and requires mathematical models of the transmission dynamics. Projections for the future course of the epidemic strongly rely on model predictions and accurate representation of real-time data as they accumulate. Here I develop an SEIR modeling framework for Covid-19, to evaluate reported cases and fatalities, and to enable forecasting using evidence-based Bayesian parameter estimation. This Bayesian framework offers a tool to parametrize real-time dynamics of Covid-19 cases, and explore the effect of control as it unfolds in any setting. I apply the model to Covid-19 data from Albania, where drastic control measures were put in place already on the day of the first confirmed case. Evaluating the dynamics of reported cases 9-31 March 2020, I estimate parameters and make preliminary projections. Three weeks into the measures, Albanian data already indicate a strong signature of more than 40% transmission reduction, and lend support to a progressively increasing effect of control measures rather than a static one. In the Albanian setting, the model and data match well, projecting the peak of the outbreak may be around 5-15 April, and be contained within 300 active confirmed cases if control continues with the same trend. This framework can be used to understand the quantitative effects of different control measures in real-time, and inform adaptive intervention for success in other settings.","Gjini, Erida",,37,8

This sudden outbreak has caused a huge impact on the global economy, which has intensified the division of globalization and the recession of the global economy. Although the epidemic situation in China has gradually stabilized, the severe situation in the world still inevitably impacts China's economy. Based on the uncertainty of future epidemic, this paper sets up three scenarios to analyze the impact of the epidemic on China's economy. The first is that in June, the epidemic both at home and abroad is under control without rebound; the second is that the domestic epidemic is basically controlled but the foreign situation is not effectively controlled; the third is that the epidemic situation in China has a serious rebound due to the influence of the imported cases from abroad, which destroy the economy again. At the same time, some corresponding guidelines are put forward for the recovery of economy, and to minimize the economic losses as well as accelerate the pace of national economic recovery. In addition, it is believed that these suggestions may have certain reference value to other countries.","Pan, Wei; Huang, Ge; Shi, Yongdong; Hu, Cheng; Dai, Wan‐qiang; Pan, Wulin; Rongsheng, Huang",Glob Chall,37,16

This initial exposure is imprinted on the immune system, so that a subsequent encounter to the same pathogen or a variant will result in a memory recall response that is often protective. Interrogating the naive B cell repertoire in terms of both abundance and specificity to said pathogen may contribute to an understanding of how to potentially elicit protective responses. Here, we isolated naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). Single B cell sorting, and subsequent sequence analysis, showed diverse gene usage and pairing with no apparent restriction on complementarity determining region length in either the heavy or light chains. We show that recombinantly expressed IgGs and Fabs of these germline precursors bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, a subset of these naive antibodies also bind SARS-CoV, an emergent variant (501Y.V2) and a potential pandemic (WIV-1) coronavirus. Furthermore, naive antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be genetically encoded. Future studies aimed at understanding the naive repertoire to other coronaviruses may ultimately reveal shared specificities that could be leveraged to develop pan-coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming encoded germline responses.","Feldman, Jared; Bals, Julia; Denis, Kerri St.; Lam, Evan C.; Hauser, Blake M.; Ronsard, Larance; Sangesland, Maya; Moreno, Thalia Bracamonte; Okonkwo, Vintus; Hartojo, Nathania; Balazs, Alejandro B.; Lingwood, Daniel; Schmidt, Aaron G.",bioRxiv,37,1

However, classical PEDV vaccine strains only provide limited protection against emerging strains. In this study, we successfully isolated and attenuated the PEDV epidemic strain Zhejiang08, which was characterized by good cell adaptation and high-titer production 48 h post infection in Vero E6 cells. The attenuated virus induced a high level of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies until 120 days after immunization in piglets and provided complete protection when challenged with an emerging virus strain on day 14 post immunization. Moreover, the capability to activate dendritic cells (DCs) of this isolate was identified. Higher expression levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ were recorded in DCs after treatment with Zhejiang08 for 24 h. Furthermore, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed high homology between the main antigen epitopes of Zhejiang08 and PEDV pandemic isolates following 2011. Combining the glycosylation site prediction results and their distribution within the spatial structure of the S protein, led to the conclusion that the observed more effective host immune response of Zhejiang08 compared to CV777 was possibly associated with a lack of the potential glycosylation site in the 296 amino acids of the S protein.

Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, three histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilizing in pre-fusion (all three) and post-fusion (two of the three) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface salt–bridge interactions and sidechain–mainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290–R273 and R355–D398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilizing in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilized in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation. These observations are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mutagenesis studies, and other human coronaviruses.","Warwicker, Jim",Brief Bioinform,37,20

Since MS is generally diagnosed at a young age—a period of great significance for personal, relational, and professional development—adaptation can become highly challenging. Therefore, enhancing the competence of young people to adaptively cope with these potential challenges is of utmost importance in order to promote their potentialities and talents. It has been shown that psychological interventions targeting MS patients can enhance resilience and HRQoL and that regular physical activity (PA) and social engagement can improve psychological well-being. However, literature on the development of global interventions based on the bio-psycho-social model of the disease is missing. Even less attention has been paid to interventions dedicated to young adults with MS (YawMS) and to the involvement of patients in the development of such programs. AIMS: In collaboration with MS patients, this study aims to develop a bio-psycho-social intervention (ESPRIMO) for YawMS, aiming to improve their HRQoL and to explore its feasibility, acceptability, and effects. METHODS: To tailor the intervention to the specific needs of YawMS, “patient engagement principles” will be adopted in the co-creation phase, performing a web survey and focus groups with patients and healthcare professionals. In the intervention phase, a pilot sample of 60 young adults with MS will be enrolled. The co-created intervention, composed of group sessions over a 12-week period, will cover psycho-social strategies and include physical activities. Adopting a longitudinal, pre–post evaluation design, self-report questionnaires measuring HRQoL and other bio-psycho-social features (e.g., resilience, well-being, mindfulness traits, self-efficacy, perceived social support, psychological symptoms, illness perception, committed action, fatigue, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, motivation, perception of autonomy support for PA, barriers and intentions to PA) will be administered, the quantity and quality of PA will be measured, and a questionnaire developed by the authors will be used to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the ESPRIMO intervention.","Donisi, Valeria; Gajofatto, Alberto; Mazzi, Maria Angela; Gobbin, Francesca; Busch, Isolde Martina; Ghellere, Annamaria; Klonova, Alina; Rudi, Doriana; Vitali, Francesca; Schena, Federico; Del Piccolo, Lidia; Rimondini, Michela",Front Psychol,37,26

It remains unknown if CytoSorb hemoadsorption will alter sedative and analgesic dosing in critically ill patients on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). We conducted a retrospective review of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring VV-ECMO for respiratory support. Patients who were enrolled in a clinical study of CytoSorb were compared with patients on VV-ECMO alone. Data were collected for the 72-hour CytoSorb therapy and an additional 72 hours post-CytoSorb, or a corresponding control time period. Sedative and analgesic doses were totaled for each day and converted to midazolam or fentanyl equivalents, respectively. The primary endpoint, change in sedative and analgesic requirements over time, were compared using a two-way mixed analysis of variance. Of the 30 patients cannulated for VV-ECMO for COVID-19, 4 were excluded, leaving 8 patients in the CytoSorb arm and 18 in the Control. There was no effect of CytoSorb therapy on midazolam equivalents over the 72-hour therapy (p = 0.71) or the 72 hours post-CytoSorb (p = 0.11). In contrast, there was a significant effect of CytoSorb therapy on fentanyl equivalents over the first 72 hours (p = 0.01), but this was not consistent over the 72-hours post-CytoSorb (p = 0.23). CytoSorb therapy led to significant increases in analgesic requirements without impacting sedative requirements.

METHODS: 187 patients, diagnosed with COVID-19 (non-severe and severe cases) and admitted to hospital between January 27th and March 8th of 2020, were enrolled in the present study. RESULTS: A higher proportion of clinical symptoms, including cough, expectoration, myalgia, and fatigue were observed in the non-severe group. The level of white blood cell count, neutrophils, CRP, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased, while the platelet count was remarkedly decreased in the severe group. The risk model based on lymphocyte, IL-6, IL-8, CRP and platelet counts had the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The baseline of IL-6, IL-8 and CRP was positively correlated with other parameters except in the cases of lymphocyte, hemoglobin and platelet counts. The baseline of the platelet count was negatively correlated with other parameters except in the lymphocyte and hemoglobin counts.

In this study, we aimed to identify the transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and assess the impact of COVID-19 case finding and contact tracing in each epidemic wave. METHODS: We collected data on COVID-19 cases published by local public health authorities in South Korea and divided the study into two epidemic periods (19 January–19 April 2020 for the first epidemic wave and 20 April–11 August 2020 for the second epidemic wave). To identify changes in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the daily effective reproductive number (R(t)) was estimated using the illness onset of the cases. Furthermore, to identify the characteristics of each epidemic wave, frequencies of cluster types were measured, and age-specific transmission probability matrices and serial intervals were estimated. The proportion of asymptomatic cases and cases with unknown sources of infection were also estimated to assess the changes of infections identified as cases in each wave. RESULTS: In early May 2020, within 2-weeks of a relaxation in strict social distancing measures, R(t) increased rapidly from 0.2 to 1.8 within a week and was around 1 until early July 2020. In both epidemic waves, the most frequent cluster types were religious-related activities and transmissions among the same age were more common. Furthermore, children were rarely infectors or infectees, and the mean serial intervals were similar (~ 3 days) in both waves. The proportion of asymptomatic cases at presentation increased from 22% (in the first wave) to 27% (in the second wave), while the cases with unknown sources of infection were similar in both waves (22 and 24%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that relaxing social distancing measures was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission despite rigorous case findings in South Korea. Along with social distancing measures, the enhanced contact tracing including asymptomatic cases could be an efficient approach to control further epidemic waves.

The structure of the ACE2-S-protein complex has been deciphered and we focused on the 27 ACE2 residues that bind to S-protein. From human sequence databases, we identified 9 ACE2 variants at ACE2-S-protein binding sites. We used both experimental assays and protein structure analysis to evaluate the effect of each variant on the binding affinity of ACE2 to S-protein. We found one variant causing complete binding disruption, two and three variants, respectively, strongly and mildly reducing the binding affinity, and two variants strongly enhancing the binding affinity. We then collected the ACE2 gene sequences from 57 non-human primates. Among the six apes and 20 Old World monkeys (OWMs) studied we found no new variants. In contrast, all 11 New World monkeys (NWMs) studied share four variants each causing a strong reduction in binding affinity, the Philippine tarsier also possesses three such variants, and 18 of the 19 prosimian species studied share one variant causing a strong reduction in binding affinity. Moreover, one OWM and three prosimian variants increased binding affinity by > 50%. Based on these findings we proposed that the common ancestor of primates was strongly resistant to and that of NWMs was completely resistant to SARS-CoV-2 and so is the Philippine tarsier, whereas apes and OWMs, like most humans, are susceptible. This study increases our understanding of the differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among primates.","Joyraj Bhattacharjee, Maloyjo; Lin, Jinn-Jy; Chang, Chih-Yao; Chiou, Yu-Ting; Li, Tian-Neng; Tai, Chia-Wei; Shiu, Tz-Fan; Chen, Chi-An; Chou, Chia-Yi; Chakraborty, Paromita; Yuan Tseng, Yan; Hui-Ching Wang, Lily; Li, Wen-Hsiung",Mol Biol Evol,37,21

Due to the high prognostic uncertainty of CHD, data suggests that early pediatric palliative care (PC) consultation may improve shared decision-making, communication, and coping, while minimizing unnecessary medical interventions. However, barriers to pediatric PC persist largely due to the perception that PC consultation is indicative of “giving up.” This review serves to highlight the evolving landscape of perinatal and neonatal CHD and the need for earlier and longitudinal integration of pediatric PC in order to provide high-quality, interdisciplinary care to patients and families.","Afonso, Natasha S.; Ninemire, Margaret R.; Gowda, Sharada H.; Jump, Jaime L.; Lantin-Hermoso, Regina L.; Johnson, Karen E.; Puri, Kriti; Hope, Kyle D.; Kritz, Erin; Achuff, Barbara-Jo; Gurganious, Lindsey; Bhat, Priya N.",Children (Basel),37,22

The activity of ten-eleven translocase 2 (TET2) responsible for selective DNA demethylation, has been recently identified as a regulator of endogenous virus inactivation and viral invasion, possibly by proteasomal deregulation of the TET2/TET3 activities. In a recent report, we presented a detailed list of factors that can be affected by TET activity, including recognition of zinc finger protein binding sites and bimodal promoters, by enhancing the flexibility of adjacent sequences. In this review, we summarize the TET-associated processes and factors that could account for SARS-CoV-2 diverse symptoms. Moreover, we provide a correlation for the observed virus-induced symptoms that have been previously associated with TET activities by in vitro and in vitro studies. These include early hypoxia, neuronal regulation, smell and taste development, liver, intestinal, and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, we propose that the high mortality of SARS-CoV-2 among adult patients, the different clinical symptoms of adults compared to children, the higher risk of patients with metabolic deregulation, and the low mortality rates among women can all be accounted for by the complex balance of the three enzymes with TET activity, which is developmentally regulated. This activity is age-dependent, related to telomere homeostasis and integrity, and associated with X chromosome inactivation via (de)regulation of the responsible XIST gene expression.","Kouidou, Sofia; Malousi, Andigoni; Andreou, Alexandra-Zoi",Pathogens,37,1

The average incidence rate of this disease in Tehran during the study period was 4.6 per 10,000 population. Generally, the lowest and highest raw frequencies of Tehran COVID-19 contamination were seen in municipal districts 21 and 4, respectively. The raw frequency of cases during the 3-month study period also showed that the highest number of cases in Tehran occurred in municipal districts 5 and 4, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the present study, using geographic information systems (GIS), geographical distribution map of COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran, during the first 3 months of the pandemic was drawn.","Saberian, Peyman; Rafiemanesh, Hosein; Sadeghi, Mostafa; Hasani-Sharamin, Parisa; Dadashi, Fatemeh; Baratloo, Alireza",Arch Acad Emerg Med,37,33

A significant number of these will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. Currently, during the COVID-19 outbreak, a high mortality rate has been found in patients with COVID-19 and cirrhosis. New direct-acting antiviral agents can cure more than 90% of HCV-infected patients. The new WHO strategy has introduced global goals against viral hepatitis, including a 30% reduction in new HCV cases and a 10% reduction in mortality by 2020. HCV transmission has changed considerably, reflecting both the evolution of medicine and health and social changes. The HCV is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact. After the discovery of HCV in 1989, antibody screening has drastically decreased the incidence of post-transfusion hepatitis. Nowadays, routine blood donor screening by nucleic acid amplification testing for the presence of HCV RNA has been introduced in many countries. It is conceivable that HCV screening could be offered to people born between 1946 and 1964 in the developed world and to people at high risk for HCV infection such as those who have received blood transfusions, blood products or organ donations before the 1990s, prisoners, health care workers, drug users and infants born to HCV-infected women. To achieve HCV elimination, health programmes should include improvement to access to health care services, increased screening and new projects to identify a submerged portion of patients with HCV infection. Submerged people with HCV infection are both people who are unaware of their condition and people diagnosed with HCV but not yet treated. Based on these premises, this review will examine and discuss the epidemiological changes in contracting HCV, highlighting the ways in which to identify a submerged portion of patients with HCV infection.","Stasi, Cristina; Silvestri, Caterina; Voller, Fabio",SN Compr Clin Med,37,16

Although preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and improved ventilation are commonly used in schools to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and support in-person instruction (3-6), routine school-based COVID-19 testing has not been as widely implemented. In addition to these types of standard preventive measures, Utah health and school partners implemented two high school testing programs to sustain extracurricular activities and in-person instruction and help identify SARS-CoV-2 infections: 1) Test to Play,* in which testing every 14 days was mandated for participation in extracurricular activities; and 2) Test to Stay,† which involved school-wide testing to continue in-person instruction as an alternative to transitioning to remote instruction if a school crossed a defined outbreak threshold (3).

The laboratory arm of surveillance must be complemented by hospital and primary care components. We also need more training at all levels: undergraduate and postgraduate medical training, specialist training, as well as continuing professional development schemes. Core training programmes for infectious disease specialists and medical microbiologists must be established. The contribution of general practitioners, infection specialists, microbiology laboratories, and public health specialists/agencies to response systems should be defined as clearly as possible and should be either empirically based or derived from scenario-guided calamity models. The success of surveillance hinges on sufficient long-term resources and dedicated coordination. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) may assume this role. However, structural and administrative constraints of the diverse healthcare systems throughout Europe may represent an impediment to a harmonised response. Also, the funding of the ECDC cannot cover the operational demands. The ECDC may well work as a small coordinating unit; however, without a laboratory-based scientific status, it remains doubtful whether the ECDC will achieve the competence and authority needed for effective leadership in healthcare. The ESCMID, together with other national and international scientific societies, should put emphasis on the fact that infectious diseases have not received the necessary degree of attention from governments in the European region. The ESCMID should strengthen its role in harmonising and supporting the highest standards of training in the infection disciplines.","Grundmann, H.; Goossens, H.",Clinical Microbiology and Infection,37,33

The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. METHODS: The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, naïve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. RESULT: The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spite of MERS being a zoonotic disease, contact with camels is not a major factor influencing recovery. CONCLUSION: The methods used were able to determine the prime factors influencing MERS recovery. It can be comprehended that awareness about symptoms and seeking medical intervention at the onset of development of symptoms will make a long way in reducing the mortality rate.","John, Maya; Shaiba, Hadil",J Infect Public Health,37,16

We explored risks and protective factors most associated with the development of these mental health disorders and their course at 68 days follow up. We acquired 9543 unique responses via an online survey that was disseminated in UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, India, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. The prevalence and new incidence during the pandemic for at least one disorder was 48.6% and 17.6%, with the new incidence of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and panic disorder being 11.4%, 8.4%, 9.3%, and 3%, respectively. Higher resilience was associated with lower mental health burden for all disorders. Ten to thirteen associated factors explained 79% of the variance in PTSD, 80% in anxiety, 78% in depression, and 89% in PD. To reduce the mental health burden, governments should refrain from implementing many highly restrictive and lasting containment measures. Public health campaigns should focus their effort on alleviating stress and fear, promoting resilience, building public trust in government and medical care, and persuading the population of the measures’ effectiveness.

It was clear that this viral disease exhibited a clear predilection for and danger to older persons. Informal contacts began with senior officials from the country's Ministry of Health, the Israel Medical Association, and the country's largest health fund; this was done to plan an approach to the possible coming storm. A group was formed, comprising three senior geriatricians, a former dean, a palliative care specialist, and a lawyer/ethicist. The members made every effort to ensure that their recommendations would be practical while at the same time taking into account the tenets of medical ethics. The committee's main task was to think through a workable approach because intensive care unit/ventilator resources may be far outstripped by those requiring such care. Recommendations included the approach to older persons both in the community and in long‐term care institutions, a triage instrument, and palliative care. Patient autonomy was emphasized, with a strong recommendation for people of all ages to update their advance directives or, if they did not have any, to quickly draw them up. Considering the value of distributive justice, with respect to triage, a “soft utilitarian” approach was advocated with the main criteria being function and comorbidity. Although chronological age was rejected as a sole criterion, in the case of an overwhelming crisis, “biological age” would enter into the triage considerations, but only in the case of distinguishing between people with equal non–age‐related deficits. The guideline emphasized that no matter what, in the spirit of beneficence, anyone who fell ill must receive active palliative care throughout the course of a COVD‐19 infection but especially at the end of life. Furthermore, in the spirit of nonmaleficence, the frail, very old, and severely demented would be actively protected from dying on ventilation.","Clarfield, A.

There is an unmet need to identify novel therapeutic alternatives beside bronchodilators that prevent disease progression. Levels of both Nitric Oxide (NO) and IL-6 were significantly increased in the plasma of patients in the exacerbation phase (ECOPD, n = 13) when compared to patients in the stable phase (SCOPD, n = 38). Levels of both NO and IL-6 were also found to inversely correlate with impaired lung function (%FEV1 predicted). In addition, there was a strong positive correlation between levels of IL-6 and NO found in the plasma of patients and those spontaneously produced by their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), identifying these cells as a major source of these key inflammatory mediators in COPD. GTS-21, an agonist for the alpha 7 nicotinic receptors (α7nAChR), was found to exert immune-modulatory actions in PBMCs of COPD patients by suppressing the production of IL-6 and NO. This study provides the first evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of α7nAChR agonists in COPD due to their ability to suppress with the production of key inflammatory markers associated with disease severity.","Douaoui, Sana; Djidjik, Reda; Boubakeur, Mokhtar; Ghernaout, Merzak; Touil-boukoffa, Chafia; Oumouna, Mustapha; Derrar, Fawzi; Amrani, Yassine",Immunobiology,37,28

Perilipins are structural proteins associated with lipophagy and lipid droplet integrity, and their overexpression is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Here, we sought to explore the role of lipid droplet-related protein perilipin-3 (PLIN3) in prostate cancer (PCa) chemotherapy. We investigated the role of PLIN3 suppression in docetaxel cytotoxic activity in PCa cell lines. Additional effects of PLIN3 depletion on autophagy-related proteins and gene expression patterns, apoptotic potential, proliferation rate, and ATP levels were examined. Depletion of PLIN3 resulted in docetaxel resistance, accompanied by enhanced autophagic flux. We further assessed the synergistic effect of autophagy suppression with chloroquine on docetaxel cytotoxicity. Inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine reversed chemoresistance of stably transfected shPLIN3 PCa cell lines, with no effect on the parental ones. The shPLIN3 cell lines also exhibited reduced Caspase-9 related apoptosis initiation. Moreover, we assessed PLIN3 expression in a series of PCa tissue specimens, were complete or partial loss of PLIN3 expression was frequently noted in 70% of the evaluated specimens. Following PLIN3 silencing, PCa cells were characterized by impaired lipophagy and acquired an enhanced autophagic response upon docetaxel-induced cytotoxic stress. Such an adaptation leads to resistance to docetaxel, which could be reversed by the autophagy blocker chloroquine. Given the frequent loss of PLIN3 expression in PCa specimens, we suggest that combination of docetaxel with chloroquine may improve the efficacy of docetaxel treatment in PLIN3-deficient cancer patients.

Some of the prophylaxis strategies are based on the development of antibodies targeting viral proteins. IgY antibodies are a type of immunoglobulin present in birds, amphibians, and reptiles. They are usually obtained from egg yolk of hyper-immunized hens and represent a relatively inexpensive source of antibodies. Specific IgY can be produced by immunizing chickens with the target antigen and then purifying from the egg yolk. Chicken IgY has been widely explored as a clinical anti-infective material for prophylaxis, preventive medicine, and therapy of infectious diseases. Administered non-systemically, IgY antibodies are safe and effective drugs. Moreover, passive immunization with avian antibodies could become an effective alternative therapy, as these can be obtained relatively simply, cost-efficiently, and produced on a large scale.

It has been used to support the health care needs of patients with COVID-19 and routine primary care patients alike. However, this change has not been fully consolidated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the determinants of health care professionals’ intention to use the eConsulta digital clinical consultation tool in the post–COVID-19 context. METHODS: A literature review of the Technology Acceptance Model allowed us to construct a theoretical model and establish a set of hypotheses on the influence of a variety of different factors relating to health care professionals, as well as the institutions where they work, on their intention to use eConsulta. In order to confirm the proposed model, a mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology was used, and a questionnaire was designed to serve as the data collection instrument. The data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate analysis techniques. To confirm the theoretical model, exploratory factor analysis and binary logistic regression were applied. RESULTS: The most important variables were related to perceived benefits (B=2.408) and the type of use that individuals habitually made of eConsulta (B=0.715). Environmental pressure (B=0.678), experience with technology (B=0.542), gender (B=0.639), and the degree to which eConsulta had been implemented (B=0.266) were other variables influencing the intention to use the tool in the post–COVID-19 context. When replicating the previous analysis according to professional group, experience with technology and gender in the physician group, and experience with tool use and the center where a professional worked in the nurse group, were found to be of considerable importance. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation and use of eConsulta had increased significantly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the majority of health care professionals were satisfied with its use in practice and planned to incorporate it into their practices in the post–COVID-19 context.

The dynamical characteristics of an isolated population are preliminary studied, with particular reference to the equilibrium points and their stability. Then, the effects of constant inputs on the dynamics are deeply analyzed also by numerical simulations; this analysis is propaedeutic to the study of the interaction between the groups. The interactions between the different populations are modeled as additional input/output to the single group dynamics introducing total averaged effects including all the external migration effects. This approach focuses on the changes in the dynamics of one population when interactions are present without showing the global migration fluxes, but stressing the influences on each populations. Besides the simplifications of the model, this point of view may be fruitful also with respect of the design of control actions, assuming that each group can adopt the best control strategy for her/his own specific social characteristics. The epidemic case analyzed is HIV-AIDS. This choice has been made since this virus is present all over the world, but with different levels of dangerousness and number of infected patients depending on the economic, social, and cultural habits. The model used is a recently introduced one, which describes this epidemic spread considering two compartments of susceptible people, distinguished by the level of attention with respect to the virus transmission, one of the infected individuals not aware of their status, and two classes of patients, divided according to the level of infection. Additional inputs have been introduced to model fluxes of susceptible individuals and infected but not aware individuals.

The effects of COVID-19 are caused by the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is the underlying actions of SARs-CoV-2 virions on the endothelial glycocalyx that we consider here. One of the key factors in COVID-19 infection is its almost unique age-related profile, with a doubling in mortality every 10 years after the age of 50. The endothelial glycocalyx layer is essential in maintaining normal fluid homeostasis, but is fragile and prone to pathophysiological damage. It is physiologically significant in capillary microcirculation and in fluid distribution to the tissues. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in plasma, is created in the liver which also maintains its concentration, but this reduces by 10–15% after 50 years of age. HSA transports hormones, free fatty acids and maintains oncotic pressure, but SARS-CoV-2 virions bind competitively to HSA diminishing its normal transport function. Furthermore, hypoalbuminemia is frequently observed in patients with such conditions as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic heart failure, i.e., those most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and vascular disease have been linked in COVID-19 and have been shown to predict outcome independent of age and morbidity. Hypoalbuminemia is also known factor in sepsis and Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when fluids build-up in the alveoli and it is associated with sepsis, whose mechanism is systemic, being associated with the fluid and logistic mechanisms of the circulation. Glycocalyx damage is associated with changes plasma protein concentration, particularly HSA and blockage of albumin transport can produce the systemic symptoms seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection and sepsis. We therefore conclude that albumin binding to SARS-CoV-2 virions may inhibit the formation of the endothelial glycocalyx by inhibition of albumin transport binding sites. We postulate that albumin therapy to replace bound albumin might alleviate some of the symptoms leading to sepsis and that clinical trials to test this postulation should be initiated as a matter of urgency.","Johnson, Andrew S.; Fatemi, Rouholah; Winlow, William",Front Cardiovasc Med,37,20

Psychological effects, for reference persons (RPs), of remote-only communication have been assessed. METHODS: All RPs of patients referred to ICU for COVID-19 were included. HADS, IES-R, and satisfaction were evaluated at admission, discharge/death, and 3 months. At 3 months, a psychologist provided a qualitative description of RPs’ psychological distress. RESULTS: Eighty-eight RPs were included. Prevalence of anxiety and depression was 83% and 73% respectively. At 3 months, lower HADS decrease was associated with patient death/continued hospitalization, and/or sleeping disorders in RPs (p < 0.01). Ninety-nine percent RPs felt the patient was safe (9 [7; 10]/10 points, Likert-type scale), confident with caregivers (10 [9; 10]/10 points), and satisfied with information provided (10 [9; 10]/10 points). All RPs stressed the specific-type of “responsibility” associated with being an RP in a remote-only context, leading RPs to develop narrow diffusion strategies (67%) and restrict the array of contacted relatives to a very few and/or only contacting them rarely. 10 RPs (30%) related the situation to a prior traumatic experience. CONCLUSION: RPs experienced psychological distress and reported that being an RP in a remote-only communication context was a specific responsibility and qualified it as an overall negative experience.

The kinetics, magnitude and landscape of the antibody response may impact the clinical severity and serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of the antibody landscape in children and adults is needed. METHODS: We tested 254 plasma from 122 children with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Hong Kong up to 206 days post symptom onset, including 146 longitudinal samples from 58 children. Adult COVID-19 patients and pre-pandemic controls were included for comparison. We assessed antibodies to a 14-wide panel of SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins by Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). FINDINGS: Children have lower levels of Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies than adults, and their cumulative humoral response is more expanded to accessory proteins (NSP1 and Open Reading Frames (ORFs)). Sensitive serology using the three N, ORF3b, ORF8 antibodies can discriminate COVID-19 in children. Principal component analysis revealed distinct serological signatures in children and the highest contribution to variance were responses to non-structural proteins ORF3b, NSP1, ORF7a and ORF8. Longitudinal sampling revealed maintenance or increase of antibodies for at least 6 months, except for ORF7b antibodies which showed decline. It was interesting to note that children have higher antibody responses towards known IFN antagonists: ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF7a. The diversified SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in children may be an important factor in driving control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hachim, Asmaa; Gu, Haogao; Kavian, Otared; Kwan, Mike YW; Chan, Wai-hung; Yau, Yat Sun; Chiu, Susan S; Tsang, Owen TY; Hui, David SC; Ma, Fionn; Lau, Eric HY; Cheng, Samuel MS; Poon, Leo LM; Peiris, JS Malik; Valkenburg, Sophie A; Kavian, Niloufar",medRxiv,37,8

Due to the worldwide shortage of intensive care unit beds, a relatively high number of patients with respiratory failure are receiving prolonged non-invasive respiratory support, even when their clinical status would have required invasive mechanical ventilation. There are few experimental and clinical data reporting that vigorous breathing effort during spontaneous ventilation can worsen lung injury and cause a phenomenon that has been termed patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of P-SILI pathophysiology and the role of non-invasive respiratory support in COVID-19 pneumonia. Respiratory mechanics, vascular compromise, viscoelastic properties, lung inhomogeneity, work of breathing, and oesophageal pressure swings are discussed. The concept of P-SILI has been widely investigated in recent years, but controversies persist regarding its mechanisms. To minimize the risk of P-SILI, intensivists should better understand its underlying pathophysiology to optimize the type of non-invasive respiratory support provided to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, as well as decide on the optimal timing of intubation for these patients.","Battaglini, Denise; Robba, Chiara; Ball, Lorenzo; Silva, Pedro Leme; Cruz, Fernanda Ferreira; Pelosi, Paolo; Macedo Rocco, Patricia Rieken",Br J Anaesth,37,22

However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020, and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. The primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were the (1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and (2) need for high levels of oxygen supplementation (HiO(2)). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [odds ratio (OR) 0.4, confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.9, p=.04], HiO(2) [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8), p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05), p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO(2) were seen with advancing age. African Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe illness and HiO(2) when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis. The lower odds of severe illness in ESRD-HD patients might have a pathophysiologic basis and need to be further explored.","Naaraayan, Ashutossh; Nimkar, Abhishek; Hasan, Amrah; Pant, Sushil; Durdevic, Momcilo; Elenius, Henrik; Nava Suarez, Corina; Basak, Prasanta; Lakshmi, Kameswari; Mandel, Michael; Jesmajian, Stephen",Cureus,37,26

Fabry disease, an X‐linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in GLA, can lead to end‐stage renal disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and stroke. Diagnostic delays are common due to the rarity of the disease and non‐specificity of early symptoms. Newborn screening and screening of at‐risk populations, (e.g., patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or undiagnosed nephropathies) can identify individuals with Fabry disease. Subsequent cascade genotyping of family members may disclose a greater number of affected individuals, often at younger age than they would have been diagnosed otherwise. METHODS: We conducted a literature search to identify all published data on family genetic testing for Fabry disease, and discussed these data, experts’ own experiences with family genetic testing, and the barriers to this type of screening that are present in their respective countries. RESULTS: There are potential barriers that make implementation of family genetic testing challenging in some countries. These include associated costs and low awareness of its importance, and cultural and societal issues. Regionally, there are barriers associated with population educational levels, national geography and infrastructures, and a lack of medical geneticists. CONCLUSION: In this review, the worldwide experience of an international group of experts of Fabry disease highlights the issues faced in the family genetic testing of patients affected with rare genetic diseases.","Germain, Dominique P.; Moiseev, Sergey; Suárez‐Obando, Fernando; Al Ismaili, Faisal; Al Khawaja, Huda; Altarescu, Gheona; Barreto, Fellype C.; Haddoum, Farid; Hadipour, Fatemeh; Maksimova, Irina; Kramis, Mirelle; Nampoothiri, Sheela; Nguyen, Khanh Ngoc; Niu, Dau‐Ming; Politei, Juan; Ro, Long‐Sun; Vu Chi, Dung; Chen, Nan; Kutsev, Sergey",Mol Genet Genomic Med,37,1

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors for survival after ESD in older patients aged ≥ 85 years with EGC. METHODS: Clinical outcomes of 70 patients aged ≥ 85 years with EGC treated with ESD were evaluated retrospectively. Prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were analyzed with the Kaplan–Meier method and a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 33 patients died from any cause, none of whom died from gastric cancer. OS probability after 3 years was 90.0%. Univariate analyses revealed that a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ≥ 2.6, a prognostic nutritional index (PNI) < 42.5 and low serum albumin value (< 3.5 g/dl) were associated with poor OS.

Our objective was to understand if the animals were infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. We found that out of the 96 dogs and cats that we sampled, none had active SARS-CoV-2 infections and only one dog had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that it had been exposed to the virus but was not actively infected. This suggests that the risk of humans spreading SARS-CoV-2 to dogs and cats in animal shelter settings is probably low. ABSTRACT: Human-to-animal and animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented; however, investigations into SARS-CoV-2 transmission in congregate animal settings are lacking. We investigated four animal shelters in the United States that had identified animals with exposure to shelter employees with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of the 96 cats and dogs with specimens collected, only one dog had detectable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies; no animal specimens had detectable viral RNA. These data indicate a low probability of human-to-animal transmission events in cats and dogs in shelter settings with early implementation of infection prevention interventions.","Cossaboom, Caitlin M.; Medley, Alexandra M.; Spengler, Jessica R.; Kukielka, Esther A.; Goryoka, Grace W.; Baird, Tiffany; Bhavsar, Swity; Campbell, Stefanie; Campbell, Thomas S.; Christensen, Daniel; Condrey, Jillian A.; Dawson, Patrick; Doty, Jeffrey B.; Feldpausch, Amanda; Gabel, Julie; Jones, Dee; Lim, Ailam; Loiacono, Christina M.; Jenkins-Moore, Melinda; Moore, Andrea; Noureddine, Clarissa; Ortega, Jorge; Poulsen, Keith; Rooney, Jane A.; Rossow, John; Sheppard, Karen; Sweet, Emma; Stoddard, Robyn; Tell, Rachel M.; Wallace, Ryan M.; Williams, Carl; Barton Behravesh, Casey",Biology (Basel),37,30

Of these, 576 completed the same assessment at the end of the spring semester, 600 completed at least 1 item from a COVID-related survey after the onset of COVID pandemic, and 485 completed nightly surveys of mood and wellness behaviors on a regular basis before and after the onset of the COVID crisis. RESULTS: Externalizing problems (mean = −0.19, 95% CI = −0.06 to 0.33, p = .004) and attention problems (mean = −0.60, 95% CI = −0.40 to 0.80, p < .001) increased after the onset of COVID, but not internalizing symptoms (mean = 0.18, 95% CI = −0.1 to 0.38, p = .06). Students who were enrolled in a campus wellness program were less affected by COVID in terms of internalizing symptoms (β = 0.40, SE = 0.21, p = .055) and attention problems (β = 0.59, SE = 0.21, p = .005) than those who were not in the wellness program.

Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male.

The unparalleled volume of available genetic data presents a unique opportunity to gain real-time insights into the virus transmission during the pandemic, but also a daunting computational hurdle if analysed with gold-standard phylogeographic approaches. We here describe and apply an analytical pipeline that is a compromise between fast and rigorous analytical steps. As a proof of concept, we focus on the Belgium epidemic, with one of the highest spatial density of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. At the global scale, our analyses confirm the importance of external introduction events in establishing multiple transmission chains in the country. At the country scale, our spatially-explicit phylogeographic analyses highlight that the national lockdown had a relatively low impact on both the lineage dispersal velocity and the long-distance dispersal events within Belgium. Our pipeline has the potential to be quickly applied to other countries or regions, with key benefits in complementing epidemiological analyses in assessing the impact of intervention measures or their progressive easement.","Dellicour, Simon; Durkin, Keith; Hong, Samuel L.; Vanmechelen, Bert; Martí-Carreras, Joan; Gill, Mandev S.; Meex, Cécile; Bontems, Sébastien; André, Emmanuel; Gilbert, Marius; Walker, Conor; De Maio, Nicola; Faria, Nuno R.; Hadfield, James; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; Bours, Vincent; Wawina-Bokalanga, Tony; Artesi, Maria; Baele, Guy; Maes, Piet",bioRxiv,37,20

While it is gaining acceptance among young- and middle-aged people, the elderly are reluctant to use it. The aim of this study was hence to identify reasons for non-use among elderly in the countryside and describe perceived possible challenges and opportunities with digital health consultations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 persons over 65 years old residing in the Swedish countryside. There was a mistrust for services offered by private companies and their public funding, a lack of knowledge of available services, and a lack of perceived usefulness. Personal interaction and continuity was more important than time or travel conveniences, although these advantages were recognized. To prevent digital exclusion, caregivers need to offer information, encouragement, or tools for the elderly. Digital primary care also needs to offer familiarity, with continuity and personal connections.","Landgren, Sara; Cajander, Åsa",Front Public Health,37,1

BACKGROUND: PPE can have physical consequences like headache and pain, which could result in increased nurse stress levels. METHODS: A total of 2600 nurses participated in this online survey. The questionnaire is based on literature and includes the perceived level of stress scale. RESULTS: We found no significant association between the use of PPE and stress. Nurses who wore masks for more than 8 h had significant higher stress levels than those who used the masks for a shorter period. CONCLUSIONS: The duration of wearing masks is associated with nurse's stress level. Our findings can help nurses to argue a higher frequency of breaks and a maximum duration of mask usage in their organisations. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: We recommend that nursing managers implement practical strategies such as a mask break task force. This task force could promote awareness for mask breaks and recommend and allocate rooms or locations such as balconies for mask breaks.","Hoedl, Manuela; Eglseer, Doris; Bauer, Silvia",J Nurs Manag,37,1

METHODS A cross sectional study in adults requesting care in Emergency Rooms (ER), or the outpatient clinics of referral hospitals for COVID-19, to define the diagnostic characteristics of a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 (the Abbott PanbioTM) having as a gold standard the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Health personnel in a routine situation within an active pandemic in several cities of Mexico performed the tests. RESULTS A total of 1,069 participants with a mean age of 47 years (SD 16 years), 47% with a self-reported comorbidity, and an overall prevalence of a positive RT-PCR test of 45%, were recruited from eight hospitals in Mexico. Overall sensitivity of the Panbio test was 54.4% (95%CI 51-57) with a positive likelihood ratio of 35.7, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.46 and a Receiver-Operating Characteristics curve area of 0.77. Positivity for the rapid test depended strongly on an estimate of the viral load (Cycle threshold of RT-PCR, Ct), and the days of symptoms. With a Ct 25, sensitivity of the rapid test was 0.82 (95%CI, 0.76-0.87). For patients during the first week of symptoms sensitivity was 69.6% (95%CI 66-73). On the other hand, specificity of the rapid test was above 97.8% in all groups. CONCLUSIONS The PanbioTM rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 has a good specificity, but due to low and heterogeneous sensitivity in real life, a negative test in a person with suggestive symptoms at a time of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 requires confirmation with RT-PCR, and after the first week of symptoms, sensitivity decreases considerably.","THIRION-ROMERO, I.; GUERRERO-ZUNIGA, S.; ARIAS-MENDOZA, A.; CORNEJO-JUAREZ, D.

The proposed methodology also allows to explore the temporal development of the actual number of infections, both detected and undetected, thereby shedding light on the infection dynamics. We exemplify our approach by analyzing German data from 2020, making only use of data available since the beginning of the pandemic. Our modeling approach can be used to quantify the effect of different testing strategies, visualize the dynamics in the case detection ratio over time, and obtain information about the underlying true infection numbers, thus enabling us to get a clearer picture of the course of the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020.","Schneble, Marc; De Nicola, Giacomo; Kauermann, Göran; Berger, Ursula",Biom J,37,31

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the dissemination of the Miyara et al study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes toward smoking occurred after its publication as preprint on April 21, 2020. METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14 and May 4, 2020, by the Tweepy stream application programming interface, using a COVID-19–related keyword query. After filtering, the final 1929 tweets were classified into three groups: (1) tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study before it was published, (2) tweets that were not related to Miyara et al study after it was published, and (3) tweets that were related to Miyara et al study after it was published. The attitudes toward smoking, as expressed in the tweets, were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in the statistical analysis software R (The R Foundation). RESULTS: Temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed that the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to the Miyara et al study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than the proportion in tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study, either before (44/126, 34.9%; P<.001) or after the Miyara et al study was published (68/198, 34.3%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The public’s attitude toward smoking shifted in a positive direction after the Miyara et al study found a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases among daily smokers.","Tao, Chunliang; Diaz, Destiny; Xie, Zidian; Chen, Long; Li, Dongmei; O’Connor, Richard",JMIR Form Res,37,29

In early 2011, respiratory disease outbreaks were investigated in Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Five IBV isolates (JOA2, JOA4, Saudi-1, Saudi-2, and Iraqi IBV) were detected by diagnostic-nested nucleocapsid RT-PCR. Strain identification was characterised by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the amplified hypervariable region of the spike 1 (S1) gene. These five IBV isolates were found to be of the IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I. Nucleotide identity between these five IBV isolates ranged from 96.9% to 99.7%, and between these isolates and the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain in the range of 96.6–99.1%. The sequenced fragment of the S1 gene of the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain had less than 80% nucleotide identity to the IBV vaccine strains commonly used in the Middle East (M41 and H120). The presence of these CK/CH/LDL/97I-like strains may account for vaccination failure against IBV, since all IBV isolates were from vaccinated chickens. In this paper, we documented for the first time the presence of IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I in the Middle East. This strain is known to have originated in China and Taiwan.","Ababneh, Mustafa; Dalab, Abd Elhafeed; Alsaad, Saad; Al-Zghoul, Mohammad",ISRN Vet Sci,37,16

Identification of which disaster relief workers may be at risk of experiencing psychological distress or mental health disorders is frequently carried out through pre-employment or pre-deployment psychological screening. The primary objective of our review was to assess the evidence for pre-employment and pre-deployment psychological screening of relief workers who work in disaster situations. We aimed to identify specific pre-employment and pre-deployment characteristics that predict impaired wellbeing of an individual following engaging in disaster-related work. METHODS: A combined list of search terms was composed relating to disaster-related occupations, screening methods, psychological disorders, and study design. The databases used were PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GlobalHealth. We included studies that used cross-sectional or longitudinal study designs; were published in the English language in peer-reviewed academic journals; reported on the association between pre-employment and pre-deployment features and post-deployment psychological disorders or distress; considered any occupational groups responding to a specified, discrete crisis; and used at least one validated measure of distress or disorder. We extracted data on the author; year of publication; disaster description; country of study; study design; population sample; disorder(s) outcome and the measures used; and results. RESULTS: Sixty-two, high-quality studies were included in the review. Forty-one potential predictors were identified. Of these, only volunteer status and previous history of mental illness and life stressors emerged as reliable predictors of distress or disorder. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that whilst it is attractive to screen for pre-employment and pre-deployment indicators of resilience, the evidence base for doing so is weak. At best, this sort of screening can only weakly suggest vulnerability and at worst may result in discrimination. Until better evidence about its usefulness becomes available, employers should exercise caution over its use.","Opie, Elena; Brooks, Samantha; Greenberg, Neil; Rubin, G. James",BMC Psychiatry,37,16

We address the use of a strict pattern of CXR findings for COVID-19 diagnosis, specifically during early onset of symptoms with respect to patient age. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients under investigation for COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020 and had CXR within 1 week of symptoms. Only reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–positive patients were included. Two board-certified radiologists, blinded to RT-PCR results, assessed 60 CXRs in consensus and assigned 1 of 3 patterns: characteristic, atypical, or negative. Atypical patterns were subdivided into more suspicious or less suspicious for COVID-19. Results: Sixty patients were included: 30 patients aged 52 to 88 years and 30 patients aged 19 to 48 years. Ninety-three percent of the older group demonstrated an abnormal CXR and were more likely to have characteristic and atypical–more suspicious findings in the first week after symptom onset than the younger group. The relationship between age and CXR findings was statistically significant (χ(2) [2, n=60]=15.70; P=0.00039). The relationship between negative and characteristic COVID-19 CXR findings between the 2 age cohorts was statistically significant with Fisher exact test resulting in a P value of 0.001. Conclusion: COVID-19 positive patients >50 years show earlier, characteristic patterns of statistically significant CXR changes than younger patients, suggesting that CXR is useful in the early diagnosis of infection. CXR can be useful in early diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients older than 50 years.","Igi, Mae; Lieux, Molly; Park, Joe; Batte, Catherine; Spieler, Bradley",Ochsner J,37,1

SOURCES AND DATA COLLECTION: A rigurous online search of CPG was accomplished among the main CPG compilers: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), National Guideline Clearinghouse, Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality (AHRQ), Andalusian Health Technology Assessment Department (AETSA), American Academy of Family Physicians, Tripdatabase. Furthermore, because of the need to identify CPG that meet the inclusion criteria, a manual search, among the main national and international dental organizations as well as recognized web sites, was also accomplished. SELECTION OF RESEARCH STUDIES: All of the guides focused on paediatric dental emergencies, available in the database and “gray” literature, and published between 2000 and 2020 (applicable to COVID-19 pandemic) were included without any language restrictions. The CPG that did not contain the full paper or were addressed to adults or children with special needs, were excluded from the selection. The evaluation of the CPG, independently included, were achieved by four (04) experts by using AGREE II. RESULTS: Five (05) out of twenty-three (23) selected CPG, were classified as “acceptable” according to AGREE II. These five guides were evaluated to determine their “Recommendation degree”. Only one (01) CPG “Guía Clínica AUGE de Urgencias Odontológicas Ambulatorias-Chile, 2011” reached a score of 75%, the highest among the other guides (5 domains with a score >= 60%, including the domain III “Rigour of Development”) to be considered as a “highly recommended” CPG. CONCLUSIONS: According to the quality assessment and recommendation degrees criteria from AGREE II, high, middle and low quality CPG were identified. Only one CPG reached a score of 75%, to be classified as “highly recommended”. Therefore, it is suggested that the existing CPG updates and future CPG use the available tools and methodologies during their elaboration, in order to guarantee their quality. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: High quality CPG for the management of dental emergencies are designed to support dental health professionals in decision-making to adopt specific dental procedures in the current COVID-19 pandemic. As a matter of fact, these CPG might contribute to reduce the risk of transmission, in case of fresh outbreak of the illness. Likewise, they might help to determine which cases warrant medical attention in centres with special facilities for COVID-19.","Arieta-Miranda, Jessica; Alcaychahua, Abad Salcedo; Santos, Gary Pereda; Sevillano, Gustavo Chávez; Verástegui, Rosa Lara; Victorio, Daniel Blanco; Ramos, Gilmer Torres",Heliyon,37,5

Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8% ) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms, 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.","Azzi, Yorg; Parides, Michael; Alani, Omar; Loarte-Campos, Pablo; Bartash, Rachel; Forest, Stefanie; Colovai, Adriana; Ajaimy, Maria; Liriano-Ward, Luz; Pynadath, Cindy; Graham, Jay; Le, Marie; Greenstein, Stuart; Rocca, Juan; Kinkhabwala, Milan; Akalin, Enver",Kidney Int,37,16

Their temporal response gives information about the presence of a biochemical/biological analyte, its concentration and its interactions with the adsorption sites (which may be an integral part of the surface itself or immobilized functionalizing molecules). Mathematical models of the temporal response taking into account as many relevant effects as possible are essential for obtaining reliable information. We present a novel model taking into account the bimodal affinity of a sensing surface (adsorption occurs on two distinct site types), and the adsorption-caused depletion of the analyte from the sample. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the analyte depletion influence on the bimodal adsorption, and of the influence of the sensing surface inhomogeneity on the sensor temporal response, for different analyte concentrations and different fractions of two types of adsorption sites.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of LRTI admissions with positive PCR results for Influenza or RSV from 2017 to 2019 in three teaching hospitals in southern Europe. Data on clinical characteristics, viral agents and disease outcome were collected. Nosocomial infection was excluded. Main outcomes were invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 984 patients were included. Median age was 75 years. Influenza A was the most frequently identified virus (56.5%), of which 27.1% were subtype H1N1 and 53.0% H3N2. Influenza B was isolated in 22.3% and RSV in 21.0%. There were 10.5% of patients who died during admission and 8.3% submitted to IMV. Influenza A H1N1 was associated with lower age and less co-morbidity, while the opposite was observed for RSV. Influenza A H1N1 was independently associated with both higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 2.0 [1.2–3.4] p = 0.008) and IMV (adjusted odds ratio 5.1 [3.0–8.5] p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Influenza A H1N1 was an independent predictor of mortality and IMV. These findings may have implications on hospital resource planning and vaccination policies.","Almeida, André; Boattini, Matteo; Christaki, Eirini; Moreira Marques, Torcato; Moreira, Inês; Cruz, Lourenço; Tosatto, Valentina; Antão, Diogo; Bianco, Gabriele; Iannaccone, Marco; Costa, Cristina; Tsiolakkis, Georgios; Khattab, Elina; Kasapi, Diamanto; Ferreira, Ana Teresa; Cavallo, Rossana; Corte-Real, Rita",Infection,37,29

METHODS: Two surveys were conducted on February 1-5 and February 20-24, separately, using an online self-administrated questionnaire among 3145 and 3814 participants, respectively. Subjective indicators of daily-life changes include level of attention, risk of infection, impact of daily life, self-perceived health status, and mental health help-seeking. Individual scores on changes in anxiety, depression, and stress were generated by 6-item, 4-item, and 3-item questions. A multivariate regression model was fitted in each survey, separately and combined. RESULTS: A total of 6959 residents participated in the study, with 32.78% male and 67.22% female, people living in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province accounted for 25.22% and 18.85%, respectively. One week after the Wuhan shutdown, their anxiety, depression, and stress had all increased. Compared with the first survey, the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress in the second survey were decreased (β = −1.220, −0.798, and −0.623, all P < 0.001). The level of attention, risk of infection, and self-perceived health status tended to be positively associated with the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the lives and psychological conditions of residents had undergone negative changes after the Wuhan shutdown, but the measures taken during this period were effective. These results may provide guidance for public health policies in other countries and regions.","Chen, Qi; Li, Mengying; Wang, Yueqing; Zhang, Ling; Tan, Xiaodong",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,37,1

Most infected people have symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, tiredness, and fever. However, the Covid-19 infection disrupts various organs, including the liver, kidney, and nervous system. Common neurological symptoms of the Covid-19 infection include delirium, confusion, headache, and loss of sense of smell and taste. In rare cases it can cause stroke and epilepsy. The virus enters the nervous system either directly through nerve pathways or indirectly through the ACE2 receptor. The neurological symptoms of a Covid-19 infection in the brain are mainly due to either the entry of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the nervous system or the production of these cytokines by microglia and astrocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can cause blood-brain barrier disruption, increase in glutamate and aspartate and reduce GABA levels, impairs the function of ion channels, and finally, high levels of cytokines can cause epilepsy. Understanding the potential mechanisms is necessary to gain better insight into COVID-19 induced seizure pathogenesis and to design the correct treatment strategies to achieve appropriate treatment for seizure and epilepsy.","Nikbakht, Farnaz; Mohammadkhanizadeh, Ali; Mohammadi, Ekram",Mult Scler Relat Disord,37,3

Thus, the aim of this scoping review is to map out the existing evidence on the impact of long-distance truck drivers on the spread of COVID-19 and measures that countries can implement to mitigate this route of spread in the African region. METHODS: we searched the PubMed database and the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 for eligible studies. RESULTS: the search strategy identified 669 citations, of which six met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently reported interventions were maintaining hand hygiene, social distance, testing truck drivers, regulation of trade and transport e.g. only trucks with the food, medical supplies, fuels, agricultural supplies will be allowed to operate in interstate operations and regulating and controlling trucks carrying essential goods and services e.g. truck drivers are required to declare their final destination and are urged to stop only at designated points. Two studies from the African region reported about border closures and entry and exit screening, two studies from the US reported about the threat for public safety and risks and mitigation plans and 2 guidelines reported about harmonisation and facilitation of cross border in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.

CGM data of 23 cycles revealed a reproducible triphasic glycemic pattern consisting of a constant hyperglycemia period, followed by a transient improvement, and ending with another hyperglycemic plateau. Given this recurrent pattern, basal insulin and correction insulin were adjusted with subsequent GCIH attenuation.

The first experiment evaluated the effects of 3 ANC in combination with an antimicrobial in high-risk calves treated for BRD during a 56-d receiving period. Newly received crossbred steers (n = 516; initial BW = 217 ± 20 kg) were monitored by trained personnel for clinical signs of BRD. Calves that met antimicrobial treatment criteria (n = 320) were then randomly assigned to experimental ANC treatment (80 steers/experimental ANC treatment): intravenous flunixin meglumine injection (NSAID), intranasal viral vaccination (VACC), intramuscular vitamin C injection (VITC), or no ANC (NOAC). Animal served as the experimental unit for all variables except DMI and G:F (pen served as the experimental unit for DMI and G:F). Within calves treated 3 times for BRD, those receiving NOAC had lower (P < 0.01) clinical severity scores (severity scores ranged from 0 to 4 on the basis of observed clinical signs and severity) and heavier (P = 0.01) BW than those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC at the time of third treatment. Between the second and third BRD treatments, calves receiving NOAC had decreased (P < 0.01) daily BW loss (−0.13 kg ADG) compared with those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC (−1.30, −1.90, and −1.41 kg ADG, respectively). There were no differences in rectal temperature, combined mortalities and removals, or overall performance among the experimental ANC treatments. Overall, morbidity and mortality attributed to BRD across treatments were 66.5% and 13.2%, respectively. After the receiving period, a subset of calves (n = 126) were allocated to finishing pens to evaluate the effects ANC administration on finishing performance, carcass characteristics, and lung scores at harvest. Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common physiological end point for each pen of calves. There were no differences among the experimental ANC observed during the finishing period (P ≥ 0.11). In summary, the use of NSAID, VACC, and VITC do not appear to positively impact clinical health and could potentially be detrimental to performance during the receiving period in high-risk calves receiving antimicrobial treatment for suspected BRD.","Wilson, B.

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United States. We calculate the CFR for each country at the latest data point and for Italy also over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. CFRs vary from 0.7% in Germany and 1.6% in South Korea to 8.6% in Spain and 10.6% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases can explain a substantial proportion of cross-country variation in the CFR. For example, 57% of Spain's difference with respect to South Korea is explained by the observed cases being older. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 10.6% between March 9 and March 29, 2020, and more than 95% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of infected cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case fatality rates indicate the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","Dudel, Christian; Riffe, Tim; Acosta, Enrique; van Raalte, Alyson A.; Myrskyla, Mikko",,37,24

However, considering the intensive transportation restriction due to lockdown measures that would lead to declines in both ambient NO(2) concentration and COVID-19 spread, the crude or insufficiently adjusted associations between NO(2) and COVID-19 transmissibility might be confounded. This study aimed to investigate whether transportation restriction confounded, mediated, or modified the association between ambient NO(2) and COVID-19 transmissibility. Methods: The time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) was calculated to quantify the instantaneous COVID-19 transmissibility in 31 Chinese cities from January 1, 2020, to February 29, 2020. For each city, we evaluated the relationships between ambient NO(2), transportation restriction, and COVID-19 transmission under three scenarios, including simple linear regression, mediation analysis, and adjusting transportation restriction as a confounder. The statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) of the three scenarios in 31 cities was summarized. Results: We repeated the crude correlational analysis, and also found the significantly positive association between NO(2) and COVID-19 transmissibility. We found that little evidence supported NO(2) as a mediator between transportation restriction and COVID-19 transmissibility. The association between NO(2) and COVID-19 transmissibility appears less likely after adjusting the effects of transportation restriction. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the crude association between NO(2) and COVID-19 transmissibility is likely confounded by the transportation restriction in the early COVID-19 outbreak. After adjusting the confounders, the association between NO(2) and COVID-19 transmissibility appears unlikely. Further studies are warranted to validate the findings in other regions.","Han, Lefei; Zhao, Shi; Cao, Peihua; Chong, Marc K.

Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo. PRINCIPLE FINDING: Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication.

The wide spectrum of clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 illness suggests that individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in determining the clinical course after first infection. Immunological studies have focused on patients with moderate to severe disease, demonstrating excessive inflammation in tissues and organ damage. In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; eight patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and eight cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.","Carsetti, Rita; Zaffina, Salvatore; Piano Mortari, Eva; Terreri, Sara; Corrente, Francesco; Capponi, Claudia; Palomba, Patrizia; Mirabella, Mattia; Cascioli, Simona; Palange, Paolo; Cuccaro, Ilaria; Milito, Cinzia; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maeurer, Markus; Camisa, Vincenzo; Vinci, Maria Rosaria; Santoro, Annapaola; Cimini, Eleonora; Marchioni, Luisa; Nicastri, Emanuele; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Agrati, Chiara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Porzio, Ottavia; Concato, Carlo; Onetti Muda, Andrea; Raponi, Massimiliano; Quintarelli, Concetta; Quinti, Isabella; Locatelli, Franco",Front Immunol,37,26

Pa0(2)/Fi0(2) increased from 88 to 124, 51 to 118, and 146 to 244, respectively. SPO(2) increased from 91% to 97% for Case 1 and maintained a high level above 97% for Case 2. Cardiac function remained normal in the three patients after treatment. Moreover, Cases 1 and 3 survived from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, while Case 2 finally died on the 36th day after the first elevation of PASP due to severe complications. Both cases who did not receive iNO treatment experienced a sudden decrease of PASP and Pa0(2)/Fi0(2) due to right heart failure and then died. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled nitric oxide treatment was beneficial in reducing and stabilizing the PASP and might also reduce the risk of right heart failure in COVID‐19 with pulmonary hypertension.","Feng, Wen‐Xia; Yang, Yang; Wen, Junmin; Liu, Ying‐Xia; Liu, Lei; Feng, Cheng",ESC Heart Fail,37,25

This descriptive and relational study was conducted with 216 international students studying at a university in Turkey. Study data were collected using the descriptive information form, the Perception of Health Scale (PHS) and the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP-II). Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis. It was determined that the health perception and healthy lifestyle behaviors of the international students involved in this study were moderately positive. The study found a weak and positive relationship between PHS and the physical activity, nutrition and stress management subdimensions of HPLP, while a moderate positive relationship was identified between PHS and the spiritual growth and interpersonal relations subdimensions of HPLP. No relationship was observed between PHS and the health responsibility subdimension of HPLP. The fact that students have a positive perception of health reflects positively on their healthy lifestyle behaviors. It is important to disseminate education programs aimed at improving the health perception and healthy lifestyle behaviors of international students within the university.","Citak Tunc, Gulseren; Citak Bilgin, Nevin; Cerit, Birgül",J Relig Health,37,1

To evaluate general physical and mental health benefits of Ashwagandha. METHODS: A 16 week randomized prospective, open label, parallel efficacy, two arm multi-centre study. The primary efficacy measure is ‘failure of prophylaxis’ as confirmed COVID-19 by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at any time during the study period. This study on 400 participants from three centres is designed to establish non-inferiority for WS to HCQ for prophylaxis against COVID-19 at 80% power and significance P < 0.025, one sided. The interim analysis was carried out on 160 participants after completion of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Participants in both the arms were well matched at the baseline characteristics. 40 participants in the HCQ group and 26 participants in the WS group reported mild AE. The symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were found to be 3.7% (95% CI 1.3 to 10.5%) in the HCQ and 1.3% (95% CI 0.02 to 6.7%) in the WS arm amongst the first 160 participants completing 8 weeks. CONCLUSION: Our intent was to explore a safer option to HCQ. We report that WS was not found inferior to HCQ and its efficacy was within the 15% non-inferiority margin set a-priori. WS as immunomodulator has other clinical benefits including reducing mental stress. Final report of this study is expected by end of August 2021.

To follow the requirements of lockdown and virtual education, the performance of students has been evaluated via web-based examinations. Although this shift to web-based examinations was inevitable, other mental, educational, and technical aspects should be considered to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of this type of evaluation in this era. The easiest way to address the new challenges is to administer traditional questions via a web-based platform. However, more factors should be accounted for when designing web-based examinations during the COVID-19 era. This article presents an approach in which the opportunity created by the pandemic is used as a basis to reconsider learning as the main goal of web-based examinations. The approach suggests using open-book examinations, using questions that require high cognitive domains, using real clinical scenarios, developing more comprehensive examination blueprints, using advanced platforms for web-based questions, and providing feedback in web-based examinations to ensure that the examinees have acquired the minimum competency levels defined in the course objectives.","Manteghinejad, Amirreza",JMIR Med Educ,37,20

P. frutescens methanol crude extract and its fractions (petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol fractions, and aqueous phase residue) were prepared by ultrasound-enzyme assisted extraction and liquid–liquid extraction. Among the samples, the ethyl acetate fraction possessed the high total phenolic (440.48 μg GAE/mg DE) and flavonoid content (455.22 μg RE/mg DE), the best antioxidant activity (the DPPH radical, ABTS radical, and superoxide anion scavenging activity, and ferric reducing antioxidant power were 1.71, 1.14, 2.40, 1.29, and 2.4 times higher than that of control Vc, respectively), the most powerful α-glucosidase inhibitory ability with the IC(50) value of 190.03 μg/mL which was 2.2-folds higher than control acarbose, the strongest proliferative inhibitory ability against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell with the IC(50) values of 37.92 and 13.43 μg/mL, which were considerable with control cisplatin, as well as certain inhibition abilities on acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase. HPLC analysis showed that the luteolin, rosmarinic acid, rutin, and catechin were the dominant components of the ethyl acetate fraction. Animal experiments further demonstrated that the ethyl acetate fraction could significantly decrease the serum glucose level, food, and water intake of streptozotocin-induced diabetic SD rats, increase the body weight, modulate their serum levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C, improve the histopathology and glycogen accumulation in liver and intestinal tissue.

As of August 2020, it has affected more than 18 million humans and caused over 700,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Under certain circumstances, the viral infection leads to excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory response, which is associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary alveolar structures. This phenomenon has been referred to as the “cytokine storm,” and it is closely linked to lung injury, acute respiratory syndrome and mortality. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine available to prevent the infection, and no effective treatment is available to reduce the mortality associated with the severe form of the disease. The cytokine storm associate with COVID-19 shows similarities with those observed in other pathologies such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury and other viral infection including severe cases of influenza. However, the specific mechanisms that cause and modulate the cytokine storm in the different conditions remain to be determined. micro-RNAs are important regulators of gene expression, including key inflammatory cytokines involved in the massive recruitment of immune cells to the lungs such as IL1β, IL6, and TNFα. In recent years, it has been shown that nutraceutical agents can modulate the expression of miRs involved in the regulation of cytokines in various inflammatory diseases. Here we review the potential role of inflammatory-regulating-miRs in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and propose that nutraceutical agents may represent a supportive therapeutic approach to modulate dysregulated miRs in this condition, providing benefits in severe respiratory diseases.","Desjarlais, Michel; Wirth, Maëlle; Lahaie, Isabelle; Ruknudin, Pakiza; Hardy, Pierre; Rivard, Alain; Chemtob, Sylvain",Front Pharmacol,37,11

Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2), which has become the cause of the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19), was discovered. Until 18 February 2020, there were 72 533 confirmed COVID‐19 cases (including 10 644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS‐CoV‐2 is spreading among the public and causing substantial burden due to its human‐to‐human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS‐CoV‐2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS‐CoV‐2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that, other than pangolins and snakes, as previously suggested, turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS‐CoV‐2 to humans.","Liu, Zhixin; Xiao, Xiao; Wei, Xiuli; Li, Jian; Yang, Jing; Tan, Huabing; Zhu, Jianyong; Zhang, Qiwei; Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Long",J Med Virol,37,1

Both digital and social media can propagate healthcare misinformation and thus affect vaccine policy support. The use of social media monitoring to understand real-time public perceptions of One Health policies is crucial to identify misinformation and address public concerns appropriately to achieve successful policy implementation. Digital and social media data surrounding two government announcements regarding the bovine tuberculosis eradication strategy for England were collected and screened using the Meltwater media monitoring platform. Communication patterns were studied using InfraNodus. Twitter analysis was conducted to identify key influencers, public engagement, and trending communications. Online social media activity increased rapidly after each announcement. Initially, badger culling took primary public concern and major influencers were identified. Cattle vaccination dominated discussion after the second announcement, with public perception being influenced by increased online activity from news sites, animal welfare charities, governmental bodies, and medical professionals. The greatest ambiguity towards the strategy was detected within farming communities, with the main disparity existing between cattle vaccination and badger culling opinions.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-hospital mortality in the Belgian national COVID-19 hospital surveillance data. Patients treated either with HCQ alone and supportive care (HCQ group) were compared to patients treated with supportive care only (no-HCQ group) using a competing risks proportional hazards regression with discharge alive as competing risk, adjusted for demographic and clinical features with robust standard errors. RESULTS: Of 8075 patients with complete discharge data on 24(th) of May and diagnosed before the 1(st) of May, 4542 received HCQ in monotherapy and 3533 were in the no-HCQ group.

Therefore, p7 is a possible target for antivirals. The consensus model for the channel formed by p7 protein is a hexameric or heptameric oligomer of α-helical hairpin monomers, each having two transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2, where the N-terminal TM1 would face the lumen of this channel. A reported high-throughput functional assay to search for p7 channel inhibitors is based on carboxyfluorescein (CF) release from liposomes after p7 addition. However, the rationale for the dual ability of p7 to serve as an ion or proton channel in the infected cell, and to permeabilize membranes to large molecules like CF is not clear. We have recreated both activities in vitro, examining the conformation present in these assays using infrared spectroscopy. Our results indicate that an α-helical form of p7, which can transport protons, is not able to elicit CF release. In contrast, membrane permeabilization to CF is observed when p7 contains a high percentage of β-structure, or when using a C-terminal fragment of p7, encompassing TM2. We propose that the reported inhibitory effect of some small compounds, e.g., rimantadine, on both CF release and proton transport can be explained via binding to the membrane-inserted C-terminal half of p7, increasing its rigidity, in a similar way to the influenza A M2-rimantadine interaction.","Gan, Siok Wan; Surya, Wahyu; Vararattanavech, Ardcharaporn; Torres, Jaume",PLoS One,37,16

As a new energy policy, PPAPs have played an important role in alleviating rural poverty. However, the adoption of solar PV faces multiple barriers from the perspective of beneficiaries. Therefore, this study aims to discuss and analyze factors affecting beneficiaries’ satisfaction and their trust in State Grid, promoting the adoption of solar PV. METHODS: Based on the integrated American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and Unified Theory of Acception and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, this study used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to reveal how the beneficiaries’ satisfaction enhance their trust in State Grid. The data were obtained from a survey of 928 PPAPs’ beneficiaries by stratified and random sampling in Chinese rural areas. RESULTS: The results confirm that environmental perception in this study has positive impact on beneficiaries’ satisfaction. In addition, perceived quality also has a positive effect on beneficiaries’ satisfaction and trust in State Grid; however, social influence has a negative impact on beneficiaries’ satisfaction; behavior expectation can directly promote beneficiaries’ satisfaction while indirectly propel their trust in State Grid. CONCLUSIONS: This study constructs an integrated customer satisfaction model from the perspective of beneficiaries and proposes relevant measures to promote the adoption of solar PV that can be applied to poverty reduction in other developing countries worldwide.","Ding, Liping; Shi, Yin; He, Chenchen; Dai, Qiyao; Zhang, Zumeng; Li, Jiaxin; Zhou, Ling",Energy Sustain Soc,37,13

We report here that biosafe coronavirus-based vaccine vectors facilitate delivery of multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to professional antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo. Vaccine vectors based on heavily attenuated murine coronavirus genomes were generated to express epitopes from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein, or human Melan-A, in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These vectors selectively targeted DCs in vitro and in vivo resulting in vector-mediated antigen expression and efficient maturation of DCs. Single application of only low vector doses elicited strong and long-lasting cytotoxic T-cell responses, providing protective antiviral and antitumor immunity. Furthermore, human DCs transduced with Melan-A-recombinant human coronavirus 229E efficiently activated tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Taken together, this novel vaccine platform is well suited to deliver antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines to DCs and to initiate and maintain protective immunity.","Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Züst, Roland; Maier, Reinhard; Sierro, Sophie; Janda, Jozef; Levy, Frederic; Speiser, Daniel; Romero, Pedro; Rohrlich, Pierre-Simon; Ludewig, Burkhard; Thiel, Volker",mBio,37,21

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: A 3D printed facial flap simulator was designed from a computed tomography scan and manufactured out of silicone for low‐cost, high‐fidelity simulation. This simulator was tested by a group of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery trainees at a single institution. The simulator group was compared to a control group who completed an exercise on a traditional paper facial flap exercise. Both groups underwent didactic lectures prior to completing their respective exercises. Pre‐ and post‐exercise Likert scale surveys measuring experience, understanding, effectiveness, and realism were completed by both groups. Central tendency, variability, and confidence intervals were measured to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: Trainees completing the facial flap simulator reported a statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvement in overall expertise in facial flap procedures, design of facial flaps, and excision of standing cutaneous deformities. No statistically significant improvement was seen in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees found the facial flap simulator to be an effective and useful training tool with a high level of realism in surgical education of facial reconstruction.

Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. Methods and Findings: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of case detection, speed of isolation, contact tracing completeness and speed of quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0=2.5, generation time 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes to the proportion of infections detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Formally framing the dynamical process also indicates that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of program performance are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the ""test"" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","Grantz, K.

These data were then combined with environmental, hospital and clinical indicators extracted from the European Health Information Gateway of the World Health Organization. Results The COVID-19 death rate in EU countries (mean 1.9 ± 0.8%) was inversely associated with the number of available general hospitals, physicians and nurses. Significant positive associations were also found with the rate of acute care bed occupancy, as well as with the proportion of population who were aged over 65 years, overweight or who had cancer. Total healthcare expenditure, public-sector health expenditure and the number of hospital and acute care beds did not influence COVID-19 death rate. Conclusions Some common healthcare system inadequacies, such as limited numbers of general hospitals, physicians and nurses, in addition to high acute care bed occupancy, may be significant drivers of nationwide COVID-19 mortality rates in EU countries.","Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Lippi, Giuseppe; Henry, Brandon M.",Public Health,37,29

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) serve as a specimen for detection by RT-PCR and rapid antigen screening tests. Saliva has been confirmed as a reliable alternative specimen for RT-PCR and has been shown to be valuable for diagnosing children and in repetitive mass testing due to its non-invasive collection. Combining the advantages of saliva with those of antigen tests would be highly attractive to further increase test capacities. Here, we evaluated the performance of the Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay (Roche) in RT-PCR-positive paired NPS and saliva samples (N = 87) and unpaired NPS (N = 100) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 IVD test). We observed a high positive percent agreement (PPA) of the antigen assay with RT-PCR in NPS, reaching 87.2% across the entire cohort, whereas the overall PPA for saliva was insufficient (40.2%). At Ct values ≤ 28, PPA were 100% and 91.2% for NPS and saliva, respectively. At lower viral loads, the sensitivity loss of the antigen assay in saliva was striking. At Ct values ≤ 35, the PPA for NPS remained satisfactory (91.5%), whereas the PPA for saliva dropped to 46.6%. In conclusion, saliva cannot be recommended as a reliable alternative to NPS for testing with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay. As saliva is successfully used broadly in combination with RT-PCR testing, it is critical to create awareness that suitability for RT-PCR cannot be translated to implementation in antigen assays without thorough evaluation of each individual test system.","Audigé, Annette; Böni, Jürg; Schreiber, Peter W.; Scheier, Thomas; Buonomano, Roberto; Rudiger, Alain; Braun, Dominique L.; Eich, Gerhard; Keller, Dagmar I.; Hasse, Barbara; Berger, Christoph; Günthard, Huldrych F.; Manrique, Amapola; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael",Microorganisms,37,17

Some have expressed concern that these may affect the cardiopulmonary system by increasing the work of breathing, altering pulmonary gas exchange and increasing dyspnea, especially during physical activity. These concerns have been derived largely from studies evaluating devices intentionally designed to severely affect respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. We review the literature on the effects of various face masks and respirators on the respiratory system during physical activity using data from several models: cloth face coverings and surgical masks, N95 respirators, industrial respirators, and applied highly resistive or high–dead space respiratory loads. Overall, the available data suggest that although dyspnea may be increased and alter perceived effort with activity, the effects on work of breathing, blood gases, and other physiological parameters imposed by face masks during physical activity are small, often too small to be detected, even during very heavy exercise. There is no current evidence to support sex-based or age-based differences in the physiological responses to exercise while wearing a face mask. Although the available data suggest that negative effects of using cloth or surgical face masks during physical activity in healthy individuals are negligible and unlikely to impact exercise tolerance significantly, for some individuals with severe cardiopulmonary disease, any added resistance and/or minor changes in blood gases may evoke considerably more dyspnea and, thus, affect exercise capacity.","Hopkins, Susan R.; Dominelli, Paolo B.; Davis, Christopher K.; Guenette, Jordan A.; Luks, Andrew M.; Molgat-Seon, Yannick; Sá, Rui Carlos; Sheel, A.

There are other noninfectious diseases that can present exactly as COVID-19, and the management and approach are completely different, hence the importance of understanding and having a wide differential in patients presenting with similar characteristics. Case Report. A 23-year-old male, with a history of childhood asthma, presented to the Emergency Department in a hospital in south Florida in the USA with complaints of a 2-day duration of subjective fever, chills, dry cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. His vital signs were blood pressure 135/65 mmHg, temperature 39°C, pulse 134 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and saturation of oxygen 96% in room air. Laboratory analysis was significant for white blood cells 15.3 × 10(3)/μL, ALT 69 U/L, AST 66 U/L, ferritin 375.6 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 27.70 mg/dL, and procalcitonin 1.43 ng/mL. A respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) and a SARS-CoV-2 test were both negative. The patient was given empiric antibiotic treatment and hydroxychloroquine. Two more tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and the patient reported that he smoked marijuana through an e-cigarette. The patient was started on high-dose steroids, and symptoms improved. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an emergent lung disease that is affecting the population worldwide; many other noninfectious diseases can mimic its presentations and laboratory characteristics; the importance of having a broad differential diagnosis especially in causing confusion during pandemic times is valuable in the management of patients with such presentations, such as EVALI, and glucocorticoids will be indicated in this circumstances.","Rodriguez, Jose A.; Roa, Alejandra A.; Lemos-Ramirez, Juan C.",Case Rep Pulmonol,37,20

Herein, we evaluated the feasibility of performing nanofiltration of platelet lysates and determined the impact on expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs. Methods: Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept®) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP+) and 35% plasma, and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v/v), filtered, and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35 and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition, removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs), and MSC expansion were evaluated. Results: Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors, or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was over 3 log values. Expansion, of proliferation, membrane markers, differentiation potential, and immunosuppressive properties of cells in nanofiltered media were consistently better than those expanded in FBS-supplemented media. Compared to FBS, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media, and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages. Conclusions: Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates, including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs, is technically feasible. These data support the possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media for clinical-grade propagation of human cells.","Barro, Lassina; Nebie, Ouada; Chen, Ming-Sheng; Wu, Yu-Wen; Koh, Mickey BC; Knutson, Folke; Watanabe, Naoto; Takahara, Masayasu; Burnouf, Thierry",Cytotherapy,37,1

The present study was designed to answer to this question. METHODS: The population study was the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort which records data about all hospitalized patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for a SARS-CoV-2 infection at Toulouse University hospital, France. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids was assessed at hospital admission. A propensity score (PS) according to corticosteroid exposure was calculated including comorbidities, clinical, radiological and biological variables that impact COVID-19 severity. The primary outcome was composite, including admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation and death occurring during the 14 days after hospital admission. Logistic regression models adjusted for the PS (overlap weighting) provided odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Overall, 253 patients were included in the study. Median age was 64 years, 140 patients (59.6%) were men and 218 (86.2%) had at least one comorbidity. Seventeen patients (6.7%) were exposed to corticosteroids before hospital admission. Chronic inflammatory disease (n = 8) was the most frequent indication. One hundred and twenty patients (47.4%) met the composite outcome. In the crude model, the OR of previous exposure to systemic corticosteroids was 1.64; 95% CI: 0.60–4.44. In the adjusted model, it was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.65–1.83).

The frameshift takes place at the slippery sequence with the two ribosome-bound tRNAs slipping back simultaneously by one nucleotide from the zero phase (U UUA AAC) to the −1 phase (UUU AAA). Asparaginyl-tRNA, which decodes the A-site codon AAC, has the modified base Q at the wobble position of the anticodon (5′ QUU 3′) and it has been speculated that Q may be required for frameshifting. To test this, we measured frameshifting in cos cells that had been passaged in growth medium containing calf serum or horse serum. Growth in horse serum, which contains no free queuine, eliminates Q from the cellular tRNA population upon repeated passage. Over ten cell passages, however, we found no significant difference in frameshift efficiency between the cell types, arguing against a role for Q in frameshifting. We confirmed that the cells cultured in horse serum were devoid of Q by purifying tRNAs and assessing their Q-content by tRNA transglycosylase assays and coupled HPLC-mass spectroscopy. Supplementation of the growth medium of cells grown either on horse serum or calf serum with free queuine had no effect on frameshifting either. These findings were recapitulated in an in vitro system using rabbit reticulocyte lysates that had been largely depleted of endogenous tRNAs and resupplemented with Q-free or Q-containing tRNA populations. Thus Q-base is not required for frameshifting at the IBV signal and some other explanation is required to account for the slipperiness of eukaryotic asparaginyl-tRNA.","Marczinke, Beate; Hagervall, Tord; Brierley, Ian",J Mol Biol,37,26

SETTING: Nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital payment and cost data. DESIGN: Retrospective review and economic impact analysis. METHODS: The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) was used to identify ophthalmic surgical procedures and associated charges, which were performed at HOPDs. The highest volume elective ophthalmic procedures were identified. The total hospital cost and payment amount was calculated for each procedure using the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Net facility income (estimated payments less OPPS rates) was determined for each elective surgical procedure category and stratified by hospital teaching status. RESULTS: In 2017, elective cataract, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgeries were performed 1 230 992 times at HOPDs. The total cost of these elective surgeries was 2350 million U.S. dollars (USD), with a total hospital payment of 3624 to 3786 million USD. This led to an estimated net income of 1278 to 1440 million USD overall to U.S. hospitals in the NASS dataset from elective ophthalmic surgery (approximately 107 to 120 million USD per month), with a larger proportion performed in teaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The cessation of elective ophthalmic surgeries at HOPDs during COVID-19 resulted in a significant loss of income for hospitals in the United States and teaching experiences for trainees at academic medical centers.","Fliotsos, Michael J.; Best, Matthew J.; Field, Matthew G.; Srikumaran, Uma; Repka, Michael X.; Woreta, Fasika A.; Srikumaran, Divya",J Cataract Refract Surg,37,20

However, there is limited information about the effects of COVID-19 on chronic airway diseases. Therefore, we conducted the present study to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ascertain risk factors for acute exacerbations (AEs). Methods: This single-center observational study was conducted at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, involving asthma or COPD patients who had been treated with inhaled combination corticosteroids (ICSs), such as budesonide, and one long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA), such as formoterol, for at least a year before the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted telephone interviews to collect demographic information and clinical data between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, focusing on respiratory and systemic symptoms, as well as times of exacerbations. Data for asthma and COPD were then compared, and the risk factors for AEs were identified using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 251 patients were enrolled, comprising 162 (64.5%) who had asthma and 89 who had COPD, with none having COPD/asthma overlap. Frequency of AEs among asthma patients was significantly lower in 2020 than in 2019 (0.82 ± 3.33 vs. 1.00 ± 3.16; P < 0.05). Moreover, these patients visited the clinic less (0.37 ± 0.93 vs. 0.49 ± 0.94; P < 0.05) and used emergency drugs less (0.01 ± 0.11 vs. 007 ± 0.38; P < 0.05) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, among COPD patients, there were no significant differences in AE frequency, clinic visits, or emergency drug use. Furthermore, asthma patients visited clinics less frequently during the pandemic than those with COPD. Logistic regression analysis also showed that a history of at least one AE within the last 12 months was associated with increased AE odds for both asthma and COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic (odds ratio: 13.73, 95% CI: 7.04–26.77; P < 0.01). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with asthma showed better disease control than before, whereas patients with COPD may not have benefited from the pandemic. For both diseases, at least one AE within the previous 12 months was a risk factor for AEs during the pandemic.

All the subtypes were categorized by their isolated regions, including Asia, Europe, and Africa, and most of the synonymous codon usage patterns were analyzed by correspondence analysis (CA). As a result, influenza A virus showed the lowest synonymous codon usage bias among the virus species of the orthomyxoviridae family, and influenza B and influenza C virus were followed, while suggesting that influenza A virus might have an advantage in transmitting across the species barrier due to their low codon usage bias. The ENC values of the host-specific HA and NA genes represented their different HA and NA types very well, and this reveals that each influenza A virus subtype uses different codon usage patterns as well as the amino acid compositions. In NP, PA and PB2 genes, most of the virus subtypes showed similar RSCU patterns except for H5N1 and H3N2 (A/HK/1774/1999) subtypes which were suspected to be transmitted across the species barrier, from avian and porcine species to human beings, respectively. This distinguishable synonymous codon usage patterns in non-human origin viruses might be useful in determining the origin of influenza A viruses in genomic levels as well as the serological tests. In this study, all the process, including extracting sequences from GenBank flat file and calculating codon usage values, was conducted by Java codes, and these bioinformatics-related methods may be useful in predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.","Ahn, Insung; Jeong, Byeong-Jin; Bae, Se-Eun; Jung, Jin; Son, Hyeon S.",Eur J Epidemiol,37,16

The main alkaloid, galantamine, is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric nicotinic receptor modulator, which slows cognitive and functional decline in mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Having a complex stereochemistry, the organic synthesis of galantamine for pharmaceutical uses is highly challenging and not always economically viable, and it is therefore isolated from Amaryllidaceae bulbs. In the present study, galantamine was extracted and quantified in Narcissus bulbs from five cultivars (cvs.), Fortune, Carlton, Ice Follies, Galilee and Ziva, which were grown in Israel under various conditions. Results show that the cvs. Fortune, Carlton and Ice Follies bulbs contained 285 ± 47, 452 ± 73 and 69 ± 17 µg g(−1) galantamine, respectively, while the Galilee and Ziva bulbs contained relatively low concentrations of galantamine (1–20 µg g(−1)). Irrigation levels and pruning conditions did not affect the galantamine contents. Additionally, the alkaloids profile of the five cvs. was analyzed and characterized using LC-MS/MS showing that galantamine-type alkaloids were mainly detected in the Fortune and Carlton bulbs, lycorine-type alkaloids were mainly detected at the Galilee and Ziva bulbs and vittatine-type alkaloids were mainly detected in the Ice Follies bulbs. The present research is the first to characterize the alkaloids profile in the Narcissus bulbs of Galilee and Ziva, indigenous cvs. grown in Israel. The antiviral and anticancer alkaloids lycorine and lycorinine were the main alkaloids detected in the bulbs of those cultivars.","Atrahimovich, Dana; Harris, Raviv; Eitan, Ron; Cohen, Menashe; Khatib, Soliman",Metabolites,37,28

Predisposing factors to contracting COVID-19 and to severe outcomes have been described in registries but were not compared between solid tumors and hematological malignancies. METHOD: This retrospective single oncologic center study included adults with solid tumors or hematological malignancies referred to testing by naso-pharyngeal swab for a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from March 10 to May 18, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were included in the study. Forty-five (21%) were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2. The univariate analysis with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR as a dependent variable reveals significant odds ratios (ORs) for age—with a mean of 62.5 years—(OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02–1.08), performance status ≥2 (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.22–4.70), inpatient status (OR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.11–4.91), and hematological malignancies (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.23–4.96). In contrast, OR for solid tumors reveals a negative association (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.20–0.81). When integrating severe outcome (ICU admission or COVID-19-related death) as a dependent variable, the univariate logistic regression model shows significant ORs for pre-existing lymphopenia (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.17–15.04), hematological malignancies (OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 1.09–13.80), and a negative association for solid tumors (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.07–0.92). CONCLUSION: In patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hematological malignancies were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes. Other factors were age and inpatient status.","Goudsmit, Anouk; Cubilier, Edouard; Meert, Anne-Pascale; Aftimos, Philippe; Stathopoulos, Konstantinos; Spilleboudt, Chloe; Loizidou, Angela",Support Care Cancer,37,16

Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in masking relative to current levels would reduce the reproductive number substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks that reduce transmission risk by 50% will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who do get infected, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy is only effective for this indication as post-exposure prophylaxis, specifically if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.","Goyal, A.; Reeves, D.

We know very little about patients during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Understanding the patient voice may play an important role in prioritization of postponed cases and triage moving forward. METHODS: Utilizing a hermeneutical phenomenological qualitative design, we interviewed 47 individuals who experienced a postponement of cardiac or vascular surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed and informed by phenomenological research methods. RESULTS: Patients in our study described 3 key issues around their postponement of elective surgery. Patients described robust narratives about the meanings of their elective surgeries as the chance to “return to normal” and alleviate symptoms that impacted everyday life. Second, because of the meanings most of our patients ascribed to their surgeries, postponement often took a toll on how patients managed physical health and emotional well-being. Finally, paradoxically, many patients in our study were demonstrative that they would “rather die from a heart attack” than be exposed to the coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several components of the patient experience, encompassing quality of life and other desired benefits of surgery, the risks of COVID, and difficulty reconciling the 2. Our study provides significant qualitative evidence to inform providers of important considerations when rescheduling the backlog of patients. The emotional and psychological distress that patients experienced due to postponement may also require additional considerations in postoperative recovery.","Byrnes, Mary E.; Brown, Craig S.; De Roo, Ana C.; Corriere, Matthew A.; Romano, Matthew A.; Fukuhara, Shinichi; Kim, Karen M.; Osborne, Nicholas H.",Med Care,37,1

The purpose of this study was to find out the role of VC as adjunctive therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methodology This study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital in Karachi. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), one group received the intervention [50 mg/kg/day of intravenous (IV) VC] along with the standard therapy, and the other group received standard therapy only. Data such as age, gender, vitals, and biochemical values as well as outcomes including the number of days required for treatment, hospital stay, need for ventilation, and mortality were compared between the two groups and recorded using a self-structured questionnaire. Results COVID-19 patients who received IV VC became symptom-free earlier (7.1 ± 1.8 vs. 9.6 ± 2.1 days, p-value: <0.0001) and spent fewer days in the hospital (8.1 ± 1.8 vs. 10.7 ± 2.2 days, p-value: <0.0001) compared to those who received standard therapy only. However, there was no significant difference in the need for mechanical ventilation (p-value: 0.406) and mortality (p-value: 0.31) between the two groups. Conclusion VC can significantly improve clinical symptoms in patients affected with COVID-19; however, it had no impact on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation.

As in the case of developing fields, ethical approaches are not well developed in the collection, processing, and analysis of participants’ information. Existing controversies and varying national ethical regulations can, thus, hamper efficient cross-border research collaboration to the detriment of quality disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review characterizes current practices on how ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSIs) pertinent to research ethics are handled by different Influenzanet country groups to analyze similarities and identify the need for further harmonization of ethical approaches. METHODS: A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Web of Science, Global Digital Library on Ethics, and Bioethics Literature Database to identify ELSIs for Influenzanet country platforms. Only English-language papers were included with publication dates from 2003 to 2017. Publications were screened for the application of bioethics principles in the implementation of country platforms. Additional publications gathered from the Influenzanet Consortium website, reference screening, and conference proceeding were screened for ELSIs. RESULTS: We gathered 96 papers from our search methodology. In total, 28 papers that mentioned ELSIs were identified and included in this study. The Research Ethics Committee (REC) approvals were sought for recruiting participants and collecting their data in 8 of 11 country platforms and informed e-consent was sought from participants in 9 of 11 country platforms. Furthermore, personal data protection was ensured throughout the Consortium using data anonymization before processing and analysis and using aggregated data. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemics forecasting activities, such as Influenzanet, are beneficial; however, its benefits could be further increased through the harmonization of data gathering and ethical requirements. This objective is achievable by the Consortium. More transparency should be promoted concerning REC-approved research for Influenzanet-like systems. The validity of informed e-consent could also be increased through the provision of a user friendly and standard information sheet across the Consortium where participants agree to its terms, conditions, and privacy policies before being able to fill in the questionnaire. This will help to build trust in the general public while preventing any decline in participation.","Geneviève, Lester Darryl; Wangmo, Tenzin; Dietrich, Damien; Woolley-Meza, Olivia; Flahault, Antoine; Elger, Bernice Simone",JMIR Public Health Surveill,37,15

Methods We examined a retrospective cohort of 58 SOT recipients with first-wave COVID-19, comparing patients with severe and non-severe illness. Additionally, SOT patients are compared to general first-wave COVID-19 patients. Results Organs transplanted included 38 kidneys, 8 livers, 5 hearts, 3 pancreas. Average SOT patient age was 57.4 years with 62% male, 46.6% African American, 36.2% white. Comorbidities included hypertension (86%), chronic kidney disease (86%), diabetes mellitus (50%), coronary artery disease (26%), COPD (14%). Twenty patients (34.5%) had severe COVID-19 and 38 (65.5%) non-severe disease. Severe disease was more common in older SOT patients with comorbidities and associated with cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, C-reactive protein > 10 mg/L, platelet count < 150/mcL. Gender, race, BMI, time from transplant, baseline immunosuppression and diagnosis month did not differ between those with severe vs non-severe COVID-19. Seventy percent of SOT patients were hospitalized vs 27.2% of general COVID-19 patients and SOT inpatients had a higher mechanical ventilation rate. While trending towards longer length of stay, higher ICU admission and greater inpatient mortality (19.5% vs 14.8%), these differences were not significant. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 has greatly impacted SOT recipients. One-third of our SOT patients seen during the first wave had severe illness with associated standard risk factors for poor outcome. Compared to general first wave patients, more SOT recipients were hospitalized, although inpatient COVID-19 mortality did not significantly differ.","Arya, Akanksha; Li, Michael; Aburjania, Nana; Singh, Pooja; Royer, Tricia; Moss, Sean; Belden, Katherine",Transplant Proc,37,20

However, defining transcriptome signatures of disease is challenging because logistic, technical and cost factors limit the size and representativeness of samples in clinical studies. These limitations lead to poor performance of signatures when applied to new datasets or varying study settings. Using a novel approach, we leverage existing transcriptomic signatures as classifiers in unseen datasets from prospective studies, with the goal of predicting individual outcomes. Machine learning allowed the identification of sets of genes, which we name transfer transcriptomic signatures, that are predictive across diverse datasets and/or species (rhesus to humans) and that are also suggestive of activated pathways and cell type composition. We demonstrate the usefulness of transfer signatures in two use cases: progression of latent to active tuberculosis, and severity of COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 infection. The broad significance of our work lies in the concept that a small set of archetypal human immunophenotypes, captured by transfer signatures, can explain a larger set of responses to diverse diseases.","di Iulio, J.; Bartha, I.; Spreafico, R.; Virgin, H.

Obtained results demonstrated that the examined processes exhibit polar nature and in the case of electrophilic dichloro-, and dibromocarbenes are initiated by the attack of carbene species onto the sulfur atom of the C=S group. Remarkably, reactions involving more electrophilic carbenes (dichloro-, and dibromocarbene) proceeds via stepwise mechanism involving thiocarbonyl ylide as a transient intermediate. In contrast, analogous reactions with nucleophilic dimethoxycarbene occur via a single step reaction, which can be considered as the [2 + 1] cycloaddition reaction initiated by the attack onto the C=S bond. A computational study showed that difluorocarbene tends to react as a nucleophilic species and resembles rather dimethoxycarbene and not typical dihalocarbene species.

Cytokines are biomarkers that orchestrate the manifestation and progression of an infection/inflammatory event. Hence, noninvasive, real‐time monitoring of cytokines can be pivotal in assessing the progression of infection/inflammatory event, which may be feasible through monitoring of host immune markers in eccrine sweat. This work is the first experimental proof demonstrating the ability to detect inflammation/infection such as fever, FLU directly from passively expressed sweat in human subjects using a wearable “SWEATSENSER” device. The developed SWEATSENSER device demonstrates stable, real‐time monitoring of inflammatory cytokines in passive sweat. An accuracy of >90% and specificity >95% was achieved using SWEATSENSER for a panel of cytokines (interleukin‐6, interleukin‐8, interleukin‐10, and tumor necrosis factor‐α) over an analytical range of 0.2–200 pg mL(−1). The SWEATSENSER demonstrated a correlation of Pearson's r > 0.98 for the study biomarkers in a cohort of 26 subjects when correlated with standard reference method. Comparable IL‐8 levels (2–15 pg mL(−1)) between systemic circulation (serum) and eccrine sweat through clinical studies in a cohort of 15 subjects, and the ability to distinguish healthy and sick (infection) cohort using inflammatory cytokines in sweat provides pioneering evidence of the SWEATSENSER technology for noninvasive tracking of host immune response biomarkers. Such a wearable device can offer significant strides in improving prognosis and provide personalized therapeutic treatment for several inflammatory/infectious diseases.","Jagannath, Badrinath; Lin, Kai‐Chun; Pali, Madhavi; Sankhala, Devangsingh; Muthukumar, Sriram; Prasad, Shalini",Bioeng Transl Med,37,16

We also constructed a predictive machine learning model based on chest CT and additional data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT. METHODS: This study’s cohort consisted of 319 patients who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing at the ED. Patient characteristics, demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT results (CO-RADS) were collected. With first RT-PCR as reference standard, the diagnostic performance of chest CT using the CO-RADS score was assessed. Additionally, a predictive machine learning model was constructed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Chest CT, with first RT-PCR as a reference, had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.2%, 88.2%, 84.5%, and 92.7%, respectively. The prediction model with CO-RADS, ferritin, leucocyte count, CK, days of complaints, and diarrhea as predictors had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 89.3%, 93.4%, 90.8%, and 92.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chest CT, using the CO-RADS scoring system, is a sensitive and specific method that can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially if RT-PCR tests are scarce during an outbreak. Combining a predictive machine learning model could further improve the accuracy of diagnostic chest CT for COVID-19. Further candidate predictors should be analyzed to improve our model. However, RT-PCR should remain the primary standard of testing as up to 9% of RT-PCR positive patients are not diagnosed by chest CT or our machine learning model.

The economic and social consequence has sparked many psychological mediators. In severe cases, they led to suicidal behavior in individuals like as seen in the 1918-1919 flu pandemic and in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Previously, a few articles have been published with regard to COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh. However, all these articles talked about sporadic cases of suicides with no clear picture of the holistic overview of suicides in Bangladesh. Herein, we looked into all COVID-19 suicide cases from March 01, 2020, to July 31, 2020, as reported in Bangladeshi media. Our study also reports the risk factors contributing to suicidal incidents. Moreover, we also identified the impact of gender, profession, and COVID-19 diagnosis status on committing suicide. This study will shed light on the topic with a clear understanding of the causalities influencing individuals to suicide. Furthermore, it will help the policymakers to take necessary actions to prevent any further suicides.","Boshra, S. N.; Islam, M. M.",,37,21

However, the assessment of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in this pandemic is lacking. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the status of AI among COVID-19-infected individuals. METHODS: A systematic literature screening in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed until May 23, 2021. We collected relevant published peer-reviewed studies that reported AI occurrence in patients who suffered from COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 10 records (cross-sectional studies: 3, N = 256, males: 176 (68.7%), and case reports: 7, N = 7, males: 4 (57.1%)) were recruited. The age spectrum ranged from 22 to 96 years. AI was diagnosed with laboratory assessment or radiologic findings. The AI prevalence ranged from 3.1% to as high as 64.3% in different studies. Except for one patient, all other patients were discharged in stable conditions in published case reports. CONCLUSION: This review indicates that AI occurrence in the COVID-19 pandemic seems quite probable; however, the extent and type (primary, secondary, and functional) need to be clarified yet. Appropriate early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions should be done, especially in critically ill patients, to prevent lethal outcomes.","Vakhshoori, Mehrbod; Heidarpour, Maryam; Bondariyan, Niloofar; Sadeghpour, Niyousha; Mousavi, Zohreh",Int J Endocrinol,37,22

ABSTRACT: Obesity increases morbidity and resource utilization in sepsis patients. The immune response in sepsis transitions from an endotoxin-responsive hyper- to an endotoxin-tolerant hypo-inflammatory phase. The majority of sepsis mortality occurs during hypo-inflammation. We reported prolonged hypo-inflammation with increased sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) expression in obese-septic mice. The effect of direct exposure to high-fat/free fatty acid (FFA) and the role of SIRT2 in immune cells during the transition to hypo-inflammation is not well-understood. Autophagy, a degradation process of damaged protein/organelles, is dysregulated during sepsis. Here, we investigated the effect of direct FFA exposure and the role of SIRT2 expression on autophagy as macrophages transition from hyper-to hypo-inflammation. We found, FFA-exposed RAW 264.7 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation undergo endotoxin-sensitive (“sensitive”) hyper- followed by endotoxin tolerant (“tolerant”) hypo-inflammatory phases; SIRT2 expression increases significantly in tolerant cells. Autophagy proteins LC3b-II, and beclin-1 increase in FFA-sensitive and decrease in tolerant cells; p62 expressions continue to accumulate in tolerant cells. We observed that SIRT2 directly deacetylates α-tubulin and impairs autophagy clearance. Importantly, we find SIRT2 inhibitor AK-7 treatment during endotoxin tolerant phase reverses autophagy dysregulation with improved autophagy clearance in FFA-tolerant cells. Thus, we report impaired autophagosome formation and autophagy clearance via increased SIRT2 expression in FFA-exposed tolerant macrophages.","Roychowdhury, Sanjoy; Gandhirajan, Anugraha; Kibler, Christopher; Wang, Xianfeng; Vachharajani, Vidula",Cells,37,33

Since the infection rate of the COVID-19 increases, the computational approach is needed to predict patients infected with COVID-19 in order to speed up the diagnosis time and minimize human error compared to conventional diagnoses. However, the number of negative data that is higher than positive data can result in a data imbalance situation that affects the classification performance, resulting in a bias in the model evaluation results. This study proposes a new oversampling technique, i.e., TRIM-SBR, to generate the minor class data for diagnosing patients infected with COVID-19. It is still challenging to develop the oversampling technique due to the data’s generalization issue. The proposed method is based on pruning by looking for specific minority areas while retaining data generalization, resulting in minority data seeds that serve as benchmarks in creating new synthesized data using bootstrap resampling techniques. Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, F-measure, and AUC are used to evaluate classifier performance in data imbalance cases. The results show that the TRIM-SBR method provides the best performance compared to other oversampling techniques.","Wibowo, Prasetyo; Fatichah, Chastine",Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,37,1

The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. METHODS: We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. RESULTS: Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months. Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation. The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status. Almost half of cases are asymptomatic, and therefore undiagnosed by local testing strategies.

In Sicily (Italy), our institute houses a mobile ECMO team that serves a population of around 10 million people for a vast area in southern Italy and Malta. This observational, descriptive study includes all patients that required veno–venous (V-V) ECMO and transport by a mobile team between October 2009 and May 2020. Linear and multiple logistic regressions were applied to explore the risk factors for mortality in the ICU. Kaplan–Meier estimates were generated to predict the survival in patients transported by helicopter or ambulance, and the two cohorts were compared according to their baseline characteristics. Of 122 patients transported, 89 (73%) survived to ICU discharge (50 (41%) patients were transported by ambulance, and 72 (59%) were transported by helicopter). Independent predictive factors associated with mortality in a stepwise multiple regression model were prone positioning, acute kidney injury, and the number of days spent on mechanical ventilation (MV). Kaplan–Meier estimates for survival favored the helicopter cohort (79%) rather than the ambulance cohort (64%). Patients transported by helicopter had better pre-ECMO profiles, with shorter hospital and ICU stays, a shorter duration of MV use, and higher RESP scores, which indicate better survival probabilities. ECMO transport can be carried out safely over long distances; in rural areas with underdeveloped roads, transportation via helicopter or ambulance can extend the arm of the hospital to remote areas. Early ECMO initiation can be crucial in improving survival outcomes, and when transportation is the limiting factor to starting ECMO support, it should be attempted at the earliest logistical stage possible.","Hildreth, Brianna A.; Panarello, Giovanna; Martucci, Gennaro; Tuzzolino, Fabio; Piacentini, Alberto; Occhipinti, Giovanna; Giunta, Andrea; Genco, Fabio; Raffa, Giuseppe M.; Pilato, Michele; Capitanio, Guido; Arcadipane, Antonio",Membranes (Basel),37,26

Our paper presents the first recorded evidence of the parasites Colpoda spp. and Colpodella spp. isolated together from the urine of a human patient. Although the patient did not experience any urinary symptoms and we discovered the parasites purely incidental, their disappearance was noticed after a combined therapy with two antibiotic drugs. In order to better understand the involvement of these two parasites in human pathology, we performed a brief review of the existing medical literature. Isolation of these parasites was recorded in different areas of the globe; however, we encountered a discrepancy in the diagnostic techniques used to identify these parasites. In medical parasitology molecular techniques provide the most accurate diagnostic but optical microscopy diagnosis, based on morphologic description of the parasites is also a useful, accessible and affordable diagnostic tool and it should not be neglected in cases involving rare parasites, where molecular diagnosis is not wildly available. ABSTRACT: An often-overlooked side of the population aging process and the steady rise of non-communicable diseases reflects the emergence of novel infectious pathogens on the background of an altered host immune response. The aim of this article was to present the first record of a ciliate and flagellate protozoa recovered from the urine of an elderly patient and to review the existing medical literature involving these parasites. A 70-year-old female patient was admitted for breathing difficulties on the basis of an acute exacerbation of COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) with respiratory insufficiency. The patient reported a long history of multiple comorbidities including COPD Gold II, chronic respiratory insufficiency, chronic heart failure NYHA III (New York Heart Association Functional Classification), type 2 diabetes and morbid obesity. During routine examinations, we ascertained the presence of two unusual protozoa, a ciliate and a flagellate, in the patient’s urine samples, identified on morphological criteria to be most likely Colpoda spp. and Colpodella spp., with similarities to C. steinii and C. gonderi. The presence of these parasites was not associated with any clinical signs of urinary disease. Following a combined treatment with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, we observed the disappearance of these pathogens upon discharge from the primary care clinic. This study highlights the importance of including unusual pathogens in the differential diagnosis of cases which involve immunosuppression.","Neculicioiu, Vlad S.; Colosi, Ioana A.; Toc, Dan A.; Lesan, Andrei; Costache, Carmen",Biology (Basel),37,24

But, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? The question arises because by the time an infected individual is tested the infection starting from him may have infected a chain of individuals. One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of testing the contact chain of an individual who tests positive. For this investigation, we utilize multiple human contact networks, spanning two real-world data sets of spatio-temporal records of human presence over certain periods of time, as also networks of a classical synthetic variety. Over the diverse set of contact patterns, we discover that testing the contact chain can both substantially reduce over time both the cumulative infection count and the testing load. We consider elements of human behavior that enhance the spread of the disease and lower the efficacy of testing strategies, and show that testing the contact chain enhances the resilience to adverse impacts of these elements. We also discover a phenomenon of diminishing return beyond a threshold value on the depth of the chain to be tested in one go, the threshold then provides the most desirable tradeoff between benefit in terms of reducing the cumulative infection count, enhancing resilience to adverse impacts of human behavior, and cost in terms of increasing the testing load.","Kim, Jungyeol; Chen, Xingran; Bidokhti, Shirin Saeedi; Sarkar, Saswati",,37,1

Circulating E-CR1 expression was semiquantified by flow cytometric analyses in 54 SARS patients and in 212 healthy individuals as a control. Since E-CR1 expression is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, a major genetic polymorphism located within intron 27 of the CR1 gene was simultaneously analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results showed that the expression level of E-CR1 (referred to as net fluorescence intensity values, NFI) was statistically correlated with the relevant genetic genotypes among the Chinese population including the healthy individuals (NFI: 5·14 ± 0·82, 3·57 ± 0·66 and 2·67 ± 0·32 for HH, HL and LL genotypes, respectively) and SARS patients (NFI: 3·52 ± 0·91 and 2·63 ± 0·70 for HH and HL genotypes, respectively). Interestingly, the expression density of E-CR1 was found to fall significantly during the initiation and progressive phases (weeks 1 and 2 after the disease onset) and gradually returned close to normal through their whole convalescent phase (beginning from weeks 2 or 3 to weeks 7 or 8) in SARS patients irrespective CR1 genotype.

Nidoviruses are comprised of 2 families of viruses, coronaviruses and arteriviruses, and are common pathogens of humans and a variety of animal species. Both families of viruses contain neurotropic strains that produce experimental neurologic diseases in rodents. These include acute meningitis and encephalitis; acute poliomyelitis; and chronic inflammatory, immune-mediated, demyelination.

This study aims to determine whether IAHS occurs in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a retrospective observational study on 268 critically ill patients with COVID-19 between February 1st, 2020 and February 26th, 2020. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, information on concurrent treatments and outcomes were collected. A diagnosis of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) was made when the patients had an HScore greater than 169. Histopathological examinations were performed to confirm the presence of hemophagocytosis. Of 268 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 17 (6.3%) patients had an HScore greater than 169. All the 17 patients with sHLH died. The interval from the onset of symptom of COVID-19 to the time of a diagnosis of sHLH made was 19 days and the interval from the diagnosis of sHLH to death was 4 days. Ten (59%) patients were infected with only SARS-CoV-2. Hemophagocytosis in the spleen and the liver, as well as lymphocyte infiltration in the liver on histopathological examinations, was found in 3 sHLH autopsy patients. Mortality in sHLH patients with COVID-19 is high. And SARS-CoV-2 is a potential trigger for sHLH. Prompt recognition of IAHS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 could be beneficial for improving clinical outcomes.","Yang, Kun; Xing, Ming-you; Jiang, Ling-yu; Cai, Yan-ping; Yang, Li-li; Xie, Na-na; Chen, Jia; Wang, Wen-xia; Wang, Li; Zhu, Ji-ling; Zhang, Ding-yu; Ruan, Qiu-rong; Song, Jian-xin",Curr Med Sci,37,21

This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. METHODS: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.","Pace, Ryan M.; Williams, Janet E.; Järvinen, Kirsi M.; Belfort, Mandy B.; Pace, Christina D.W.; Lackey, Kimberly A.; Gogel, Alexandra C.; Nguyen-Contant, Phuong; Kanagaiah, Preshetha; Fitzgerald, Theresa; Ferri, Rita; Young, Bridget; Rosen-Carole, Casey; Diaz, Nichole; Meehan, Courtney L.; Caffe, Beatrice; Sangster, Mark Y.; Topham, David; McGuire, Mark A.; Seppo, Antti; McGuire, Michelle K.",medRxiv,37,16

Here, a novel approach—termed the Chronological Hurst Exponent (CHE)—is proposed, which hypothesizes that changes in the long-range memory latent within the dynamics of time series data may be temporally associated with changes in such influences. Using the monthly number FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approvals from 1939 to 2019 as the data source, it is demonstrated that the CHE has a distinct S-shaped structure demarcated by an 8-year (1939–1947) Stagnation Period, a 27-year (1947–1974) Emergent Period, and a 45-year (1974–2019) Saturation Period. Further, dominant periodicities (resolved via wavelet analyses) are identified during the most recent 45-year CHE Saturation Period at 17, 8 and 4 years; thus, US drug approvals have been following a Juglar/Kuznet mid-term cycle with Kitchin-like bursts. As discussed, this work suggests that (1) changes in extrinsic factors (e.g., of economic and/or policy origin) during the Emergent Period may have led to persistent growth in US drug approvals enjoyed since 1974, (2) the CHE may be a valued method to explore influences on time series data, and (3) innovation-related economic cycles exist (as viewed via the proxy metric of US drug approvals).

We isolated neutrophils from the blood of COVID‐19 patients receiving general ward care and from patients hospitalised at intensive care units (ICUs) to explore the kinetics of circulating neutrophils and factors important for neutrophil migration and activation. METHODS: Multicolour flow cytometry was exploited for the analysis of neutrophil differentiation and activation markers. Multiplex and ELISA technologies were used for the quantification of protease, protease inhibitor, chemokine and cytokine concentrations in plasma. Neutrophil polarisation responses were evaluated microscopically. Gelatinolytic and metalloproteinase activity in plasma was determined using a fluorogenic substrate. Co‐culturing healthy donor neutrophils with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) allowed us to investigate viral replication in neutrophils. RESULTS: Upon ICU admission, patients displayed high plasma concentrations of granulocyte–colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) and the chemokine CXCL8, accompanied by emergency myelopoiesis as illustrated by high levels of circulating CD10(−), immature neutrophils with reduced CXCR2 and C5aR expression. Neutrophil elastase and non‐metalloproteinase‐derived gelatinolytic activity were increased in plasma from ICU patients. Significantly higher levels of circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP‐1) in patients at ICU admission yielded decreased total MMP proteolytic activity in blood. COVID‐19 neutrophils were hyper‐responsive to CXCL8 and CXCL12 in shape change assays. Finally, SARS‐CoV‐2 failed to replicate inside human neutrophils. CONCLUSION: Our study provides detailed insights into the kinetics of neutrophil phenotype and function in severe COVID‐19 patients, and supports the concept of an increased neutrophil activation state in the circulation.","Metzemaekers, Mieke; Cambier, Seppe; Blanter, Marfa; Vandooren, Jennifer; de Carvalho, Ana Carolina; Malengier‐Devlies, Bert; Vanderbeke, Lore; Jacobs, Cato; Coenen, Sofie; Martens, Erik; Pörtner, Noëmie; Vanbrabant, Lotte; Van Mol, Pierre; Van Herck, Yannick; Van Aerde, Nathalie; Hermans, Greet; Gunst, Jan; Borin, Alexandre; Toledo N Pereira, Bruna; dos SP Gomes, Arilson Bernardo; Primon Muraro, Stéfanie; Fabiano de Souza, Gabriela; S Farias, Alessandro; Proenca‐Modena, José Luiz; R Vinolo, Marco Aurélio; Marques, Pedro Elias; Wouters, Carine; Wauters, Els; Struyf, Sofie; Matthys, Patrick; Opdenakker, Ghislain; Marques, Rafael Elias; Wauters, Joost; Gouwy, Mieke; Proost, Paul",Clin Transl Immunology,37,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 427 patients (287 men and 140 women; mean [SD] age, 72 [12] y) who were treated with thermal ablation for RCC between October 2006 and December 2017. Patients were stratified by BMI into 3 categories: normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (≥ 30 kg/m2). Of 427 patients, 71 (16%) were normal weight, 157 (37%) were overweight, and 199 (47%) were obese. Complication rates, local recurrence, and residual disease were compared in the 3 cohorts. RESULTS: No differences in technical success between normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients were identified (P = .72). Primary technique efficacy rates for normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients were 91%, 94%, and 93% (P = .71). There was no significant difference in RCC specific-free survival, disease-free survival, and metastasis-free survival between obese, overweight, and normal-weight groups (P = .72, P = .43, P = .99).

Currently, there are no effective treatments or vaccines available to control PDCoV. To study the potential of RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against PDCoV infection, two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids (pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N) that targeted the M and N genes of PDCoV were constructed and transfected separately into swine testicular (ST) cells, which were then infected with PDCoV strain HB-BD. The potential of the plasmids to inhibit PDCoV replication was evaluated by cytopathic effect, virus titers, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The cytopathogenicity assays demonstrated that pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N protected ST cells against pathological changes with high specificity and efficacy. The 50% tissue culture infective dose showed that the PDCoV titers in ST cells treated with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N were reduced 13.2- and 32.4-fold, respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that the amount of viral RNA in cell cultures pre-transfected with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N was reduced by 45.8 and 56.1%, respectively. This is believed to be the first report to show that shRNAs targeting the M and N genes of PDCoV exert antiviral effects in vitro, which suggests that RNAi is a promising new strategy against PDCoV infection.","Gu, Wen-yuan; Li, Yan; Liu, Bao-jing; Wang, Jing; Yuan, Guang-fu; Chen, Shao-jie; Zuo, Yu-Zhu; Fan, Jing-Hui",Virus Genes,37,20

One hundred and three serum or plasma samples were selected and tested: 70 were positive by both tests, 24 were negative by both tests. The in-practice test produced five false positive and four false negative results. The sensitivity of the in-practice test was 95% and the specificity was 83%. When the titres were compared it was found that the in-practice test results were significantly correlated with IFA titres but the degree of correlation was not likely to be clinically useful. The IFA titres of the four false negative samples were found to be low (less than 40) which suggests that even a cat with a false negative result is still unlikely to be excreting FCoV. A negative result with the in-practice assay is likely to be reliable for screening cats prior to entry into an FCoV-free cattery or stud. It would also be useful in the investigation of suspected FIP as most cats with this condition have high IFA titres of antibodies. A strong positive result would be useful in the diagnosis of FIP (in conjunction with other biochemical and cytological testing), but positive results would be of limited value in monitoring FCoV infection in healthy cats as the antibody titre could not be reliably compared with those obtained with IFA. All positive results obtained using the in-practice kit should be confirmed and titrated by IFA.

We evaluated the association between receipt of laboratory-based polysomnography (which is the first step in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep breathing disorders in Ontario, Canada) and respiratory-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality among individuals with IPF. METHODS: We used a retrospective, population-based, cohort study design, analyzing health administrative data from Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2019. Individuals with IPF were identified using an algorithm based on health administrative codes previously developed by IPF experts. Propensity score matching was used to account for potential differences in 41 relevant covariates between individuals that underwent polysomnography (exposed) and individuals that did not undergo polysomnography (controls), in order minimize potential confounding. Respiratory-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality were evaluated up to 12 months after the index date. RESULTS: Out of 5044 individuals with IPF identified, 201 (4.0%) received polysomnography, and 189 (94.0%) were matched to an equal number of controls. Compared to controls, exposed individuals had significantly reduced rates of respiratory-related hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.75), p = 0.003) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30–0.80), p = 0.004).

We present a mathematical model for predication of maximum temperature at different positions inside the container and their relation to different ambient air temperature scenarios. The mathematical formulas used are based on the conservation laws and a good agreement of a full month of field measurements were obtained. Even in winter conditions in many of developing countries air temperature can maintain levels above 20 °C, which will produce temperature around 30 °C and viruses can reach levels below detection limit in maximum 3 h.","Maher, Osama Ali; Kamal, Sherif A.; Newir, Ahmed; Persson, Kenneth M.",Int J Hyg Environ Health,37,31

A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass “social distancing” measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion.","Lakhani, Hari Vishal; Pillai, Sneha S.; Zehra, Mishghan; Sharma, Ishita; Sodhi, Komal",Int J Environ Res Public Health,37,20

Here, using native mass spectrometry, we show that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly and that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs, a common motif in coronavirus packaging signals. Unexpectedly, proteolytic processing of N protein resulted in the formation of additional proteoforms. The N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA, with the same preference for GGG motifs, and bind to cyclophilin A, an interaction which can be abolished by approved immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. Furthermore, N proteoforms showed significantly different interactions with IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from convalescent plasma. Notably, the C-terminal proteoform exhibited a heightened interaction with convalescent antibodies, suggesting the antigenic epitope is localized to the C-terminus. Overall, the different interactions of N proteoforms highlight potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and identify a stable and immunogenic proteoform as a possible candidate for immune-directed therapies.","Lutomski, Corinne A.; El-Baba, Tarick J.; Bolla, Jani R.; Robinson, Carol V.",JACS Au,37,24

We examined the lead-lag associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in wastewater and COVID-19 rates in relatively small urban areas of Seville, adjusting for internal mobility, temperature, and wastewater-related variables. The association COVID-19 rates-RNA copies were statistically significant from three to 27 days after sampling. Temperature is a confounding factor for both viral RNA counts and mobility. The model that best fitted data used cases six days after sampling. A logarithmic unit increase in viral RNA count in wastewater was associated with a 26.9% increase in COVID-19 rate per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 13.1-42.4%), within the urban area, six days later. Surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has great potential for public health. Knowing the specific association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in wastewater and COVID-19 daily rates may help to improve its performance.","Rodríguez Rasero, Francisco Javier; Moya Ruano, Luis A.; Rasero Del Real, Pablo; Cuberos Gómez, Lucila; Lorusso, Nicola",Sci Total Environ,37,26

Methods The phase 2 component of our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2 trial was designed to identify which dosing regimen of NVX-CoV2373 should move forward into late phase studies in younger (18-59 years) and older (60-84 years) participants and was based on immunogenicity and safety data through day 35 (14 days after the second dose). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one or two intramuscular doses of 5-microgram or 25-microgram NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, 21 days apart. Primary endpoints were immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response, 7 day solicited reactogenicity, and unsolicited adverse events. A key secondary endpoint was wild type virus neutralizing antibody response. Results After randomization, approximately 250 participants each were assigned to one of four vaccine groups or placebo. Of these, approximately 45% were older participants. Reactogenicity was predominantly mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (median <3 days) after first and second vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, with higher frequencies and intensity after second vaccination and with the higher dose, and occurred less frequently and was of lower intensity in older participants. The two-dose regimen of 5-microgram NVX-CoV2373 induced robust geometric mean titer (GMT) IgG anti-spike protein (65,019 and 28,137 EU/mL) and wild-type virus neutralizing antibody (2201 and 981 titers) responses in younger and older participants, respectively, with seroconversion rates of 100% in both age groups. Neutralizing antibody responses exceeded those seen in convalescent sera for both age groups. Conclusions The study confirmed that the two-dose regimen of 5 microgram NVX CoV2373 is highly immunogenic and well tolerated in both younger and older participants.

The deterministic SEIRD(R)D-SD model is further converted into the stochastic form to account for uncertainties involved in COVID-19 spread. Based on this, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed based on the stochastic SEIR(R)D-SD model to simultaneously estimate both model parameters and transmission state of COVID-19 spread.

Quality, Organization, Training, Resources, Management, Interoperability, and Responsiveness were evaluated by calculating scores (10 points). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare scores. Spearman’s correlation coefficient and multifaceted regression analysis were performed between Responsiveness and dimensions scores. RESULTS: A total of 287 of 636 French EDs were included (45.1%). Calculated scores showed (median): Quality 5.38; Organization 6.4; Training 4.6; Resources 4.13; Management 2.38; Interoperability 4.0; Responsiveness 6.25; seasonal influenza score was 5.

We conducted detailed investigations in six London care homes reporting suspected COVID-19 outbreaks during April 2020. Methods: Residents and staff had nasal swabs for SARS CoV-2 testing using RT-PCR and were followed-up for 14 days. They were categorized as symptomatic, post-symptomatic or pre-symptomatic if they had symptoms at the time of testing, in the two weeks before or two weeks after testing, respectively, or asymptomatic throughout. Virus isolation and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was also performed. Findings: Across the six care homes, 105/264 (39.8%) residents were SARS CoV-2 positive, including 28 (26.7%) symptomatic, 10 (9.5%) post-symptomatic, 21 (20.0%) pre-symptomatic and 46 (43.8%) who remained asymptomatic. Case-fatality at 14-day follow-up was highest among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive residents (10/28, 35.7%) compared to asymptomatic (2/4, 4.2%), post-symptomatic (2/10, 20.0%) or pre-symptomatic (3/21,14.3%) residents. Among staff, 53/254 (20.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 26/53 (49.1%) remained asymptomatic. RT-PCR cycle-thresholds and live-virus recovery were similar between symptomatic/asymptomatic residents/staff. Higher RT-PCR cycle threshold values (lower virus load) samples were associated with exponentially decreasing ability to recover infectious virus (P<0.001). WGS identified multiple (up to 9) separate introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 strains into individual care homes. Interpretation: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was found in care homes residents and staff, half of whom were asymptomatic and potential reservoirs for on-going transmission. A third of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 residents died within 14 days. Symptom-based screening alone is not sufficient for outbreak control.

The social and economic risks of the pandemic are identified and the directions of anti-crisis measures are considered. Public administration is a system consisting of citizens, business structures and government employees. State authorities, while implementing the directions of public policy, must take into account the interests of all participants of the system, building the channels of interaction between them in the most effective way. The pandemic is a serious challenge to the state administration system of any country, the prevention of the consequences of which requires timely and effective measures to be taken. Under the conditions of the pandemic in Russia, as well as all over the world, the role of the state has significantly increased, both in terms of prevention of pandemic spread, and in the form of measures aimed at supporting citizens and businesses, the most affected spheres of the economy. The purpose of this work is to consider new approaches to optimize the processes in the system of public administration, caused by the need to revise the directions of state policy under the threat of the spread of COVID-19.","Titov, V N; Korshunov, A M",Probl Sotsialnoi Gig Zdravookhranenniiai Istor Med,37,24

The use of different available NGS tools applied to wastewater samples could be the key for an in-depth study of the excreted virome, not only focusing on SARS-CoV-2 circulation and typing, but also to detect other potentially pandemic viruses within the same family. With this aim, 24-hours composite wastewater samples from March and July 2020 were sequenced by applying specific viral NGS as well as target enrichment NGS. The full virome of the analyzed samples was obtained, with human Coronaviridae members (CoV) present in one of those samples after applying the enrichment. One contig was identified as HCoV-OC43 and 8 contigs as SARS-CoV-2. CoVs from other animal hosts were also detected when applying this technique. These contigs were compared with those obtained from contemporary clinical specimens by applying the same target enrichment approach. The results showed that there is a co-circulation in urban areas of human and animal coronaviruses infecting domestic animals and rodents. NGS enrichment-based protocols might be crucial to describe the occurrence and genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviridae family members within the excreted virome present in wastewater.","Martínez-Puchol, Sandra; Itarte, Marta; Rusiñol, Marta; Forés, Eva; Mejías-Molina, Cristina; Andrés, Cristina; Antón, Andrés; Quer, Josep; Abril, Josep F.; Girones, Rosina; Bofill-Mas, Sílvia",Sci Total Environ,37,1

This includes a newly identified class of genes called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lack of sequence conservation for lncRNAs across species meant that their biological importance was initially met with some skepticism. LncRNAs mediate their functions through interactions with proteins, RNA, DNA, or a combination of these. Their functions can often be dictated by their localization, sequence, and/or secondary structure. Here we provide a review of the approaches typically adopted to study the complexity of these genes with an emphasis on recent discoveries within the innate immune field. Finally, we discuss the challenges, as well as the emergence of new technologies that will continue to move this field forward and provide greater insight into the biological importance of this class of genes.

S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-II) to enter into the lungs through membrane proteases consequently inflicting the extensive viral load through rapid replication mechanisms. Despite several research efforts, challenges in COVID-19 management still persist at various levels that include (a) availability of a low cost and rapid self-screening test, (b) lack of an effective vaccine which works against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, and (c) lack of a potent drug that can reduce the complications of COVID-19. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated process due to the emergence of mutant variants with greater virulence and their ability to invoke intricate lung pathophysiology. Moreover, the lack of a thorough understanding about the virus transmission mechanisms and complete pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is making it hard for medical scientists to develop a better strategy to prevent the spread of the virus and design a clinically viable vaccine to protect individuals from being infected. A recent report has tested the hypothesis of T cell immunity and found effective when compared to the antibody response in agammaglobulinemic patients. Understanding SARS-CoV-2-induced changes such as “Th-2 immunopathological variations, mononuclear cell & eosinophil infiltration of the lung and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)” in COVID-19 patients provides key insights to develop potential therapeutic interventions for immediate clinical management. Therefore, in this review, we have described the details of rapid detection methods of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular and serological tests and addressed different therapeutic modalities used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In addition, the current challenges against the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are also briefly described in this article.","Beeraka, Narasimha M.; Tulimilli, SubbaRao V.; Karnik, Medha; Sadhu, Surya P.; Pragada, Rajeswara Rao; Aliev, Gjumrakch; Madhunapantula, SubbaRao V.",Biomed Res Int,37,16

However, its diagnostic capability differentiated by time from onset and potential contribution to infectivity assessment have not been fully investigated. Methods A retrospective, observational study using nasopharyngeal swab specimens from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) inpatients was conducted using LumipulseⓇ SARS-CoV-2 antigen test. Diagnostic accuracy was examined for the early (up to 10 days after onset) and late (over 10 days after onset) stages. Time-course QAT changes and reverse‐transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction tests results were displayed as locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine the appropriate cutoff value for differentiating the early and late stages. Results We obtained 100 specimens from 68 COVID-19 patients, including 51 early-stage and 49 late-stage specimens. QAT sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (0.72–0.90) and 0.95 (0.75–0.99) for all periods, 0.93 (0.82–0.98) and 1.00 (0.39–1.00) for the early stage, and 0.66 (0.48–0.82) and 0.93 (0.69–0.99) for the late stage, respectively. The ROC analysis indicated an ideal cutoff value of 6.93 pg/mL for distinguishing early-from late-stage specimens. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting the late stage were 0.76 (0.61–0.87), 0.76 (0.63–0.87), 0.76 (0.61–0.87), and 0.76 (0.63–0.87).

This scoping review synthesises evidence from 33 studies in the African Great Lakes Region to examine the influence of food environments on fish acquisition and consumption. We identified only two studies that explicitly applied a food environment framework and none that linked policy conditions with the contribution of fish to diets. Economic access to fish was represented in the largest number of included studies (21 studies), followed by preferences, acceptability and desirability of fish (17 studies) and availability and physical access (14 studies). Positive perceptions of taste and low cost, relative to other animal-source foods, were drivers of fish purchases in many settings; however, limited physical and economic access were frequently identified as preventing optimal intake. In lakeside communities, fish were increasingly directed toward external markets which reduced the availability and affordability of fish for local households. Few studies considered intra-household variations in fish access according to age, gender or physiological status, which represents an important knowledge gap. There is also scope for future research on seasonal influences on fish access and the design and rigorous evaluation of programmes and policies that address one or more constraints of availability, cost, convenience and preferences.","de Bruyn, Julia; Wesana, Joshua; Bunting, Stuart W.; Thilsted, Shakuntala H.; Cohen, Philippa J.",Nutrients,37,21

Many local cannabis businesses have attracted investment from overseas, including from Canada, US and Europe. AIM: To explore the opportunities and risks of foreign investment in an emerging domestic legal cannabis market in a developing country. METHODS: Thematic analysis of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 22 key informants (KIs) from the Jamaican government, local cannabis industry, academia and civil society, and field observations of legal and illegal cannabis cultivators. RESULTS: KIs from the Jamaican public agencies and domestic cannabis entrepreneurs saw foreign investment as an essential source of capital to finance the start-up costs of legal cannabis businesses. Local cannabis entrepreneurs prioritised investors with the greatest financial resources, brand reputation and export networks. They also considered how allied an investor was with their business vision (e.g., organic cultivation, medical vs. recreational). The key benefits of partnering with a foreign investor included transfer of technical knowledge and financial capital, which enhanced production, quality assurance and seed-to-sale tracking. Some KIs expressed concern over investors’ focus on increasing production efficiency and scale at the expense of funding research and development (R&D) and clinical trials. KIs from the local industry, government agencies and civil society highlighted the risks of ‘predatory’ shareholder agreements and domestic political interference. Concerns were raised about the impact of foreign investment on the diversity of the domestic cannabis sector in Jamaica, including the commitment to transition traditional illegal small-scale cannabis cultivators to the legal sector. CONCLUSION: While foreign investment has facilitated the commercialisation of the cannabis sector in Jamaica, regulatory measures are also needed to protect the domestic industry and support the transition of small-scale illegal cultivators to the legal regime. Foreign investments may alter the economic, social and political determinants of health in transitioning from illegal to legal cannabis market economy.","Rychert, Marta; Emanuel, Machel Anthony; Wilkins, Chris",Global Health,37,28

To successfully contain the spread of the virus, special attention needs to be given to this set of people by assessing the type of information, source of information, and practices they inculcate as regards adherence to WHO guidelines in the fight against COVID-19 in Uganda. The study aimed to assess the role of information sources, education level, and phone internet connectivity in influencing COVID-19 knowledge among the rural market vendors; and the relationship existing between knowledge, attitude, and practices among them. Methods: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study among rural market vendors (n = 248) in southwestern Uganda. Information was collected using a questionnaire and descriptively presented as frequency and percentages. Results: The study showed that the majority of the rural market vendors had sufficient information regarding COVID-19 with the majority being female individuals and have attained a secondary level of education, The general percentage score for knowledge, attitude, and practices were (75.57, 82.6, and 76.50% respectively). There was a positive correlation between attitude and practices (r = 0.17, p = 0.007), as well as their knowledge with practices (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). The majority of the people in the population did not have their phones connected to the internet (OR = 1.96, 95%CI: 1.16–3.31, P = 0.01). The majority of people received their information regarding COVID-19 from one source (radio) (OR = 1.55). Conclusion: Where and how the rural market vendors get their information and education level are vital in breaking COVID 19 infection circle in line with WHO guidelines. Therefore, sources of information and education level played a key role in molding their knowledge and practices.

Two Cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) isolates, M1 and M2, were studied. Both can infect Phalaenopsis orchids, but only M1 can systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Protoplast inoculation and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that both isolates can replicate in N. benthamiana; however, M2 was restricted to the initially infected cells. Genome shuffling between M1 and M2 revealed that two control modes are involved in CymMV host dependent movement. The M1 coat protein (CP) plays a dominant role in controlling CymMV movement between cells, because all chimeric CymMV viruses containing the M1 CP systemically infected N. benthamiana plants. Without the M1 CP, one chimeric virus containing the combination of the M1 triple gene block proteins (TGBps), the M2 5′ RNA (1–4333), and the M2 CP effectively moved in N. benthamiana plants. Further complementation analysis revealed that M1 TGBp1 and TGBp3 are co-required to complement the movement of the chimeric viruses in N. benthamiana. The amino acids within the CP, TGBp1 and TGBp3 which are required or important for CymMV M2 movement in N. benthamiana plants were mapped. The required amino acids within the CP map to the predicted RNA binding domain. RNA–protein binding assays revealed that M1 CP has higher RNA binding affinity than does M2 CP.

FINDINGS: Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34,435,272 person-days. Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 11·6 (95% CI: 10·9 to 12·3) for reporting a positive test. The corresponding aHR was 3·40 (95% CI: 3·37 to 3·43) using an inverse probability weighted Cox model adjusting for the likelihood of receiving a test. A symptom-based classifier of predicted COVID-19 yielded similar risk estimates. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE, the aHRs for reporting a positive test were 1·46 (95% CI: 1·21 to 1·76) for those reporting PPE reuse and 1·31 (95% CI: 1·10 to 1·56) for reporting inadequate PPE. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE who did not care for COVID-19 patients, HCWs caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had aHRs for a positive test of 4·83 (95% CI: 3·99 to 5·85) if they had adequate PPE, 5·06 (95% CI: 3·90 to 6·57) for reused PPE, and 5·91 (95% CI: 4·53 to 7·71) for inadequate PPE. INTERPRETATION: Frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 infection, highest among HCWs who reused PPE or had inadequate access to PPE. However, adequate supplies of PPE did not completely mitigate high-risk exposures.

To maintain alveolar fluid homeostasis, both the integrity of the alveolar–capillary barrier and the expression of epithelial ion channels and pumps are necessary to establish a vectorial ion gradient. However, during pulmonary infection, auto- and/or paracrine-acting mediators induce pathophysiological changes of the alveolar–capillary barrier, altered expression of epithelial Na,K-ATPase and of epithelial ion channels including epithelial sodium channel and cystic fibrosis membrane conductance regulator, leading to the accumulation of edema and impaired alveolar fluid clearance. These mediators include classical pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β, TNF-α, interferons, or IL-1β that are released upon bacterial challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as in viral infection with influenza A virus, pathogenic coronaviruses, or respiratory syncytial virus. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic mediator TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, extracellular nucleotides, or reactive oxygen species impair epithelial ion channel expression and function. Interestingly, during bacterial infection, alterations of ion transport function may serve as an additional feedback loop on the respiratory inflammatory profile, further aggravating disease progression. These changes lead to edema formation and impair edema clearance which results in suboptimal gas exchange causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Recent preclinical studies suggest that modulation of the alveolar–capillary fluid homeostasis could represent novel therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes in infection-induced lung injury.","Peteranderl, Christin; Sznajder, Jacob I.; Herold, Susanne; Lecuona, Emilia",Front Immunol,37,20

In this report a new intelligent model called HH-COVID-19 is proposed, with simple design and adaptive parameters. Methods: The parameters R_0 and S_I are adapted by adding three new weighting factors α, β and γ and two free parameters σ_1 and σ_2 in function of time t, thus the HH-COVID-19 become time-variant model. The parameters R_0, S_I, α, β, γ, σ_1 and σ_2 are estimated optimally based on a recent algorithm of artificial intelligence (AI), inspired from nature called Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO), using the data of the confirmed infected cases in Algeria country in the first t=55 days. Results: Parameters estimated optimally: R_0= 1.341, S_I= 5.991, α= 2.987, β= 1.566, γ= 4.998 σ_1= -0.133 and σ_2= 0.0324. R_0 starts on 1.341 and ends to 2.677, and S_I starts on 5.991 and ends to 6.692. The estimated results are identically to the actual infected incidence in Algeria, HH-COVID-19 proved its superiority in comparison study. HH-COVID-19 predicts that in 1 May, the infected cases exceed 50 000, during May, to reach quickly the herd immunity stage at beginning of July. Conclusion: HH-COVID-19 can be used for tracking any COVID-19 outbreak cases around the world, just should updating its new parameters to fitting the area to be studied, especially when the population is directly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.","Nail, Bachir; Rabehi, Abdelaziz; Bekhiti, Belkacem; Arbaoui, Taha",,37,1

METHODS: We performed a prospective study of acute bronchitis at 31 hospitals and clinics in Korea from July 2011 to June 2012. Sputum specimens were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of microorganisms. RESULTS: Of the 811 enrolled patients, 291 had acceptable sputum specimens that were included for analysis of the etiologic distribution. With multiplex PCR testing, viruses were identified in 36.1% (105/291), most commonly rhinovirus (25.8%) and coronavirus (3.8%). Typical bacteria were isolated in 126/291 (43.3%) patients. Among these patients Haemophilus influenzae (n = 39) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 30) were isolated most commonly; atypical bacteria were identified in 44 (15.1%) patients. Bacteria-only, virus-only, and mixed infections (bacteria plus virus) accounted for 36.7% (98/291), 17.2% (50/291), and 18.9% (55/291) of infections, respectively. In particular, 52.4% of patients with viral infection had a concurrent bacterial infection, and rhinovirus was the most common virus in mixed infections (40/55). Additionally, infections with typical bacteria were more common in patients with chronic lung disease (p = 0.029), and typical bacterial infections showed a trend towards a higher prevalence with older age (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were associated with almost half of community-acquired acute bronchitis cases.

A sample of 980 volunteers answered a web-based survey which aimed to investigate the many facets of risk perceptions connected to COVID-19 (health, work, institutional-economy, interpersonal and psychological), and risk-related variables such as perceived knowledge, news seeking, perceived control, perceived efficacy of containment measures, and affective states. Socio-demographic characteristics were also collected. Results showed that although levels of general concern are relatively high among Italians, risk perceptions are highest with regards to the institutional-economy and work, and lowest concerning health. COVID-19 has been also estimated to be the least likely cause of death. Cognitive and affective risk-related variables contributed to explain the several risk perception domains differently. COVID-19 perceived knowledge did not affect any risk perception while the perceived control decreased health risk likelihood. The other risk-related variables amplified risk perceptions: News seeking increased work and institutional-economy risk; perceived efficacy of containment measures increased almost all perceived risks; negative affective states of fear, anger and sadness increased health risk; anxiety increased health, interpersonal and psychological risks, and uncertainty increased work, institutional-economy, interpersonal and psychological risk perceptions. Finally, positive affective states increased health risk perception.

A large fraction of allergic diseases is characterized by a type 2 immune response involving Th2 cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, eosinophils, mast cells, and M2 macrophages. Biomarkers are valuable parameters for precision medicine as they provide information on the disease endotypes, clusters, precision diagnoses, identification of therapeutic targets, and monitoring of treatment efficacies. The availability of powerful omics technologies, together with integrated data analysis and network-based approaches can help the identification of clinically useful biomarkers. These biomarkers need to be accurately quantified using robust and reproducible methods, such as reliable and point-of-care systems. Ideally, samples should be collected using quick, cost-efficient and noninvasive methods. In recent years, a plethora of research has been directed toward finding novel biomarkers of allergic diseases. Promising biomarkers of type 2 allergic diseases include sputum eosinophils, serum periostin and exhaled nitric oxide. Several other biomarkers, such as pro-inflammatory mediators, miRNAs, eicosanoid molecules, epithelial barrier integrity, and microbiota changes are useful for diagnosis and monitoring of allergic diseases and can be quantified in serum, body fluids and exhaled air. Herein, we review recent studies on biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma, chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergies, anaphylaxis, drug hypersensitivity and allergen immunotherapy. In addition, we discuss COVID-19 and allergic diseases within the perspective of biomarkers and recommendations on the management of allergic and asthmatic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ogulur, Ismail; Pat, Yagiz; Ardicli, Ozge; Barletta, Elena; Cevhertas, Lacin; Fernandez-Santamaria, Ruben; Huang, Mengting; Bel Imam, Manal; Koch, Jana; Ma, Siyuan; Maurer, Debbie J; Mitamura, Yasutaka; Peng, Yaqi; Radzikowska, Urszula; Rinaldi, Arturo O; Rodriguez-Coira, Juan; Satitsuksanoa, Pattraporn; Schneider, Stephan R; Wallimann, Alexandra; Zhakparov, Damir; Ziadlou, Reihane; Brüggen, Marie-Charlotte; van de Veen, Willem; Sokolowska, Milena; Baerenfaller, Katja; Zhang, Luo; Akdis, Mubeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A",Allergy,37,20

Cytotoxic amyloid and tau species were recovered from the blood and the hippocampus following pneumonia, and they were present in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation oxygenators of patients with pneumonia, especially in those who died. Introduction of immunopurified blood‐borne amyloid and tau into either the airways or the blood of uninfected animals acutely and chronically impaired hippocampal information processing. In contrast, the infection did not impair long‐term potentiation in tau knockout mice and the amyloid‐ and tau‐dependent disruption in hippocampal signaling was less severe in tau knockout mice.

A high number of non-specific effective infection control protocols are available in dental settings. It is of fundamental importance to implement specific protocols relating to those clinical situations that normally do not represent an emergency but which now fall into that category. The aim of this study was the comparison of data obtained from the Regional National Health Fund (NFZ) relating to the number and the type of procedures in the oral health management of children aged 0–18 years from the Wielkopolska region, with the months of March and April of 2019 being compared with those of the, respective, pandemic period of 2020. The results showed statistical differences in the number of performed procedures when comparing 2019 and 2020; especially in April (n = 53,077 in 2019 but only n = 2,287 in 2020), when lockdown restrictions reached their highest level and when only 30% of the dental clinics for children were open for patients in the Wielkopolska region of Poland. Regarding surgical cases, there were no differences in percentage frequency between April 2019 and 2020 in terms of extractions. However, an increase was observed in abscess incisions (3.5–17.8%) and surgical dressings (1.5–10.07%). There was a decrease in the total number of performed conservative dentistry procedures in April 2020, but temporary fillings in primary and permanent teeth showed a prominent increase: from 6.4% in 2019 to 19.3% in 2020; and 5.8–11.4%, respectively. Pulp treatment and mucosal lesions therapy fall into the dental emergency category during this COVID-19 pandemic. These cases have shown an increase from 3.2% in 2019 to 12.8% in 2020 for pulp treatment, and from 2.3 to 4.3% for the treatment of oral mucosal lesions. As suspected, after the lockdown was implemented, the number of pediatric dental cases were low. Moreover, the analysis revealed differences in the profile of clinical situations that represented the emergency cases and the pandemic treatment protocols. Future implications suggest that dental prophylactic procedures be included in pandemic protocols with even dental services being limited to a form of urgent treatment. New approaches and treatment models should be implemented in the control of the infectious spread of the disease in the management of the oral health of children in this pandemic period.","Olszewska, Aneta; Paszynska, Elzbieta; Roszak, Magdalena; Czajka-Jakubowska, Agata",Front Public Health,37,20

Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with host proteins to pave its entry into host cells. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 and design of effective antiviral drugs, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be very useful. In this regard, we have initially created a human-SARS-CoV-2 PPI database from existing works in the literature which has resulted in 7085 unique PPIs. Subsequently, we have identified at most 10 proteins with highest degrees viz. hub proteins from interacting human proteins for individual virus protein. The identification of these hub proteins is important as they are connected to most of the other human proteins. Consequently, when they get affected, the potential diseases are triggered in the corresponding pathways, thereby leading to comorbidities. Furthermore, the biological significance of the identified hub proteins is shown using KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis is also essential for identifying the pathways leading to comorbidities. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 proteins viz. NSP2, NSP5, Envelope and ORF10 interacting with human hub proteins like COX4I1, COX5A, COX5B, NDUFS1, CANX, HSP90AA1 and TP53 lead to comorbidities. Such comorbidities are Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, HTLV-1 infection, prostate cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Subsequently, using Enrichr tool possible repurposable drugs which target the human hub proteins are reported in this paper as well. Therefore, this work provides a consolidated study for human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions to understand the relationship between comorbidity and hub proteins so that it may pave the way for the development of anti-viral drugs.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Saha, Indrajit; Sharma, Nikhil",Comput Biol Med,37,1

In this protocol, we outline a randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and tolerability of higher dose (25 mg) melatonin to target brain oxidative stress and sleep disturbance in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Forty individuals with MCI will be recruited from the Healthy Brain Ageing Clinic, University of Sydney and from the community, and randomised to receive either 25 mg oral melatonin or placebo nightly for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of intervention and adherence to trial medication at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes will include the effect of melatonin on brain oxidative stress as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, blood pressure, blood biomarkers, mood, cognition and sleep. Outcomes will be collected at 6 and 12 weeks. The results of this feasibility trial will inform a future conclusive randomised controlled trial to specifically test the efficacy of melatonin on modifiable risk factors of dementia, as well as cognition and brain function. This will be the first trial to investigate the effect of melatonin in the population with MCI in this way, with the future aim of using this approach to reduce progression to dementia. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the Sydney Local Health District Ethics Committee (X18-0077). This randomised controlled trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol published in the registry, the International Conference for Harmonisation on Good Clinical Practice and all other applicable regulatory requirements. The findings of the trial will be disseminated via conferences, publications and media, as applicable. Participants will be informed of results of the study at the conclusion of the trial.

Recent autopsy series indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both tubular and glomerular cells. Whereas tubular cell infiltration may contribute to acute kidney injury, data on a potential clinical correlative to glomerular affection is rare. We describe the first case of nephrotic syndrome in the context of COVID-19 in a renal transplant recipient. A 35 year old male patient received a kidney allograft for primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Three months posttransplant a recurrence of podocytopathy was successfully managed by plasma exchange, ivIG, and a conversion from tacrolimus to belatacept (initial proteinuria > 6 g/l decreased to 169 mg/l). Six weeks later he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed a second increase of proteinuria (5.6 g/l). Renal allograft biopsy revealed diffuse podocyte effacement and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in RNA in-situ hybridation indicating a SARS-CoV-2 associated recurrence of podocytopathy. Noteworthy, nephrotic proteinuria resolved spontaneously after recovering from COVID-19. The present case expands the spectrum of renal involvement in COVID-19 from acute tubular injury to podocytopathy in renal transplant recipients. Thus, it may be wise to test for SARS-CoV-2 prior to initiation of immunosuppression in new onset glomerulopathy during the pandemic.

Despite advances in the surgical technique, urinary continence recovery time remains variable. A range of surgical and patient-related risk factors contributing to urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy have been described, including age, BMI, membranous urethral length and urethral sphincter insufficiency. Physical activity interventions incorporating aerobic exercise, resistance training and pelvic floor muscle training programmes can positively influence the return to continence in men after radical prostatectomy. Traditional approaches to improving urinary continence after radical prostatectomy have typically focused on interventions delivered during the postoperative period (rehabilitation). However, the limited efficacy of these postoperative approaches has led to a shift from the traditional reactive model of care to more comprehensive interventions incorporating exercise-based programmes that begin in the preoperative period (prehabilitation) and continue after surgery. Comprehensive prehabilitation interventions include appropriately prescribed aerobic exercise, resistance training and specific pelvic floor muscle instruction and exercise training programmes. Transperineal ultrasonography is a non-invasive and validated method for the visualization of the action of the pelvic floor musculature, providing real-time visual biofeedback to the patient during specific pelvic floor muscle instruction and training. Importantly, the waiting time before surgery can be used for the delivery of comprehensive prehabilitation exercise-based interventions to increase patient preparedness in the lead-up to surgery and optimize continence and health-related quality-of-life outcomes following radical prostatectomy.","Mungovan, Sean F.; Carlsson, Sigrid V.; Gass, Gregory C.; Graham, Petra L.; Sandhu, Jaspreet S.; Akin, Oguz; Scardino, Peter T.; Eastham, James A.; Patel, Manish I.",Nat Rev Urol,37,1

The evidence is mixed, however, with some studies showing that students may adopt a surface approach even when teaching promotes deep learning. To add to the understanding of the relationships between CA and learning approaches, we explored with quantitative measures two potential implications from prior qualitative research. First, we assessed with a novel questionnaire if students’ CA perceptions predicted adaptation towards a deep learning approach. Second, we explored relationships between deep approach adaptation and learning motivation, as well as perceived mental workload. 56 students from two second-year courses in different study programmes completed a learning approach questionnaire in the second (T(1)), seventh (T(2)), and the final fourteenth (T(3)) course week. At T(2) and T(3,) participants also rated the constructive alignment of the course, their learning motivation, and the mental workload. Regression analyses showed that ILO Clarity (i.e. being clear about the intended learning outcomes of the course) and receiving effective feedback were associated with a significant increase in deep approach scores from T(2) to T(3). That deep approach adaptation was in turn positively related to learning motivation in terms of higher ratings of one’s competence, the importance of high course performance, and course usefulness. Moreover, deep approach adaptation went with higher satisfaction of having accomplished one’s learning goals, but also with stronger feelings of insecurity and stress. Our findings suggest that students’ CA perceptions are meaningful predictors of learning approach adaptation that might eventually be developed into indicators of the effectiveness of CA implementation at the course level.","Stamov Roßnagel, Christian; Lo Baido, Katrin; Fitzallen, Noleine",PLoS One,37,1

The aim was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys, separated by one month, performed in Spain. METHODS: : Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. RESULTS: : There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales, and daily physical activity to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. CONCLUSIONS: : Results indicated a temporal increase of anxiety, depression and stress scores during the COVID-19 lockdown. Factors such as age, consumption of information about COVID-19 and physical activity seem to have an important impact on the evolution of psychological symptoms.","Planchuelo-Gómez, Álvaro; Odriozola-González, Paula; Irurtia, María Jesús; de Luis-García, Rodrigo",J Affect Disord,37,22

These proteins are involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and refolding of damaged or misfolded proteins. Recent studies have been focused on the regulatory role of HSPs in OS and ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) where reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role. ROS perform many functions, including cell signaling. Unfortunately, they are also the cause of pathological processes leading to various diseases. Biological pathways such as p38 MAPK, HSP70 and Akt/GSK-3β/eNOS, HSP70, JAK2/STAT3 or PI3K/Akt/HSP70, and HSF1/Nrf2-Keap1 are considered in the relationship between HSP and OS. New pathophysiological mechanisms involving ROS are being discovered and described the protein network of HSP interactions. Understanding of the mechanisms involved, e.g., in I/R, is important to the development of treatment methods. HSPs are multifunctional proteins because they closely interact with the antioxidant and the nitric oxide generation systems, such as HSP70/HSP90/NOS. A deficiency or excess of antioxidants modulates the activation of HSF and subsequent HSP biosynthesis. It is well known that HSPs are involved in the regulation of several redox processes and play an important role in protein-protein interactions. The latest research focuses on determining the role of HSPs in OS, their antioxidant activity, and the possibility of using HSPs in the treatment of I/R consequences. Physical exercises are important in patients with cardiovascular diseases, as they affect the expression of HSPs and the development of OS.","Szyller, Jakub; Bil-Lula, Iwona",Oxid Med Cell Longev,37,1

Many available tests lack rigorous evaluation and therefore results may be misleading. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay. METHODS: A multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019. RESULTS: The specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4 % and sensitivity of 96.2 % for samples taken 14 days and 97.9 % for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay. CONCLUSION: Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay which can also measure antibody functionality.","Johnson, Marina; Wagstaffe, Helen R.; Gilmour, Kimberly C.; Mai, Annabelle Lea; Lewis, Joanna; Hunt, Adam; Sirr, Jake; Bengt, Christopher; Grandjean, Louis; Goldblatt, David",J Clin Virol,37,20

The present study seeks to estimate social gradients in COVID-19 hospitalisations, intensive care admissions and death by education, income and country of birth, while taking into account disparities in comorbidities. METHODS: We used a register-based retrospective open cohort design enrolling all 74 659 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive cases aged >25 years in Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic (until 14 September 2020). Information was retrieved from multiple registers and linked by the unique Swedish personal identity number concerning COVID-19 case identification; COVID-19 hospitalisations, intensive care admissions and death; comorbidities as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index; and sociodemographic information. Social gradients were estimated by the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) using Cox regression. RESULTS: Adjusted analyses showed significant social gradients in COVID-19 hospitalisation, intensive care admission, across education, income and country of birth, which were unaffected by adjustment for comorbidities. Education and country of birth gradients were stronger for hospitalisation and intensive care admissions but small to non-existent for death. In contrast, income gradients were consistent across all three COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Social gradients in severe COVID-19 outcomes are widespread in Sweden, but appear to be unrelated to pre-existing health disparities. Inequitable outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection may therefore be at least partially avoidable and could rely on equitable management of confirmed COVID-19 cases.","Gustafsson, Per E.; San Sebastian, Miguel; Fonseca-Rodriguez, Osvaldo; Fors Connolly, Anne-Marie",J Epidemiol Community Health,37,1

An important means to unraveling the complexities of disaster management is to recognize the interdependencies between health care and broader social systems and how they intersect to promote health and resilience before, during and after a crisis. While recent literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters at the macro level, few studies have examined empirically how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure at the micro level influence community capacity. The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters, to determine levers for action where interventions can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience. A community-based participatory research design was used in nine focus group consultations (n = 143) held in five communities in Canada, between October 2010 and March 2011, using the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. The findings underscore the importance of interconnectedness of hard and soft systems at the micro level, with culture providing the backdrop for the social fabric of each community. Open coding drawing upon the tenets of complexity theory was used to develop four core themes that provide structure for the framework that evolved; they relate to dynamic context, situational awareness and connectedness, flexible planning, and collaboration, which are needed to foster adaptive responses to disasters. Seven action recommendations are presented, to promote community resilience and population health.","O'Sullivan, Tracey L.; Kuziemsky, Craig E.; Toal-Sullivan, Darene; Corneil, Wayne",Soc Sci Med,37,20

In this study, we aimed to assess long-standing symptoms (LS) (symptoms lasting from the time of discharge) in previously hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and assess associated risk factors. Methods This is a longitudinal cohort study of adults (18 years of age and above) with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Sechenov University Hospital Network in Moscow, Russia. Data were collected from patients discharged between April 8 and July 10, 2020. Participants were interviewed via telephone using Tier 1 ISARIC Long-term Follow-up Study CRF and the WHO CRF for Post COVID conditions. Reported symptoms were further categorised based on the system(s) involved. Additional information on dyspnoea, quality of life and fatigue was collected using validated instruments. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to investigate risk factors for development of LS categories. Findings Overall, 2,649 of 4,755 patients discharged from the hospitals were available for the follow-up and included in the study. The median age of the patients was 56 years (IQR, 46-66) and 1,353 (51.1%) were women. The median follow-up time since hospital discharge was 217.5 (200.4-235.5) days. At the time of the follow-up interview 1247 (47.1%) participants reported LS. Fatigue (21.2%, 551/2599), shortness of breath (14.5%, 378/2614) and forgetfulness (9.1%, 237/2597) were the most common LS reported. Chronic fatigue (25%, 658/2593) and respiratory (17.2% 451/2616) were the most common LS categories. with reporting of multi-system involvement (MSI) less common (11.3%; 299). Female sex was associated with LS categories of chronic fatigue with an odds ratio of 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.02), neurological (2.03, 1.60 to 2.58), mood and behaviour (1.83, 1.41 to 2.40), dermatological (3.26, 2.36 to 4.57), gastrointestinal (2.50, 1.64 to 3.89), sensory (1.73, 2.06 to 2.89) and respiratory (1.31, 1.06 to 1.62).

Interpretation 6 to 8 months after acute infection episode almost a half of patients experience symptoms lasting since hospital discharge. One in ten individuals experiences MSI. Female sex is the main risk factor for majority of the LS categories. chronic pulmonary disease is associated with a higher risk of chronic fatigue development, and asthma with neurological and mood and behaviour changes. Individuals with LS and MSI should be the main target for future research and intervention strategies.","Munblit, D.; Bobkova, P.; Spiridonova, E.; Shikhaleva, A.; Gamirova, A.; Blyuss, O.; Nekliudov, N.

The PUPPY Study (Problems Coordinating and Accessing Primary Care for Attached and Unattached Patients Exacerbated During the COVID-19 Pandemic Year) seeks to understand the impact of COVID-19 across the quadruple aim of primary care, with particular focus on the impacts on patients without attachment to a regular provider and those with chronic health conditions. OBJECTIVE: The PUPPY Study objective is to understand the impact of COVID-19 across the quadruple aim of primary care. METHODS: The PUPPY study builds on an existing research program exploring patients' access and attachment to primary care, pivoted to adapt to the emerging COVID-19 context. We will undertake a longitudinal mixed methods study to understand critical gaps in primary care access and coordination, comparing data pre- and post-pandemic in three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Nova Scotia). Multiple data sources will be used including: a policy review; qualitative interviews with primary care policymakers, providers (i.e., family physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists), and patients (N=120); and medication prescribing and healthcare billings. The findings will inform the strengthening of primary care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our model, that we call SUDR+K, grounds on the usual SIR model, with the difference of splitting the total fraction of infected individuals in two components: patients that are still undetected and patients that have been already detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly, we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change of the testing rate around the bi-stable point can determine a fluctuation of the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to develop quantitative models of testing process.","Zlatić, Vinko; Barjašić, Irena; Kadović, Andrea; Štefančić, Hrvoje; Gabrielli, Andrea",Nonlinear Dyn,37,21
