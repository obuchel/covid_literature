However, no animal model has been developed for ARDS caused by infection with 2009 H1N1 virus. Here, we present a mouse model of ARDS induced by 2009 H1N1 virus. METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were inoculated with A/swine/Shandong/731/2009 (SD/09), which was a 2009 H1N1 influenza variant with a G222D mutation in the hemagglutinin. Clinical symptoms were recorded every day. Lung injury was assessed by lung water content and histopathological observation. Arterial blood gas, leukocyte count in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and blood, virus titers, and cytokine levels in the lung were measured at various times post-inoculation. Mice infected with SD/09 virus showed typical ARDS symptoms characterized by 60% lethality on days 8–10 post-inoculation, highly edematous lungs, inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema, lung hemorrhage, progressive and severe hypoxemia, and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggested that we successfully established an ARDS mouse model induced by a virulent 2009 H1N1 variant without previous adaptation, which may be of benefit for evaluating the pathogenesis or therapy of human ARDS caused by 2009 H1N1 virus.","Zhang, Yi; Sun, Honglei; Fan, Lihong; Ma, Yuan; Sun, Yipeng; Pu, Juan; Yang, Jun; Qiao, Jian; Ma, Guangpeng; Liu, Jinhua",PLoS One,229,9

RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately half of all hypertensive patients have not achieved goal blood pressure with current available antihypertensive medications. Recent landmark studies and new hypertension guidelines have called for stricter blood pressure control, creating a need for better strategies for lowering blood pressure. This has led to a shift in focus, in recent years, to the development of combination pills as a means of achieving improved blood pressure control by increasing adherence to prescribed medications along with further research and development of promising novel drugs based on discovery of new molecular targets such as the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin system. SUMMARY: Fixed-dose combination pills and novel treatments based on recently discovered pathogenic mechanisms of hypertension that have demonstrated promising results as treatments for hypertension and related comorbidities will be discussed in this review.","Davis, Jared; Oparil, Suzanne",Curr Hypertens Rep,229,12

Recent data show that CF recipients oflung transplantation have survival as good as those of any other diagnostic group. After transplantation, CF patients confront the major threats to life and health of graft infection and rejection. Inflammation is the common mediator of injury to the lung in both these instances. Graft infection after lung transplantation involves the same micro-organismsas are typical with CF as well as opportunistic agents. Prophylactic strategies and aggressive diagnosis via bronchoscopy are both critical in the effective treatment of post-transplant lung infections. Graft rejection involves the detection and recognition of foreign antigen and the subsequent activation of specific T-lymphocyte clones leading to inflammatory injury to the donor organ. Immunosuppression is used to prevent and/or modulate host response to the donor organ and titrated to serum therapeutic drug monitoring and transbronchial biopsy findings. Precise clinical monitoring and aggressive diagnostic approaches are crucial to minimizing graft injury and aggressive diagnostic approaches are crucial to minimizing graft injury and enhancing life after transplantation. Although most CF lung transplant recipients experience both graft infection and rejection and the 5-yr survival rate remains at approx 50%, improvement in diagnosis and therapy continue over time. With the introduction of new approaches to antimicrobial therapy, new immunosuppressant agents and promising strategies to promote immune tolerance, survival after lung transplantation is likely to improve in the coming decades.","Mallory, George B.",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,229,9

The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders affecting fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney and liver. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction, hyperammonaemia and often cardiac dysfunction. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. The phenotypic diversity encountered in defects of fat oxidation is partly explained by genotype/phenotype correlation and certain identifiable environmental factors but there remain many unresolved questions regarding the complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences that dictate phenotypic expression. It is becoming increasingly clear that the view that most inherited disorders are purely monogenic diseases is a naive concept. In the future our approach to understanding the phenotypic diversity and management of patients will be more realistically achieved from a polygenic perspective.","Olpin, Simon E",J Inherit Metab Dis,229,9

Community-acquired BSIs in immunocompetent adults usually involve drug-susceptible bacteria, while healthcare-associated BSIs are frequently due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Early adequate antimicrobial therapy is a key to improve patient outcomes, especially in those with criteria for sepsis or septic shock, and should be based on guidelines and direct examination of available samples. Local epidemiology, suspected source, immune status, previous antimicrobial exposure, and documented colonization with MDR bacteria must be considered for the choice of first-line antimicrobials in healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired BSIs. Early genotypic or phenotypic tests are now available for bacterial identification and early detection of resistance mechanisms and may help, though their clinical impact warrants further investigations. Initial antimicrobial dosing should take into account the pharmacokinetic alterations commonly observed in ICU patients, with a loading dose in case of sepsis or septic shock. Initial antimicrobial combination attempting to increase the antimicrobial spectrum should be discussed when MDR bacteria are suspected and/or in the most severely ill patients. Source identification and control should be performed as soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized. De-escalation from a broad-spectrum to a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial may reduce antibiotic selection pressure without negative impact on mortality. The duration of therapy is usually 5–8 days though longer durations may be discussed depending on the underlying illness and the source of infection. This narrative review covers the epidemiology, diagnostic workflow and therapeutic aspects of BSI in ICU patients and proposed up-to-date expert statements.","Timsit, Jean-François; Ruppé, Etienne; Barbier, François; Tabah, Alexis; Bassetti, Matteo",Intensive Care Med,229,0

Accurate characterization is often the factor that can accelerate the translational approaches of nanomedicines and their pharmaceutical development to reach the clinic faster. We conducted a case study involving the adsorption of the NFL-TBS.40–63 (NFL) peptide (derived from neurofilaments) to the surface of lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) (a combined nanosystem used to target glioblastoma cells) to develop an analytical approach combining the separation and the quantification in a single step, leading to the characterization of the proportion of free peptide and thus the proportion of peptide adsorbed to the lipid nanocapsule surface. METHODS: LNC suspensions, NFL peptide solution and LNC/NFL peptide mixtures were characterized using a Size-Exclusion Chromatography method (with a chromatographic apparatus). In addition, this method was compared to centrifugal-filtration devices, currently used in literature for this case study. RESULTS: Combining the steps for separation and characterization in one single sequence improved the accuracy and robustness of the data and led to reproducible results. Moreover the data deviation observed for the centrifugal-filtration devices demonstrated the limits for this increasingly used characterization approach, explained by the poor separation quality and highlighting the importance for the method optimization. The high potential of the technique was shown, proving that H-bond and/or electrostatic interactions mediate adsorption of the NFL peptide to the surface of LNCs. CONCLUSIONS: Used only as a characterization tool, the process using chromatographic apparatus is less time and solvent consuming than classical Size-Exclusion Chromatography columns only used for separation. It could be a promising tool for the scientific community for characterizing the interactions of other combinations of nanosystems and active biological agents.

In sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA) where most YLWH reside, there are limited summary data on CMDs among these youths, yet there are previous systematic reviews summarizing data on CMDs among adults living with HIV. We conducted a systematic literature review on the prevalence and correlates of CMDs among YLWH, aged 10 to 24 years, from SSA. METHODS: We searched African Index Medicus, African Journals Online and five other electronic databases (from database inception up to 31 December 2020) for relevant studies published in English. The key search terms applied were as follows: “Depression OR Anxiety”, “Young people”, “HIV infections” and “sub‐Saharan Africa”. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Out of 3989 articles, 31 studies were included in the review. The prevalence of CMDs in YLWH widely varied ranging between 16.0% and 40.8% for major depression, 4.4% and 52.6% for depressive symptoms and 2.2% and 25.0% for anxiety symptoms. Anxiety disorder was estimated at 45.6%. Four of the five included studies with a comparison group of HIV‐negative young people reported significantly higher prevalence estimates of depressive disorders among YLWH. Several sociodemographic, psychosocial and HIV‐related correlates of CMDs were reported but most lacked consensus across studies. Nevertheless, female sex, older age, fewer schooling years, HIV‐positive status, bullying, sexual abuse, HIV‐related stigma, social support and poor antiretroviral therapy adherence were frequently reported (in ≥2 studies) as significant correlates of depressive symptoms among YLWH. Higher social support was the only frequent significant correlate of anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of CMDs among YLWH from SSA is substantial and appears to be significantly higher when compared with HIV‐negative peers, particularly for depressive disorders. However, more comparative research is needed. Importantly, screening for CMDs at the youth HIV‐clinics should be prioritized especially for YLWH at high risk of CMDs, to facilitate early management or referral for treatment. Furthermore, youth‐friendly psychological interventions addressing CMDs in YLWH should urgently be piloted in SSA, incorporating contextual components that may directly or indirectly reduce symptoms of CMDs among YLWH, such as social support.","Too, Ezra K; Abubakar, Amina; Nasambu, Carophine; Koot, Hans M; Cuijpers, Pim; Newton, Charles RJC; Nyongesa, Moses K",J Int AIDS Soc,229,22

It is related to decision-making, control ability, and social functioning. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a training technique that requires people to work out at full intensity during a short period. Many studies have already shown the potential effects of HIIT on cognitive functions. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the cognitive effects of HIIT on individuals with MA dependence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 240 individuals with MA dependence will be randomly assigned to the HIIT group, moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) group and control (CON) group. HIIT will consist of a 24-min HIIT exercise on a treadmill. MICT will consist of a 1-h body–mind exercise. CON will be their traditional intervention. The experimental period will be 12 months with 3 interventions weekly for the first 6 months and follow-up for the next 6 months. All subjects will be given cognitive tests at baseline, after intervention and at follow-up. Cognitive performances will be compared by a mixed-model analysis for repeated measures. DISCUSSION: HIIT training may reduce illicit drug cravings amongst individuals with MA dependence; hence, HIIT may have a good effect on the cognitive functions, such as memory and executive function, of individuals with MA dependence.

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for this cancer. There are no public awareness and national immunization programs in most Arab countries. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and awareness about the HPV vaccine among females in four Arab countries and their acceptance to receive the vaccine. A cross-sectional study was conducted in several Arab countries: Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iraq. Respondents that fulfilled the desired criteria and were willing to participate in the study were asked to fill out the survey. Knowledge and awareness were assessed using 13 questions. Ethical approvals were given from the four countries. A total of 3658 individuals participated in the study; however, 2804 responses were included in the analysis and more than one third of participants (n = 1007) were aged between 18 and 25 years old. This study revealed poor awareness and knowledge of the participants about HPV and its vaccine among all four countries’ participants with relatively better knowledge among participants from the UAE. Participants who are younger (18–25 years old), have a postgraduate education, have an education or career related to the medical field, or had a Pap smear in the last three years tend to have higher knowledge about the HPV vaccine compared to others. Poor knowledge and awareness findings in this study were expected, considering the lack of public education campaigns regarding the HPV virus coupled with the absence of the HPV vaccination from the national immunization schedule in three participating countries (Jordan, Qatar, and Iraq). It is recommended that there is a need to provide national educational campaigns about the HPV vaccine to the public in all Arab populations.","Alsous, Mervat M.; Ali, Ahlam A.; Al-Azzam, Sayer I.; Abdel Jalil, Mariam H.; Al-Obaidi, Hala J.; Al-abbadi, Esraa I.; Hussain, Zainab K.; Jirjees, Feras J.",Sci Rep,229,10

The objective of this study was to analyze the burden in consequence of stroke. This research used a systematic review method. Furthermore, a search for articles was carried out in June–July 2020. Four databases were used to search articles from 2015 to 2020. Eligible studies were identified, analyzed, and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were prospective cost studies, retrospective cost studies, database analysis, mathematical models, surveys, and COI studies that assess burden of stroke in primary and referral healthcare (hospital-based). The results showed that from four databases, 9270 articles were obtained, and 13 articles were qualified. A total of 9270 articles had the identified search keywords, but only 13 articles met the set criteria for inclusion. The criteria for inclusion were stroke patients, the economic burden of stroke disease based on cost of illness method, which is approximately equal to USD 1809.51–325,108.84 (direct costs 86.2%, and indirect costs 13.8%). Those that used the health expenditure method did not present the total cost; instead, only either direct or indirect cost of health expenditure were reported. For most hospital admissions due to stroke, LOS (length of stay) was the dominant cost. The high economic burden to manage stroke justifies the promotion and preventive efforts by the policymakers and motivates the practice of healthy lifestyles by the people.","Rochmah, Thinni Nurul; Rahmawati, Indana Tri; Dahlui, Maznah; Budiarto, Wasis; Bilqis, Nabilah",Int J Environ Res Public Health,229,1

In the said scenario, this paper will seek to answer the question: Starting from the premises set by the BVerfG in the ruling rendered on February 27th, 2008, are there similar grounds to sustain the existence of an IT Privacy right in Brazil, regarding the Brazilian juridical scenario, mainly as to data protection? To that end, the paper is divided into four main parts to: (i) assess the fundamentals of the decision rendered by the BVerfG in the case mentioned; (ii) present the privacy and data protection legal scenario in Brazil; (iii) point out how information security is provided for in Brazilian legislation; and (iv) validate whether the premises adopted by the BVerfG are also coherent in Brazil, considering the legal landscape presented. The research is based on a hypothetical-deductive method, through inquiry and bibliographic analysis, grounded both in Brazilian and European doctrine. Lastly, the research concludes in the sense that the Brazilian and German Constitutional Legal Orders are different, not only relating to the way in which new fundamental rights are acknowledged, but also in regard to the privacy and data protection legal culture, which directly impacts the feasibility of a fundamental right to confidentiality and integrity of IT systems.","Alberton Coutinho Silva, Cecília",Int,229,2

Fifty-seven heifers were submitted to an ovulation synchronization protocol. This was followed by monitoring the heifers every 12 h over 60 h. Heifers were monitored for rectal and vaginal temperature using a digital thermometer. The surface temperature of the eye, vulva, and muzzle regions were monitored by IRT. Meteorological data was recorded for temperature and humidity. Observation of sexual behavior was performed to monitor estrus onset. Transrectal ultrasonography was used to identify the dominant follicle and confirm ovulation of all heifers. We observed a decrease in temperature of the rectum and vagina, as well as in the eye and vulva regions within the first 12 h after the completion of the synchronization. This period coincides with the expected proestrus phase of the estrous cycle. A progressive increase in all temperatures was noticed in the following 36 h, which coincides with the estrus phase of the reproductive cycle. The regions evaluated around the vulva and eye exhibited the highest temperature and experienced less environmental distortion than the muzzle area thermographs.

MBL deficiency results from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1, and the promoter region of the human MBL2 gene has been found to be associated with susceptibility to a number of infections. However, studies on the interactions between MBL and CMV infection are limited. In this study, we investigated 104 children suffering from HCMV infection, in an effort to find any association between MBL and HCMV infection of children in China. We analyzed the genotypes of 104 HCMV patients and 105 healthy controls, and investigated the distributions of polymorphisms at -550(H/L), -221(Y/X), and +4(P/Q), together with their structural variants. Although there was no significant difference in the distribution of B alleles between HCMV patients and healthy controls, the frequencies of the high-MBL-level related genotype of YA type in HCMV patients were significantly lower than those seen in healthy controls, while low-level related genotypes of XB type were more common in HCMV patients. In addition, CMV-DNA quantification revealed higher viral loads of the XB type in HCMV patients. Thus we can speculate that as an acute response protein and a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system, MBL may play a role in protecting against HCMV infection in children, and MBL gene mutations may be a significant risk factor for the development of infantile HCMV infection.","Hu, Yingzi; Wu, Dingwen; Tao, Ran; Shang, Shiqiang",Viral immunology,229,1

The hospital stay is one of the prognostic indicators, and its predicting model based on CT radiomics features is important for assessing the patients' clinical outcome. The study aimed to develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This retrospective, multicenter study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Lanzhou, Linxia, and Zhenjiang between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. Patients were classified into short-term (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features from pneumonia lesions in first four centers. The predictive performance was evaluated in fifth center (test dataset) on lung lobe- and patients-level. Results A total of 52 patients were enrolled from designated hospitals. As of February 20, 21 patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in analysis. The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in test. The LR and RF model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, 0.75 and 1.0 in test respectively. As of February 28, a prospective cohort of six discharged patients were all correctly recognized as long-term stay using RF and LR models. Conclusions The machine learning-based CT radiomics features and models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Yue, Hongmei; Yu, Qian; Liu, Chuan; Huang, Yifei; Jiang, Zicheng; Shao, Chuxiao; Zhang, Hongguang; Ma, Baoyi; Wang, Yuancheng; Xie, Guanghang; Zhang, Haijun; Li, Xiaoguo; Kang, Ning; Meng, Xiangpan; Huang, Shan; Xu, Dan; Lei, Junqiang; Huang, Huihong; Yang, Jie; Ji, Jiansong; Pan, Hongqiu; Zou, Shengqiang; Ju, Shenghong; Qi, Xiaolong",Annals of translational medicine,229,1

The complexity of the pathophysiologic response to direct or indirect lung injury in ARDS is difficult to reconstruct in experimental conditions. Thus, direct analysis of ARDS patient blood may provide valuable information. We investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles in paired whole blood samples from patients with ARDS (n = 8) during the acute stage (within 3 d of diagnosis) and recovery stage of ARDS (around ICU discharge). Among 126 differentially expressed genes, peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3, encoding elafin, a potent neutrophil elastase inhibitor) had the largest fold-change (-3-fold changes, acute stage/recovery stage) in expression, indicating down-regulation during the acute stage of ARDS. We further examined plasma PI3 levels in 40 patients with ARDS and 23 at-risk control subjects from the same cohort. There was a coincidence of the microarray findings of lower PI3 gene expression with the lower plasma PI3 during the acute-stage. The plasma PI3 levels were statistically significant different among pre-diagnosis, day of diagnosis, and post-diagnosis groups (ANOVA, P = 0.001), with a trend of decreasing from pre- to post-diagnosis group. The time course of plasma PI3 decrease is well correlated with the course of early ARDS development (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.52, P = 0.0006). Considering that PI3 can covalently binding to extracellular matrix in lung, circulating PI3 may provide a useful clinical marker for monitoring the early development of ARDS and may have implications for ARDS treatment.","Wang, Zhaoxi; Beach, Douglas; Su, Li; Zhai, Rihong; Christiani, David C",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,229,31

However, other dimensions and behavioral measures of sleep may also be associated with adiposity. This study evaluated whether multidimensional sleep health calculated from actigraphy and self-report was longitudinally associated with adiposity in a sample of midlife women who have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances and adiposity. DESIGN Longitudinal study with 11-14 years of follow-up time between the sleep health assessment and body mass index / waist-to-hip ratio measurements. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and twenty-one midlife women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. MEASUREMENTS Multidimensional sleep health was quantified using actigraphy (M[SD] = 29.1[7.2] nights) measures of sleep efficiency, midpoint, duration, regularity, and self-report measures of alertness and satisfaction. Each component was dichotomized and summed; higher values indicated better sleep health. Height, body weight, and waist and hip circumference were measured at the sleep study and at follow-up. Linear regression models were used to assess associations between sleep health and adiposity, adjusting for demographic and menopausal covariates. RESULTS There was no substantial within-person change in adiposity over time. Better sleep health was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with lower adiposity in unadjusted, but not in adjusted, models. Individual sleep health components were not associated with adiposity after adjustment. CONCLUSION We did not observe cross-sectional or longitudinal associations between multidimensional sleep health and adiposity. The sleep-adiposity link may be weaker in midlife adults than in other age groups.","Bowman, Marissa A; Brindle, Ryan C; Joffe, Hadine; Kline, Christopher E; Buysse, Daniel J; Appelhans, Bradley M; Kravitz, Howard M; Matthews, Karen A; Neal-Perry, Genevieve S; Krafty, Robert T; Hall, Martica H",Sleep health,229,16

Heparin catheter lock solutions are commonly used to maintain catheter patency, however the incidence of PF remains high. The purpose of the CLOCK Trial was to evaluate two catheter lock solutions on reduction of PF incidence. METHODS Seventy-five CKD 5D patients on high-efficiency hemodialysis at the Integrated Centre of Nephrology (Guarulhos, Brazil) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a lock solution combining minocycline 3 mg/mL with the anticoagulant/chelation agent EDTA 30 mg/mL (M-EDTA) or heparin 1000 IU/mL (H) or trisodium citrate 30% (TSC) vs. Hfor 15 weeks. A total of 68 patients completed the trial in which both investigators and patients were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary end-point was the occurrence of hydraulic resistance and secondary safety end-point was adverse drug reactions related to the lock solutions. FINDINGS At the beginning of the trial, 7 patients were excluded from this trial due to their poor catheter care. The incidence of hydraulic resistance was significantly higher among patients on H (18/23) compared to TSC (4/22) and M-EDTA (2/23) lock solutions, (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION The CLOCK Trial suggests TSC and M-EDTA may preserve catheter patency better than H. TSC may be a better option due the lack of association with long-term antimicrobial resistance.","Luiz, Marcus V S João; Scavone, Cristoforo; Tzanno, Carmen",Hemodialysis international.

ACE2 is one of the key enzymes in renin-angiotensin system and plays a vital role in the maintenance of cardiovascular function. ACE/ACE2 balance is critical in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis, vascular and cardiac remodeling and inflammation. ACE2 was shown to be abundantly present in human epithelial cells of the lung and enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in endothelial cells of the arterial and venous vessels. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized on the cell surface and produced a critical step host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2-cleaved ACE2 permits SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry however, ADAM17-cleaved ACE2 produces protective effects in several organs. Differently, basigin (CD147) was suggested as a putative alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into endothelial cells. The intestinal ACE2 receptor is associated with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and ACE2 is necessary for the expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. There is a good association between the localization of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the disease target organs in respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Decreased expression of ACE2, being a receptor for coronavirus, would prevent cellular entry of the virus thereby reducing progression of the infection. However, increased ACE2 expression produces beneficial health effects. Further studies are needed to clarify this conflicting situation. Currently, it is recommended to continue the therapy with ACE2-increasing drugs in patients with COVID-19.","Guney, Ceren; Akar, Fatma","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",229,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS During a 1-year period, RFA was performed in 18 benign solid thyroid nodules in 17 patients. EA was subsequently performed on 8 of these nodules. The success rate of EA, size and vascularity of the remaining solid components, amount of injected ethanol, degree of intranodular echo staining just after ethanol injection, and number of EA sessions were assessed. RESULTS Of 18 post-RFA nodules, 8 nodules were subsequently treated with EA because of incomplete ablation, as defined by the presence of peripherally located vascularized solid components. On follow-up US, 2 nodules showed marked hypoechogenicity and no vascularity of the remaining solid components, while 3 nodules showed considerably decreased echogenicity and vascularity of the remaining solid components. Three nodules showed no significant decrease or mild decrease in the echogenicity and vascularity of the remaining solid components.

The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among health care workers during and after the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS We conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study involving health care workers in Ontario, Canada, to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Blood samples and self-reported questionnaires were obtained at enrolment, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. A community hospital, tertiary care pediatric hospital and a combined adult-pediatric academic health centre enrolled participants from Apr. 1 to Nov. 13, 2020. Predictors of seropositivity were evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for clustering by hospital site. RESULTS Among the 1062 health care workers participating, the median age was 40 years, and 834 (78.5%) were female. Overall, 57 (5.4%) were seropositive at any time point (2.5% when participants with prior infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing were excluded). Seroprevalence was higher among those who had a known unprotected exposure to a patient with COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and those who had been contacted by public health because of a nonhospital exposure (p = 0.003). Providing direct care to patients with COVID-19 or working on a unit with a COVID-19 outbreak was not associated with higher seroprevalence. In multivariable logistic regression, presence of symptomatic contacts in the household was the strongest predictor of seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio 7.15, 95% confidence interval 5.42-9.41).

METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2007-2011) was utilized to analyze outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing colorectal surgery. Main outcomes were risk-adjusted inpatient morbidity, mortality, hospital charge, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 6490 patients were identified. Utilization of laparoscopic surgery in Parkinson's patients has progressively increased in frequency over the latest 5 years analyzed. The most common diagnoses were colorectal malignancy (39 %) and intestinal obstruction (20 %). Right hemicolectomy (37 %) and sigmoidectomy (30 %) were the most common operations. Laparoscopy was used in 18 % of Parkinson's patients and most commonly in the elective setting. 54.3 % of Parkinson's patients had emergency surgery compared to 38.6 % in non-Parkinson's. Overall morbidity and mortality were significantly lower after laparoscopic surgery compared to open (20 vs. 25 % and 2.1 vs. 6.6 %, respectively). Length of stay was significantly shorter (OR -1.86; p < 0.01) for laparoscopic operations, but there were no significant differences in risk-adjusted outcomes between laparoscopic and open groups. CONCLUSION PD patients have high rates of morbidity and mortality after colorectal surgery; this may be because more than half of all patients in this population undergo emergent surgery. The laparoscopic approach appears to have short-term benefits in this patient population.","Hwang, Grace S; Young, Monica T; Hanna, Mark H; Menon, Gopal; Phelan, Michael; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Stamos, Michael J; Hermanowicz, Neal; Pigazzi, Alessio",International journal of colorectal disease,229,17

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo experiment. ANIMALS Stifles (n = 6). Horses (n = 4). METHODS Stifle joints were axially loaded to 1800 N at 155°, 145°, and 130°, under 3 conditions: Intact, MFC with a 15 mm circular osteochondral defect, and with a transcondylar screw inserted in lag fashion through the defect. An electronic pressure sensor (Tekscan®) on the medial tibial plateau recorded contact area, force, peak pressure, and contact maps. Stress load (N/cm(2) ) was calculated for the entire medial plateau and in 3 sub-regions; cranial, caudal, and central. Significance was set at P ≤ .05. RESULTS Flexion increased force, contact area, and stress load for all conditions. An MFC defect significantly reduced force at both flexion angles and contact area at 145°. The transcondylar screw returned force to intact values at 130° and reduced contact area in extension. Intact MFC contact maps revealed pressure peaks on the central cartilage at all angles and contact pressure and area expansion and caudal movement with flexion. Contact maps with an MFC defect amplified the caudal and abaxial pressure movement during flexion, and the screw did not further change them. CONCLUSIONS Stifle flexion increases force, contact area, and stress load on the medial tibial plateau and is most pronounced caudally. An MFC defect alters load on the medial tibial plateau, and a transcondylar screw may reverse some of those changes.","Bonilla, Alvaro G; Williams, Jarred M; Litsky, Alan S; Santschi, Elizabeth M",Veterinary surgery : VS,229,1

Such studies are now underway amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. While traditional case-control and test-negative design studies feature prominently among strategies used to assess vaccine effectiveness, such studies may encounter important threats to validity. Here we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, non-specific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources. We suggest practical strategies to reduce bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates at the study design and analysis stages.","Lewnard, Joseph A; Patel, Manish M; Jewell, Nicholas P; Verani, Jennifer R; Kobayashi, Miwako; Tenforde, Mark W; Dean, Natalie E; Cowling, Benjamin J; Lopman, Benjamin A",Epidemiology,229,1

METHODS Over a 6-month period, GME activity was monitored in 102 Euroscore 6+ patients during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with a conventional 32-micron arterial filter by non-invasive, real-time ultrasonic device. Cognitive tests; line bisection, the Stroop test, finger tapping, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test were performed at baseline, postoperative one week and postoperative one month. RESULTS The distribution of GME activity showed that there were three groups of patients: >500 total emboli (n = 38); 250 to 500 emboli (n = 30) and <250 emboli (n = 34) at a detection level of 2% of the circuit diameter on the arterial side. Line bisection, the Stroop test and finger tapping were impaired significantly in >500 emboli patients versus control (<250 emboli) in postoperative week one, but resolved in one month. CONCLUSIONS Correlation between intraoperative GME intensity and neurocognitive tests suggests that the level of GME might have a role in determining the psychological outcome after CABG with CPB.","Doganci, S; Gunaydin, S; Kocak, O Murat; Yilmaz, S; Demirkilic, U",Perfusion,229,16

We assessed the potential for variations in urine flow and arterial PO2 (aPO2 ) to confound these estimates. METHODS In 28 sheep urine flow, uPO2 , aPO2 and mPO2 were measured during development of septic AKI. In 65 human patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) uPO2 and aPO2 were measured continuously during CPB, and in a subset of 20 patients, urine flow was estimated every 5 minutes. RESULTS In conscious sheep breathing room air, uPO2 was more closely correlated with mPO2 than with aPO2 or urine flow. The difference between mPO2 and uPO2 varied little with urine flow or aPO2 . In patients, urine flow increased abruptly from 3.42 ± 0.29 mL min-1 to 6.94 ± 0.26 mL min-1 upon commencement of CPB, usually coincident with reduced uPO2 . During hyperoxic CPB high values of uPO2 were often observed at low urine flow. Low urinary PO2 during CPB (<10 mm Hg at any time during CPB) was associated with greater (4.5-fold) risk of AKI. However, low urine flow during CPB was not significantly associated with risk of AKI. CONCLUSIONS uPO2 provides a robust estimate of mPO2 , but this relationship is confounded by the simultaneous presence of systemic hyperoxia and low urine flow. Urine flow increases and uPO2 decreases during CPB. Thus, CPB is probably the best time to use uPO2 to detect renal medullary hypoxia and risk of post-operative AKI.","Ngo, Jennifer P; Lankadeva, Yugeesh R; Zhu, Michael Z L; Martin, Andrew; Kanki, Monica; Cochrane, Andrew D; Smith, Julian A; Thrift, Amanda G; May, Clive N; Evans, Roger G",Acta physiologica,229,1

Most cases require mesh excision and complex abdominal wall reconstruction, with variable success rates. We report two cases of mesh salvage with a novel use of percutaneous drainage and antibiotic irrigation. CASES Two patients developed infected seromas after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. One patient with a remote history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) mesh infection underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with a 20 x 23-cm piece of Parietex composite mesh. Two weeks post-operatively, he developed fevers and MRSA was aspirated from the seroma. Another patient had a 32 x 33-cm piece of ePTFE placed for repair. He subsequently developed a massive seroma requiring repeated aspirations. Four months following the repair, he developed an infected seroma with Klebsiella pneumonia. Each patient underwent percutaneous drainage of their abscesses with a six-French-pigtail catheter under ultrasound guidance. After 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics and clinical resolution, the patients were placed on 4 weeks of gentamicin irrigations (80 mg in 30 cc solution) via the drain three times per day. Once therapy was completed, the drains were removed. The first patient also remains on daily oral doxycycline for suppression for his MRSA. Both patients have remained free of clinical signs of infection at 12 and 16 months, respectively, following the completion of therapy. CONCLUSION Percutaneous drainage followed by antibiotic irrigation is a potential alternative to prosthetic removal when treating infected mesh in carefully selected patients.","Trunzo, J A; Ponsky, J L; Jin, J; Williams, C P; Rosen, M J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,229,33

METHODS An online survey of Fellows of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was conducted in July 2016. It comprised questions on personal attributes, type of work, site and cause of WRMI, if any and treatment required. RESULTS We received responses from 765 O&Gs giving a response rate of 38.3% (765/1997). Four hundred and ten specialists (53.6%) reported suffering a WRMI at some point, including 252 (32.9%) who reported multiple injuries. In multivariable analysis, females had increased risk of WRMI (odds ratio (OR): 2.12; 95% CI: 1.54-2.91) and among generalists and subspecialists, gynaecological oncologists had highest risk for WRMI (OR: 3.13; 95% CI: 1.21-8.14). Commonest sites of injury were back (218/633, 34.4%) and shoulder (131/633, 20.7%). Laparoscopic surgery (117/633, 18.5%) was the commonest cause of injury.

This study examines a case of clustering that occurred in a courtroom, in which 5 of the 10 participants were tested positive within days of the hearing. Ventilation loss rates and dispersion of fine aerosols were measured through CO2 injections and lactose aerosol generation. Emission rate and influencing parameters were then computed using a well-mixed dispersion model. The emission rate from the index case was estimated at 130 quanta h-1 (interquartile (97-155 quanta h-1 ). Measured lactose concentrations in the room were found relatively homogenous (n = 8, mean 336 µg m-3 , SD = 39 µg m-3 ). Air renewal was found to play an important role for event durations greater than 0.5 h and loss rate below 2-3 h-1 . The estimated emission rate suggests a high viral load in the index case and/or a high SARS-CoV-2 infection coefficient. High probabilities of infection in similar indoor situations are related to unfavorable conditions of ventilation, emission rate, and event durations.

METHODS Using a large multi-center electronic health record network, we conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with SARDs diagnosed with COVID-19 (identified by diagnostic code or positive molecular test) versus non-SARD comparators with COVID-19, matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (primary model) and comorbidities and health care utilization (extended model). Thirty-day outcomes were assessed, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (ARF), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. RESULTS We initially identified 2,379 SARD patients with COVID-19 (mean age 58 years, 79% female) and 142,750 comparators (mean age 47 years, 54% female). In the primary matched model (2,379 SARD patients and 2,379 matched non-SARD comparators with COVID-19), SARD patients had significantly higher risks of hospitalization (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.26), ICU admission (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.68), ARF (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.07), and VTE (RR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.45) versus comparators but did not have significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation or death. In the extended model, all risks were largely attenuated except risk of VTE (RR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.25). CONCLUSIONS SARD patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, ARF, and VTE versus matched comparators.

However, to understand how honest begging behaviour is evolutionarily maintained in nature, the long-term cost-benefit output associated with exaggerated signals should also be estimated. As far as we know, the net cost-benefit balance of begging display has not previously been explored. Here, we used an appetite stimulant, cyproheptadine hydrochloride, to increase the feeling of hunger in some magpie nestlings. Supporting the use of cyproheptadine to manipulate hunger level and thereby begging behaviour, we found that experimental nestlings increased the frequency of begging and received more food than their control nestmates. Contrary to the expectation that physiological costs per se counteract the associated benefits of escalated begging signals, we found that near-fledging experimental magpies showed a better physical condition than control nestlings. These findings stress the interesting question of why magpie nestlings do not show to adults an escalated level of hunger if it implies an advantage.

Our objective was to evaluate the propensity of a population of Italian women to receive the vaccine and its psychological impact. METHODS A prospective, observational study was performed on pregnant women attending Ospedale Cristo Re Università Roma TorVergata. A multi-section questionnaire was sent to each included woman on the first day of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Part-A was finalized to acquire maternal characteristics and to test the women's perception of vaccinations in pregnancy and their fear-induced by vaccines. Part-B included the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) a validated test for scoring trait anxiety (basal anxiety, STAI-T) and state anxiety (STAI-S). An abnormal value of STAI was considered when ≥40. Comparisons of maternal variables were performed according to their vaccine attitude. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 161 women (80.5% of the population considered). A positive attitude toward the vaccine was present in 136 (84.5%) women (positive) while the remaining 25.5% considered the vaccine not useful (negative). Among the former group 52.9% were favorable to obtain the vaccine during pregnancy despite the current national limitations, a percentage significantly higher (p = .02) than in the negative groups. Women with a negative attitude to the vaccine had a lower educational (p = .002) and employment level (p = .016) when compared to the positive group. In all the women a significant increase of STAI-S from STAI-T values was evidenced (p < .0001).

RESULTS Most patients were men (87%) with high frequency of diabetes mellitus (42%) and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (36%). The CTO target vessel was the right coronary (59%), left anterior descending (20%), or circumflex (17%) artery. TR access was used in 110 (17%) of the 650 cases, as follows: bilateral radial access (63%); bilateral radial access plus unilateral or bilateral femoral access (7%); unilateral radial access plus unilateral or bilateral femoral access (26%); and unilateral radial access (4%). Six and eight French guide catheters were used through the radial and femoral artery, respectively. Compared to transfemoral, transradial cases had similar technical (92.6% vs. 93.0%, P = 0.87) and procedural (91.1% vs. 90.0%, P = 0.95) success and major complication rates (1.7% vs 1.8%, P = 0.99).

A principal components-based analytic framework was employed to evaluate pathway-level and gene-level associations with disease risk. RESULTS We identified a significant signal for the COX pathway in relation to BE risk (p=0.0059, false discovery rate q=0.03), and in gene-level analyses found an association with microsomal glutathione-S-transferase 1 (MGST1); (p=0.0005, q=0.005). Assessment of 36 MGST1 SNPs identified 14 variants associated with elevated BE risk (q<0.05). Four of these were subsequently confirmed (p<5.5×10-5) in a meta-analysis encompassing an independent set of 1851 BE cases and 3496 controls, and are known strong expression quantitative trait loci for MGST1. Three such variants were associated with similar elevations in OA risk. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the most comprehensive evaluation of inflammation-related germline variation in relation to risk of BE/OA and suggests that variants in MGST1 influence disease susceptibility.","Buas, Matthew F; He, Qianchuan; Johnson, Lisa G; Onstad, Lynn; Levine, David M; Thrift, Aaron P; Gharahkhani, Puya; Palles, Claire; Lagergren, Jesper; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C; Ye, Weimin; Caldas, Carlos; Bird, Nigel C; Shaheen, Nicholas J; Bernstein, Leslie; Gammon, Marilie D; Wu, Anna H; Hardie, Laura J; Pharoah, Paul D; Liu, Geoffrey; Iyer, Prassad; Corley, Douglas A; Risch, Harvey A; Chow, Wong-Ho; Prenen, Hans; Chegwidden, Laura; Love, Sharon; Attwood, Stephen; Moayyedi, Paul; MacDonald, David; Harrison, Rebecca; Watson, Peter; Barr, Hugh; deCaestecker, John; Tomlinson, Ian; Jankowski, Janusz; Whiteman, David C; MacGregor, Stuart; Vaughan, Thomas L; Madeleine, Margaret M",Gut,229,6

In the last number of years, the number of studies on MP has grown quickly due to the increasing consciousness of the potential risks for human health related to MP exposure. The present review article discusses scientific literature regarding MP occurrence and accumulation on the aquatic compartment (river, lake, wastewater, seafood), the analytical methods used to assess their concentration, their fate and transport to humans, and delineates the urgent areas for future research. To better analogize literature data regarding MP occurrence in the aquatic compartment we subdivided papers based on sampling, analytical methods, and concentration units with the aim to help the reader identify the similarities and differences of the considered research papers, thus making the comparison of literature data easier and the individuation of the most relevant articles for the reader’s interests faster. Furthermore, we argued about several ways for MP transport to humans, highlighting some gaps in analytical methods based on the reviewed publications. We suggest improving studies on developing standardized protocols to collect, process, and analyze samples.","Ricciardi, Maria Pironti Concetta Motta Oriana Miele Ylenia Proto Antonio Montano Luigi",Water,229,22

Nevertheless, no remarkable excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 has been observed. Object: We sought to quantify excess mortality in April using the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) model. Method: We applied the NIID model to deaths of all causes from 1987 through February, 2021 for all of Japan and through October for Tokyo. Results: Results obtained for Japan show very few excess mortality cases in August and October, 2020, estimated respectively as 12 and 104. However, in Tokyo, 595 cases of excess mortality were detected during August and October: they were, respectively, 3.1% and 1.7% of baseline numbers.

However, according to recent reports it can affect immunocompetent hosts with severe influenza infection due to viral-dependent disruption of respiratory immune defenses. We present the case of a 61-year-old Caucasian man admitted to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and fever, who was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and IPA. Because of his poor general conditions, he was treated with a double antifungal scheme, although this lies outside the suggested treatment guidelines. This choice turned out to be extremely effective. He was discharged after one month and his clinical conditions showed rapid improvement, with nearly complete normalization of the radiological pattern in three months. IPA remains a life-threatening condition, even in immunocompetent hosts, and should therefore always be suspected; if necessary, a combined treatment should rapidly be started. We report this case as the interest in influenza-associated IPA is high, both due to the clinical severity of this condition, which is treatable if identified early, and the emerging importance of respiratory infections caused by viruses belonging to the SARS family, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Saccaro, Luigi Francesco; Galfo, Valentina; Ferranti, Simone; Russo, Alessandro; Menichetti, Francesco",Le infezioni in medicina,229,1

This caused reactivation of latent Pneumocystis carinii infection, manifest as P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) of varying severity. Rats were euthanized after 9-12 wk of immunosuppression. An assessment of the severity of the induced PCP was made, based on the total number of organisms extracted from the lungs and their ability to proliferate in short-term cell culture. Serum samples obtained at sacrifice were tested by indirect immunofluorescence for antibodies to coronavirus, parvovirus, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. A total of 60 rats were examined. Thirty-four of these (57%) developed moderate or severe PCP. No antibodies were detected to either coronavirus or Mycoplasma pulmonis in any of the rats. Although antibodies were detected to parvovirus in 13/60 (22%), to PVM in 29/60 (48%), and to Sendai virus in 47/60 (78%), there was no apparent correlation between the presence or absence of antibodies to these agents and the severity of PCP.

Bats are reservoir to viruses causing Ebola virus diseases (EBV) (Leroy et al., 2005), Nipah Encephalitis (NiV) (Chua et al., 2002), SARS(Li et al., 2005) and MERS-CoV (Yang et al., 2015) being the latest one making headlines. About 18 years ago, a major outbreak of Nipah virus encephalitis occurred in Peninsular Malaysia resulted in the deaths of 105 persons and the slaughter of approximately 1.1 million pigs. In 2006, a novel bat orthoreovirus was found to be associated with acute respiratory syndrome in Malaysia. Following that incidents, many studies have been done on bats, particularly to determine their species, behaviour, and antibody level and there were also studies in human on antibody prevalence to batsrelated viruses e.g. Nipah and Hendra and PRV. Humans may become infected with viruses from bats through intermediate host (swine, horse) or through aerosol or direct contact with bats. Communities living adjacent to bat roosts should aware of possible risk of infection transmission from bats. An earlier study in Guatemala demonstrated that risk of exposure to bats in communities near bats roosts was common, but recognition of the potential for disease transmission from bats was low (Moran et al., 2015). Surprisingly, there is no local published data on public awareness towards bats-related infection despite potential risk of getting the infection. This study aimed to determine knowledge and awareness on bat-related infections, attitudes towards bats and practices related to health-seeking behaviours following exposure to bats.","Mohamed, N A; Said, M H; Mohd Rani, M D; Ramli, S; Isahak, I",Tropical biomedicine,229,1

Propofol and sevoflurane act differently on cerebral blood vessels. Consequently, cerebral blood flow during hyperventilation with propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia may differ. OBJECTIVES The first aim of this study was to compare the changes in rSO2 between propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia during hyperventilation. The second aim was to assess changes in rSO2 with ventilation changes. DESIGN A randomised, open-label study. SETTING University of Yamanashi Hospital, Yamanashi, Japan from January 2014 to September 2014. PARTICIPANTS Fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or 2 adult patients who were scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were assigned randomly to receive either propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia. Exclusion criterion was a known history of cerebral disease such as cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, transient ischaemic attack and subarachnoid haemorrhage. INTERVENTIONS After induction of anaesthesia but before the start of surgery, rSO2, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) and arterial oxygen saturation were measured. Measurements were repeated at 5-min intervals during 15 min of hyperventilation with a PaCO2 around 30 mmHg (4 kPa), and again after ventilation was normalised. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the difference of changes in rSO2 between propofol anaesthesia and sevoflurane anaesthesia during and after hyperventilation. The second outcome was change in rSO2 after the initiation of hyperventilation and after the normalisation of ventilation. RESULTS Changes of rSO2 during hyperventilation were -10 ± 7% (left) and -11 ± 8% (right) in the propofol group, and -10 ± 8% (left) and -9 ± 7% (right) in the sevoflurane group. After normalisation of PaCO2, rSO2 returned to baseline values. Arterial oxygen saturation remained stable throughout the measurement period. The rSO2 values were similar in the propofol and the sevoflurane groups at each time point. CONCLUSION The effects of hyperventilation on estimated rSO2 were similar with propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia. Changes in rSO2 correlated well with ventilation changes.

The nucleolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis and sequesters cell cycle regulatory complexes. Two of the major components of the nucleolus are fibrillarin and nucleolin. These proteins are involved in nucleolar assembly and ribosome biogenesis and act as chaperones for the import of proteins into the nucleolus. We have found that fibrillarin is reorganized in primary cells infected with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and in continuous cell lines that express either IBV or mouse hepatitis virus N protein. Both N protein and a fibrillarin-green fluorescent protein fusion protein colocalized to the perinuclear region and the nucleolus. Pull-down assays demonstrated that IBV N protein interacted with nucleolin and therefore provided a possible explanation as to how coronavirus N proteins localize to the nucleolus. Nucleoli, and proteins that localize to the nucleolus, have been implicated in cell growth-cell cycle regulation. Comparison of cells expressing IBV N protein with controls indicated that cells expressing N protein had delayed cellular growth. This result could not to be attributed to apoptosis. Morphological analysis of these cells indicated that cytokinesis was disrupted, an observation subsequently found in primary cells infected with IBV. Coronaviruses might therefore delay the cell cycle in interphase, where maximum translation of viral mRNAs can occur.","Chen, Hongying; Wurm, Torsten; Britton, Paul; Brooks, Gavin; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,229,10

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the knowledge, practices, and expectations of dentists toward TD and its association with sociodemographic variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to dentists in Colombia as part of global research on the impact of COVID-19 on dentistry. The core questionnaire included 5 additional questions on TD that were added by the Colombian research team in 5 domains about TD: Q1, knowledge; Q2, practices; Q3, expectations; Q4, usefulness; and Q5, reimbursement. Sociodemographic variables were also measured. The questionnaire was validated in a pilot test and administered via digital media. Descriptive and bivariate analysis for sociodemographic and TD variables were done. For the evaluation of the chances of a determined answer, an ordinal multinomial logistic regression (Q1 and Q2) and binomial logistic regression (Q3 and Q5) analyses were made. RESULTS: In total, 5,370 dentists answered the survey (women: 3,878; mean age: 45 y). The response rate of the survey was 16.84%. Knowledge and practice of TD before the COVID-19 pandemic were both low (25.75% and 12.42%, respectively); however, since the beginning of the current pandemic, knowledge increased by 62.72% and practice by 42.53%. Some 93.1% of respondents considered that TD could be useful in their clinical practice, and 59.55% would consider practicing it after the pandemic. A high number of dentists (88.58%) did not charge for these services. Logistic regressions showed significant differences according to sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on TD, increasing knowledge and practice significantly. Dentists expect to continue practicing TD in the future. However, some geographical, technological, and attitudinal barriers need to be broken down to increase daily use of TD.

Prior reports of testing have reported low sensitivities of nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reports of viral co-infections have varied from 0-20%. Therefore, we sought to determine the accuracy of nasopharyngeal PCR for COVID-19 and rates of viral co-infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who received viral testing between March 1, 2020-April 28, 2020. Test results of a complete viral pathogen panel and COVID-19 testing were abstracted. We compared patients with more than one COVID-19 test for diagnostic accuracy against the gold standard of chart review. RESULTS: We identified 1950 patients, of whom 1024 were tested for COVID-19. There were 221 repeat tests for COVID-19. Among patients with a repeat test, COVID-19 swabs had a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 69.5-94.4%) and a specificity of 99.5% (95%CI, 97-100%) compared to a clinical and radiographic criterion reference by chart review. We found viral co-infection rates of 2.3% in patients without COVID-19 and 6.1% in patients with COVID-19. Rates of co-infection appeared to be related to base rates of infection in the community and not a specific property of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR specimens are accurate but have imperfect sensitivity. Repeat testing for high-risk patients should be considered, and presence of an alternative virus should not be used to limit testing for COVID-19 for patients where it would affect treatment or isolation.","Gopaul, Ravindra; Davis, Joshua; Gangai, Linda; Goetz, Lianna",West J Emerg Med,229,6

Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (""risk""and""spread""), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic""friendship paradox""-- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.","Allard, Antoine; Moore, Cristopher; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Althouse, Benjamin M.; H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent",,229,9

METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients. We found a shift in the proportions of thrombosis subtypes from 2019 to 2020, with declines in ST-segment myocardial infarction (from 22.0% to 10.1% of thrombotic events) and stroke (from 48.6% to 37.2%) and an increase in venous thromboembolism (from 29.4% to 52.7%). The patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis were younger (age, 58 years vs 64 years; P = .043) and were less frequently women (31.3% vs 43.9%; P = .16). However, no differences were found in the body mass index or major comorbidities between those with and without COVID-19. COVID-19-associated thrombosis correlated with greater mortality (15.2% vs 4.3%; P = .016). The biometric profile of patients admitted with COVID-19-associated thrombosis compared with regular thrombosis showed significant changes in the complete blood count, liver function test results, D-dimer levels, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and coagulation panels. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis requiring hospitalization had increased mortality compared with outpatients without COVID-19 who developed thrombosis requiring hospitalization. Given the significantly higher inflammatory marker levels, it is possible this is related to different mechanisms of thrombotic disease in these patients. The inflammation could be a therapeutic target to reduce the risk, or aid in the treatment, of thrombosis. We call for more studies elucidating the role that immunothrombosis might be playing in patients with COVID-19.","Brosnahan, Shari B; Smilowitz, Nathaniel R; Amoroso, Nancy E; Barfield, Michael; Berger, Jeffery S; Goldenberg, Ronald; Ishida, Koto; Talmor, Nina; Torres, Jose; Yaghi, Shadi; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Maldonado, Thomas S",J.

Information on the approach to and effectiveness of COVID-19 workplace investigations is limited. In May 2020, Public Health - Seattle & King County (PHSKC), King County, Washington established a COVID-19 workplace surveillance and response system to enhance COVID-19 contact tracing and identify outbreaks in workplaces. During June 15-November 15, 2020, a total of 2,881 workplaces in King County reported at least one case of COVID-19. Among 1,305 (45.3%) investigated workplaces,* 524 (40.3%) met the definition of a workplace outbreak. Among 306 (58.4%) workplaces with complete data,§ an average of 4.4 employee COVID-19 cases¶ (median = three; range = 1-65) were identified per outbreak, with an average attack rate among employees of 17.5%. PHSKC and the Washington State Department of Health optimized resources by establishing a classification scheme to prioritize workplace investigations as high, medium, or low priority based on workplace features observed to be associated with increased COVID-19 spread and workforce features associated with severe disease outcomes. High-priority investigations were significantly more likely than medium- and low-priority investigations to have two or more cases among employees (p<0.001), two or more cases not previously linked to the workplace (p<0.001), or two or more exposed workplace contacts not previously identified during case interviews (p = 0.002). Prioritization of workplace investigations allowed for the allocation of limited resources to effectively conduct workplace investigations to limit the potential workplace spread of COVID-19. Workplace investigations can also serve as an opportunity to provide guidance on preventing workplace exposures to SARS-CoV-2, facilitate access to vaccines, and strengthen collaborations between public health and businesses.","Bonwitt, Jesse; Deya, Ruth W; Currie, Dustin W; Lipton, Beth; Huntington-Frazier, Melinda; Sanford, Sara Jaye; Pallickaparambil, Aley Joseph; Hood, Julia; Rao, Agam K; Kelly-Reif, Kaitlin; Luckhaupt, Sara E; Pogosjans, Sargis; Lindquist, Scott; Duchin, Jeff; Kawakami, Vance",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,229,1

KD has been described in association with dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. However, MIS-C with concomitant infection has rarely been reported in literature. A 14-year-old-girl presented with fever and rash with history of redness of eyes, lips and tongue. Investigations showed anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytosis with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, Interleukin-6, ferritin and d-dimer. Scrub typhus immunoglobulin M was positive. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was also elevated. A diagnosis of MIS-C with concomitant scrub typhus was proffered. Child received azithromycin, intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. After an afebrile period of 2.5 days, child developed unremitting fever and rash. Repeat investigations showed anemia, worsening lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia which were consistent with a diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). KD, MIS-C and MAS represent three distinct phenotypes of hyperinflammation seen in children during coronavirus disease pandemic. Several tropical infections may mimic or coexist with MIS-C which can be a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. Identification of coexistence or differentiation between the two conditions is important in countries with high incidence of tropical infections to guide appropriate investigations and treatment.","Gupta, Aman; Gill, Arpinder",J. trop. pedriatr,229,21

Government instructions to the general public include: (a) limiting time spent outside the home, (b) staying more than 1 m away from people outside the household at all times, and (c) maintaining hand hygiene. Current evidence suggests high rates of adherence to such instructions, but interventions to sustain adherence to government instructions in the long term can only be developed if we know why people do or do not adhere to them. The aims were to assess levels of public adherence to government instructions to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but more importantly to gauge why people were or were not adhering to instructions. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 2252 adults who were representative of the UK population. Data were analysed descriptively, and using one-sample t-tests, within-participants ANOVA and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The sample reported mostly adhering to UK government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with 5% or fewer people reporting active resistance to instructions. People generally reported high levels of capability, opportunity and motivation to follow the instructions, but perceived relatively few physical and social opportunities. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that better adherence was associated with older age, being a woman, having a white ethnic background, and with perceiving greater levels of capabilities, opportunities and motivations. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions targeted at people with black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, men and younger people that focus on increasing capabilities, providing greater opportunities and boosting motivations are needed to support continued adherence to government instructions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Further research is required to track changes in people's capabilities, opportunities, motivations and behaviours in response to the ongoing emergency, any changes in government instructions, and to adapt the present procedures to other emergency situations.","Armitage, Christopher J; Keyworth, Chris; Leather, Jessica Z; Byrne-Davis, Lucie; Epton, Tracy",BMC Public Health,229,1

We surveyed Italian neurosurgical residents, asking them to provide a brief description and analyze the situation they are experiencing and how the educational system reacted to the pandemic in one of the most affected countries all over the world. METHODS: An 18-question, web-based survey was administered to Italian neurosurgical residents from May 3 to May 11, 2020, by web-link or e-mail invitation. Closed-ended, multiple choice questions were focused on the experience of neurosurgical residents in the last 2 months (from March to May 2020) concerning both clinical and educational aspects. RESULTS: Among 331 Italian neurosurgical residents invited to participate, 192 responded to the survey (58%). According to the participants' responses, in the whole country, only 29.7% of residents were directly involved in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Time spent in the clinic and surgical activity was significantly reduced in most of the cases. Educational activities as well as scientific activity and time spent for studying, on the other hand, were reported to be significantly increased by the majority of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Most Italian neurosurgical residents reported significant changes on both training and education, highlighting a prompt reaction of the educational system in the whole country, regardless the local and regional diffusion of the pandemic.","Zoia, Cesare; Raffa, Giovanni; Somma, Teresa; Della Pepa, Giuseppe M; La Rocca, Giuseppe; Zoli, Matteo; Bongetta, Daniele; De Divitiis, Oreste; Fontanella, Marco M",Acta Neurochir (Wien),229,32

Therefore, a re-evaluation of the algorithm was conducted to determine which recommendations were still relevant and which needed modification. METHODS: The authors conducted a twofold approach: a review of literature to include new evidence since 2011 (controlled trials, meta-analyses and practice guidelines); and a participatory component involving electronic surveys, participatory conferences, clinical speakers and expert patients. RESULTS: Overall, prescribers tended to make decisions based on personal experience and conversations with colleagues rather than evidence-based guidelines. To test if the algorithm was useful worldwide, it was presented in the United Arab Emirates, where the feedback was in agreement with the algorithm and its limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Since its initial publication, the QAAPAPLE algorithm has been updated to guide clinicians on the use of LAIs. The new algorithm has also been assessed outside Canada to test its generalisability worldwide, and indicated its flexibility, efficiency and user-friendliness in order to guide clinicians on the use of LAIs.","Stip, Emmanuel; Grignon, Sylvain; Roy, Marc André; Bloom, David; Osman, Ossama; Amiri, Leena; Abdul Aziz, Karim; Javaid, Syed Fahad; Arnone, Danilo",,229,16

We conducted this study to explore the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab recently used for treating COVID-19. METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted (up to September 27, 2020), and 19 eligible records were identified according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data of the studies were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and were analyzed to evaluate the safety and availability of tocilizumab for treating COVID-19. RESULTS: Thirteen retrospective case-control studies (n = 2285 patients) and 6 retrospective single-armed studies (n = 208) were retrieved in this study. In the comparison of tocilizumab treatment group (TCZ) and standard treatment group (ST), significant associations with a lower risk of admission to ICU, use of ventilation, and mortality (OR, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.26~1.09; 0.66, 0.46~0.94; 0.44, 0.36~0.55) were found in the tocilizumab treatment group. What is more, patients treated with tocilizumab had better clinical improvement compared with the patients treated with ST (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.96~1.62). After taking tocilizumab, the patients had lower C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (WMD, 95% CI: - 99.66, - 156.24~- 43.09; - 0.95, - 1.8~- 0.11; - 12.58, - 18.88~-6.29) but higher troponin (WMD, 7.61; 95% CI, 3.06~12.15) than before. In addition, tocilizumab did not have significant influence on patients' neutrophil count (Neut), lymphocyte count (Lymp), platelet count (Plt), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine (WMD, 95% CI: - 0.29, - 2.91~2.33; 0.42, - 0.23~1.07; 5.2, - 2.85~13.25; 22.49, - 2.73~47.7; - 44.78, - 93.37~3.81). CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab may have potential effectiveness to treat COVID-19 according to the results of this study. However, more large-scale studies are needed for more accurate conclusions.","Zhao, Meng; Lu, Jieyu; Tang, Yihu; Dai, Yawei; Zhou, Jingxin; Wu, Yanhu",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,229,1

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively. METHODS: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participant's county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment. RESULTS: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that perceived COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with COVID-related behaviors, distress and impairment whereas actual infection rates have a less important and perhaps even paradoxical influence on behavioral responses to the pandemic.","Schmidt, Norman B; Martin, Alex D; Allan, Nicholas P; Mathes, Brittany M; Saulnier, Kevin G; March, David S",J Psychiatr Res,229,25

The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis' effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects' COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Huete-Pérez, Jorge A; Cabezas-Robelo, Cristiana; Páiz-Medina, Lucía; Hernández-Álvarez, Carlos A; Quant-Durán, Carlos; McKerrow, James H",PLoS One,229,1

METHODS: We systematically searched the Google Scholar database using specific keywords related to our aims until August 1st, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and statin were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with a total of 3449 patients were included in our analysis.

The aim of the present study was to investigate PTSD, Burnout and global functioning in a sample of emergency healthcare workers (HCWs) of a major University Hospital of Italy, exploring possible correlations between the two constructs. METHODS: The study sample included 137 medical and nursing Emergency Room and Intensive Care Unit staff of a major University Hospital in Italy (Pisa), all assessed by means of the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report (TALS-SR), for post-traumatic stress spectrum, the Professional Quality of Life Scale - Revision IV (ProQOL R-IV), for Burnout related to work activities, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), for global functioning. RESULTS: Fourty-nine subjects reported a full (18, 14.3%) or partial (31, 24.6%) symptomatological DSM-5 PTSD. HCWs with PTSD reported significantly higher Burnout scores and global functioning impairment compared to those without PTSD.

To evaluate the causal associations between various white blood cell traits and the COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, we conducted two-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses with summary statistics from the largest and most recent genome-wide association studies. Our MR results indicated causal protective effects of higher basophil count, basophil percentage of white blood cells, and myeloid white blood cell count on severe COVID-19, with odds ratios (OR) per standard deviation increment of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60-0.95), 0.70 (95% CI: 0.54-0.92), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73-0.98), respectively. Neither COVID-19 severity nor susceptibility was associated with white blood cell traits in our reverse MR results. Genetically predicted high basophil count, basophil percentage of white blood cells, and myeloid white blood cell count are associated with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19. Individuals with a lower genetic capacity for basophils are likely at risk, while enhancing the production of basophils may be an effective therapeutic strategy.","Sun, Yitang; Zhou, Jingqi; Ye, Kaixiong",,229,16

Responses to this crisis integrated resource allocation for the increased amount of infected patients while maintaining an adequate response to other severe and life-threatening diseases. Though cardiothoracic patients are at high risk for Covid-19 severe illness, postponing surgeries would translate to increased mortality and morbidity. We reviewed our practice during the initial time of the pandemic, with emphasis on safety protocols. METHODS: From 11 March to 15 May 2020, 148 patients underwent surgery at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João. The clinical characteristics of the patients were retrospectively registered, along with novel containment and infection prevention measures targeting the new coronavirus. RESULTS: The majority of adult cardiac patients were operated on an emergency basis. Hospital mortality was 1.9% (n = 2 patients). Most adult thoracic patients were admitted from home, with a diagnosis of neoplastic disease in 60% of patients. Hospital mortality was 3.3% (1 patient). Fifteen children underwent cardiothoracic surgery. There was no mortality. The infection prevention procedures applied, totally excluded the transmission of Covid-19 in the department. CONCLUSION: While guaranteeing a prompt response to emergent, urgent, and high priority cases, novel safety measures in individual protection, patients circuits, and preoperative diagnoses of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection were adopted. The surgical results corroborate that it was safe to undergo cardiothoracic surgery during the initial time of the Covid-19 pandemic. The new policies will be maintained while the virus stays in the community.","Casanova, Jorge; Pissarra, Diana; Costa, Rita; Salgueiro, Elson; Pinho, Paulo",J Card Surg,229,26

This manuscript aimed at reviewing published papers for sampling and detection of corona viruses, especially SARS-Cov-2 as a global health concern. It was found that SARS-Cov 2 was present in some air samples that were collected from patient's rooms in hospitals. This result warrants its airborne transmission potential. However, due to the fact that in the most reviewed studies, sampling was performed in the patient's room, it seems difficult to discriminate whether it is airborne or is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Moreover, some other disrupting factors such as patient distance from the sampler, using protective or oxygen masks by patients, patient activities, coughing and sneezing during sampling time, air movement, air conditioning, sampler type, sampling conditions, storage and transferring conditions, can affect the results. About the sampling methods, most of the used samplers such as PTFE filters, gelatin filers and cyclones showed suitable performance for trapping SARS-Co and MERS-Cov viruses followed by PCR analysis.","Rahmani, Ali Reza; Leili, Mostafa; Azarian, Ghasem; Poormohammadi, Ali",Sci Total Environ,229,16

Study 1 collected survey data from students' families and their educators on the feasibility and effectiveness of distance-learning programs when working with students with severe developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs. Results indicated that parents and educators had generally neutral attitudes toward distance learning, although educators agreed that their students were obtaining educational benefits during distance learning. Study 2 further examined the effects of a transition to distance learning on students' Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goal progress. Analyses revealed that students maintained about half of the skills addressed in their IEPs and made progress on an additional quarter of their IEP goals.

METHODS: A retrospective survey was performed comparing procedure volumes within March 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with April 2020 (during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic). Sixty-three (63) health care facilities within Oceania that perform cardiac diagnostic procedures were surveyed, including a mixture of metropolitan and regional, hospital and outpatient, public and private sites, and 846 facilities outside of Oceania. The percentage change in procedure volume was measured between March 2019 and April 2020, compared by test type and by facility. RESULTS: In Oceania, the total cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was reduced by 52.2% from March 2019 to April 2020, compared to a reduction of 75.9% seen in the rest of the world (p<0.001). Within Oceania sites, this reduction varied significantly between procedure types, but not between types of health care facility. All procedure types (other than stress cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] and positron emission tomography [PET]) saw significant reductions in volume over this time period (p<0.001). In Oceania, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) decreased by 51.6%, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) by 74.0%, and stress tests by 65% overall, which was more pronounced for stress electrocardiograph (ECG) (81.8%) and stress echocardiography (76.7%) compared to stress single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) (44.3%). Invasive coronary angiography decreased by 36.7% in Oceania. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was seen across all facility types in Oceania and was likely a function of recommendations from cardiac societies and directives from government to minimise spread of COVID-19 amongst patients and staff. Longer term evaluation is important to assess for negative patient outcomes which may relate to deferral of usual models of care within cardiology.","O039,; Sullivan, Patricia; Younger, John; Van Pelt, Niels; Malley, Sue; Lenturut-Katal, Dora; Hirschfeld, Cole B; Vitola, Joao V; Cerci, Rodrigo; Williams, Michelle C; Shaw, Leslee J; Raggi, Paolo; Villines, Todd C; Dorbala, Sharmila; Choi, Andrew D; Cohen, Yosef; Goebel, Benjamin; Malkovskiy, Eli; Randazzo, Michael; Pascual, Thomas N B; Pynda, Yaroslav; Dondi, Maurizio; Paez, Diana; Einstein, Andrew J; Better, Nathan",Heart lung circ,229,16

However, a historical perspective demonstrates the ILO's difficulties in integrating such standards for sea workers. From 1920 to 1958, the ILO endeavoured to anchor the 8-hour workday principle in maritime conventions on working time and to ensure compliance by quantifying manning levels. Facing sectoral opposition and the obstacle of the minimum tonnage requirement, none of the conventions adopted during the first period entered into force. A second regulatory wave (1995-2007) initiated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) orientated working time towards fatigue management and adopted the 14-hour workday. Absorbed by the ILO from 1996, this threshold facilitated the implementation of working time standards for sea workers. The existence of autonomous maritime governance at the ILO and the IMO complemented by the incorporation of the tonnage clause in maritime convention allowed the acceptance of the 14-hour workday system in spite of breaching the universal principles established a century ago. The departure between maritime and land standards show that sectoral interests prevail over labour rights. More decisively, current standards detached labour rights from workers' human nature and attached them directly to sectoral interests.","Baumler, Raphael",Mar Policy,229,16

The objective of this study was to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the opioid epidemic in the state of Ohio by describing the changes in the quarterly opioid overdose deaths (OOD) over the last 10 years. METHODS: This longitudinal study included OOD data from death records obtained through the Ohio Department of Health. Temporal trend analysis and visualizations were performed on the OOD death rate per 100,000 quarterly from 2010 to 2020. Age, sex, and ethnicity were also analyzed. RESULTS: The OOD rate of 11.15 in Q2 of 2020 was statistically equivalent to the previous peak level of 10.87 in Q1 of 2017. There was a significant increase in the OOD rate from Q1 to Q2 of 2020 and a significant difference between the actual Q2 of 2020 OOD rate and the predicted OOD rate. The poisoning indicator fentanyl was present in 94% of OOD during Q2 of 2020. The total number of OOD remains highest in the White population. There was no significant difference between the actual and predicted OOD rates in the Black population of Q2 of 2020 based on the trend line. However, the OOD rate of 14.29 in Q2 of 2020 was significantly higher than the previous peak level of 8.34 in Q2 of 2017. The Q2 of 2020 OOD rates for 18 to 39 and 40+ age groups were significantly higher from what would be expected from the trend predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, Ohio has entered a COVID19 pandemic mediated fourth wave in the opioid epidemic. These findings further suggest that as efforts are made to address the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, states need to maintain their vigilance toward combating the local opioid epidemic.","Vieson, Jamie; Yeh, Arthur B; Lan, Qizhen; Sprague, Jon E",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),229,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients who received systemic treatment at chemotherapy unit with diagnosis of cancer between 11 March 2020 and 11 June 2020 were included. The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, the systemic treatments that they received (CT, IT, targeted therapies), and the stage of disease were determined. For the parameters that affect the hospitalization of COVID-19 infected patients were also determined. RESULTS: Among 1149 patients with cancer, 84 of them were infected with COVID-19, and the median age of infected patients was 61.0 (IQR: 21-84) and 60.7% of them were male. As a subtype of cancers lung cancer was more frequent in the patients who infected with COVID compared with non-infected ones and the difference was statistically significant when the underlying malignities were compared (32.1% vs 19.0%, p = 0.031). The hospitalization rate and receiving COVID-19 treatment were more frequent in metastatic patients who were receiving palliative therapy, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01, p = 0.03). In our study, infection rate was similar among patients treated with CT, IT and CT plus targeted therapy; however, fewer COVID-19 infections were seen at patients who received only targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is more frequent in cancer patients and tends to be more severe in metastatic cancer patients receiving anticancer treatment, and the continuation of palliative cancer treatments in these patients may cause increased cancer and infection-related morbidity and mortality.","Ayhan, Murat; Laçin, Sahin; Özyükseler, Deniz T; Sürmeli, Heves; Dogan, Akif; Turan, Merve; Odabas, Hatice; Turan, Nedim; Yildirim, Mahmut Emre",J Oncol Pharm Pract,229,16

It is beyond any doubt that it is, again, a call-to-action to minimize the risk of future zoonoses caused by emerging human pathogens. The primary response to contain zoonotic diseases is to call for more strict regulations on wildlife trade and hunting. This is because the origins of coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as other viral pathogens (e.g., Ebola, HIV) are traceable to wild animals. Although COVID-19 is not related to livestock animals, the pandemic increased general attention given to zoonotic viral infections-the risk of which can also be associated with livestock. Therefore, this paper discusses the potential transformation of industrial livestock farming and the production of animal products, particularly meat, to decrease the risks for transmission of novel human pathogens. Plant-based diets have a number of advantages, but it is unrealistic to consider them as the only solution offered to the problem. Therefore, a search for alternative protein sources in insect-based foods and cultured meat, important technologies enabling safer meat production. Although both of these strategies offer a number of potential advantages, they are also subject to the number of challenges that are discussed in this paper. Importantly, insect-based foods and cultured meat can provide additional benefits in the context of ecological footprint, an aspect important in light of predicted climate changes. Furthermore, cultured meat can be regarded as ethically superior and supports better food security. There is a need to further support the implementation and expansion of all three approaches discussed in this paper, plant-based diets, insect-based foods, and cultured meat, to decrease the epidemiological risks and ensure a sustainable future. Furthermore, cultured meat also offers a number of additional benefits in the context of environmental impact, ethical issues, and food security.","Rzymski, Piotr; Kulus, Magdalena; Jankowski, Maurycy; Dompe, Claudia; Bryl, Rut; Petitte, James N; Kempisty, Bartosz; Mozdziak, Paul",Nutrients,229,16

DESIGN: Systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PubMed Central and grey literature through ProQuest, The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, COVID-Evidence and speech pathology national bodies were searched up until August 13th, 2020 for articles examining the aerosol-generating activities in clinical voice and speech assessment and intervention within speech pathology. RESULTS: Of the 8288 results found, 39 studies were included for data extraction and analysis. Included articles were classified into one of three categories: research studies, review articles or clinical guidelines. Data extraction followed appropriate protocols depending on the classification of each article (e.g. PRISMA for review articles). Articles were assessed for risk of bias and certainty of evidence using the GRADE system. Six behaviours were identified as aerosol generating. These were classified into three categories: vegetative acts (coughing, breathing), verbal communication activities of daily living (speaking, loud voicing), and performance-based tasks (singing, sustained phonation). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate with variation in research design and variables. CONCLUSIONS: This body of literature helped to both identify and categorise the aerosol-generating behaviours involved in speech pathology clinical practice and confirm the low level of evidence throughout the speech pathology literature pertaining to aerosol generation. As many aerosol-generating behaviours are common human behaviours, these findings can be applied across healthcare and community settings.

However, the molecule also has many other biological properties that are unrelated to the oncotic activity. The purpose of this review is to examine the hemodynamic and systemic effects of albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Recent Findings: Besides plasma expansion, albumin appears to act against inflammation, facilitate immunocompetence, and improve cardiac and endothelial function, thus antagonizing critical steps in the pathophysiological cascade underlying decompensated cirrhosis. Summary: Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, as well the pleiotropic properties of the molecule, provides the rationale for considering albumin as a multi-target disease-modifying agent in decompensated cirrhosis. Both oncotic and non-oncotic properties likely concur with the clinical benefits of long-term albumin administration recently demonstrated in these patients.","Tufoni, Manuel; Baldassarre, Maurizio; Zaccherini, Giacomo; Antognoli, Agnese; Caraceni, Paolo",Curr Hepatol Rep,229,1

Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the ICTV has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.",,Nat Microbiol,229,18

In this context, it results in a particular interest in the evaluation of the efficacy of existing pharmacological agents that may be used for overcoming or attenuating the severity of this pulmonary complication that has ended the lives of many people worldwide. Vitamin D and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim, taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against COVID-19 infection, possibly even through a synergistic interaction. The renin-angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 infection; and it may be down-regulated by vitamin D and melatonin in many organs.

While multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature. COVID-19 is predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence has showed that shedding in feces and feco-oral transmission could also be possible. It is unclear if COVID-19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids. GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions. This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission. Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non-urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent procedures based on the clinical need. Furthermore, pre-screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended. This article focuses on the risk of COVID-19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus, including transmission during endoscopies, and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopy procedures.","Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Boregowda, Umesha; Bansal, Pardeep; Goyal, Hemant",Dig Endosc,229,33

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that 129Xe MRI is feasible and can demonstrate ventilation defects that relate to and predict clinical severity in a pediatric asthma cohort. METHODS: Thirty-seven children (13 severe asthma, 8 mild/moderate asthma, 16 age-matched healthy controls) aged 6-17 years-old were imaged with 129Xe MRI. Ventilation defect percentage (VDP) and image reader score were calculated and compared to clinical measures at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS: Children with asthma had higher VDP (p=0.002) and number of defects per image slice (defects/slice) (p=0.0001) than children without asthma. Children with clinically severe asthma had significantly higher VDP and number of defects/slice than healthy controls. Children with asthma who had higher number of defects/slice had higher rate of healthcare utilization (r=0.48, p=0.03) and oral corticosteroid use (r=0.43, p=0.05) at baseline. ROC analysis demonstrated the number of defects/slice and VDP were predictive of increased healthcare utilization, asthma and severe asthma. VDP correlated with FEV1 (r=-0.35, p=0.04) and FEV1/FVC ratio (r=-0.41, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: 129Xe MRI correlates with asthma severity, healthcare utilization, and oral corticosteroid use. As delineation of clinical severity is often difficult in children, 129Xe MRI may be an important biomarker for severity, with potential to identify children at higher risk for exacerbations and improve outcomes.","Lin, Nancy Y; Roach, David J; Willmering, Matthew M; Walkup, Laura L; Hossain, Md Monir; Desirazu, Priyanka; Cleveland, Zackary I; Guilbert, Theresa W; Woods, Jason C",J Allergy Clin Immunol,229,16

Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","Hernández, A; Papadakos, P J; Torres, A; González, D A; Vives, M; Ferrando, C; Baeza, J",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,229,21

Here, we developed a method called 2CIMPL that includes proximity ligation under native conditions to identify genome-wide RNA duplexes. Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation. Overall, 2CIMPL is a versatile technique to map in vivo RNA-RNA interactions.","Le Sage, Valerie; Kanarek, Jack P; Snyder, Dan J; Cooper, Vaughn S; Lakdawala, Seema S; Lee, Nara",Cell Rep,229,32

This study tested the hypothesis that this eosinopenia is COVID-19 specific and is associated with systemic activation of eosinophils. Blood of 15 healthy controls and 75 adult patients with suspected COVID-19 at the ER were included before PCR testing and analyzed by point-of-care automated flow cytometry (CD10, CD11b, CD16, and CD62L) in the absence or presence of a formyl peptide (fNLF). Forty-five SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients were grouped based on disease severity. PCR negative patients with proven bacterial (n = 20) or other viral (n = 10) infections were used as disease controls. Eosinophils were identified with the use of the FlowSOM algorithm. Low blood eosinophil numbers (<100 cells/µL; p < 0.005) were found both in patients with COVID-19 and with other infectious diseases, albeit less pronounced. Two discrete eosinophil populations were identified in healthy controls both before and after activation with fNLF based on the expression of CD11b. Before activation, the CD11bbright population consisted of 5.4% (CI95% = 3.8, 13.4) of total eosinophils. After activation, this population of CD11bbright cells comprised nearly half the population (42.21%, CI95% = 35.9, 54.1). Eosinophils in COVID-19 had a similar percentage of CD11bbright cells before activation (7.6%, CI95% = 4.5, 13.6), but were clearly refractory to activation with fNLF as a much lower percentage of cells end up in the CD11bbright fraction after activation (23.7%, CI95% = 18.5, 27.6; p < 0.001). Low eosinophil numbers in COVID-19 are associated with refractoriness in responsiveness to fNLF.

We aimed to evaluate an internal quality control (iQC) program that controls the total ANA IIF process in routine practice. METHODS: In addition to the kit iQC materials, supplemental quality indicators were integrated in a total quality assurance (QA) program: patient-derived iQC's samples (negative, 1/160 fine speckled and 1/160 homogeneous), median sample FI per run and percentage of ANA IIF positive samples per run.Analytical rejection criteria were based on the imprecision of the positivity index (PI) measure of the Zenit PRO system (Menarini). Clinical rejection criteria were based on changes in FI that correspond to a change in ANA IIF titer of &#8805;2. To evaluate the QA program, different artificial errors were introduced during the ANA IIF process. After every run, quality indicators were evaluated and compared to the pre-set target values. RESULTS: Rescanning the ANA IIF slides five times, using an old conjugate and a needle obstruction resulted in analytically and even clinically relevant errors in ANA IIF results. All errors were correctly detected by the different defined quality indicators. Traditional Westgard rules, including analytically (and clinically) defined rejection limits were useful in monitoring quality indicators.

No studies to date have investigated the awareness of DCD among key stakeholders in Australia. METHODS: An online survey was complete by 494 Australian participants: primary caregivers (n = 153), teachers (n = 149), allied health professionals (n = 165) and medical professionals (n = 27). RESULTS: DCD and related terms were among the least known childhood disorders. Approximately half of the sample were familiar with the term DCD but every stakeholder group were more familiar with the term dyspraxia. Allied health professionals demonstrated greater knowledge of the features of DCD, particularly motor features. Every stakeholder group showed poor recognition of the social and psychological effects of DCD. A relatively low percentage of allied health (53%) and medical (33%) professionals reported they had identified or diagnosed DCD and less than 20% of these felt that the DSM-5 contained adequate information to make a DCD diagnosis. Most teachers (82%) believed they should play a role in identifying early warning signs of this disorder, and 80% believed there are children in the school system who were labelled as lazy or defiant when they have motor skills impairments. Primary caregivers were supportive of a diagnosis of DCD being provided; however, only 16% were confident that a physician would provide an accurate and timely diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Key stakeholders play a unique and important role in the identification of children with DCD. Though most participants acknowledge the role that they play, all stakeholder groups demonstrated poor familiarity with the term DCD and low levels of knowledge about the features of this disorder. Improved familiarity and knowledge of the disorder is needed for access to appropriate services and improved long-term outcomes for this condition.","Hunt, Jacqui; Zwicker, Jill G; Godecke, Erin; Raynor, Annette",Child care health dev,229,16

At the molecular level, this process is defined by the cyclical co-expression of both core transcription factors and off-target genes across time. While interactions between these molecular clocks are likely necessary for proper homeostasis, these features remain undefined. Here, we utilize integrative analysis of a baboon diurnal transcriptome atlas to characterize the properties of gene networks under circadian control. We found that 53.4% (8,120) of baboon genes are rhythmically expressed body-wide. In addition, >30% of gene-gene interactions exhibit periodic co-expression patterns, with core circadian genes more cyclically co-expressed than others. Moreover, two basic network modes were observed at the systems level: daytime and nighttime mode. Daytime networks were enriched for genes involved in metabolism, while nighttime networks were enriched for genes associated with growth and cellular signaling. A substantial number of diseases only form significant disease modules at either daytime or nighttime. In addition, we found that 216 of 313 genes encoding products that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are rhythmically expressed throughout the body. Importantly, more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 related genes enriched modules are rhythmically expressed, and have significant network proximities with circadian regulators. Our data suggest that synchronization amongst circadian gene networks is necessary for proper homeostatic functions and circadian regulators have close interactions with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Jie; Nie, Pengxing; Turck, Christoph; Wang, Guang-Zhong",,229,24

Studies on the impact of the psychosocial stress associated with the pandemic on adults with asthma are limited. We examined the associations of COVID-19 related stress with asthma control in adults. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted with US adults with asthma. Study invitations were shared with potential participants via social media and email lists. Stress was measured using a 5-point Likert scale to capture participants' responses to 8 questions on being worried, sad vs. happy, relaxed vs. nervous, not fidgety vs. extremely fidgety, not fatigued vs. fatigued, focused vs. unfocused, not irritable vs. extremely irritable, and not lonely vs. extremely lonely. Responses were summed for a score ranging from 8-40 with higher values indicating higher stress. Stress scores were categorized into 4 levels (low: 8-16, moderate:17-24, high: 25-32, very high: 33-40). Participants also completed the asthma control test (ACT), answered questions about health care utilization during the pandemic, and reported the level of life changes they and their families experienced due to the pandemic. Results: Participants (N=909) were mostly female (82%), white (80%), from urban areas (61%), with at least a college degree (69%), and had a mean age of 44±15 years. Of participants, 13% and 15% were put into self-quarantine with and without symptoms, respectively;14% lost their job;and 21% had reduced ability to earn money. Less educated, non-white, and those who rent or live with family were more likely to experience significantly higher levels of stress in the 2 weeks before the survey. Almost 58% had an asthma exacerbation since the pandemic and 43% had uncontrolled asthma (ACT≤19). In adjusted multiple logistic regression models, we observed a significant dose-response (p trend&lt;0.0001) direct relationship of COVID-19 related stress levels with the odds of uncontrolled asthma. Compared to participants with low stress score, the odds of having uncontrolled asthma were 1.58 (95% CI=1.04,2.41), 2.74 (95% CI=1.72,4.37), and 6.46 (95% CI=3.18,13.12) for those at moderate, high, and very high levels of stress, respectively, after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions: Adults with asthma are significantly impacted by the pandemic. Our findings show a significant and dose-response detrimental effect of COVID-19 related stress on asthma control. Health care providers should attempt to assess the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on adults with asthma and provide the necessary mental health care and referrals.","Eldeirawi, K.; Nyenhuis, S.

Here, we examined the role of host innate immune defenses in restricting early SARS-CoV-2 infection using transcriptomics and biomarker-based tracking in serial patient nasopharyngeal samples and experiments with airway epithelial organoids. SARS-CoV-2 initially replicated exponentially, with a doubling time of â¼6 h, and induced interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the upper respiratory tract, which rose with viral replication and peaked just as viral load began to decline. Rhinovirus infection before SARS-CoV-2 exposure accelerated ISG responses and prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conversely, blocking ISG induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection enhanced viral replication from a low infectious dose. These results show that the activity of ISG-mediated defenses at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure impacts infection progression and that the heterologous antiviral response induced by a different virus can protect against SARS-CoV-2.","Cheemarla, Nagarjuna R; Watkins, Timothy A; Mihaylova, Valia T; Wang, Bao; Zhao, Dejian; Wang, Guilin; Landry, Marie L; Foxman, Ellen F",J. exp. med,229,13

While many governments and private companies are putting significant resources on the development of hydrogen technologies, there still remains a high number of unsolved issues, including technical challenges, economic and geopolitical implications. The hydrogen supply chain includes a large number of steps, resulting in additional energy losses, and while much focus is put on hydrogen generation costs, its transport and storage should not be neglected. A low-carbon hydrogen economy offers promising opportunities not only to fight climate change, but also to enhance energy security and develop local industries in many countries. However, to face the huge challenges of a transition towards a zero-carbon energy system, all available technologies should be allowed to contribute based on measurable indicators, which require a strong international consensus based on transparent standards and targets.","Raimondi, Pier Paolo Scita Rossana Hafner Manfred",Sustainability,229,17

Understanding how palliative care needs and outcomes have changed during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic is crucial to inform service planning and research initiatives. AIM: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on symptoms, clinical characteristics, and outcomes for patients referred to a hospital-based palliative care service in a district general hospital in London, UK. DESIGN: A retrospective service evaluation. Data were extracted from the electronic patient records. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The first 60 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, referred to the hospital palliative care service between 1 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, and another 60 inpatients, referred to the hospital palliative care service between 11 March 2019 and 23 April 2019, were included from a district general hospital in East London, UK. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 have lower comorbidity scores, poorer performance status, and a shorter time from referral to death compared to patients without COVID-19. Breathlessness, drowsiness, agitation, and fever are the most prevalent symptoms during COVID-19 compared to pain and drowsiness pre-COVID-19. Time from admission to referral to palliative care is longer for Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients, especially during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Early referral to palliative care is essential in COVID-19, especially for Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups. There is urgent need to research why Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients are referred late; how palliative care services have changed; and possible solutions to setting up responsive, flexible, and integrated services.","Chidiac, Claude; Feuer, David; Flatley, Mary; Rodgerson, Anna; Grayson, Kate; Preston, Nancy",Palliat Med,229,6

The number of users and the number of different social networks is constantly growing, which indicates that technology-mediated daily life has become an integral part of life in the 21st century. It is indubitable that there are many advantages to technological progress, but the question remains whether the use of social networks necessarily contributes to the wellbeing and quality of life of every individual. Over the last decade, a growing number of studies have attempted to clarify the connection between the use of social networks and mental health. In the context of social networks, the most-studied factor is the subjective assessment of time spent on social networks and the type of social network use in those periods (active/passive use). In the context of mental health, the anxiety and depression have been most extensively studied, while self-esteem, fear of missing out, social comparison, and loneliness have shown themselves to be mediators/moderators in the association between social networks and mental health. However, it is extremely important to place existing research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review article presents the main findings in this field with the clear conclusion that further longitudinal and experimental studies are required to clarify the causal direction of this relationship and the potential protective and risk factors, especially in the context of the alterations in the importance of social networks in maintaining social contacts during the pandemic. © 2020 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

An Australian/New Zealand organisational position statement released in March 2018 recommended avoiding extended-release opioid prescribing for acute pain. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this organisational position statement on extended-release opioid prescribing among surgical inpatients. Secondary objectives included predictors and clinical outcomes of prescribing extended-release opioids among surgical inpatients. We conducted a retrospective, dual centre, 11-month before-and-after study and time-series analysis by utilising electronic medical records from two teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients prescribed an extended-release opioid. For surgical patients prescribed any opioid (n = 16,284), extended-release opioid prescribing decreased after the release of the position statement (38.4% before vs. 26.6% after, p < 0.001), primarily driven by a reduction in extended-release oxycodone (31.1% before vs. 14.1% after, p < 0.001). There was a 23% immediate decline in extended-release opioid prescribing after the position statement release (p < 0.001), followed by an additional 0.2% decline per month in the following months. Multivariable regression showed that the release of the position statement was associated with a decrease in extended-release opioid prescribing (OR 0.54, 95%CI 0.50-0.58). Extended-release opioid prescribing was also associated with increased incidence of opioid-related adverse events (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.35-1.71); length of stay (RR 1.44, 95%CI 1.39-1.51); and 28-day re-admission (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.12-1.41). Overall, a reduction in extended-release opioid prescribing was observed in surgical inpatients following position statement release.","Awadalla, R; Liu, S; Kemp-Casey, A; Gnjidic, D; Patanwala, A; Stevens, J; Begley, D; Bugeja, B; Penm, J",Anaesthesia (Lond.),229,16

The serum titer of anti-tetanus antibody, however, was significantly lower in patients compared to healthy individuals (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that measles vaccination triggers those B cells cross-reactive with SARS-CoV2 antigens leading to the production of increased levels of measles-specific antibody.","Hassani, Danesh; Amiri, Mohammad Mehdi; Maghsood, Faezeh; Salimi, Vahid; Kardar, Gholam Ali; Barati, Omid; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammad Reza; Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood; Zarnani, Amir-Hassan; Shokri, Fazel",Iran J Immunol,229,16

Methods: All patients who were scheduled for elective, outpatient orthopaedic sports medicine procedures at one of two of outpatient surgical centers between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were asked to complete a custom survey during a post-operative clinic visit or phone call at a minimum of two-weeks or were subject to a routine screening questionnaire and temperature screen at the time of the first post-operative follow-up visit. The survey questionnaire assessed for any COVID-19-related symptoms. Surgical case logs were retrieved to review for any cancelled surgeries due to a positive pre-operative COVID-19 test. Results: A total of 3.5% of patients (n=39/1119) scheduled for surgery were diagnosed with COVID-19 during preoperative testing, resulting in surgical cancellation. Patients with a positive pre-operative COVID-19 test were found to be significantly younger (46 ± 20 years) when compared to all other patients with a negative test (51 ± 21 years; p=0.002). No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, reported symptoms concerning for COVID infection, underwent additional testing, or reported close contact with another individual with a positive test or possessed symptoms concerning for COVID-19 at a minimum of two-weeks post-operatively. Conclusion: This study found that 3.5% of patients tested positive for COVID-19 and were significantly younger when compared to patients testing negative. No patient investigated for potential infection post-operatively reported the development of any symptoms related to COVID-19 or reported a positive test post-operatively. Using current protocols for pre-operative screening, elective outpatient orthopaedic surgery performed in an ASC is safe with no documented cases of COVID-19 transmission in this cohort.","Singh, Harsh; Isak, Inis; Knapik, Derrick M; Vadhera, Amar S; Gursoy, Safa; Cole, Brian J; Verma, Nikhil N",,229,26

Thus, 600 MHz 1H solvent-suppressed single-pulse, spin-echo, and 2D J-resolved spectra were collected on plasma recorded from SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR-positive patients (n = 15, with multiple sampling timepoints) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 34, confirmed rRT-PCR negative), together with patients with COVID-19/influenza-like clinical symptoms who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (n = 35). We compared the single-pulse NMR spectral data with in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) information on quantitative lipoprotein profiles (112 parameters) extracted from the raw 1D NMR data. All NMR methods gave highly significant discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with individual NMR methods, giving different diagnostic information windows on disease-induced phenoconversion. Longitudinal trajectory analysis in selected patients indicated that metabolic recovery was incomplete in individuals without detectable virus in the recovery phase. We observed four plasma cytokine clusters that expressed complex differential statistical relationships with multiple lipoproteins and metabolites. These included the following: cluster 1, comprising MIP-1ß, SDF-1&#945;, IL-22, and IL-1&#945;, which correlated with multiple increased LDL and VLDL subfractions; cluster 2, including IL-10 and IL-17A, which was only weakly linked to the lipoprotein profile; cluster 3, which included IL-8 and MCP-1 and were inversely correlated with multiple lipoproteins. IL-18, IL-6, and IFN-Î³ together with IP-10 and RANTES exhibited strong positive correlations with LDL1-4 subfractions and negative correlations with multiple HDL subfractions. Collectively, these data show a distinct pattern indicative of a multilevel cellular immune response to SARS CoV-2 infection interacting with the plasma lipoproteome giving a strong and characteristic immunometabolic phenotype of the disease. We observed that some patients in the respiratory recovery phase and testing virus-free were still metabolically highly abnormal, which indicates a new role for these technologies in assessing full systemic recovery.","Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Coudert, Jerome D; Begum, Sofina; Bong, Sze-How; Richards, Toby; Edgar, Dale; Raby, Edward; Spraul, Manfred; Schaefer, Hartmut; Lindon, John C; Loo, Ruey Leng; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K",J Proteome Res,229,20

In this research, we collected data from January 1 to March 30, 2020 (90 days). This study used secondary data of meteorological and air pollutant parameters obtained from the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment as well as daily confirmed COVID-19 case data in the BMR obtained from the official webpage of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We employed descriptive statistics, and Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the associations of weather variables, air pollutants, AQI with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our findings indicate that CO, NO2, SO2, O3 PM10, PM2.5, AQI have a significantly negative association with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR, whereas meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), absolute humidity (AH) and wind speed (WS) showed significant positive associations with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. Our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote environmental strategies, as air pollution regulation could be a sustainable policy for mitigating the harmful effects of air pollutants. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into the relationship between daily meteorological factors, AQI, and air pollutants and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. These data may provide useful information to the public health authorities and decision makers in Thailand, as well as to the World Health Organization (WHO), in order to set proper strategic aimed at reducing the impact of the COVID-19.

Despite clear evidence of the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccination, vaccination coverage has internationally remained at inadequate levels in recent years. The general practitioner is of central importance for the care of this population. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate various measures in general practice to increase seasonal influenza vaccination rates for the chronically ill, taking into account various international health systems. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and ERIC as well as manually in trial registers and literature lists. Only randomized controlled studies were taken into account. The methodology was defined in advance in a study protocol and published (PROSPERO CRD42018114163). RESULTS: A total of 14 studies within the framework of a national health service (United Kingdom), a state (Australia) and social (Switzerland) health insurance system and a private health care system (USA) were included in our review. Analog patient reminders and automated physician reminders as well as changes in professional roles have led to a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates, but only in the private health care system. In the national health service, none of the interventions we analyzed achieved a significant increase in vaccination rates, although the National Health Service in the United Kingdom documented relatively good basic influenza vaccination rates before the studies were carried out, regardless of the intervention. Good results were achieved in the social and state health insurance systems of Switzerland and Australia by training events for practice teams and SMS reminders. CONCLUSIONS: In Germany, training events for medical teams and centrally organized invitation and monitoring systems might improve vaccination rates among the chronically ill. That the federal government pays for the vaccination costs seems to ensure a good basic influenza vaccination coverage for indicated patients in various health systems.","Brombacher, Felix; Sanftenberg, Linda; Klug, Stefanie J; Schelling, Jörg; Gensichen, Jochen",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,229,24

Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung samples of patients with COVID-19 and to compare them to pandemic influenza A virus H1N1 subtype 2009 and control cases. Approach and Results: Postmortem lung samples (COVID-19 group =6 cases; H1N1 group =10 cases, and control group =11 cases) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-IL (interleukin)-6, anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-&#945;, anti-ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and anticaspase-1. From the result, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and suggested the participation of the pyroptosis pathway in the pulmonary samples. These conditions might lead to systemic thrombotic events that could impair the clinical staff's efforts to avoid fatal outcomes. One of the health professionals' goals should be to identify the high risk of thrombosis patients early to block endotheliopathy and its consequences.","Nagashima, Seigo; Mendes, Monalisa Castilho; Camargo Martins, Ana Paula; Borges, Nícolas Henrique; Godoy, Thiago Mateus; Miggiolaro, Anna Flavia Ribeiro Dos Santos; da Silva Dezidério, Felipe; Machado-Souza, Cleber; de Noronha, Lucia",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,229,1

METHODS: This single center retrospective observational study included all patients over 60 years old admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of hip fracture during March and April 2020. Exclusion criteria were periprosthetic or pathologic fractures and multitrauma. We collected the same data on all patients with hip fractures admitted during March and April of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Mean patient age increased from 81.7 to 85.0 years. Only two of 49 patients tested positive for COVID-19. The data show a decrease of 38% in fracture load, but a striking decrease of 85% and 59% among sexagenarians and septuagenarian, respectively. There was no decrease among nonagenarians. Early mortality, both at 30 days and 90 days, was twice as common during the pandemic. However, stratification by age group demonstrated that the risks of early mortality were the same as previous years. Mean waiting time for surgery decreased from 27.5 to 18.9 hours. Patient discharge to home over a rehabilitation facility increased from 9% to 17. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic affected the epidemiology of hip fractures in the elderly.

The Xpert 4-in-1 assay demonstrated high concordance with the comparator assays, with overall agreement for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV at 99.64%, 100%, 99.64%, and 100%, respectively, and a high kappa value ranging from 0.99 to 1.00, indicating an almost perfect correlation between assays. The cycle threshold value association between positive samples also showed a good correlation between assays. In conclusion, the overall performance of the Xpert 4-in-1 assay was highly comparable to that of the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Flu/RSV assays for the detection and differentiation of SARS CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV in NP specimens.","Leung, Eddie Chi-Man; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Lee, May Kin-Ping; Tang, Kevin Pui-San; Li, Daniel Kwok-Cheung; Lai, Raymond Wai-Man",J. clin. microbiol,229,10

METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients from a Long-term COVID-19 Clinic referred to electrophysiological examination with the suspicion of mono- or polyneuropathy were included. Examinations were performed from 77 to 255 (median: 216) days after acute COVID-19. None of the patients had received treatment at the intensive care unit. Of these, 10 patients were not even hospitalized. Conventional nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative electromyography (qEMG) findings from three muscles were compared with 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: qEMG showed myopathic changes in one or more muscles in 11 patients (55%). Motor unit potential duration was shorter in patients compared to healthy controls in biceps brachii (10.02 ± 0.28 vs 11.75 ± 0.21), vastus medialis (10.86 ± 0.37 vs 12.52 ± 0.19) and anterior tibial (11.76 ± 0.31 vs 13.26 ± 0.21) muscles. All patients with myopathic qEMG reported about physical fatigue and 8 patients about myalgia while 3 patients without myopathic changes complained about physical fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term COVID-19 does not cause large fibre neuropathy, but myopathic changes are seen. SIGNIFICANCE: Myopathy may be an important cause of physical fatigue in long-term COVID-19 even in non-hospitalized patients.","Agergaard, J; Leth, S; Pedersen, T H; Harbo, T; Blicher, J U; Karlsson, P; Østergaard, L; Andersen, H; Tankisi, H",Clin Neurophysiol,229,11

Notably, diabetes has been shown to be one of the strongest factors influencing healthcare outcome in COVID-19 infections. Though it has long been noted that lymphocytes upregulate insulin receptors following immune activation, until recently, this observation has received little attention. Here, we point out key findings implicating dysregulated insulin signalling in immune cells as a possible contributing factor in the immune pathology associated with diabetes. Mechanistically, insulin, by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, regulates various aspects of both myeloid cells and lymphocytes, such as cell survival, metabolic reprogramming and the polarization and differentiation of immune cells. PI3K signalling is also supressed by immune checkpoint proteins, suggesting that insulin signalling may antagonize peripheral tolerance. Remarkably, it has also recently been shown that, following insulin binding, the insulin receptor translocates to the nucleus where it plays a key role in regulating the transcription of various immune-related genes, including pathways involved in viral infections. Taken together, these observations suggest that dysregulated insulin signalling may directly contribute to a defective immune response during COVID-19 infections.","van Niekerk, Gustav; van der Merwe, Michelle; Engelbrecht, Anna-Mart",Immunology,229,16

This often causes painful pressure injuries. The aim of this study is to value the use of anesthetic cream and collagen veil masks for the treatment of pain. We also evaluated the possible psychological impact on healthcare workers involved in the emergency, which is currently a hot topic in the worldwide literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied lidocaine idrochloride 5% cream and a collagen veil mask respectively before and after each work shift. We evaluated the improvement of pain symptoms through VAS assessments. We used a modified Maslach burnout inventory as well to evaluate the psychological impact of our treatments on healthcare workers. RESULTS: A significant reduction of pain was detected within the first 3 days, but this was not significant over the long period (10 days). Otherwise, we saw a significant improvement of the psychological assessment (p<0,05). CONCLUSIONS: Parameters such as pain or psychological stress are not objective, but, anyway, our data show a reduction of pain due to continuative PPE wearing and a significant improvement of psychological wellness of healthcare workers from two different countries, a finding which should not be undervalued by all the health caregivers not directly involved in COVID-19 pandemic.","Giardino, Francesco Ruben; Cuomo, Roberto; Sisti, Andrea; Han, Jingjian; Giuseppe, Nisi; Grimaldi, Luca",Acta Biomed,229,24

From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assay's performance. RESULTS: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 µL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments.

The treatment of the disease largely remains symptomatic but repurposed drugs used to treat other disease conditions are being used to treat moderate to severe form of the disease. As the clinical trials for these drugs are ongoing, we conducted this survey to know the physicians' medical treatment plan for COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: It was a web-based questionnaire study. Institutional ethical committee clearance was taken before the commencement of the study. There were a total of 17 questions, the first 6 being about the demographics, place of work, and whether the clinician was involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. Subsequent 11 questions were to assess physician's awareness and plan of the medical management of the COVID-19 patients. Results: The majority of the clinicians were aware of the various treatment modalities available for the treatment of COVID-19. Regarding the plan for use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 55% of the total respondents intended to use the drug in combination with azithromycin, even as 62% agreed that there was no clear evidence yet. About 90% of all clinicians, from junior residents to consultants, were monitoring electrocardiogram (ECG) during HCQ therapy; however, there were 10% of physicians who were not practicing ECG monitoring. About 68% of clinicians were aware of the various therapeutic options being tested, like convalescent plasma, lopinavir-ritonavir, and 64% knew about remdesivir. There was divergence regarding the use of steroids in a cytokine storm among the physicians, with only 39% of consultants planning to use steroids whereas about 50% of junior residents and 79% of junior consultants were planning to use the drug. Conclusion: The majority of the clinicians involved in the management of COVID-19 were aware of the various drug modalities available for treatment. However, more emphasis on the adverse effects and possible drug interactions is required. There is disaccord regarding the use of steroids in cytokine storm in COVID-19 and further guidelines and educational programs should address these issues. Clinical significance: Clinicians have to be made more aware of the possible adverse effects and drug interactions of the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. The treatment of the serious, cytokine storm syndrome and the role of steroids must be elucidated as soon as it is feasible. How to cite this article: Maddani SS, Chaudhuri S, Deepa HC, Amara V.

We review the adaptations and challenges surrounding the preparation and response for pediatric emergency patients, with a specific focus on operational modifications, evolving personal protected equipment (PPE) needs, protected resuscitation responses, clinical characteristics in children, and the unintended effects on children and youth. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has thus far proven to have a milder course in children, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic carriage or typical viral symptoms, to novel clinical entities such as 'COVID toes' and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), the latter associated with potentially significant morbidity. It has had an important effect on primary prevention, injury rates, reduced presentations for emergency care, and increased mental health, abuse and neglect rates in children and youth. PEDs have prepared successfully. The most significant adjustments have occurred with screening, testing, and consistent and effective use of PPE, along with protected responses to resuscitation, adaptations to maintain family-centered care, and technological advances in communication and virtual care. Simulation has been key to the successful implementation of many of these strategies. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has pushed PEDs to rapidly adapt to evolving clinical and societal needs, with both resultant challenges and positive advances. Further experience and research will guide how in the face of a global pandemic we can further optimize the clinical and operational care of children and youth, ensure robust educational training programs, and maintain provider safety and wellness.","Beno, Suzanne; Ross, Caitlin; Principi, Tania",Curr Opin Pediatr,229,16

A marked increase in dry eye symptoms among regular mask users was reported, but the prevalence of this condition has not been described in the literature yet. The aim of this observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was to measure self-reported symptoms of mask-associated dry eye in the general population and to identify factors influencing this condition. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was distributed using Google Forms through different social media platforms. RESULTS: A total of 3,605 surveys were analysed. Of the 2,447 having symptoms, 658 (26.9 %) participants reported their symptoms were exacerbated when wearing a mask, thus 18.3 % of all participants experienced mask-associated dry eye. There was no significant association between perceived mask-associated dry eye and age, refractive correction, and pre-existing ocular discomfort, while a positive association was observed with female sex and retail work. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of this survey showed that most people reported no change in ocular symptoms while wearing a face mask, a significant proportion reported an increase in ocular discomfort when wearing a face mask. As face masks are necessary to slow down the spread of COVID-19, it is important not to underestimate all symptoms that could discourage the population from using them. Eye care professionals should verify the presence of clinical signs in all patients complaining about mask-induced eye discomfort, and suggest methods to mitigate this condition.","Boccardo, Laura",Cont. lens anterior eye,229,23

Specific stress stimuli prompt dedicated stress kinases to phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2) in turn sequesters the eIF2-specific guanine exchange factor eIF2B to block eIF2 recycling, thereby halting translation initiation and reducing global protein synthesis. To circumvent stress-induced translational shutdown, viruses encode ISR antagonists. Those identified so far prevent or reverse eIF2 phosphorylation. We now describe two viral proteins-one from a coronavirus and the other from a picornavirus-that have independently acquired the ability to counteract the ISR at its very core by acting as a competitive inhibitor of p-eIF2-eIF2B interaction. This allows continued formation of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex and unabated global translation at high p-eIF2 levels that would otherwise cause translational arrest. We conclude that eIF2 and p-eIF2 differ in their interaction with eIF2B to such effect that p-eIF2-eIF2B association can be selectively inhibited.","Rabouw, Huib H; Visser, Linda J; Passchier, Tim C; Langereis, Martijn A; Liu, Fan; Giansanti, Piero; van Vliet, Arno L W; Dekker, José G; van der Grein, Susanne G; Saucedo, Jesús G; Anand, Aditya A; Trellet, Mikael E; Bonvin, Alexandre M J J; Walter, Peter; Heck, Albert J R; de Groot, Raoul J; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",Nat. microbiol,229,1

D-dimer has been found to be an essential thromboembolism-associated biomarker; however, the association between absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and level of D-dimer in patients with COVID-19 infection remains unclear. In this study, we enrolled consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), a referral center in central Taiwan with 20 airborne infection isolation rooms. Spearman correlation was used to determine the association between ANC and level of D-dimer in distinct time periods. A total of 28 consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection were enrolled, and 32.1% (9/28) of them required mechanical ventilation. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation had a higher ANC (8225 vs. 3427/µL, p < 0.01) and levels of D-dimer (6.0 vs. 0.6 mg/L, p < 0.01) compared with those without mechanical ventilation. Notably, we identified five patients with image-proven thromboembolic events during the hospital course, with the number of patients with pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke were 2, 1, and 2, respectively. We found that ANC within 4 days correlated with the level of D-dimer to a moderate level (r = 0.71, p < 0.05), and the association between ANC and D-dimer no longer exist after day 5. In conclusion, we found highly prevalent thromboembolic events among patients with severe COVID-19 infection in central Taiwan and identified the association between early ANC and D-dimer.

There is currently no drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for which efficacy on the virus has been proved. Therefore, the only strategy against this virus is to apply measures that are capable of reducing its spread, such as isolation and quarantine, social distancing, community-wide containment, and strict enforcement of hygiene. Quarantine has proved to be effective in combating the spread of the virus; however, it has inevitably led to a radical change in the lives of people. Studies have been conducted in Italy and some European countries to highlight the role that quarantine has played in determining the lifestyle changes both in eating habits and physical activity and their possible correlation with increase in weight. The selection criteria involved answering a questionnaire that included information on the weight status and at least one of the other two aspects: changes in eating habits and/or physical activity during the quarantine period. The results obtained indicate, in general, that the negative effect of quarantine was on eating habits and physical activity.

METHODS: A mixed method cross-sectional survey was conducted, seeking the views and experiences of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal medically qualified and Allied Health Professionals in the United Kingdom. Descriptive statistical analysis was employed for quantitative data and a qualitative content analysis undertaken for qualitative data. Findings were presented in accordance with the four key issues. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety professionals (206 physiotherapists, 78 medically qualified professionals, 6 ‘other’ therapists) participated in the survey. Of the 290 participants, 260 (90%) were not using VC prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 248 respondents (86%) were unsure whether their professional indemnity insurance covered VC, 136 (47%) had considered how they would handle an issue of safeguarding whilst the remainder had not, 126 (43%) had considered what they would do if, during a virtual consultation, a patient suffered an injury (e.g. bang on their head) or a fall (e.g. mechanical or a medical event like syncope) and 158 (54%) reported they felt the current technological solutions are secure in terms of patient data.

According to a very recent literature, the imposed lockdown and social distancing measures have generated a series of negative outcomes, including fear of the future, anxiety, and somatization symptoms. Few studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of parents and children, and still fewer studies have assessed the relationship between the psychological health of parents and children. The present study aimed at understanding the effect of parents’ psychological distress and verbal aggression on behavioral and emotional symptoms of children during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using an online survey administered in the first weeks of the lockdown in Italy, we explored the mediating effects of parent verbal hostility and child emotional symptoms on the relationship between parent distress and child hyperactivity/inattention in a sample of 878 Italian parents (87.4% mothers; mean(age) = 40.58). Two hypotheses were proposed: (1) parent distress would significantly predict child hyperactivity/inattention, and (2) parent verbal hostility and child emotional symptoms would mediate the association between parent distress and child hyperactivity/inattention. The serial mediated model confirmed both hypotheses, suggesting that higher rates of psychological distress in parents were associated with higher levels of hyperactivity/inattention in children. Parent verbal hostility and child emotional problems were also found to positively mediate this relation. Our results may be used to improve sociopsychological interventions in the general population in the near future. They may also contribute to the clinical definition of therapeutic paths for parents and families.","Marchetti, Daniela; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Mazza, Cristina; Roma, Paolo; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina",Front Psychol,229,27

Engagement of these pattern recognition receptors triggers a series of signaling pathways that culminate in the production of antiviral mediators such as type I interferons. Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) acts as a central hub for signal transduction initiated by RIG-I-like receptors, which predominantly recognize viral RNA. MAVS expression and function are regulated by both post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, of which ubiquitination and phosphorylation play the most important roles in modulating MAVS function. Increasing evidence indicates that viruses can escape the host antiviral response by interfering at multiple points in the MAVS signaling pathways, thereby maintaining viral survival and replication. This review summarizes recent studies on the mechanisms by which MAVS expression and signaling are normally regulated and on the various strategies employed by viruses to antagonize MAVS activity, which may provide new insights into the design of novel antiviral agents.","Ren, Zhihua; Ding, Ting; Zuo, Zhicai; Xu, Zhiwen; Deng, Junliang; Wei, Zhanyong",Front Immunol,229,2

Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication.","Strauss, Ellen G.; De Groot, Raoul J.; Levinson, Randy; Strauss, James H.",Virology,229,17

Disinfectant Quats have very low vapor pressure, and following the use phase of the products in which they are found, disposal is typically “down-the-drain” to wastewater treatment systems. Consequently, the potential for the greatest environmental effect is to the aquatic environment, from treated effluent, and potentially to soils, which might be amended with wastewater biosolids. Among the earliest used and still common disinfectant Quats are the alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC) compounds and the dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) compounds. They are cationic surfactants often found in consumer and commercial surface cleaners. Because of their biocidal properties, disinfectant Quats are heavily regulated for human and environmental safety around the world. Consequently, there is a robust database of information regarding the ecological hazards and environmental fate of ADBAC and DDAC; however, some of the data presented are from unpublished studies that have been submitted to and reviewed by regulatory agencies (i.e., EPA and European Chemicals Agency) to support antimicrobial product registration. We summarize the available environmental fate data and the acute and chronic aquatic ecotoxicity data for freshwater species, including algae, invertebrates, fish, and plants using peer-reviewed literature and unpublished data submitted to and summarized by regulatory agencies. The lower limit of the range of the ecotoxicity data for disinfectant Quats tends to be lower than that for other surface active agents, such as nonionic or anionic surfactants. However, ecotoxicity is mitigated by environmental fate characteristics, the data for which we also summarize, including high biodegradability and a strong tendency to sorb to wastewater biosolids, sediment, and soil. As a result, disinfectant Quats are largely removed during wastewater treatment, and those residues discharged in treated effluent are likely to rapidly bind to suspended solids or sediments, thus mitigating their toxicity.","DeLeo, Paul C.; Huynh, Carolyn; Pattanayek, Mala; Schmid, Katherine Clark; Pechacek, Nathan",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,229,1

The sensitivity of the biosensor chip depends on design parameters, illumination format (side vs. top), and flow configuration (parabolic, two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic focused (2DHF and 3DHF)). We study the signal differences between various combinations of these design aspects. Our model is validated against a sample of physical devices. We find that side-illumination with 3DHF produces the strongest and consistent signal, but parabolic flow devices process a sample volume more quickly.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.","Lau, M. S.; Grenfell, B.; Nelson, K.; Lopman, B.",,229,1

Diagnosis, based primarily on histopathological examination of duodenal biopsies, is confounded by poor concordance between pathologists and minimal histological abnormality if insufficient gluten is consumed. CeD pathogenesis involves both CD4(+) T‐cell‐mediated gluten recognition and CD8(+) and γδ T‐cell‐mediated inflammation, with a previous study demonstrating a permanent change in γδ T‐cell populations in CeD. We leveraged this understanding and explored the diagnostic utility of bulk T‐cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in assessing duodenal biopsies in CeD. Genomic DNA extracted from duodenal biopsies underwent sequencing for TCR‐δ (TRD) (CeD, n = 11; non‐CeD, n = 11) and TCR‐γ (TRG) (CeD, n = 33; non‐CeD, n = 21). We developed a novel machine learning‐based analysis of the TCR repertoire, clustering samples by diagnosis. Leave‐one‐out cross‐validation (LOOCV) was performed to validate the classification algorithm. Using TRD repertoire, 100% (22/22) of duodenal biopsies were correctly classified, with a LOOCV accuracy of 91%. Using TCR‐γ (TRG) repertoire, 94.4% (51/54) of duodenal biopsies were correctly classified, with LOOCV of 87%. Duodenal biopsy TRG repertoire analysis permitted accurate classification of biopsies from patients with CeD following a strict gluten‐free diet for at least 6 months, who would be misclassified by current tests. This result reflects permanent changes to the duodenal γδ TCR repertoire in CeD, even in the absence of gluten consumption. Our method could complement or replace histopathological diagnosis in CeD and might have particular clinical utility in the diagnostic testing of patients unable to tolerate dietary gluten, and for assessing duodenal biopsies with equivocal features. This approach is generalisable to any TCR/BCR locus and any sequencing platform, with potential to predict diagnosis or prognosis in conditions mediated or modulated by the adaptive immune response. © 2020 The Authors.

No effective vaccine or treatment to control the virus has been approved yet. Social distancing and precautionary protocols are still the only way to prevent person-to-person transmission. We hope to identify anti-COVID-19 activity of the existing drugs to overcome this pandemic as soon as possible. The present study used HEX and AutoDock Vina softwares to predict the affinity of about 100 medicinal structures toward the active site of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3Clpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), separately. Afterwards, MOE software and the pharmacophore-derived query methodology were employed to determine the pharmacophore model of their inhibitors. Tegobuvir (19) and compound 45 showed the best binding affinity toward RdRp and 3Clpro of SARS-CoV-2 in silico, respectively. Tegobuvir -previously applied for hepatitis C virus- formed highly stable complex with uncommon binding pocket of RdRp (E total: −707.91 Kcal/mol) in silico. In addition to compound 45, tipranavir (28) and atazanavir (26) as FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitors were tightly interacted with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease as well. Based on pharmacophore modelling, a good structural pattern for potent candidates against SARS-CoV-2 main enzymes is suggested. Re-tasking or taking inspiration from the structures of tegobuvir and tipranavir can be a proper approach toward coping with the COVID-19 in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost.","Mosayebnia, Mona; Hajiagha Bozorgi, Atefeh; Rezaeianpour, Maliheh; Kobarfard, Farzad",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,229,16

In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the oral and intestinal flora before and after the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in 53 COVID-19 patients, and then examined their microbiome alterations in comparison to 76 healthy individuals. A total of 140 throat swab samples and 81 fecal samples from these COVID-19 patients during hospitalization, and 44 throat swab samples and 32 fecal samples from sex and age-matched healthy individuals were collected and then subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and viral load inspection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with alterations of the microbiome community in patients as indicated by both alpha and beta diversity indexes. Several bacterial taxa were identified related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, wherein elevated Granulicatella and Rothia mucilaginosa were found in both oral and gut microbiome. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load in those samples was also calculated to identify potential dynamics between COVID-19 and the microbiome. These findings provide a meaningful baseline for microbes in the digestive tract of COVID-19 patients and will shed light on new dimensions for disease pathophysiology, potential microbial biomarkers, and treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Wu, Yongjian; Cheng, Xiaomin; Jiang, Guangmin; Tang, Huishu; Ming, Siqi; Tang, Lantian; Lu, Jiahai; Guo, Cheng; Shan, Hong; Huang, Xi",NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes,229,23

Studies were clustered by population, intervention, and outcomes, and narrative synthesis was undertaken. Of 1394 records identified, nine met the inclusion criteria: two were deemed to be of poor methodological quality, six of fair quality, and one of good quality. Three clusters of technologies were identified: virtual reality, wearables, and software applications. We identified weak evidence that digital technologies may provide less benefit to people with dementia than people with MCI. Future research should address the methodological limitations and narrow scope of existing work.

We test the hypothesis that these groups are following these recommendations and are more likely to undertake social distancing. METHODS: We conducted an open online survey of 4,676 U.S. adults aged 18 and older between April 4 and April 7, 2020. We model the effects of age and common COVID-19 symptoms in the last two weeks on going out of the home for non-healthcare reasons the day before taking the survey, using a logistic model and the number of close contacts (within 6 feet) that respondents had with non-household members, using a Poisson count model. Our models control for several covariates, including other flu-like symptoms, sex, education, income, whether the respondent worked in February, household size, population density in the respondent’s ZIP code, state fixed effects, and the day of completion of the survey. We also weight our analyses to make the sample representative of the U.S. adult population. FINDINGS: About 52 percent of the adult United States population went out of their home the previous day. On average, adults had close contact with 1.9 non-household members. We find that having at least one COVID-19 symptom (fever, dry cough, or shortness of breath) increased the likelihood of going out the previous day and having additional close contacts with non-household members; however, the estimates were not statistically significant. When disaggregating our analysis by COVID-19 symptoms, we find no strong evidence of greater social distancing by people with a fever or cough in the last two weeks, but we do find that those who experienced shortness of breath have fewer close contacts, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.30–0.78). Having other flu-like symptoms reduces the odds of going out by 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18–0.60) and the incidence rate of having close contacts by 42 percent (IRR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38–0.88). We find that older people are just as likely to leave their homes as younger people, but people over the age of 50 had less than half the predicted number of close contacts than those who were younger than 30. Our approach has the limitation that the survey sample is self-selected. Our findings may therefore be subject to selection bias that is not adequately controlled for by weighting. In addition, the possibility exists of confounding of the results due to omitted variable bias. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that older people are having significantly fewer close contacts than younger people, which is in line with the public health authorities’ recommendations. We also find that people experiencing shortness of breath are practicing more intense social distancing. However, we find that those with two other common COVID-19 symptoms, fever and dry cough, are not engaging in greater social distancing, suggesting that increased targeting on relevant symptoms, and messaging, may be required.","Canning, David; Karra, Mahesh; Dayalu, Rashmi; Guo, Muqi; Bloom, David E.",medRxiv,229,11

It has a vast spectrum of clinical presentations and can affect various organs. Rarely, it has been reported to cause acalculous cholecystitis in a non ICU setting patient. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare association of COVID 19 with acalculous cholecystitis in a 40 years old healthy woman. She developed fever, malaise, generalized body weakness, and right hypochondrial pain after fourteen days of COVID 19 infection, raising the possibility of Post COVID dysregulated immune response resulting in acalculous cholecystitis. She was managed conservatively with broad spectrum antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Acalculous cholecystitis primarily occurs due to the gall bladder's hypomotility and most commonly seen in critically ill patients such as severe burns, mechanically ventilated patients, and prolonged parenteral nutrition. The management depends upon treating the underlying pathology and, in some severe cases, may need surgical intervention as well. Up to our knowledge, COVID 19, causing acalculous cholecystitis, is a rare association described only in a few critically ill patients but not in young, healthy patients. It can be attributed to the body's dysregulated immunological response against the virus resulting in systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is are no clear guidelines for managing acute cholecystitis in COVID-19 patients. It depends on the patient's clinical state and disease severity. We aim to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and management in such clinical scenarios to avoid fatal complications.","Alhassan, Shahda Mohamed; Iqbal, Phool; Fikrey, Lubna; Mohamed Ibrahim, Mohanad Ibrahim; Qamar, Muhammad Sohaib; Chaponda, Masautso; Munir, Waqar",Ann Med Surg (Lond),229,30

Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.","Alvarez-Ramirez, Jose; MERAZ, MONICA",,229,16

Smoking in public places is prohibited in The Gambia but there is no information on the level of exposure to second-hand smoke among adolescents and adults 15–64 years. The aim of this study was to assess the level and predictors of exposure to second-hand smoke in public places and compliance with smoke-free regulations in The Gambia. Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in an established Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). A total of 4547 participants (15–64 years) from households within the Farafenni HDSS were interviewed at their homes but only 3343 were included in our analysis. Factors associated with exposure to second-hand smoke in public places were assessed by three different multivariable regression models. Results: Exposure to tobacco smoke in public places was high (66.1%), and higher in men (79.9%) than women (58.7%). Besides being male, less education, lower household income, urban residence and not aware of smoke-free regulations were strongly associated with exposure to second-hand smoke. Conclusion: Despite existing smoke-free regulations, reported exposure to second-hand smoke remains high in public places in The Gambia. The Ministry of Health should continue to strengthen their advocacy and sensitization programs to ensure smoke-free regulations are fully implemented. Some population subgroups are at a higher risk of exposure and could be targeted by interventions; and settings where these subgroups are exposed should be targeted by enforcement efforts.","Cham, Bai; Mdege, Noreen Dadirai; Bauld, Linda; Britton, John; D’Alessandro, Umberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,229,24

Since stretchable electronics use less printed circuit boards (PCBs), it is expected that the environmental performance of a stretchable electronics-based device is better than a rigid electronics-based device that provides the same functionalities. Yet, such a study is rarely available. Thus, the main purpose of this research is to perform a comparative life cycle analysis of stretchable and rigid electronics-based devices. This research combines both the case study approach and the research review approach. For the case study, a cardiac monitoring device with both stretchable and rigid electronics is used. The ISO 14044:2006 standard's prescribed LCA approach and ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (Hierarchist) are followed for the impact assessment using the SimaPro 9.1 software. The LCA results show that the stretchable cardiac monitoring device has better environmental performance in all eighteen impact categories. This research also shows that the manufacturing process of stretchable electronics has lower environmental impacts than those for rigid electronics. The main reasons for the improved environmental performance of stretchable electronics are lower consumption of raw material as well as decreased energy consumption during manufacturing. Based on the LCA results of a cardiac monitoring device, the study concludes that stretchable electronics and their manufacturing process have better environmental performance in comparison with the rigid electronics and their manufacturing process.","Kokare, S.; Asif, F.

Two aspects were specifically considered: 1) reported changes in intake of specific food categories and 2) effect on healthy eating, operationalized as adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS score). Respondents (N = 2,462) completed a 44-items self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of their socio-demographic characteristics, general food habits, and consumption frequency of selected foods (mainly related to the MedDiet) during the lockdown. The data indicated that the lockdown has affected dietary habits of adult Danes to a relatively limited degree. The most important findings were that a substantial proportion of respondents (≥28%) reported eating more, snacking more, exercising less, and gaining weight during the lockdown. Results could be linked to the amount of time spent at home (e.g., a higher cooking frequency) a higher degree of emotional eating during the lockdown (e.g., a higher consumption of pastries and alcohol). Women were generally affected to a higher degree than men. Additionally, dietary changes during the lockdown to a certain degree reflected pre-existing (un)healthy eating habits, as positive health outcomes were observed in respondents with a high MEDAS score and negative outcomes (e.g., weight gain and higher intakes of pastries and carbonated beverages) were associated with respondents with a low MEDAS score. These changes, if sustained long-term, are potentially concerning from a public health perspective, especially given that more than half of the respondents were characterized by a low adherence to the MedDiet.","Giacalone, Davide; Frøst, Michael Bom; Rodríguez-Pérez, Celia",Front Nutr,229,16

Given the presence of viral RNA in feces in around 40% of infected persons, wastewater-based epidemiology has been proposed as an addition to disease-based surveillance to assess the spread of the virus at the community level. Here we have explored the possibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sewage samples to evaluate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level from routine wastewater testing, and compared these results with the virus diversity in patients from the Netherlands and Belgium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of viruses belonging to the most prevalent clades (19A, 20A and 20B) in both countries. Clades 19B and 20C were not identified, while they were present in clinical samples during the same period. Low frequency variant (LFV) analysis showed that some known LFVs can be associated with particular clusters within a clade, different to those of their consensus sequences, suggesting the presence of at least 2 clades within a single sewage sample. Additionally, combining genome consensus and LFV analyses we found a total of 57 unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which have not been described before. In conclusion, this work illustrates how NGS analysis of wastewater can be used to approximate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in a community.","Izquierdo Lara, R.

At the current rate of vaccine distribution (March 15, 2021), universal herd immunity in the USA could be reached in roughly 4.5 months. However, distributing vaccines according to where the virus spreads more easily (dense counties with high R0 values), herd immunity would be reached simultaneously in all counties almost two months earlier and would require roughly 40% fewer vaccine doses. Furthermore, under the current distribution strategy densely populated counties would reach herd immunity last, with negative epidemiological and socio-economic consequences. In sum, it would be more fair and efficient to distribute vaccines to jurisdictions that need them most to reach herd immunity.","Ives, A. R.; Bozzuto, C.",,229,16

The use of immunosuppressive agents, such as high dose corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors (e.g., Tocilizumab) has been suggested to contrast the hyperinflammatory process involved in the pathogenesis of the severe disease, with conflicting evidence. Among the drawbacks of immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of reactivation of latent infections, including parasitic infestations, is to be considered. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 59-year-old Italian patient treated with high dose intravenous dexamethasone and two intravenous doses of Tocilizumab for interstitial bilateral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed itching, abdominal pain, and an increased eosinophil count. Stool examination confirmed the presence of S. stercoralis larvae. The patient was treated with a 4-day course of Ivermectin with full recovery. DISCUSSION: We report the first case of S. stercoralis infection following an 11-day treatment with high-dose steroids and Tocilizumab for severe COVID-19.

The disease can be very debilitating with vision loss, motor and sensory disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The clinical course may present as a relapsing‐remitting disease course, a progressive disease course, or a combination thereof. The etiology of MS is unknown. Though many viruses have been shown to be associated with MS, no one virus has ever been demonstrated to be the cause of MS. In addition, MS is thought to have an autoimmune component. Molecular mimicry is one hypothesis put forth which could reconcile the diverse pathology and etiology of MS. Molecular mimicry occurs when peptides from pathogens share sequence or structural similarities with self‐antigens. Infection with various pathogens, each with its individual molecular mimic to a CNS antigen, may explain the inability of investigators to link one specific virus to MS. Molecular mimicry may be mediated through human leukocyte antigen class I‐ and class II‐restricted T cells and antibodies, which may explain the diversity in phenotype. Aspects of molecular mimicry will be discussed in relation to each of these immune system components. Examples of various molecular mimics will be discussed with a particular focus on the CNS and MS. Molecular mimicry alone may not be able to induce disease; priming of the immune system by infection with a pathogen that carries a molecular mimic to self may have to be followed by a later nonspecific immunologic challenge in order for disease to be initiated. Recent research into this priming and triggering of disease will be discussed in relation to an animal model for MS.","Libbey, Jane E.; McCoy, Lori L.; Fujinami, Robert S.",Int Rev Neurobiol,229,21

Using weekly cut-offs, we sought to determine the probability that an individual would return to clinic given that they had not yet returned in order to identify the LTFU cut-off that could be used to inform clinical management and tracing procedures. METHODS: Individuals who initiated ART with Dignitas International supported sites (n = 22) in Zomba, Malawi between January 1 2007-June 30 2010 and were ≥ 1 week late for a follow-up visit were included. Lateness was categorized using weekly cut-offs from ≥1 to ≥26 weeks late. At each weekly cut-off, the proportion of patients who returned for a subsequent follow-up visit were identified. Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) were plotted to determine the probability of returning as a function of lateness. Hazard functions were plotted to demonstrate the proportion of patients who returned each weekly interval relative to those who had yet to return. RESULTS: In total, n = 4484 patients with n = 7316 follow-up visits were included. The number of included follow-up visits per patient ranged from 1–10 (median: 1). Both the CDF and hazard function demonstrated that after being ≥9 weeks late, the proportion of new patients who returned relative to those who had yet to return decreased substantially.

Immunization has been shown to provide the best protection against the flu. Increasing flu vaccination rates can reduce the number of patients who get the flu and seek care for non-specific symptoms thus making detection of the coronavirus more efficient. METHOD A quality improvement project was implemented to increase the number of influenza vaccines received by employees at an onsite employer-based health clinic. Anonymous pre- and post-surveys were used to assess the flu knowledge of employees. Employees from a large financial group, who voluntarily participated, received an educational handout at the onsite health fair or at a lunch and learn. Full-time employees who carried their employer's health insurance were eligible to participate, whereas, dependents and contract employees were excluded. FINDINGS The number of employees who received the vaccination increased during the fall of 2019 (n = 406) when compared with the previous year (n = 337). Nineteen percent (n = 170) of employees completed surveys. There were statistically significantly more post- than pre-survey responses reflecting the participants' perceived knowledge of influenza and the flu vaccine. The majority of participants in both the pre- and post-surveys reported that they learned ""a lot"" about both influenza and the flu vaccine.

The introduction of the electronic prescription has had a significant impact on pharmacy workflows, such as the dispensing process. This inevitably has significant sociotechnical implications. We examine the impact of digitalization on the dispensing process and the sociotechnical orientation of a pharmacy. METHODS: We utilize data collected in customer service situations in Finnish community pharmacies at two points in time: in the traditional workflow, when electronic prescriptions were not in use, and in the new direct dispensing workflow, which is the usual delivery model in the case of electronic prescriptions. We analyze this data in terms of changes in workflow efficiency. We also draw on existing literature to build a conceptual model for digitalization in the pharmacy sector from a sociotechnical standpoint. RESULTS: In the Finnish environment, the results, based on our study sample, show that with electronic prescriptions and the direct dispensing model, the delivery time for a single medication over the counter was reduced by 13%. The results also indicate that the process has become more predictable, as the variation in terms of the workflow lead time has decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the dispensing process has become more efficient in terms of time and throughput as well as more technically oriented and predictable. From a sociotechnical perspective, the results indicate that the technical subsystem has strengthened, and pharmacies have adapted to the new technology in the dispensing process.","Peltoniemi, Teijo; Suomi, Reima; Peura, Sirpa; Lähteenoja, Markus N.

Knowledge about human behavior while facing emergencies has become more significant nowadays. This knowledge can help improving our already present defensive responses and natural coping mechanisms when facing imminent dangers, natural disasters, and catastrophes. A new method is here offered to explore the core points of this topic. The Emergency Reaction Questionnaire (ERQ), is proposed for predicting one's reaction and behaviour in an emergency. First, a large item pool was created based on interviews with people facing emergencies on a weekly basis and related literature. The factor structure, reliability and validity were assessed on a large sample of lay people (N = 1115, 440 males) and specific groups of firefighters and people doing extreme sports (N = 85, all males). Participants were Caucasian with an age range of 18–70. We also used measures of anxiety, depression, and sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition and activation and coping in stressful situations. The ERQ was proved to be reliable and consistent in time and having sound psychometric properties both on the community and special samples. Results show that psychometric properties are satisfying; the test has excellent validity ratings. Consequently, the ERQ can be used in future research effectively and facilitate a better understanding of how people react in a highly dangerous situation.

As assessed by a multivariable Cox model, patients with delirium on admission showed an almost twofold increased hazard ratio for in‐hospital mortality with respect to patients without delirium (hazard ratio = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.25–2.83). CONCLUSION: Delirium is prevalent and associated with in‐hospital mortality among older patients hospitalized with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Rebora, Paola; Rozzini, Renzo; Bianchetti, Angelo; Blangiardo, Paolo; Marchegiani, Alice; Piazzoli, Andrea; Mazzeo, Francesca; Cesaroni, Giulia; Chizzoli, Anita; Guerini, Fabio; Bonfanti, Paolo; Morandi, Alessandro; Faraci, Bianca; Gentile, Simona; Bna, Claudio; Savelli, Giordano; Citerio, Giuseppe; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia; Mazzola, Paolo; Bellelli, Giuseppe",J Am Geriatr Soc,229,26

Este atraso en acudir a los servicios de urgencias puede llevar a un empeoramiento clínico y aumentar las complicaciones relacionadas a la enfermedad o al tratamiento recibido. Material y métodos: Realizamos una revisión retrospectiva de tres centros hospitalarios en España e Italia. Fueron incluidos pacientes atendidos en el servicio de urgencias por cólico renal (unilateral o bilateral) secundario a litiasis confirmadas en pruebas de imagen durante los 45 días previos y posteriores a la declaración de estado de alarma de cada país. Se recolectaron datos demográficos, síntomas y signos de presentación, análisis de sangre y orina, pruebas de imagen, y manejo terapéutico. El análisis estadístico se realizó entre dos grupos, Grupo A: pacientes que acudieron antes de la declaración del estado de alarma y Grupo B: Pacientes que acudieron tras la declaración del estado de alarma. Resultados: Un total de 397 pacientes que acudieron a urgencias por cólicos nefríticos secundarios a litiasis fueron incluidos en el estudio, 285 (71.8%) en el Grupo A, y 112 (28.2%) en el Grupo B (p<0.001). Un total de 135 (47.4%) en el Grupo A y 63 (56.3%) en el Grupo B (p=0.11) admitieron haber pospuesto su búsqueda de atención médica urgente. En el momento de la valoración inicial, no se encontraron diferencias entre ambos grupos en los niveles de creatinina sérica, leucocitosis, fiebre, oliguria, dolor, o hidronefrosis. Además, no se observaron diferencias en relación a la estancia media, ingreso en el servicio de urología, o necesidad de tratamientos invasivos. Conclusión: Nuestros resultados muestran una disminución significativa de atenciones en urgencias por cólicos nefríticos tras la declaración del estado de alarma en España e Italia. A diferencia de otros estudios publicados recientemente, no encontramos diferencias en la estancia media, ingreso al servicio de urología, o necesidad de tratamientos invasivos en pacientes que se presentaron antes y después del estado de alarma. Introduction: We hypothesized that the recent COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a delay in renal colic patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) due to the fear of getting infected. This delay may lead to a more severe clinical condition at presentation with possible complications for the patients. Methods: Retrospective review of data collected from three institutions from Spain and Italy. Patients who presented to ED with unilateral or bilateral renal colic caused by imaging confirmed urolithiasis during the 45 days before and after each national lockdown were included. Data collected included patients’ demographics, biochemical urine and blood tests, radiological tests, signs, symptoms and the therapeutic management. Analysis was performed between two groups, Group A: patients presenting prior to the national lockdown date; and Group B: patients presenting after the national lockdown date. Results: A total of 397 patients presented to ED with radiology confirmed urolithiasis and were included in the study. The number of patients presenting to ED with renal/ureteric colic was 285 (71.8%) patients in Group A and 112 (28.2%) patients in Group B (p<0.001). The number of patients reporting a delay in presentation was 135 (47.4%) in Group A and 63 (56.3%) in Group B (p=0.11). At presentation, there were no statistical differences between Group A and Group B regarding the serum creatinine level, C reactive protein, white blood cell count, fever, oliguria, flank pain and hydronephrosis. In addition, no significant differences were observed with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and type of therapy. Conclusions: Data from our study showed a significant reduction in presentations to ED for renal colic after the lockdown in Spain and Italy. However, we did not find any significant difference with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and type of therapy.","Carrion, D M; Mantica, G; Juanilla M, M Antón; Pang, K H; Tappero, S; Rodriguez-Serrano, A; Parodi, S; Crespo-Atín, V; Cansino, R; Terrone, C; Nikles, S; Gomez Rivas, J; Esperto, F",Actas Urol Esp,229,24

The simple negative staining technique of DEM was applied widely to smallpox diagnosis until the world-wide eradication of the human-specific pathogen in 1980. Since then, the threat of smallpox re-emerging through laboratory escape, molecular manipulation, synthetic biology or bioterrorism has not totally disappeared and would be a major problem in an unvaccinated population. Other animal poxviruses may also emerge as human pathogens. With its rapid results (only a few minutes after arrival of the specimen), no requirement for specific reagents and its “open view”, DEM remains an important component of virus diagnosis, particularly because it can easily and reliably distinguish smallpox virus or any other member of the orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus from parapoxviruses (PPV) and the far more common and less serious herpesviruses (herpes simplex and varicella zoster). Preparation, enrichment, examination, internal standards and suitable organisations are discussed to make clear its continuing value as a diagnostic technique.","Gelderblom, Hans R.; Madeley, Dick",Viruses,229,16

Within a short period of time the outbreak developed exponentially into a pandemic that infected millions of people, with a global death toll of more than 500,000 during its first 6 months. Eventually, the novel disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the new virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to all known pandemics throughout history, COVID-19 has been accompanied by a large degree of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and economic disaster worldwide. Despite multiple publications and increasing knowledge regarding the biological secrets of SARS-CoV-2, as of the writing of this paper, there is neither an approved vaccine nor medication to prevent infection or cure for this highly infectious disease. Past pandemics were caused by a wide range of microbes, primarily viruses, but also bacteria. Characteristically, a significant proportion of them originated in different animal species (zoonoses). Since an understanding of the microbial cause of these diseases was unveiled relatively late in human history, past pandemics were often attributed to strange causes including punishment from God, demonic activity, or volatile unspecified substances. Although a high case fatality ratio was common to all pandemic diseases, some striking clinical characteristics of each disease allowed contemporaneous people to clinically diagnose the infection despite null microbiological information. In comparison to past pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 has tricky and complex mechanisms that have facilitated its rapid and catastrophic spread worldwide.","Pitlik, Silvio Daniel",Rambam Maimonides Med J,229,5

Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death in the developing world. Higher-quality etiological data are required to reduce this mortality burden. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of pneumonia etiology among children aged 1–59 months in rural Kenya. Case patients were hospitalized with World Health Organization–defined severe pneumonia (SP) or very severe pneumonia (VSP); controls were outpatient children without pneumonia. We collected blood for culture, induced sputum for culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and obtained oropharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients, and serum for serology and nasopharyngeal swab specimens for multiplex PCR from case patients and controls. Results. Of 984 eligible case patients, 810 (84%) were enrolled in the study; 232 (29%) had VSP. Blood cultures were positive in 52 of 749 case patients (7%). A predominant potential pathogen was identified in sputum culture in 70 of 417 case patients (17%). A respiratory virus was detected by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab specimens in 486 of 805 case patients (60%) and 172 of 369 controls (47%). Only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) showed a statistically significant association between virus detection in the nasopharynx and pneumonia hospitalization (odds ratio, 12.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–51.5). Among 257 case patients in whom all specimens (excluding serum specimens) were collected, bacteria were identified in 24 (9%), viruses in 137 (53%), mixed viral and bacterial infection in 39 (15%), and no pathogen in 57 (22%); bacterial causes outnumbered viral causes when the results of the case-control analysis were considered. Conclusions. A potential etiology was detected in >75% of children admitted with SP or VSP. Except for RSV, the case-control analysis did not detect an association between viral detection in the nasopharynx and hospitalization for pneumonia.","Hammitt, Laura L.; Kazungu, Sidi; Morpeth, Susan C.; Gibson, Dustin G.; Mvera, Benedict; Brent, Andrew J.; Mwarumba, Salim; Onyango, Clayton O.; Bett, Anne; Akech, Donald O.; Murdoch, David R.; Nokes, D.

Although the list of rule-outs for acute or chronic gastritis is extensive, a review of the veterinary literature reveals fewer than 15 articles that have focused on clinical cases of canine gastritis over the last 25 years. The dog frequently appears in the human literature as an experimentally manipulated model for the study of endoscopic techniques or the effect of medications on gastric mucosa. In the veterinary patient, cases of acute gastritis are rarely pursued with the complete diagnostic armamentarium, and cases of chronic gastritis are rarely found to occur as an entity isolated from the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. This article focuses on those findings most clinically relevant to cases of canine gastritis in veterinary medicine.","Webb, Craig; Twedt, David C",Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,229,20
