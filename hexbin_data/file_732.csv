Mycorrhiza refers to an association or symbiosis between plants and fungi that colonize the roots during periods of active plant growth. The intimate symbiotic relationships developed between mycorrhizal fungi and plants, since the colonization of land by the latter, have led to interdependence between these organisms for many basic processes. The fungi require plants to accomplish their life cycle. Plants depend heavily on mycorrhizal fungi for many different functions, such as mineral nutrition and abiotic and biotic stress resistance. Substantial evidence has accumulated in the recent past about how the use of the microsymbiont could significantly contribute in decreasing use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, forestry and flori-hortriculture, especially if combined with other beneficial soil microorganisms. The most common and prevalent arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play an indispensable role in upgrading plant growth, vigor and survival by a positive impact on the nutritional and hydratic status of the plant and on soil health, by increasing the reproductive potential, improving root performance, and providing a natural defence against invaders, including pests and pathogens. The described species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mainly belong to Zygomycetes placed in the order Glomerales. However, the growing of arbuscular mycorrhizae in pure culture in the absence of living host roots is a matter of global concern. Unfortunately, their biotechnological applications cannot be exploited to the level they deserve due to their axenically unculturable nature.","Prasad, R.; Sharma, M.; Chatterjee, S.; Chauhan, G.; Tripathi, S.; Das, A.; Kamal, S.; Rawat, A.

Although disease etiology remains unknown, coronaviruses are suspected to be involved in MS pathology. Molecular mimicry, the recognition of two antigens by a single immune cell, could be the mechanism explaining the link between a viral infection and MS through activation of myelin-reactive T cells by a virus infection in a genetically predisposed individual. Evidence supporting this hypothesis in humans has been accumulated in our laboratory. Human coronavirus (HCoV) — myelin cross-reactive T-cell lines (TCL) were predominantly found in MS patients compared to patients with other neurological or inflammatory diseases, or healthy controls. Moreover, virus-myelin T cell cross-reactivity was confirmed at the clonal level. Molecular mimicry between infectious pathogens such as the ubiquitous human respiratory coronaviruses could, in genetically susceptible individuals, play a role leading to the development of MS. Together with other possible mechanisms such as bystander effects, epitope spreading or even superantigenic activities, this pathogen-associated immune induction could play a role in maintaining and broadening the autoimmune response associated with MS pathology.","Talbot, Pierre J.; Boucher, Annie; Duquette, Pierre; Gruslin, Edith",Experimental Models of Multiple Sclerosis,732,1

Of concern are requirements for massive transfusion and resuscitation that absorb resources and create a short-fall for patients whose injuries are less severe. Additionally, the conventional massive transfusion model of packed RBCs, plasma and platelets actually further dilutes the patient compared to the blood he or she has lost and thus is not the ideal fluid for patients who require this massive transfusion of products. Fresh whole blood has three vital properties: oxygen carrying capacity, volume, and hemostatic effect. In the austere environment of combat the practice of fresh whole blood transfusion has proven beneficial to patients who are coagulopathic and require massive transfusion. Appropriate use following established guidelines can be beneficial and may even be superior to packed RBCs. A fluid containing the vital properties of fresh whole blood would serve as a bridge to allow a patient to be resuscitated without initiating the ‘bloody cycle of death’ that is seen all too often in our current paradigm of massive resuscitation.","McMullin, N.

Here we present a series of five patients with confirmed adenovirus infection treated for ARDS at our quaternary referral institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients were above 18 years old, had confirmed adenovirus infection, and were treated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in our medical intensive care unit (MICU). Demographic and clinical data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, the median age was 28 years, median BMI 28 kg/m(2) median sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score 9, and median acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score 74. All patients received lung-protective mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure and low plateau pressures. Three patients developed severe ARDS, two received prone position ventilation, and one was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median duration of mechanical ventilation, MICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay were 24, 19, and 27 days, respectively. One out of five patients died in our study. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate for adenovirus-associated pneumonia in the literature is estimated to be 40% in those requiring mechanical ventilation. The lower mortality at our institution could be attributed to the use of standardized protocols, which include low tidal volume ventilation, early use of neuromuscular blockade, targeting low plateau pressures, conservative fluid management, and comfort and familiarity with the use of adjunctive and rescue therapies. We recommend testing for adenovirus as part of a routine respiratory viral panel in ARDS patients, and if tested positive, transfer to tertiary or quaternary centers with the experience and rescue modalities needed to manage complicated ARDS patients.

Piperaquine (PPQ) resistance has emerged in Cambodia, compromising an important partner drug that is widely used in China in the form of dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-PPQ. Several mutations in a P. falciparum gene encoding a kelch protein on chromosome 13 (k13) are associated with artemisinin resistance and have arisen spread in the Great Mekong subregion, including the China–Myanmar border. Multiple copies of the plasmepsin II/III (pm2/3) genes, located on chromosome 14, have been shown to be associated with PPQ resistance. METHODS: The therapeutic efficacy of DHA-PPQ for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum was evaluated along the China–Myanmar border from 2010 to 2014. The dry blood spots samples collected in the efficacy study prior DHA-PPQ treatment and from the local hospital by passive detection were used to amplify k13 and pm2. Polymorphisms within k13 were genotyped by capillary sequencing and pm2 copy number was quantified by relative-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Treatment outcome was evaluated with the World Health Organization protocol. A linear regression model was used to estimate the association between the day 3 positive rate and k13 mutation and the relationship of the pm2 copy number variants and k13 mutations. RESULTS: DHA-PPQ was effective for uncomplicated P. falciparum infection in Yunnan Province with cure rates > 95%. Twelve non synonymous mutations in the k13 domain were observed among the 268 samples with the prevalence of 44.0% and the predominant mutation was F446I with a prevalence of 32.8%. Only one sample was observed with multi-copies of pm2, including parasites with and without k13 mutations. The therapeutic efficacy of DHA-PPQ was > 95% along the China–Myanmar border, consistent with the lack of amplification of pm2. CONCLUSION: DHA-PPQ for uncomplicated P. falciparum infection still showed efficacy in an area with artemisinin-resistant malaria along the China–Myanmar border. There was no evidence to show PPQ resistance by clinical study and molecular markers survey. Continued monitoring of the parasite population using molecular markers will be important to track emergence and spread of resistance in this region.","Huang, Fang; Shrestha, Biraj; Liu, Hui; Tang, Lin-Hua; Zhou, Shui-Sen; Zhou, Xiao-Nong; Takala-Harrison, Shannon; Ringwald, Pascal; Nyunt, Myaing M.; Plowe, Christopher V.",Malar J,732,1

However, CPAP failure rates of 50% are reported in large randomized controlled trials. A possible explanation for these failure rates is the application of insufficient low levels of PEEP during nasal CPAP treatment to maintain adequate functional residual capacity shortly after birth. The optimum PEEP level to treat symptoms of respiratory distress in very low birth weight infants has not been assessed in clinical studies. The aim of the study is to compare two different PEEP levels during nasal CPAP treatment in preterm infants. METHODS: In this randomized multicenter trial, 216 preterm infants born at 26 + 0–29 + 6 gestational weeks will be allocated to receive a higher (6–8 cmH(2)O) or a lower (3–5 cmH(2)O) PEEP during neonatal resuscitation and the first 120 h of life. The PEEP level within each group will be titrated throughout the intervention based on the FiO(2) (fraction of inspired oxygen concentration) requirements to keep oxygenation within the target range. The primary outcome is defined as the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation for > 1 h or being not ventilated but reaching one of the two pre-defined CPAP failure criteria (FiO(2) > 0.5 for > 1 h or pCO(2) ≥ 70 mmHg in two consecutive blood gas analyses at least 2 h apart). DISCUSSION: Based on available data from the literature, the optimum level of PEEP that most effectively treats respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants is unknown, since the majority of large clinical trials applied a wide range of PEEP levels (4–8 cmH(2)O). The rationale for our study hypothesis is that the early application of a higher PEEP level will more effectively counteract the collapsing properties of the immature and surfactant-deficient lungs and that the level of inspired oxygen may serve as a surrogate marker to guide PEEP titration. Finding the optimum noninvasive continuous distending pressure during early nasal CPAP is required to improve CPAP efficacy and as a consequence to reduce the exposure to ventilator-induced lung injury and the incidence of chronic lung disease in this vulnerable population of very preterm infants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study 30 patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. Subjects in the study group received three sessions of focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy, whereas the control group underwent a sham therapy. Patients were evaluated 3 and 12 weeks after treatment. The primary outcome was the visual analogue scale score. Secondary outcome measurements included hand grip strength, Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire, SF-36 Health Survey and electrodiagnostic measurements. RESULTS: A significant improvement of visual analogue scale at week 3 (p = 0.018) and week 12 (p = 0.007) as well as hand grip strength at week 12 (p = 0.019) could be observed in the study group.

To address this problem while maintaining patient safety, this pilot study explored the feasibility of using a wearable headset to live stream teaching ward rounds to remotely based medical students. METHODS: Three live streamed teaching ward rounds were delivered to three groups of medical students (n=53) using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device and Microsoft Teams software, and results pooled for analysis. Feedback was gathered from students and instructors using the evaluation of technology-enhanced learning materials (ETELM). Patient feedback was gathered using the Communication Assessment Tool to explore any impact on interpersonal communication. RESULTS: The response rate for the ETELM-learner perceptions was 58% (31/53), 100% for the ETELM-instructor perceptions. Students strongly agreed that the overall quality of the teaching session and instructors was excellent. However, 32% experienced issues with audio or video quality and one remote student reported cyber sickness. The statement ‘educational activities encouraged engagement with session materials/content’ returned the most varied response. Instructors reported technological problems with delivery while using the HoloLens 2 device and environmental noise in the ward was a disruptive factor. Preparation and skilled facilitation were key to delivering a high-quality teaching session. Patients reacted generally favourably to the technology and no negative effects on interpersonal communication were identified. CONCLUSION: The experience of live streamed ward rounds was well received by patients, medical students and teaching faculty. However, there remain limitations to the routine use of HoloLens 2 technology in our setting including steep learning curves, hardware costs and environmental factors such as noise and WiFi connectivity. Live streamed ward rounds have potential postpandemic implications for the judicious use of resources, and the possibility for few educationally minded clinicians to teach at scale in a patient-friendly manner.","Mill, Tobias; Parikh, Shefali; Allen, Archie; Dart, Gemma; Lee, Daniel; Richardson, Charlotte; Howell, Keith; Lewington, Andrew",BMJ Simul Technol Enhanc Learn,732,16

The national-wide lockdown in Tunisia, from Mars to Mai 2020 had substantially decreased healthcare accessibility and drugs availability. In addition, the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was likely to lead to anxiety and negative emotional and behavioral reactions which are thought to be predictors of active IBD and relapses. We aimed to assess the hospital admission and complication rates in patients with IBD during the first wave of COIVD-19 infection in Tunisia and to compare them to those observed during the same period one year earlier. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of patients with IBD admitted to our department during the period of time following the national lock-down in Tunisia ( from Mai, the 4th to August, the 31th). We compared the total global admission rate, IBD related complications, surgery rates and postoperative complications between the study period (P1) and the corresponding period of the previous year (P2 : from Mai, the 4th to August, the 31th, 2019). The Chi square test and Fisher exact test were used for analysis of categorical data. RESULTS: Eighty patients with IBD were included in this study (44 patients in P1 and 36 patients in P2), 73.7% of which (n=59) had Crohn disease. The sex ratio was 1.16 and the mean age was33.8 years ± 11.9. The mean follow-up period was 5 years. In 17.5% of cases (n=14), the IBD was diagnosed during the admission. None of the P1 patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The incidence of hospitalizations during P1 was 2.6 per week. It was greater than that of P2 but without the difference being statistically significant (2.1 admissions per week; incidence rate ratio: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.67-1.2; p = 0, 54). A total of 31 complications were noted (19 in P1 vs 12 in P2; p=0,489). The complications were as follows: 19 cases of acute severe colitis (12 in P1 vs 7 in P2 ; p= 0,234), 8 cases of intra-abdominal abscesses (6 in P1 vs 2 in P2 ; p=0,234), 4 cases of acute intestinal obstruction (1 in P1 vs 3 in P2 ; p=0,322). Among patients who had presented an acute severe colitis, 6 had undergone subtotal colectomy (6 in P1 vs 0 in P2, p=0,006). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that during the pandemic period, there was an increase in the incidence of hospitalizations of patients with IBD as well as a significant increase in the need for surgery in severe acute colitis. These results should be taken into account so that IBD management strategies can be adjusted accordingly, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or recurs, or in case of future outbreaks.","Dahmani, W; Sahar, N; Aya, H; Nour, E; Wafa, B A; Aida, B S; Ahlem, B; Mehdi, K; Hanene, J; Ali, J",J Crohns Colitis,732,1

Protein modification through covalent attachment to different moieties improves the therapeutic’s pharmacokinetic properties, affinity, stability, confers protection against proteolytic degradation, and increases circulation half-life. Nowadays, several modified therapeutic proteins, including PEGylated, Fc-fused, lipidated, albumin-fused, and glycosylated proteins have obtained regulatory approval for commercialization. During its manufacturing, the purification steps of the therapeutic agent are decisive to ensure the quality, effectiveness, potency, and safety of the final product. Due to the robustness, selectivity, and high resolution of chromatographic methods, these are recognized as the gold standard in the downstream processing of therapeutic proteins. Moreover, depending on the modification strategy, the protein will suffer different physicochemical changes, which must be considered to define a purification approach. This review aims to deeply analyze the purification methods employed for modified therapeutic proteins that are currently available on the market, to understand why the selected strategies were successful. Emphasis is placed on chromatographic methods since they govern the purification processes within the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, to discuss how the modification type strongly influences the purification strategy, the purification processes of three different modified versions of coagulation factor IX are contrasted.","Sánchez-Trasviña, Calef; Flores-Gatica, Miguel; Enriquez-Ochoa, Daniela; Rito-Palomares, Marco; Mayolo-Deloisa, Karla",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,732,1

Several transcription factors (TFs) have also been reported to regulate the antitumor activity and immune cell infiltration. This study aimed to quantify the populations of different immune cells infiltrated in tumor samples based on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from 50 cancer patients using the CIBERSORT and the EPIC algorithm. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified eigengene modules strongly associated with tumorigenesis and the activation of CD4+ memory T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. TF genes FOXM1, MYBL2, TAL1, and ERG are central in the subnetworks of the eigengene modules associated with immune-related genes. The analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer data confirmed these findings and further showed that the expression of these potential TF genes regulating immune infiltration, and the immune-related genes that they regulated, was associated with the survival of patients within multiple cancers. Exome-seq was performed on 24 paired samples that also had RNA-seq data. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis showed that mutations were significantly more frequent in the regions flanking the TF genes compared with those of non-TF genes, suggesting a driver role of these TF genes regulating immune infiltration. Taken together, this study presented a practical method for identifying genes that regulate immune infiltration. These genes could be potential biomarkers for cancer prognosis and possible therapeutic targets.","Liu, Lei; Zhao, Qiuchen; Cheng, Chao; Yi, Jingwen; Sun, Hongyan; Wang, Qi; Quan, Weili; Xue, Yaqiang; Sun, Luguo; Cong, Xianling; Zhang, Yi",Front Immunol,732,1

OBJECTIVES: The current study characterized current video usage behaviors and their relationship with appearance dissatisfaction and interest in aesthetic procedures in the general population. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 335 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in 'video manipulation' techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention while on video calls (ie, on self or others). The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video use behaviors were associated with greater body image disturbance. RESULTS: Over 1/3 of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, greater engagement in video manipulation behaviors, and increasing appearance concerns due to their time on video calls. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty treatments (eg, waxing) and aesthetic procedures (eg, non-surgical procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of first empirical studies to report the potential consequences of video call usage for increasing appearance dissatisfaction and dysmorphic concern, and to demonstrate a link between the use of video calls and interest in cosmetic procedures.","Pikoos, Toni D; Buzwell, Simone; Sharp, Gemma; Rossell, Susan L",Aesthet. surg. j,732,1

METHODS: A task force from the European Respiratory Society and endorsed by the Chinese Thoracic Society identified priority interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for the initial version of this ""living guideline"" using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format. The GRADE approach was used for assessing the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Systematic literature reviews were performed, and data pooled by meta-analysis where possible. Evidence tables were presented and evidence to decision frameworks were used to formulate recommendations. RESULTS: Based on the available evidence at the time of guideline development (20 February, 2021), the panel makes a strong recommendation in favour of the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients requiring supplementary oxygen or ventilatory support, and for the use of anticoagulation in hospitalised patients. The panel makes a conditional recommendation for interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibody treatment and high-flow nasal oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure in patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The panel make strong recommendations against the use of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Conditional recommendations are made against the use of azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, colchicine, and remdesivir, in the latter case specifically in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. No recommendation was made for remdesivir in patients requiring supplemental oxygen. Further recommendations for research are made. CONCLUSION: The evidence base for management of COVID-19 now supports strong recommendations in favour and against specific interventions. These guidelines will be regularly updated as further evidence becomes available.","Chalmers, James D; Crichton, Megan L; Goeminne, Pieter C; Cao, Bin; Humbert, Marc; Shteinberg, Michal; Antoniou, Katerina M; Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli; Parks, Helen; Wang, Chen; Vandendriessche, Thomas; Qu, Jieming; Stolz, Daiana; Brightling, Christopher; Welte, Tobias; Aliberti, Stefano; Simonds, Anita K; Tonia, Thomy; Roche, Nicolas",Eur. respir. j,732,21

The causative agent of this disease is identified and named as SARS-CoV2 because of its genetic relatedness to SARS-CoV species that was responsible for the 2003 coronavirus outbreak. The immense spread of the disease in a very small period demands urgent development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infected patients. A plethora of research is being conducted globally on this novel coronavirus strain to gain knowledge about its origin, evolutionary history, and phylogeny. This review is an effort to compare genetic similarities and diversifications among coronavirus strains, which can hint towards the susceptible antigen targets of SARS-CoV2 to come up with the potential therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the prevention of this public threat.","Kaur, Navpreet; Singh, Rimaljot; Dar, Zahid; Bijarnia, Rakesh Kumar; Dhingra, Neelima; Kaur, Tanzeer",Infect Genet Evol,732,5

Identifying patients who could benefit from evaluation and intervention can be challenging for referring providers and otolaryngologists alike. We aimed to develop and validate an accessible diagnostic tool to estimate the probability of AIFS. METHODS: Retrospective chart review from 1999 to 2017 identified all patients evaluated for possible AIFS at a tertiary care center. AIFS was diagnosed by pathologic confirmation of fungal tissue angioinvasion. Stepwise selection and univariate logistic regression were used to screen risk factors for a multivariable predictive model. Model performance was assessed using Tukey's goodness-of-fit test and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Model coefficients were internally validated using bootstrapping with 1000 iterations. RESULTS: A total of 283 patients (244 negative controls, 39 with AIFS) were included. Risk factors in our final diagnostic model included: fever &#8805;38°C (log-odds ratio [LOR] 1.72; 95% CI, 0.53 to 2.90), unilateral facial swelling, pain, or erythema (LOR 2.84; 95% CI, 1.46 to 4.23), involvement of the orbit or pterygopalatine fossa on imaging (LOR 3.02; 95% CI, 1.78 to 4.26), and mucosal necrosis seen on endoscopy (LOR 5.52; 95% CI, 3.81 to 7.24), with p < 0.01 for all factors. The model had adequate goodness of fit (p > 0.05) and discrimination (AUC = 0.96). CONCLUSION: We present an internally validated diagnostic tool to stratify the risk for AIFS. The estimated risk may help determine which patients can be observed with serial nasal endoscopy, which ones could be biopsied, and which ones would benefit from immediate surgical intervention.","Yin, Linda X; Spillinger, Aviv; Lees, Katherine A; Bailey, Kent R; Choby, Garret; O039,; Brien, Erin K; Stokken, Janalee K",Int. forum allergy rhinol,732,26

Methods to correct these batch effects are error-prone, as previous findings have shown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate how using the R function ComBat to correct simulated Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) and Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit (EPIC) DNAm data can lead to a large number of false positive results under certain conditions. We further provide a detailed assessment of the consequences for the highly relevant problem of p-value inflation with subsequent false positive findings after application of the frequently used ComBat method. Using ComBat to correct for batch effects in randomly generated samples produced alarming numbers of false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni-corrected (BF) false positive results in unbalanced as well as in balanced sample distributions in terms of the relation between the outcome of interest variable and the technical position of the sample during the probe measurement. Both sample size and number of batch factors (e.g. number of chips) were systematically simulated to assess the probability of false positive findings. The effect of sample size was simulated using n = 48 up to n = 768 randomly generated samples. Increasing the number of corrected factors led to an exponential increase in the number of false positive signals. Increasing the number of samples reduced, but did not completely prevent, this effect. CONCLUSIONS: Using the approach described, we demonstrate, that using ComBat for batch correction in DNAm data can lead to false positive results under certain conditions and sample distributions. Our results are thus contrary to previous publications, considering a balanced sample distribution as unproblematic when using ComBat. We do not claim completeness in terms of reporting all technical conditions and possible solutions of the occurring problems as we approach the problem from a clinician's perspective and not from that of a computer scientist. With our approach of simulating data, we provide readers with a simple method to assess the probability of false positive findings in DNAm microarray data analysis pipelines.","Zindler, Tristan; Frieling, Helge; Neyazi, Alexandra; Bleich, Stefan; Friedel, Eva",BMC Bioinformatics,732,16

This qualitative case study highlights one online parent education and training (PET) program developed during the pandemic to offer home-intervention strategies to parents of children with ASD in mainland China. This exploratory study sought to examine the emic perspectives of the trainers and parents who participated in the 12-week intensive training program while considering the cultural context in China and the transnational, remote nature of the program. METHODS: The primary data focused on the experiences of the trainers and parents within PET program's structure and strategies, which were adapted from the Training of Trainers model, and were collected from semi-structured, in-depth individual and focus group interviews conducted virtually with trainers (n = 4). Supplemental data sources included training session materials and feedback forms collected from parents (n = 294) at the midpoint and end of the program. After the collected data were sorted and condensed, a thematic analysis was performed using the data analysis spiral to further organize and code the data, and the codes were finally collapsed into themes. FINDINGS: Three overarching themes were identified: (1) training as modeling with resources, (2) dilemmas in cultural contexts and expectations, and (3) cultivating parent support networks. CONCLUSION: The online PET program became a hub of support networks and learning spaces for parents of children with ASD in different regions in China during the pandemic. Through the interactive virtual training sessions, parents were supported by continuous feedback on their home intervention and coached to cultivate support networks among themselves despite tensions arising from cultural differences and to implement effective intervention strategies that were individualized and authenticated to their specific familial needs.","McDevitt, Seung Eun",Res Dev Disabil,732,20

Drug repurposing is a well-known method to address the crisis in a time-critical fashion. Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been reported to inhibit DNA replication of hepatitis B virus, measles virus germination, and HIV infection, along with replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which interact with host cells as SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Nineteen APDs were screened using ACE2-HEK293T cell membrane chromatography (ACE2-HEK293T/CMC). Cytotoxicity assay, coronavirus spike pseudotype virus entry assay, surface plasmon resonance, and virtual molecular docking were applied to detect affinity between ACE2 protein and drugs and a potential antiviral property of the screened compounds. KEY FINDINGS: After the CMC screening, 8 of the 19 APDs were well-retained on ACE2-HEK293T/CMC column and showed significant antiviral activities in vitro. Three quarters of them belong to phenothiazine and could significantly inhibit the entrance of coronavirus into ACE2-HEK293T cells. Aother two drugs, aripiprazole and tiapride, exhibited weaker inhibition. We selected five of the drugs for subsequent evaluation. All five showed similar affinity to ACE2 and virtual molecular docking demonstrated they bound with different amino acids respectively on ACE2 which SARS-CoV-2 binds to. SIGNIFICANCE: Eight APDs were screened for binding with ACE2, five of which demonstrated potential protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 through acting on ACE2. Although the five drugs have a weak ability to block SARS-CoV-2 with a single binding site, they may provide a synergistic effect in adjuvant therapy of COVID-19 infection.","Lu, Jiayu; Hou, Yajing; Ge, Shuai; Wang, Xiangjun; Wang, Jue; Hu, Tian; Lv, Yuexin; He, Huaizhen; Wang, Cheng",Life Sci,732,16

Respondents felt that adolescent pregnancy is risky and that adolescents require support and guidance through this experience. Families were highly influential on the care seeking, health and nutrition of pregnant adolescents, and mothers/mothers‐in‐law primarily took on the decision‐making roles, with husbands actively participating. Adolescents valued family support but felt a loss of autonomy and agency upon becoming pregnant. Financial constraints were the greatest perceived barrier to appropriate nutrition and healthcare; yet, both were valued.
