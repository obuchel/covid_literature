The three most prominent stories from the digital editions of five tabloids—the Sun, the Star, the Mirror, the Mail and the Express—were checked between 16.30 and 17.30 GMT on Friday 24 January 2020. It was found that all five tabloids gave adequate coverage to what Reuters considered the main item of international news that afternoon, and two prioritised serious articles that were critical of the British government. However, sensationalised and frivolous pieces also featured among the most prominent posts, which confirmed the eclectic nature of tabloid content.","Buckledee, Steve",Tabloiding the Truth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282563/,747

Such scanning is important, but sensemaking is too, which is essentially scanning with mindfulness as executives work to conceptualize through awareness and interpretation of the world around them. It requires being attentive to the deviations from commonly accepted interpretations, habits of mind, and routines. To do this, executives can take several steps including creating a search map, developing horizon thinking, and tapping “outsiders” in the scanning process.","Galunic, Charles",Backstage Leadership,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282833/,747

35308,Machine Learning Based Rank Attack Detection for Smart Hospital Infrastructure,2020-05-31,"Immune-checkpoint inhibition provides an unmatched level of durable clinical efficacy in various malignancies. Such therapies promote the activation of antigen-specific T cells, although the precise targets of these T cells remain unknown. Exploiting these targets holds great potential to amplify responses to treatment, such as by combining immune-checkpoint inhibition with therapeutic vaccination or other antigen-directed treatments. In this scenario, the pivotal hurdle remains the definition of valid HLA-restricted tumour antigens, which requires several levels of evidence before targets can be established with sufficient confidence. Suitable antigens might include tumour-specific antigens with alternative or wild-type sequences, tumour-associated antigens and cryptic antigens that exceed exome boundaries. Comprehensive antigen classification is required to enable future clinical development and the definition of innovative treatment strategies. Furthermore, clinical development remains challenging with regard to drug manufacturing and regulation, as well as treatment feasibility. Despite these challenges, treatments based on diligently curated antigens combined with a suitable therapeutic platform have the potential to enable optimal antitumour efficacy in patients, either as monotherapies or in combination with other established immunotherapies. In this Review, we summarize the current state-of-the-art approaches for the identification of candidate tumour antigens and provide a structured terminology based on their underlying characteristics.","Haen, Sebastian P.; Löffler, Markus W.; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Brossart, Peter",Nat Rev Clin Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306938/,747
35309,A Novel On-Wrist Fall Detection System Using Supervised Dictionary Learning Technique,2020-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory support has been increasingly used after extubation for the prevention of re-intubation and improvement of prognosis in critically ill medical patients. However, the optimal respiratory support method is still under debate. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of various respiratory support methods used for preventive purposes after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patients. METHODS: A systematic database search was performed from inception to December 19, 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a preventive use of different respiratory support methods, including conventional oxygen therapy (COT), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT), and combinational use of HFOT and NIV (HFOT+NIV), after planned extubation in adult critically ill medical patients. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were performed in duplicate. The primary outcomes included re-intubation rate and short-term mortality. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs comprising 3341 participants with 4 comparisons were included. Compared with COT, NIV significantly reduced the re-intubation rate [risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77; moderate quality of evidence] and short-term mortality (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91; moderate quality of evidence). Compared to COT, HFOT had a beneficial effect on the re-intubation rate (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86; moderate quality of evidence) but no effect on short-term mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.12; low quality of evidence). No significant difference in the re-intubation rate or short-term mortality was found among NIV, HFOT, and HFOT+NIV. The treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) from best to worst for re-intubation rate were HFOT+NIV (95.1%), NIV (53.4%), HFOT (51.2%), and COT (0.3%), and the rankings for short-term mortality were NIV (91.0%), HFOT (54.3%), HFOT+NIV (43.7%), and COT (11.1%). Sensitivity analyses of trials with a high risk of extubation failure for the primary outcomes indicated that the SUCRA rankings were comparable to those of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: After scheduled extubation, the preventive use of NIV is probably the most effective respiratory support method for comprehensively preventing re-intubation and short-term death in critically ill medical patients, especially those with a high risk of extubation failure.","Zhou, Xiaoyang; Yao, Shengmi; Dong, Pingping; Chen, Bixin; Xu, Zhaojun; Wang, Hua",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306939/,747

They are predicting a lingering wave of trauma and depression even after the pandemic's immediate effects recede and lockdowns lift, the Fort Worth Business Press reported June 9. “There's a lot of bad things happening right now because of COVID‐19,” said Andy Keller, president and CEO of the Texas‐based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. “But in some ways, people in rural Texas have better access to health care than they'd ever had before. All the barriers to them accessing physicians across the state have been lifted.” In April, Gov. Greg Abbott temporarily waived restrictions on telehealth, allowing mental health care providers and local mental health authorities to broadly expand services and collect reimbursement for online appointments more easily.

35323,Combined Machine Learning and Semantic Modelling for Situation Awareness and Healthcare Decision Support,2020-05-31,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in intercellular communication. Recently, there has been increasing interest in EVs as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic vehicles. However, the molecular properties and cargo information of EV subpopulations have not yet been fully investigated due to lack of reliable and reproducible EV separation technology. Current approaches have faced difficulties with efficiently isolating EVs from biofluids, especially subpopulations of small EVs. Here, we report an EV isolation method based on a size-selective microfluidic platform (ExoSMP) via nanomembrane filtration and electrophoretic force. This unique platform offers an enhanced approach to sorting a heterogeneous population of EVs based on size, with the additional advantages of being label-free and low-cost, and featuring a short processing time (<1 h), and convenient integration with downstream analysis. In this research, we used ExoSMP to demonstrate the isolation of cancer-derived small EVs (30–120 nm) with high recovery (94.2%) and reproducibility at an optimum sample flow rate. Furthermore, we investigated isolation of EV subpopulations by altering nanomembrane combinations with different pore size combinations (50 and 100 nm, 30 and 100 nm, 30 and 200 nm, and 30 and 50 nm). This ExoSMP technique can serve as a standardized EV isolation/separation tool, facilitating the clinical prospects of EVs and opening up a new avenue for future point-of-care applications in liquid biopsies.","Chen, Zheyuan; Yang, Yi; Yamaguchi, Hirohito; Hung, Mien-Chi; Kameoka, Jun",Biomicrofluidics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7307647/,747

40617,Évaluation des politiques sanitaires publiques face aux grandes pandémies,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Current urban vector control strategies have failed to contain dengue epidemics and to prevent the global expansion of Aedes-borne viruses (ABVs: dengue, chikungunya, Zika). Part of the challenge in sustaining effective ABV control emerges from the paucity of evidence regarding the epidemiological impact of any Aedes control method. A strategy for which there is limited epidemiological evidence is targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS). TIRS is a modification of classic malaria indoor residual spraying that accounts for Aedes aegypti resting behavior by applying residual insecticides on exposed lower sections of walls (< 1.5 m), under furniture, and on dark surfaces. METHODS/DESIGN: We are pursuing a two-arm, parallel, unblinded, cluster randomized controlled trial to quantify the overall efficacy of TIRS in reducing the burden of laboratory-confirmed ABV clinical disease (primary endpoint). The trial will be conducted in the city of Merida, Yucatan State, Mexico (population ~ 1million), where we will prospectively follow 4600 children aged 2–15 years at enrollment, distributed in 50 clusters of 5 × 5 city blocks each. Clusters will be randomly allocated (n = 25 per arm) using covariate-constrained randomization. A “fried egg” design will be followed, in which all blocks of the 5 × 5 cluster receive the intervention, but all sampling to evaluate the epidemiological and entomological endpoints will occur in the “yolk,” the center 3 × 3 city blocks of each cluster. TIRS will be implemented as a preventive application (~ 1–2 months prior to the beginning of the ABV season). Active monitoring for symptomatic ABV illness will occur through weekly household visits and enhanced surveillance. Annual sero-surveys will be performed after each transmission season and entomological evaluations of Ae. aegypti indoor abundance and ABV infection rates monthly during the period of active surveillance. Epidemiological and entomological evaluation will continue for up to three transmission seasons. DISCUSSION: The findings from this study will provide robust epidemiological evidence of the efficacy of TIRS in reducing ABV illness and infection. If efficacious, TIRS could drive a paradigm shift in Aedes control by considering Ae. aegypti behavior to guide residual insecticide applications and changing deployment to preemptive control (rather than in response to symptomatic cases), two major enhancements to existing practice.

41430,Lutte contre les pénuries de médicaments : associer les patients,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is an unprecedented global public health burden, which popped up in China in late 2019 to early 2020 and distributed worldwide rapidly. Indeed, this pandemic transmission has raised global physical and mental health concerns. Mental health issues that concur with this public health emergency may pose anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In Iraq, there are no registered known data on the psychological consequence of the public during the communicable disease outbreak. The ongoing study aims to address the paucity of these data as an appraisal of the mental health burden represented by anxiety disorder related to the global COVID-19 era. RESULTS: Among the 1591 Iraqi respondents, 788 (49.5%) accounted for having health anxiety over the current home restriction situation. Younger ages experienced more COVID-19-related health anxiety compared to older ages. Females reported higher health anxiety compared to males (57.7% vs 42.3%). The health care professionals reported 20.9% health anxiety. The Iraqi southern population displayed more health anxiety compared to the northern and middle portions. This work showed about half of the respondents were spending over 60 min focusing on news of COVID-19. We found that 80 to 90% carrying out preventive efforts and home quarantine against COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, participants experienced fear from the risk of COVID-19 infection, whether more or equal to a level of war scare, in 70.1% of the sample. CONCLUSIONS: In Iraq, during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly half of the respondents have health anxiety. Southern Iraqi cities displayed higher rates of anxiety. Also, being female, younger ages, holding an academic degree, or being a college student are associated with more prominent degrees of anxiety. Furtherly, it is important to adopt strategies for public health education and prevention and alerting future governmental responses focusing on psychological state impact among the general population.","Karim, Saad Kazim; Taha, Perjan Hashim; Amin, Nazar Mohammad Mohammad; Ahmed, Habeeb Shuhaib; Yousif, Miami Kadhim; Hallumy, Ammar Mohmmed",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7587510/,747
44993,Les multiples facettes du pathologiste,2021-01-07,"The Toll pathway plays an important role in defense against infection of various pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses. However, current understanding of Toll pathway was mainly restricted in mammal and some model insects such as Drosophila and mosquitoes. Whether plant viruses can also activate the Toll signaling pathway in vector insects is still unknown. In this study, using rice stripe virus (RSV) and its insect vector (small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus) as a model, we found that the Toll pathway was activated upon RSV infection. In comparison of viruliferous and non-viruliferous planthoppers, we found that four Toll pathway core genes (Toll, Tube, MyD88, and Dorsal) were upregulated in viruliferous planthoppers. When the planthoppers infected with RSV, the expressions of Toll and MyD88 were rapidly upregulated at the early stage (1 and 3 days post-infection), whereas Dorsal was upregulated at the late stage (9 days post-infection). Furthermore, induction of Toll pathway was initiated by interaction between a Toll receptor and RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). Knockdown of Toll increased the proliferation of RSV in vector insect, and the dsToll-treated insects exhibited higher mortality than that of dsGFP-treated ones. Our results provide the first evidence that the Toll signaling pathway of an insect vector is potentially activated through the direct interaction between Toll receptor and a protein encoded by a plant virus, indicating that Toll immune pathway is an important strategy against plant virus infection in an insect vector.","He, Yu-Juan; Lu, Gang; Qi, Yu-Hua; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Xiao-Di; Huang, Hai-Jian; Zhuo, Ji-Chong; Sun, Zong-Tao; Yan, Fei; Chen, Jian-Ping; Zhang, Chuan-Xi; Li, Jun-Min",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7821435/,747

In critical times, the well-being of vulnerable groups is often at stake. Migrants represent a case in point because language barriers and the lack of social networks impede their seeking help from public institutions and information access. In migration policy and research, current attention overwhelmingly focusses on COVID-19’s impact on travel restrictions and healthcare. This article contributes a new perspective by demonstrating how migrants’ well-being needs (understood as emotions and sense of achievement) in education during the COVID-19-induced school closure were addressed by community educational organisations. Focussing on the Chinese community in Germany, data were collected in Chinese heritage language (CHL) schools from three urban areas. This article argues that CHL schools’ reaction to public schools’ closure had a positive impact on their members’ well-being. Such organisations achieved this by expanding their educational programmes during and after the lockdown. These measures ensured continuity in migrant children’s education beyond the realm of heritage language instruction, while enabling migrant parents to seek employment as the economy reopened. Overall, the results of this study underscore the potential of community organisations’ educational programmes in maintaining migrants’ well-being, especially in trying times.","Wang, Zi",Migr Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798983/,747

Adopting a complex systems’ perspective, it points out that technology and pedagogy are interconnected and interdependent elements of the classroom or learning environment as a system, alongside other elements, including the teacher, the students, the curriculum content, and the physical environment. Any change in one will have an impact on the other, and hence the whole system. Drawing on data from an English language teacher educator’s reflections on her journey of adopting online teaching, this paper elucidates the dynamic relationship between technology and pedagogy. It shows how her exploitation of the affordances of technology to simulate face-to-face classroom teaching has led to a re-tooling of these affordances to achieve and re-imagine pedagogical goals. The positive impact on students’ self-efficacy and her own self-efficacy in online teaching has led to the emergence of new pedagogical practices and routines which have enabled her to surpass what she could achieve in face-to-face classroom teaching. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance for teachers to embrace technology with an open mind and to understand this complex dynamic relationship for effective online teaching.","Tsui, Amy B.

Yet the extent of its application and efficacy as an alternative route for healthcare provision remains a major concern for clinicians and patients. OBJECTIVE This study sought to identify barriers to the successful implementation of telemedicine in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. METHOD A systematic review of the literature was conducted by applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for identifying, selecting, evaluating and interpreting findings. RESULTS Our results from 66 empirical studies revealed a wide usage of telemedicine technology across SSA countries but also showed insufficient evidence of usage for fighting Covid-19 infection. Further, technological, organisational, legal and regulatory, individual, financial, and cultural aspects were identified as the major barriers to the successful implementation of telemedicine in SSA. A list of recommendations was produced for each telemedicine barrier. CONCLUSION Our review shows current trends in telemedicine application, as well as highlighting critical barriers for consideration by healthcare decision makers.

The size, number, location, distribution, density and morphology of the pulmonary lesions of these CT data were analyzed and compared with some already existed COVID-19 CT images which come from two files, ""Radiological diagnosis of COVID-19: expert recommendation from the Chinese Society of Radiology (First edition)"" and ""A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel corona-virus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)"". The simple or multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions are located both in the HAPE and COVID-19 at the early stage, but only the thickening of interlobular septa, called ""crazy paving pattern"" belongs to COVID-19. At the next period, some increased cloudy shadows are located in HAPE, while lesions of COVID-19 are more likely to develop parallel to the direction of the pleura, and some of the lesions show the bronchial inflation. At the most serious stage, both the shadows in HAPE and COVID-19 become white, but the lesions of HAPE in the right lung are more serious than that of left lung. In summary, some cloudy shadows are the feature of HAPE CT image, and ""crazy paving pattern"" and ""pleural parallel sign"" belong to the COVID-19 CT, which can be used for differential diagnosis.","Li, Wenzhe; Li, Kai; Zhang, Nan; Chen, Gaofeng; Li, Wenjun; Tang, Jun; Yuan, Fang",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.7507/1001-5515.202007043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369342/,747
160329,The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History.,2015,"Introduction: COVID-19 presents benign forms in young patients who frequently present with anosmia. Infants are rarely infected, while severe forms occur in patients over 65 years of age with comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes. Lymphopenia, eosinopenia, thrombopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers and low zinc levels are associated with severity. Areas covered: The authors review the literature and provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the natural history of and therapeutic options for COVID-19. Expert opinion: Diagnosis should rely on PCR and not on clinical presumption. Because of discrepancies between clinical symptoms, oxygen saturation or radiological signs on CT scans, pulse oximetry, and radiological investigation should be systematic. The disease evolves in successive phases: an acute virological phase, and, in some patients, a cytokine storm phase; an uncontrolled coagulopathy; and an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therapeutic options include antivirals, oxygen therapy, immunomodulators, anticoagulants and prolonged mechanical treatment. Early diagnosis, care, and implementation of an antiviral treatment; the use of immunomodulators at a later stage; and the quality of intensive care are critical regarding mortality rates. The higher mortality observed in Western countries remains unexplained. Pulmonary fibrosis may occur in some patients. Its future is unpredictable.","Gautret, Philippe; Million, Matthieu; Jarrot, Pierre-André; Camoin-Jau, Laurence; Colson, Philippe; Fenollar, Florence; Leone, Marc; La Scola, Bernard; Devaux, Christian; Gaubert, Jean Yves; Mege, Jean-Louis; Vitte, Joana; Melenotte, Cléa; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Parola, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Brouqui, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1847640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356661/,747
196535,"Colds and influenza: a review of diagnosis and conventional, botanical, and nutritional considerations.",2007,"Backtracking from antibodies to their corresponding epitopes is a rational approach for vaccine design. Here we apply such a reverse immunological strategy for mapping the cross-reactive neutralizing epitope corresponding to the monoclonal antibody (mAb) b12 specific for HIV-1 gp120. b12 was used to screen a combinatorial phage display random peptide library and nineteen 12mer cysteine-looped peptides were affinity purified. These were used as input for analysis with the predictive algorithm Mapitope. Based on the input panel of peptides and the antigen's atomic structure, Mapitope predicts candidate epitopes on the surface of the antigen. Two major clusters were predicted as candidate b12 epitopes. These could be discriminated by a series of experiments, which included point mutagenesis of selected residues and binding assays. Moreover, the prediction of the b12 epitope was further strengthened by comparison with additional predictions for two competing antibodies, b6 and m14. Finally, support of our prediction was obtained in view of the fact that b12, m14, and b6 were found to compete against mAb 17b binding to gp120. The b12 epitope is predicted to consist of four peptide segments of gp120 (residues V254-T257, D368-F376, E381-Y384, and I420-I424), which lie at the periphery of the CD4 binding site.","Bublil, Erez M; Yeger-Azuz, Sharon; Gershoni, Jonathan M",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16940148/,747

Objective: To investigate potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection with epidemiologic evidence from a COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined a community COVID-19 outbreak in Zhejiang province. On January 19, 2020, 128 individuals took 2 buses (60 [46.9%] from bus 1 and 68 [53.1%] from bus 2) on a 100-minute round trip to attend a 150-minute worship event. The source patient was a passenger on bus 2. We compared risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection among at-risk individuals taking bus 1 (n = 60) and bus 2 (n = 67 [source patient excluded]) and among all other individuals (n = 172) attending the worship event. We also divided seats on the exposed bus into high-risk and low-risk zones according to the distance from the source patient and compared COVID-19 risks in each zone. In both buses, central air conditioners were in indoor recirculation mode. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or by viral genome sequencing results. Attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated for different groups, and the spatial distribution of individuals who developed infection on bus 2 was obtained. Results: Of the 128 participants, 15 (11.7%) were men, 113 (88.3%) were women, and the mean age was 58.6 years. On bus 2, 24 of the 68 individuals (35.3% [including the index patient]) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after the event. Meanwhile, none of the 60 individuals in bus 1 were infected. Among the other 172 individuals at the worship event, 7 (4.1%) subsequently received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Individuals in bus 2 had a 34.3% (95% CI, 24.1%-46.3%) higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared with those in bus 1 and were 11.4 (95% CI, 5.1-25.4) times more likely to have COVID-19 compared with all other individuals attending the worship event. Within bus 2, individuals in high-risk zones had moderately, but nonsignificantly, higher risk for COVID-19 compared with those in the low-risk zones. The absence of a significantly increased risk in the part of the bus closer to the index case suggested that airborne spread of the virus may at least partially explain the markedly high attack rate observed. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study and case investigation of a community outbreak of COVID-19 in Zhejiang province, individuals who rode a bus to a worship event with a patient with COVID-19 had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individuals who rode another bus to the same event. Airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 seems likely to have contributed to the high attack rate in the exposed bus. Future efforts at prevention and control must consider the potential for airborne spread of the virus.","Shen, Ye; Li, Changwei; Dong, Hongjun; Wang, Zhen; Martinez, Leonardo; Sun, Zhou; Handel, Andreas; Chen, Zhiping; Chen, Enfu; Ebell, Mark H; Wang, Fan; Yi, Bo; Wang, Haibin; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Aihong; Chen, Bingbing; Qi, Yanling; Liang, Lirong; Li, Yang; Ling, Feng; Chen, Junfang; Xu, Guozhang",JAMA intern. med.

This Perspective provides insight into the environmental effects of the pandemic, documenting how it offers an opportunity to better understand the Earth System. Restrictions to reduce human interaction have helped to avoid greater suffering and death from the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also created socioeconomic hardship. This disruption is unprecedented in the modern era of global observing networks, pervasive sensing and large-scale tracking of human mobility and behaviour, creating a unique test bed for understanding the Earth System. In this Perspective, we hypothesize the immediate and long-term Earth System responses to COVID-19 along two multidisciplinary cascades: energy, emissions, climate and air quality;and poverty, globalization, food and biodiversity. While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour. These impacts offer the opportunity for novel insight, particularly with the careful deployment of targeted data collection, coordinated model experiments and solution-oriented randomized controlled trials, during and after the pandemic.","Diffenbaugh, N.

This is a question that billions of people are wondering early 2020 due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus can produce a severe pneumonia that has killed over 230,000 people so far, was detected for the first time late 2019 in Wuhan (China), and has spread all over the world due, in part, to the difficulty of detecting and isolating asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases. In this paper, we explore how long suppression strategies (i.e., home confinement and social distancing) must be put into practice in highly populated cities to reduce the chances that a quick rebound of COVID-19 infections occur again over the next months. This is explored, using New York City (USA), San Francisco (USA), and Madrid (Spain) as case studies, through a simple but realistic Monte Carlo stochastic model that takes into account that part of the undetected infected individuals remain in circulation propagating the virus. Our simulations reflect that, if suppression strategies are not properly applied, they can be counterproductive because there are high chances that the confinement time has to be lengthened without reducing the total number of infections. We also estimate that, in the most conservative scenario and under the model assumptions, home confinement is effective if applied at least ~110 days in New York City, ~80 days in San Francisco, and ~70 days in Madrid, i.e., until mid-July 2020, early June 2020, and late May 2020, respectively.","Girona, Társilo",Front.

Across the globe, governments have put mandates for the use of face masks, which have received both positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides an exciting platform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing patterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six US cities. An increase in masks worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases rose, particularly when their respective states imposed strict regulations. We also found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws were put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter protest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore masks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We introduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks, respectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector (for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic segmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model for the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of 98%.

AIM: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies in Thai patients with differing severities of COVID-19. METHODS: Plasma from the following patient groups was examined: 118 adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, 49 patients under investigation (without confirmed infections), 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy control patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from EUROIMMUN was performed to assess for IgA and IgG antibodies. The optical density (OD) ratio cutoff for a positive result was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. Additionally, the association of the antibody response with both the severity of disease and the date after onset of symptoms was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 289 participants were enrolled and 384 samples analyzed from March 10 to May 31, 2020. Patients were categorized, based on their clinical manifestations, as mild (n = 59), moderate (n = 27), or severe (n = 32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from the samples collected after day 7 of the symptoms was 87.9% (95% CI: 79.8-93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI: 76.2-91.3), respectively. Compared to the mild group, the severe group had significantly higher levels of spike 1 (S1) antigen-specific IgA and IgG. All patients in the moderate and severe groups had S1-specific IgG, while 20% of the patients in the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks after the onset of symptoms. Interestingly, in the severe group, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males than females (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The serological test for SARS-CoV-2 has a high sensitivity more than two weeks after the onset of illness. Additionally, the serological response differs among patients based on sex as well as the severity of infection.","Kowitdamrong, Ekasit; Puthanakit, Thanyawee; Jantarabenjakul, Watsamon; Prompetchara, Eakachai; Suchartlikitwong, Pintip; Putcharoen, Opass; Hirankarn, Nattiya",PLoS One,,747

244544,[Reflections on the position of the Covid-19 antigenic test based on a discrepancy of result],2021,"SARS-CoV-2 currently represents a serious global public health problem. Non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) have been widely adopted, and the testing strategy since the beginning of the infection is the most effective tool for tracking, isolating, and minimizing transmission. The high operating costs and the need for sophisticated instrumentation related to gold standard diagnostic for COVID-19, Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), have highlighted the urgency and importance of developing and applying new diagnostic techniques, especially in places with scarce resources. Thus, alternative molecular tests, such as Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP), based on isothermal amplification have been used to detect SARS-CoV-2 using different protocols. The potential for field application of RT-LAMP is due to the lower cost and time and not requiring high-cost instrumentation. Here, we evaluate the colorimetric RT-LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital environment and correlate its performance with tests performed in a reference laboratory. The analysis performed at the hospital showed high sensitivity (88.89%), specificity (98.55%), accuracy (95.83%), and a Cohen's kappa of 0.895. However, we achieved 100% of agreement when comparing the RT-LAMP results with the gold standard (qRT-PCR) results for samples with Ct < 30 in the hospital-based test. In addition, a similar performance was found in the field compared to the reference laboratory, corroborating the proposal to apply the test directly at point-of-care.","Silva, Lívia do Carmo; Dos Santos, Carlos Abelardo; Mendes, Geovana de Melo; Oliveira, Kézia Gomes de; de Souza Júnior, Marcio Neres; Estrela, Paulo Felipe Neves; Costa, Sérgio Henrique Nascente; Silveira-Lacerda, Elisângela de Paula; Duarte, Gabriela Rodrigues Mendes",,,747

262092,Contre Sars-CoV-2 : un vaccin mais aussi le don de plasma,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected millions of people and has caused more than 2.30 million deaths worldwide to date. Several doubts arise about the role of asymptomatic carriers in virus transmission. During the first epidemic outbreak in Italy a large screening with nasopharyngeal swab (NS) was performed in those who were considered 'suspect' for infection. AIMS: To report the results of the SARS-CoV-2 screening in a province in Southern Italy and to provide data on the COVID-19 epidemic and the burden of asymptomatic subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was set up in all healthcare facilities of the province (12 hospitals and 13 sanitary districts: primary, secondary and tertiary centres) with the aim to analyse the results of NS performed on all subjects suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, either because they presented symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were 'contacts' of positive subjects, they came from areas with high prevalence or they were healthcare workers. NS were performed and managed as indicated by international guidelines. The specimens were processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time PCR. RESULTS: A total of 20 325 NS were performed from 13 March to 9 May 2020. Of these, 638 (3.14%) were positive. 470 were asymptomatic, or 75.3% of persons who were positive. They were mostly among 'contacts' of symptomatic cases (428 of 470, 91%) and were in domiciliary isolation. Expression of three SARS-CoV-2 genes did not differ between asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. The strict measures with regard to social distancing led to a continuous decrease in cases during phase 1. CONCLUSIONS: In a large area in Southern Italy, 3.14% (638 of 20 325) of the total subjects tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most of them were asymptomatic (470 of 624, 75.3%), and of these 91% (428 of 470) were 'close contacts' of symptomatic subjects. The combination of social distancing together with the systematic screening of close contacts of COVID-19-positive symptomatic subjects seems to be an efficacious approach to limit the spread of the epidemic.","Masarone, Mario; Vaccaro, Emilia; Sciorio, Roberta; Torre, Pietro; Della Vecchia, Antonio; Aglitti, Andrea; Caliulo, Rita; Borrelli, Anna; Persico, Marcello",BMJ Open,,747

The goals were diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 while protecting patients and staff from infection and ensuring operational continuity and treatment of patients with non-COVID. Options considered included adaptation of existing wards, building a tented facility and converting a non-medical structure. The option chosen was a non-medical structure converted to a hospitalisation facility suited for COVID-19 with appropriate logistic and organisational adaptations. Operational principles included patient isolation, unidirectional workflow from clean to contaminated zones and minimising direct contact between patients and caregivers using personal protection equipment (PPE) and a multimodal telemedicine system. The ED was modified to enable triage and treatment of patients with COVID-19 while maintaining a COVID-19-free environment in the main campus. This system enabled treatment of patients with COVID-19 while maintaining staff safety and conserving the operational continuity and the ability to continue delivery of treatment to patients with non-COVID-19.","Bar-On, Elhanan; Segal, Gad; Regev-Yochay, Gili; Barkai, Galia; Biber, Asaf; Irony, Avinoah; Luttinger, Assaf; Englard, Hindy; Grinberg, Amir; Katorza, Eldad; Rahav, Galia; Afek, Arnon; Kreiss, Yitshak",Emerg. med. j,,747

The aim of this review was to analyze the COVID-19 literature with respect to nutritional status and nutrition management in older adults. No studies only on people aged 65+ years were found, and documentation on those 80+ was rare. Age was found to be strongly associated with worse outcomes, and with poor nutritional status. Prevalence of malnutrition was high among severely and critically ill patients. The studies found a need for nutrition screening and management, and for nutrition support as part of follow-up after a hospital stay. Most tested screening tools showed high sensitivity in identifying nutritional risk, but none were recognized as best for screening older adults with COVID-19. For diagnosing malnutrition, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria are recommended but were not used in the studies found. Documentation of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in relation to nutritional status is missing in older adults. Other COVID-19-associated factors with a possible impact on nutritional status are poor appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms. Vitamin D is the nutrient that has attracted the most interest. However, evidence for supplementation of COVID-19 patients is still limited and inconclusive.","Rothenberg, E.",Nutrients,,747

Clinical trials are a key element of comprehensive cancer care. Ensuring the continuing safe conduct of cancer clinical trials in the context of a pandemic is challenging. METHODS: We aimed to describe the COVID-19 pandemic response of a Cancer Care Clinical Research Unit (CRU) of a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia. We used a mixed methods approach for this case study. Emailed directives from CRU managers to all CRU staff sharing were qualitatively analysed and mapped against our unit activities over longitudinal time points. Data from patient recruitment and protocol deviations were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Mapping activity from 11 March to 30 September 2020 revealed rapid change during the first 2 weeks. Four key strategies to accommodate change were identified: supporting patients and families, introduction of telehealth, accessing investigational product, and social distancing. Early in the pandemic we recognised that our core key stakeholders were integral to our response. When compared to the previous 12 months, our recruitment numbers dropped markedly in early phases of the response but recovered over time, as we accommodated internal and external impacts. CONCLUSION: Our experience of agility as a necessity, adapting to support patients, and managing both clinical research activity and sponsors during the height of the pandemic response is presented here in order to inform future disaster response planning by clinical trial organisations.","Ives, Amy; Pusztai, Tricia; Keller, Jacqui; Ahern, Elizabeth; Chan, Bryan; Gasper, Harry; Wyld, David; Kennedy, Glen; Dickie, Graeme; Lwin, Zarnie; Roberts, Natasha A",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,,747

Up to now, impact of those factors in different European societies is not discussed and compared. Aim of the present study was to perform the cluster analysis in European countries in attention to clinical and epidemiological factors due to covid-19. Methods We collected some appropriate extreme data of COVID-19 to access the situations by ANOVA post-hoc test in 3 scenarios, as well as to estimate regression coefficients in simple linear regression, and a cluster analysis using average linkage. Covid-19 Statistics were considered in all analyses until April 24, 2020. Results Among 39 European countries, several countries reported highest rate of confirmed cases included of Italy (current statues=2270.52) and Spain (current status=2616.24). The highest rate of mortality was seen in France (current status=242.16), Italy (current status=305.52). Life expectancy (female) (P=0.01, 95%Cl=1521.27,15264.58), migration (P<0.001, 95%Cl=41.42,96.72) had significant association with confirmed cases and death.

A chest radiograph revealed pneumothorax and ground glass opacities. Ventilatory support with continuous positive airway pressure was needed. Given the respiratory failure and the positive test from the mother, the patient was sampled for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR) at minute 30 of life, with a positive result reported at 36 h of life. No complications had been present during pregnancy, and cardiac screening and blood cultures revealed no other etiologies. CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission was highly likely in this case.

Our method outputs highly accurate 4D (spatio-temporal) point coordinates and, crucially, automatically assigns a unique label to each of the points. The locations and unique labels of the points are inferred from individual 2D input images only, without relying on temporal tracking or any human body shape or skeletal kinematics models. Therefore, our captured point trajectories contain all of the details from the input images, including motion due to breathing, muscle contractions and flesh deformation, and are well suited to be used as training data to fit advanced models of the human body and its motion. The key idea behind our system is a new type of motion capture suit which contains a special pattern with checkerboard-like corners and two-letter codes. The images from our multi-camera system are processed by a sequence of neural networks which are trained to localize the corners and recognize the codes, while being robust to suit stretching and self-occlusions of the body. Our system relies only on standard RGB or monochrome sensors and fully passive lighting and the passive suit, making our method easy to replicate, deploy and use. Our experiments demonstrate highly accurate captures of a wide variety of human poses, including challenging motions such as yoga, gymnastics, or rolling on the ground.","Chen, He; Park, Hyojoon; Macit, Kutay; Kavan, Ladislav",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07343v1.pdf,747

Although there are several reviews detailing various aspects of Ca2+-signaling such as the role of IP3 receptors and Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, none of them provide an integrated view of the mathematical descriptions of GPCR signal transduction and investigations on dose-response curves. This article is the first study in reviewing the network structures underlying GPCR signal transduction that control downstream [Cac2+]-oscillations. The central theme of this paper is to present the biochemical pathways, as well as molecular mechanisms underlying the GPCR-mediated Ca2+-dynamics in order to facilitate a better understanding of how agonist concentration is encoded in Ca2+-signals for G&#945;q, G&#945;s, and G&#945;i/o signaling pathways. Moreover, we present the GPCR targeting drugs that are relevant for treating cardiac, respiratory, and neuro-diseases. The current paper presents the ODE formulation for various models along with the detailed schematics of signaling networks. To provide a systems perspective, we present the network motifs that can provide readers an insight into the complex and intriguing science of agonist-mediated Ca2+-dynamics. One of the features of this review is to pinpoint the interplay between positive and negative feedback loops that are involved in controlling intracellular [Cac2+]-oscillations. Furthermore, we review several examples of dose-response curves obtained from [Cac2+]-spiking for various GPCR pathways. This paper is expected to be useful for pharmacologists and computational biologists for designing clinical applications of GPCR targeting drugs through modulation of Ca2+-dynamics.","Dhyani, Vaibhav; Gare, Suman; Gupta, Rishikesh Kumar; Swain, Sarpras; Venkatesh, K V; Giri, Lopamudra",Cell Signal,,747

A systematic review of these publications to provide an accurate burden of these psychiatric/behavioral problems is needed for planning mitigating measures by the health authorities. METHODS: Different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, medRxiv and bioRxiv) were searched for articles describing psychological/behavioral complications in children/adolescents with/without pre-existing behavioral abnormalities and their caregivers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only original articles with/without comparator arms and a minimum sample size of 50 were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate of various psychological/behavioral problems was calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen studies describing 22 996 children/adolescents fulfilled the eligibility criteria from a total of 219 records. Overall, 34.5%, 41.7%, 42.3% and 30.8% of children were found to be suffering from anxiety, depression, irritability and inattention. Although the behavior/psychological state of a total of 79.4% of children was affected negatively by the pandemic and quarantine, at least 22.5% of children had a significant fear of COVID-19, and 35.2% and 21.3% of children had boredom and sleep disturbance. Similarly, 52.3% and 27.4% of caregivers developed anxiety and depression, respectively, while being in isolation with children. CONCLUSION: Anxiety, depression, irritability, boredom, inattention and fear of COVID-19 are predominant new-onset psychological problems in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children with pre-existing behavioral problems like autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a high probability of worsening of their behavioral symptoms.","Panda, Prateek Kumar; Gupta, Juhi; Chowdhury, Sayoni Roy; Kumar, Rishi; Meena, Ankit Kumar; Madaan, Priyanka; Sharawat, Indar Kumar; Gulati, Sheffali",J. trop. pedriatr,,747

Numerous randomized trials have required changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but guidance for reporting such modifications is incomplete. Objective: As a joint extension for the CONSORT and SPIRIT reporting guidelines, CONSERVE (CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances) aims to improve reporting of trial protocols and completed trials that undergo important modifications in response to extenuating circumstances. Evidence: A panel of 37 international trial investigators, patient representatives, methodologists and statisticians, ethicists, funders, regulators, and journal editors convened to develop the guideline. The panel developed CONSERVE following an accelerated, iterative process between June 2020 and February 2021 involving (1) a rapid literature review of multiple databases (OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL) and gray literature sources from 2003 to March 2021; (2) consensus-based panelist meetings using a modified Delphi process and surveys; and (3) a global survey of trial stakeholders. Findings: The rapid review yielded 41â¯673 citations, of which 38 titles were relevant, including emerging guidance from regulatory and funding agencies for managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trials. However, no generalizable guidance for all circumstances in which trials and trial protocols might face unanticipated modifications were identified. The CONSERVE panel used these findings to develop a consensus reporting guidelines following 4 rounds of meetings and surveys. Responses were received from 198 professionals from 34 countries, of whom 90% (n = 178) indicated that they understood the concept definitions and 85.4% (n = 169) indicated that they understood and could use the implementation tool. Feedback from survey respondents was used to finalize the guideline and confirm that the guideline's core concepts were applicable and had utility for the trial community. CONSERVE incorporates an implementation tool and checklists tailored to trial reports and trial protocols for which extenuating circumstances have resulted in important modifications to the intended study procedures. The checklists include 4 sections capturing extenuating circumstances, important modifications, responsible parties, and interim data analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: CONSERVE offers an extension to CONSORT and SPIRIT that could improve the transparency, quality, and completeness of reporting important modifications to trials in extenuating circumstances such as COVID-19.","Orkin, Aaron M; Gill, Peter J; Ghersi, Davina; Campbell, Lisa; Sugarman, Jeremy; Emsley, Richard; Steg, Philippe Gabriel; Weijer, Charles; Simes, John; Rombey, Tanja; Williams, Hywel C; Wittes, Janet; Moher, David; Richards, Dawn P; Kasamon, Yvette; Getz, Kenneth; Hopewell, Sally; Dickersin, Kay; Wu, Taixiang; Ayala, Ana Patricia; Schulz, Kenneth F; Calleja, Sabine; Boutron, Isabelle; Ross, Joseph S; Golub, Robert M; Khan, Karim M; Mulrow, Cindy; Siegfried, Nandi; Heber, Joerg; Lee, Naomi; Kearney, Pamela Reed; Wanyenze, Rhoda K; Hróbjartsson, Asbjørn; Williams, Rebecca; Bhandari, Nita; Jüni, Peter; Chan, An-Wen",JAMA,,747

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has created intense anxiety in nurses/midwives that may affect the care they provide. Nurses and midwives may manage anxiety using solution-focused thinking skills. METHODS: This descriptive correlational study included 170 nurses/midwives at 61 family health centres evaluated from 1 August to 14 September 2020. RESULTS: The participants' state and trait anxiety scores were above average, indicating a moderate level of anxiety and the mean total solution-focused inventory scores were at a moderate level. It was determined that 47.9% of the variance in state anxiety scores could be explained by trait anxiety, age, years of professional experience, chronic illness, type of work shift during the pandemic, follow-up of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using computed tomography or a COVID-19 test, and whether the institution was taking necessary measures against COVID-19. There was a negative relationship between state anxiety and solution-focused inventory total score. CONCLUSION: Nurses/midwives displayed a moderate level of anxiety and solution-focused thinking skills during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Steps should be taken to improve nurses' solution-focused thinking skills to enable them to organise quickly and manage care processes successfully in extraordinary circumstances such as pandemics. Moreover, personal empowerment programmes should be recommended for nurses and midwives to help them cope with anxiety.","Selçuk Tosun, Alime; Akgül Gündogdu, Nurcan; Tas, Filiz",J. nurs. manag,,747

Different diagnostic tools, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), lung ultrasound (LUS), and computerized tomography (CT), have been used to detect active pneumonic lesions associated with COVID-19 with their varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with a pneumonic lung lesion detected by CT that is not detected by CXR. A total of 156 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at three nationally designated South Korean hospitals with no active lesion detected by CXR but on clinical suspicion of pneumonia underwent the CT examination and were enrolled. Medical records, which included demographic and clinical features, including comorbidity, symptoms, radiological, and laboratory findings on admission, were reviewed and analyzed. The risk factors of pneumonia detected by CT for patients without an active lesion detected by CXR were investigated. Of the 156 patients without an active lesion detected by CXR, 35 (22.44%) patients were found to have pneumonia by CT. The patients with pneumonia defined by CT were older than those without (64.1 years vs. 41.2 years). Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, preexisting stroke, and dementia were more common among patients with pneumonia defined by CT than those without. Serum albumin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), stroke, and age &#8805; 70 years were significantly associated with pneumonia defined by CT after adjustment for age. In multivariable regression analysis, serum albumin level (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.123, 95% CI = (0.035-0.429)) and preexisting stroke (AOR = 11.447, 95% CI = (1.168-112.220)) significantly and independently predicted pneumonia detection by CT. Our results suggest that CT scans should be performed on COVID-19 patients negative for a pneumonic lung lesion by CXR who are suspected to be pneumonic on clinical grounds. In addition, older patients with a lower albumin level and a preexisting stroke should be checked for the presence of pneumonia despite a negative CXR finding for an active lesion.","Acharya, Dilaram; Park, Jungi; Lee, Yebong; Hamm, In Suk; Lee, Dong Seok; Moon, Seong-Su; Lee, Kwan",,,747

These have implications for the regular health services including the TB control program. This brief communication assesses the impact of the COVID-19 response on the TB control activities of Addis Ababa health centers based on research project data. We compared the patient flows in pre-COVID-19 period (quarter 1, Q1) and during COVID-19 (quarter 2, Q2 and quarter 3, Q3) of 2020 at 56 health centers in Addis Ababa from all 10 sub-cities per sub-city. The patient flow declined from 3,473 in Q1 to 1,062 in Q2 and 1,074 in Q3, which is a decrease by 62-76% and 52-80% in Q2 and Q3 respectively as compared to that of Q1. In Q2, Kolfe keranio and Kirkos sub-cities recorded the biggest decline (76 and 75% respectively) whereas Yeka sub-city had the least decline (62%). In Q3, Kirkos sub-city had the biggest decline (80%) and Addis ketema sub-city had the lowest (52%). We conclude that the series of measures, state of emergency proclamation and government directives issued to counter the spread of COVID-19 and the public response to these significantly affected the TB control activities in Addis Ababa city as attested by the decrease in the patient flow at the clinics. Health authorities may inform the public that essential health services are still available and open to everyone in need of these services.","Beyene, Negussie Wodajo; Sitotaw, Alemu Lakew; Tegegn, Ben; Bobosha, Kidist",Pan Afr Med J,,747

The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. Here, the humoral immune response of a cohort of 143 COVID-19 patients from the University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Germany was characterized. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RESULTS: COVID-19 severity increased with age and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than females. Disease severity correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after PCR conformation of the infection and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID19 disease severity seemed to correlate with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. CONCLUSION: The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.","Henss, Lisa; Scholz, Tatjana; von Rhein, Christine; Wieters, Imke; Borgans, Frauke; Eberhardt, Fabian J; Zacharowski, Kai; Ciesek, Sandra; Rohde, Gernot; Vehreschild, Maria; Stephan, Christoph; Wolf, Timo; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Scheiblauer, Heinrich; Schnierle, Barbara S",J. infect. dis,,747

Meanwhile, patient surveys have suggested that continuity of care and access to care are worsening. AIM: To explore whether increasing the size of the practice population and working collaboratively are linked to changes in continuity of care or access to care. DESIGN AND SETTING: This observational study in English general practice used data on patient experience, practice size, and collaborative working. Data were drawn from the English GP Patient Survey, NHS Digital, and from a previous study. METHOD: The main outcome measures were the proportions of patients at practice level reporting positive experiences of both access and relationship continuity of care in the GP Patient Survey. Changes in proportions between 2013 and 2018 among practices that had grown and those that had, roughly, stayed the same size were compared, as were patients' experiences, categorised by whether or not practices were working in close collaborations in 2018. RESULTS: Practices that had grown in population size had a greater fall in continuity of care (by 6.6%, 95% confidence interval = 4.3% to 8.9%), than practices that had roughly stayed the same size, after controlling for other factors. Differences in falls in access to care were smaller (4.3% difference for being able to get through easily on the telephone; 1.5% for being able to get an appointment; 0.9% in satisfaction with opening hours), but were statistically significant. Practices collaborating closely with others had marginally worse continuity of care than those not working in collaboration, and no differences in access. CONCLUSION: Larger general practice size in England may be associated with slightly poorer continuity of care and may not improve patient access. Close collaborative working did not have any demonstrable effect on patient experience.","Forbes, Lindsay Jl; Forbes, Hannah; Sutton, Matt; Checkland, Katherine; Peckham, Stephen",Br.j.gen.pract,,747

Because practices now are considering reintroduction of elective endoscopy, we conducted a survey of North American practices to identify reactivation barriers and strategies. METHODS: We designed and electronically distributed a web-based survey to North American gastroenterologists consisting of 7 domains: institutional demographics, impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy practice, elective endoscopy resumption plans, anesthesia modifications, personal protective equipment policies, fellowship training, and telemedicine use. Responses were stratified by practice type: ambulatory surgery center (ASC) or hospital-based. RESULTS: In total, 123 practices (55% ASC-based and 45% hospital-based) responded. At the pandemic's peak (as reported by the respondents), practices saw a 90% decrease in endoscopy volume, with most centers planning to resume elective endoscopy a median of 55 days after initial restrictions. Declining community prevalence of COVID-19, personal protective equipment availability, and preprocedure severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing availability were ranked as the 3 primary factors influencing reactivation timing. ASC-based practices were more likely to identify preprocedure testing availability as a major factor limiting elective endoscopy resumption (P = .001). Preprocedure SARS-CoV-2 testing was planned by only 49.2% of practices overall; when testing is performed and negative, 52.9% of practices will continue to use N95 masks. CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights barriers and variable strategies for reactivation of elective endoscopy services after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that more widespread access to preprocedure SARS-CoV-2 tests with superior performance characteristics is needed to increase provider and patient comfort in proceeding with elective endoscopy.","Kushnir, Vladimir M; Berzin, Tyler M; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Mendelsohn, Robin B; Patel, Vaishali; Pawa, Swati; Smith, Zachary L; Keswani, Rajesh N",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,,747

This meta-analysis was strictly focused on the influence of smoking history on the severe and critical outcomes on people with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in eight online databases before 1 February 2021. All studies meeting our selection criteria were included and evaluated. Stata 14.0 software was used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 109 articles involving 517,020 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was discovered between smoking history and COVID-19 severity, the pooled OR was 1.55 (95%CI: 1.41-1.71). Smoking was significantly associated with the risk of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.36-2.19), increased mortality (OR=1.58, 95%CI: 1.38-1.81), and critical diseases composite endpoints (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.35-1.93), whereas there was no relationship with mechanical ventilation. The pooled prevalence of smoking using the random effects model (REM) was 15% (95%CI: 14%-16%). Meta-regression analysis showed that age (P=0.004), hypertension (P=0.007), diabetes (P=0.029), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P=0.001) were covariates that affect the association. Conclusions: Smoking was associated with severe or critical outcomes and increased the risk of admission to ICU and mortality in COVID-19 patients, but not associated with mechanical ventilation. This association was more significant for former smokers than in current smokers. Current smokers also had a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared with non-smokers. More detailed data, which are representative for more counties, are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","Zhang, Huimei; Ma, Shaodi; Han, Tiantian; Qu, Guangbo; Cheng, Ce; Uy, John Patrick; Shaikh, Mohammad Baseem; Zhou, Qin; Song, Evelyn J; Sun, Chenyu",Eur J Integr Med,,747

METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis of 409 severe, hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 20 January to 29 February 2020 was performed. The longitudinal characteristics of immune inflammatory cytokines in patients with/without diarrhea were analyzed. The relations of diarrhea and immuno-inflammatory factors with illness course and clinical outcomes were further explored. RESULTS: Diarrhea was more common and more serious with longer duration (4.9 ± 1.5 vs 4.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.039) and higher frequency (5.5 ± 2.1 vs 4.0 ± 2.0 times/day, P = 0.001) in deceased patients than in the survivors. Also, diarrhea patients were more inclined to develop multi-organ damage: survivors have longer illness course (media 41.0 vs 36.0 days, P = 0.052) and hospital stays (media 27.0 vs 23.0 days, P = 0.041), and the deceased patients had higher mortality (33.0% vs 22.6%, P = 0.045) and earlier death (media 20.0 vs 25.0 days, P = 0.038). Progressively, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, especially the declined CD8+ T cells, were demonstrated in diarrhea patients relative to the non-diarrhea cases. The inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were intensively increased in patients with diarrhea. The multivariable logistic analysis showed longer duration of diarrhea (P = 0.036), higher neutrophil counts (P = 0.011), and lower lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors of in-hospital death. The proportional hazards model indicated that longer duration of diarrhea (P = 0.002), higher frequency of diarrhea (P = 0.058), higher neutrophil counts (P = 0.001), lower lymphocyte counts (P = 0.035), and decreased proportion of CD8+ T cells (P < 0.001) were independently associated with longer illness course of the survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea patients were more likely to present with neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and cytokine storm and to develop multi-organ damage. The inflammatory patterns were independent factors associated with illness course of the survivors and in-hospital death of severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Lei; Han, Chaoqun; Zhang, Shengyan; Duan, Caihan; Shang, Haitao; Bai, Tao; Hou, Xiaohua",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,747
396447,Public expenditures in the selected economic industries: Policy implications for the period of the covid-19 pandemic crisis,2021,"Nanoscrolls are a class of nanostructures where atomic layers of 2D materials are stacked consecutively in a coaxial manner to form a 1D spiral topography. Self-assembly of chemical vapor deposition grown 2D WS2 monolayer into quasi-1D van der Waals scroll structure instigates a plethora of unique physiochemical properties significantly different from its 2D counterparts. The physical properties of such nanoscrolls can be greatly manipulated upon hybridizing them with high-quantum-yield colloidal quantum dots, forming 0D/2D structures. The efficient dissociation of excitons at the heterojunctions of QD/2D hybridized nanoscrolls exhibits a 3000-fold increased photosensitivity compared to the pristine 2D-material-based nanoscroll. The synergistic effects of confined geometry and efficient QD scatterers produce a nanocavity with multiple feedback loops, resulting in coherent lasing action with an unprecedentedly low lasing threshold. Predominant localization of the excitons along the circumference of this helical scroll results in a 12-fold brighter emission for the parallel-polarized transition compared to the perpendicular one, as confirmed by finite-difference time-domain simulation. The versatility of hybridized nanoscrolls and their unique properties opens up a powerful route for not-yet-realized devices toward practical applications.","Ghosh, Rapti; Lin, Hung-I; Chen, Yu-Siang; Singh, Mukesh; Yen, Zhi-Long; Chiu, Shengkuei; Lin, Hsia-Yu; Bera, Krishna P; Liao, Yu-Ming; Hofmann, Mario; Hsieh, Ya-Ping; Chen, Yang-Fang",Small,,747
399010,The impact of the international crisis on the entrepreneurial intentions of refugees,2021,"BackgroundFollowing emergency use authorization in December 2020, the Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial was amended to an open-label phase, where participants were unblinded and those randomized to placebo were offered vaccination. Emergence of the delta variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with increased incidences of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among unvaccinated and vaccinated persons. This exploratory analysis evaluated the incidence and genetic sequences of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing COVE trial during the open-label phase, with a focus on July-August 2021, when delta-variants surged in the US. MethodsCovid-19 cases were identified in participants initially randomized to mRNA-1273 (vaccinated from July-December 2020) and those initially randomized to the placebo (vaccinated December 2020-April 2021) who received at least one dose and were SARS-CoV-2-negative at baseline in the modified-intent-to-treat population were analyzed. Included were Covid-19 cases occurring after 26-Mar-2021 with positive RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples (central lab test) and reported Covid-19 symptoms. Genetic sequencing of Covid-19 cases was also performed. ResultsThere were 14,746 participants in the earlier mRNA-1273 (mRNA-1273e) group and 11,431 in the later placebo-mRNA1273 (mRNA-1273p) group. Covid-19 cases increased from the start of the open-label phase to July-August 2021. During July and August, 162 Covid-19 cases occurred in the mRNA-1273e group and 88 in the mRNA-1273p group. Of the cases sequenced, 144/149 [97%]) in the mRNA-1273 and 86/88 (99%) in the mRNA-1273p groups were attributed to delta. The incidence rate of Covid-19 was lower for the mRNA-1273p (49.0/1000 person-years) versus mRNA-1273e (77.1/1000 person-years) group [36.4% (95% CI 17.1%-51.5%) reduction]. There were fewer severe Covid-19 cases in the mRNA-1273p (6; 6.2/1000 person-years) than mRNA-1273e (13; 3.3/1000 person-years) [46.0% (95% CI -52.4%-83.2%) reduction]. Three Covid-19 related hospitalizations occurred with two resulting deaths in the mRNA-1273e group. ConclusionIncidence rates of Covid-19 and severe Covid-19 were lower during the months when delta was the dominant variant (July/August 2021) among COVE participants vaccinated more recently. Analysis of COVID-19 cases from the open-label phase of the COVE study is ongoing.","Baden, Lindsey R; ElSahly, Hana M; Essink, Brandon; Follman, Dean; Neuzil, Kathleen M; August, Allison; Clouting, Heather; Fortier, Gabrielle; Deng, Weiping; Han, Shu; Zhao, Xiaoping; Leav, Brett; Talarico, Carla; Girard, Bethany; Paila, Yamuna; Tomassini, Joanne E; Schodel, Florian; Pajon, Rolando; Zhou, Honghong; Das, Rituparna; Miller, Jacqueline",,,747

411975,Comparaison des scores de sévérité dans les pneumonies à SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Background: From the first detection in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infections have spread rapidly worldwide and have been proven to cause an urgent and important health problem. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on two proteins present on the surface of host cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The nasal cavity is thought to be one of the initial sites of infection and a possible reservoir for dissemination within and between individuals. However, it is not known how the expression of these genes is regulated in the nasal mucosa. Objective: In this study, we examined whether the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is affected by innate immune signals in the nasal mucosa. We also investigated how fluticasone propionate (FP), a corticosteroid used as an intranasal steroid spray, affects the gene expression. Methods: Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were collected from the nasal mucosa and incubated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and/or fluticasone propionate (FP), followed by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses. Results: Among the TLR agonists, the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) significantly increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in HNECs (ACE2 36.212±11.600-fold change, p<0.0001; TMPRSS2 5.598±2.434-fold change, p=0.031). The ACE2 protein level was also increased with Poly(I:C) stimulation (2.884±0.505-fold change, p=0.003). The Poly(I:C)-induced ACE2 expression was suppressed by co-incubation with FP (0.405±0.312-fold change, p=0.044). Conclusion: The activation of innate immune signals via TLR3 promotes the expression of genes related to SARS-CoV2 cell entry in the nasal mucosa, although this expression is suppressed in the presence of FP. Further studies are required to evaluate whether FP suppresses SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry.","Nakazono, Akira; Nakamaru, Yuji; Ramezanpour, Mahnaz; Kondo, Takeshi; Watanabe, Masashi; Hatakeyama, Shigetsugu; Kimura, Shogo; Honma, Aya; Wormald, P J; Vreugde, Sarah; Suzuki, Masanobu; Homma, Akihiro",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,747

In this work, the structure and conformation of Î³-gliadin were investigated through its limited chymotrypsic digestion. Using a combination of computational, biochemical and biophysical tools, we studied each of its N and C terminal domains. Our results reveal that Î³-gliadin is a partially disordered protein with an unfolded N-terminal domain surprisingly resistant to chymotrypsin and a folded C-terminal domain. Using spectroscopic tools, we showed that structural transitions occured over the disordered N-terminal domain for decreasing ethanol/water ratios. Using SAXS measurements, low-resolution 3D structures of Î³-gliadin were proposed. To relate the repeated motifs of the N-terminal domain of Î³-gliadin to its structure, engineered peptide models PQQPY/F were also studied. Overall results demonstrated strong similarities between the N-terminal domain and its derived model peptides. Our findings support the use of these peptides as general templates for understanding the wheat protein assembly and dynamics.","Sahli, Line; Boire, Adeline; Solé-Jamault, Véronique; Rogniaux, Hélène; Giuliani, Alexandre; Roblin, Pierre; Renard, Denis",Int. j. biol. macromol,,747

The epidemiological case definition for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was developed from literature review of data on viral kinetics. For achieving second objective, the individuals who satisfied the developed case definition for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection were contacted telephonically. Taking available evidence into consideration, re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in our study was defined as any individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by either molecular tests or rapid antigen test at an interval of at least 102 days with one negative molecular test in between. In this archive based, telephonic survey, 58 out of 1300 individuals (4.5%) fulfilled the above-mentioned definition; 38 individuals could be contacted with healthcare workers (HCWs) accounting for 31.6% of the cases. A large proportion of participants was asymptomatic and had higher Ct value during the first episode. While SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is still a rare phenomenon, there is a need for epidemiological definition of re-infection for establishing surveillance systems and this study contributes to such a goal.Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) re-infection is an emerging concern and there is a need to define it. Therefore, working epidemiological case definition for re-infection was developed and its magnitude was explored via archive-based, telephonic survey. Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was defined as two positive tests at an interval of at least 102 days with one interim negative test. Thirty-eight of the 58 eligible patients could be contacted with 12 (31.6%) being HCWs. Majority of the participants were asymptomatic and had higher Ct value during their first episode. To conclude, a working epidemiological case definition of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is important to strengthen surveillance. The present investigation contributes to this goal and records reinfection in 4.5% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India.","Mukherjee, Aparna; Anand, Tanu; Agarwal, Anup; Singh, Harpreet; Chatterjee, Pranab; Narayan, Jitendra; Rana, Salaj; Gupta, Nivedita; Bhargava, Balram; Panda, Samiran",Epidemiol Infect,,747

439192,Síndrome de Guillain Barré asociado a infección por SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly influenced society in the past few years. Park accessibility and social distancing are considered important under the threat of a long-term epidemic. However, measures that can maintain park accessibility and diminish virus spreading synchronously have been seldom studied before, which may threaten public health in all major urban parks globally. This paper proposed a methodology based on an agent-based model to analyze capacities for parks by simulating park visitor behaviors when they all are social distancing. The model was derived from historical visitor data and realistic visitor behaviors in three park settings. Then, park capacities of varied contact conditions, different park policies, and layout adjustments were analyzed. First, congestions caused by social distancing without proper visitor control are found inside all parks. Second, 85 to 3972 square meters per person is predicted as a safe space in different parks. Third, the current results can be easily adjusted according to various concerns regarding infection distance and rate. Finally, it can be inferred that information provisions are more effective than space design adjustments and mandatory measures. The results can guide park managers and those who plan and design park settings. They are also helpful in improving knowledge of the mechanisms behind visitor behaviors. Moreover, these findings can be tested and verified in a variety of public spaces with many other contact-based illnesses.","Yue, Zhi; Burley, Jon Bryan; Cui, Zhouxiao; Lei, Houping; Zhou, Jing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,747

Currently, no potent medicine is available to treat COVID-19. Quest for new drugs especially from natural plant sources is an area of immense potential. The current study aimed to repurpose stilbenoid analogs, reported for some other biological activities, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex for their affinity and stability using molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis based on molecular docking. Four compounds in total were probed for their binding affinity using molecular docking. All of the compounds showed good affinity (> -7 kcal/mol). However, fifty nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation in aqueous solution revealed highly stable bound conformation of resveratrol to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex. Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex. Based on the results, we report that stilbene based compounds in general and resveratrol, in particular, can be promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike protein.

OBJECTIVE: Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress. METHODS: We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians, resident physicians, and nursing staff, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. RESULTS: Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members and the stress of social distancing. Later, the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician-patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.

The overall sensitivity was of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%), the positive predictive value of 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%). The sensitivity was higher in symptomatic patients, in those arriving within 5 days since symptom onset and in those with high viral load. INTERPRETATION: Ag-RDT had relatively good performance characteristics in suspected symptomatic patients within five days since the onset of symptoms. However, our data do not support the sole use of Panbio&#8482; Ag-RDT in asymptomatic individuals.

500336,The covid-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls in the local governments in slovakia,2021,"Many of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate viral replication, overall virulence, and viral genomic RNA reproduction. We sought to better characterize the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 structure revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted the relative juxtapositioning of the monomers within the homodimer. We have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure, and identified a peptide-binding site that warrants further study to understanding Nsp9 function.","Littler, Dene R; Gully, Benjamin S; Colson, Rhys N; Rossjohn, Jamie",iScience,,747

The outbreaks depend on different social and demographic factors based on human mobility structured with the help of mathematical models for vector-borne disease transmission. In Dec 2019, an infectious disease is known as ""coronavirus"" (officially declared as COVID-19 by WHO) emerged in Wuhan (Capital city of Hubei, China) and spread quickly to all over the china with over 50,000 cases including more than 1000 death within a short period of one month. Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this proposed hybrid computing technique are as follows: The innovative design of the NAR-RBFs neural network paradigm is designed to construct the SITR epidemic differential equation (DE) model to ascertain the different features of the spread of COVID-19. The new set of transformations is introduced for nonlinear input to achieve with a higher level of accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis. METHODS: Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. In this research bimodal spread of COVID-19 is investigated with hybrid model based on nonlinear autoregressive with radial base function (NAR-RBFs) neural network for SITR model. Chaotic and stochastic data of the pandemic. A new class of transformation is presented for the system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) for fast convergence and improvement of desired accuracy level. The proposed transformations convert local optimum values to global values before implementation of bimodal paradigm. RESULTS: This suggested NAR-RBFs model is investigated for the bi-module nature of SITR model with additional feature of fragility in modeling of stochastic variation ability for different cases and scenarios with constraints variation. Best agreement of the proposed bimodal paradigm with outstanding numerical solver is confirmed based on statistical results calculated from MSE, RMSE and MAPE with accuracy level based on mean square error up to 1E-25, which further validates the stability and consistence of bimodal proposed model. CONCLUSIONS: This computational technique is shown extraordinary results in terms of accuracy and convergence. The outcomes of this study will be useful in forecasting the progression of COVID-19, the influence of several deciding parameters overspread of COVID-19 and can help for planning, monitoring as well as preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Shoaib, Muhammad; Raja, Muhammad Asif Zahoor; Sabir, Muhammad Touseef; Bukhari, Ayaz Hussain; Alrabaiah, Hussam; Shah, Zahir; Kumam, Poom; Islam, Saeed",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,747

We compare the contagion phenomenon of Bitcoin and other financial markets or assets pre and during the COVID-19 shock in both contemporaneous and non-contemporaneous manner. This paper uses the directed acyclic graph (DAG), spillover index, and network topology to provide strong evidence on the directional contagion outcomes of Bitcoin and other assets. The empirical results show that the contagion effect between Bitcoin and developed markets is strengthened during the COVID-19 crisis. Particularly, European market has a dominant role. Excluding Bitcoin’s own shocks, United State and European markets are the main contagion sources to Bitcoin. European market also works as the intermediary to deliver the infectious from United State and market fear. The findings also show that gold always has contagion effect with Bitcoin, while gold, US dollar and bond market are the contagion receivers of Bitcoin under the shock of COVID-19. The empirical results further proved the safe haven, hedge and diversifier potential of Bitcoin in economic stable time, but also shows that the sustainability of these properties is undermined during the market turmoil.","Guo, Xiaochun Lu Fengbin Wei Yunjie",Research in International Business and Finance,,747

Based on the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 4, “achieving inclusive and quality education for all”, this study designed two feasible learning models for the solution of sustainable learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, GPAM-WATA and Paper-and-Pencil test (PPT). The GPAM-WATA, a web-based dynamic assessment, offers online learning to most of the populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, while PPT makes the vulnerable groups’ access to learning possible with the aid of paper-based delivery. A quasi-experimental design was adopted, and both learning models were applied to a junior high school English reading course in Taiwan. A total of 122 seventh graders were randomly assigned to the GPAM-WATA group and PPT group for self-directed learning. The findings show that the GPAM-WATA is a sustainable educational technique that facilitates a better improvement in English reading performance. The PPT also has a positive effect on English reading performance, although not significantly if compared with the GPAM-WATA. This study suggests that GPAM-WATA is effective for English reading instruction in an online learning environment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 3 to June 2, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfused a convenience sample of 20,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. RESULTS: The incidence of all serious adverse events was low; these included transfusion reactions (n=78; <1%), thromboembolic or thrombotic events (n=113; <1%), and cardiac events (n=677, ~3%). Notably, the vast majority of the thromboembolic or thrombotic events (n=75) and cardiac events (n=597) were judged to be unrelated to the plasma transfusion per se. The 7-day mortality rate was 13.0% (12.5%, 13.4%), and was higher among more critically ill patients relative to less ill counterparts, including patients admitted to the intensive care unit versus those not admitted (15.6 vs 9.3%), mechanically ventilated versus not ventilated (18.3% vs 9.9%), and with septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction/failure versus those without dysfunction/failure (21.7% vs 11.5%). CONCLUSION: These updated data provide robust evidence that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and support the notion that earlier administration of plasma within the clinical course of COVID-19 is more likely to reduce mortality.","Joyner, Michael J; Bruno, Katelyn A; Klassen, Stephen A; Kunze, Katie L; Johnson, Patrick W; Lesser, Elizabeth R; Wiggins, Chad C; Senefeld, Jonathon W; Klompas, Allan M; Hodge, David O; Shepherd, John R A; Rea, Robert F; Whelan, Emily R; Clayburn, Andrew J; Spiegel, Matthew R; Baker, Sarah E; Larson, Kathryn F; Ripoll, Juan G; Andersen, Kylie J; Buras, Matthew R; Vogt, Matthew N P; Herasevich, Vitaly; Dennis, Joshua J; Regimbal, Riley J; Bauer, Philippe R; Blair, Janis E; van Buskirk, Camille M; Winters, Jeffrey L; Stubbs, James R; van Helmond, Noud; Butterfield, Brian P; Sexton, Matthew A; Diaz Soto, Juan C; Paneth, Nigel S; Verdun, Nicole C; Marks, Peter; Casadevall, Arturo; Fairweather, DeLisa; Carter, Rickey E; Wright, R Scott",Mayo Clin Proc,,747

Understanding the actual human mobility response to such policies remains a challenge owing to the lack of an observed and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during the pandemic. This study uses an integrated dataset, consisting of anonymized and privacy-protected location data from over 150 million monthly active samples in the USA, COVID-19 case data and census population information, to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and under the stay-at-home state orders in the USA. The study successfully quantifies human mobility responses with three important metrics: daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles travelled; and daily percentage of residents staying at home. The data analytics reveal a spontaneous mobility reduction that occurred regardless of government actions and a 'floor' phenomenon, where human mobility reached a lower bound and stopped decreasing soon after each state announced the stay-at-home order. A set of longitudinal models is then developed and confirms that the states' stay-at-home policies have only led to about a 5% reduction in average daily human mobility. Lessons learned from the data analytics and longitudinal models offer valuable insights for government actions in preparation for another COVID-19 surge or another virus outbreak in the future.","Xiong, Chenfeng; Hu, Songhua; Yang, Mofeng; Younes, Hannah; Luo, Weiyu; Ghader, Sepehr; Zhang, Lei",J R Soc Interface,,747

594941,Comité OMS de sécurité des vaccins : déclaration provisoire sur le vaccin AstraZeneca,2021-05-21,"Abstract Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family, causes a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa, where as many as 300,000 infections occur per year. Presently, there are no FDA-approved LASV-specific vaccines or antiviral agents, although the antiviral drug ribavirin has shown some efficacy. A recently identified small-molecule inhibitor of arenavirus entry, ST-193, exhibits submicromolar antiviral activity in vitro. To determine the antiviral utility of ST-193 in vivo, we tested the efficacy of this compound in the LASV guinea pig model. Four groups of strain 13 guinea pigs were administered 25 or 80mg/kg ST-193, 25mg/kg of ribavirin, or the vehicle by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route before infection with a lethal dose of LASV, strain Josiah, and continuing once daily for 14 days. Control animals exhibited severe disease, becoming moribund between days 10 and 15 postinfection. ST-193-treated animals exhibited fewer signs of disease and enhanced survival when compared to the ribavirin or vehicle groups. Body temperatures in all groups were elevated by day 9, but returned to normal by day 19 postinfection in the majority of ST-193-treated animals. ST-193 treatment mediated a 2–3-log reduction in viremia relative to vehicle-treated controls. The overall survival rate for the ST-193-treated guinea pigs was 62.5% (10/16) compared with 0% in the ribavirin (0/8) and vehicle (0/7) groups. These data suggest that ST-193 may serve as an improved candidate for the treatment of Lassa fever.","Cashman, Kathleen A.; Smith, Mark A.; Twenhafel, Nancy A.; Larson, Ryan A.; Jones, Kevin F.; Allen, Robert D.; Dai, Dongcheng; Chinsangaram, Jarasvech; Bolken, Tove’ C.; Hruby, Dennis E.; Amberg, Sean M.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Guttieri, Mary C.",Antiviral Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21371508/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211000507; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211000507; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.012,747

Internet cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) tailored by psychologists' initial assessments to meet patients' specific needs have shown promising effects. However, few studies have evaluated patient involvement in decisions during iCBT. AIM: This study aimed to explore the effect of patient-driven iCBT compared to standard iCBT on perceived control over treatment, adherence, and level of anxiety symptoms. A secondary aim was to assess the relationship between changes in empowerment and changes in anxiety symptoms. METHOD: Participants were patients recruited form primary care and assessed as meeting the criterion for an anxiety disorder. Participants were randomized to patient-driven iCBT (n = 27) or standard iCBT (n = 28). Patient-driven iCBT was adapted to participants' preferences regarding for example focus of treatment program and order of modules. Participants randomized to the control condition received the standard iCBT program for anxiety disorders at the participating unit. The outcome measures were patients' perceived control over treatment, adherence to treatment, symptoms of anxiety, depression and general disability as well as the experience of empowerment. RESULTS: Participants in patient-driven iCBT had statistically higher perceived control over treatment (t(43) = 2.13, p = .04). Symptoms were significantly reduced in both arms with regards to anxiety, depression, and general disability. A significant time per condition interaction effect for anxiety symptoms was observed (df = 45.0; F = 3.055; p = .038), where the patient-driven condition had a significantly larger reduction in anxiety. For both groups a significant correlation of r = −0.47 was found between changes in empowerment and changes in anxiety. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that iCBT that is patient-driven, may have a greater effect on anxiety, than standard iCBT. The effect on perceived control over treatment might also be larger in patient-driven treatments than in standard iCBT. Internet-based therapies inherently promote as active agents of their own care and might be well suited for promoting perceived control and empowerment.

Its etiology has long been attributed to lymphocyte (especially T-cell) dysfunction, while T-cell-mediated vascular hyperpermeability increases protein permeability in glomerular capillaries, leading to proteinuria and hypoproteinemia. Based on this etiology, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs that are effective against this disease have also been considered to correct T-cell dysfunction. However, in recent years, this has been questioned. The primary cause of NS has been considered damage to glomerular epithelial cells and podocyte-related proteins. Therefore, we first describe the changes in expression of molecules involved in NS etiology, and then describe the mechanism by which abnormal expression of these molecules induces proteinuria. Finally, we consider the mechanism by which infection causes the recurrence of NS.","Tamura, Hiroshi",World J Nephrol,https://doi.org/10.5527/wjn.v10.i5.88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631479/,747

617348,Síndrome de Guillain-Barré tras infección por SARS-CoV-2. Comentarios tras la publicación de 16 nuevos casos,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the disease COVID-19 that has decimated the health and economy of our planet. The virus causes the disease not only in people but also in companion and wild animals. People with diabetes are at risk of the disease. As yet we do not know why the virus has been highly successful in causing the pandemic within 3 months of its first report. The structural proteins of SARS include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). METHODS: The structure and function of the most abundant structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, is not fully understood. Using in silico analyses we determined the structure and potential function of the M protein. RESULTS: The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3-trans-membrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET. SemiSWEETs are related to the PQ-loop family whose members function as cargo receptors in vesicle transport, mediate movement of basic amino acids across lysosomal membranes, and are also involved in phospholipase flippase function. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage and role of the M protein having a sugar transporter-like structure is not clearly understood. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with S, E, and N protein. The S protein of the virus is glycosylated. It could be hypothesized that the sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein influences glycosylation of the S protein. Endocytosis is critical for the internalization and maturation of RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Sucrose is involved in endosome and lysosome maturation and may also induce autophagy, pathways that help in the entry of the virus. Overall, it could be hypothesized that the SemiSWEET sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein may be involved in multiple functions that may aid in the rapid proliferation, replication, and immune evasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Biological experiments would validate the presence and function of the SemiSWEET sugar transporter.","Thomas, Sunil",Pathog Immun,https://doi.org/10.20411/pai.v5i1.377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154981/,747

To enhance student engagement in student-centered classrooms, Lee and Hannafin (64: 707–734, 2016) argue that learners need to be empowered with autonomy, scaffolding, and authentic audiences, manifested in an “own it, learn it, share it” design framework. This commentary examines how each of these frameworks might be implemented with the “shift to digital” learning, and considers how these guidelines might be adopted in international contexts. While owning, learning, and sharing are principles that can be appreciated by systems of education around the globe, the very definitions and understandings of owning, learning, and sharing knowledge need to be carefully considered in light of cultural differences. The commentary concludes with a call for future research to closely examine what student-centered learning in online environments might look like in different contexts.","Wong, Kevin M.",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09842-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071525/,747
627206,Brève : Covid-19 : dépistage en entreprise,2021-02-09,"Background: After a COVID-19 diagnosis, vulnerable populations face considerable logistical and financial challenges to isolate and quarantine. We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (Test-to-Care Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. Methods: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. Results: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time - this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. Conclusions: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by vulnerable populations.","Kerkhoff, A.

630958,Les Coronavirus humains,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND: Emerging and re-emerging pathogens imperil public health and global food security. Responding to these threats requires improved surveillance and diagnostic systems. Despite their potential, genomic tools have not been readily applied to emerging or re-emerging plant pathogens such as the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST). This is due largely to the obligate parasitic nature of PST, as culturing PST isolates for DNA extraction remains slow and tedious. RESULTS: To counteract the limitations associated with culturing PST, we developed and applied a field pathogenomics approach by transcriptome sequencing infected wheat leaves collected from the field in 2013. This enabled us to rapidly gain insights into this emerging pathogen population. We found that the PST population across the United Kingdom (UK) underwent a major shift in recent years. Population genetic structure analyses revealed four distinct lineages that correlated to the phenotypic groups determined through traditional pathology-based virulence assays. Furthermore, the genetic diversity between members of a single population cluster for all 2013 PST field samples was much higher than that displayed by historical UK isolates, revealing a more diverse population of PST. CONCLUSIONS: Our field pathogenomics approach uncovered a dramatic shift in the PST population in the UK, likely due to a recent introduction of a diverse set of exotic PST lineages. The methodology described herein accelerates genetic analysis of pathogen populations and circumvents the difficulties associated with obligate plant pathogens. In principle, this strategy can be widely applied to a variety of plant pathogens.

We applied MPRAu to six human cell lines, focusing on genetic variants associated with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and human evolutionary adaptation. MPRAu expands our understanding of 3'UTR function, suggesting that simple sequences predominately explain 3'UTR regulatory activity. We adapt MPRAu to uncover diverse molecular mechanisms at base pair resolution, including an adenylate-uridylate (AU)-rich element of LEPR linked to potential metabolic evolutionary adaptations in East Asians. We nominate hundreds of 3'UTR causal variants with genetically fine-mapped phenotype associations.

Early prediction of the clinical progression was essential but still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the timeline of COVID-19 development and analyze risk factors of disease progression. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 333 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen from 10 January to 10 February 2020. Epidemiological feature, clinical records, laboratory and radiology manifestations were collected and analyzed. 323 patients with mild-moderate symptoms on admission were observed to determine whether they exacerbated to severe-critically ill conditions (progressive group) or not (stable group). We used logistic regression to identify the risk factors associated with clinical progression. RESULTS: Of all the 333 patients, 70 (21.0%) patients progressed into severe-critically ill conditions during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group, 253 (76.0%) patients belonged to the stable group, another 10 patients were severe before admission. we found that the clinical features of aged over 40 (3.80 [1.72, 8.52]), males (2.21 [1.20, 4.07]), with comorbidities (1.78 [1.13, 2.81]) certain exposure history (0.38 [0.20, 0.71]), abnormal radiology manifestations (3.56 [1.13, 11.40]), low level of T lymphocytes (0.99 [0.997, 0.999]), high level of NLR (0.99 [0.97, 1.01]), IL-6 (1.05 [1.03, 1.07]) and CRP (1.67 [1.12, 2.47]) were the risk factors of disease progression by logistic regression.

This study aims to quantify the pandemic's impact on physician productivity across radiology practice areas as measured by physician work Relative Value Units (wRVUs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: All signed diagnostic and procedural radiology reports were curated from January 1st to July 1st of 2019 and 2020. Physician work RVUs were assigned to each study type based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Utilizing divisional assignments, radiologist schedules were mapped to each report to generate a sum of wRVUs credited to that division for each week. Differential impact on divisions were calculated relative to a matched timeframe in 2019 and a same length pre-pandemic time period in 2020. RESULTS: All practice areas saw a substantial decrease in wRVUs from the 2020 pre- to intra-pandemic time period with a mean decrease of 51.5% (range 15.4%–76.9%). The largest declines were in Breast imaging, Musculoskeletal, and Neuroradiology, which had decreases of 76.9%, 75.3%, and 67.5%, respectively. The modalities with the greatest percentage decrease were mammography, MRI, and non-PET nuclear medicine. CONCLUSION: All radiology practice areas and modalities experienced a substantial decrease in wRVUs. The greatest decline was in Breast imaging, Neuroradiology, and Musculoskeletal radiology. Understanding the differential impact of the pandemic on practice areas will help radiology departments prepare for the potential depth and duration of the pandemic by better understanding staffing needs and the financial effects.","Poyiadji, Neo; Klochko, Chad; Palazzolo, Josie; Brown, Manuel L.; Griffith, Brent",Clin Imaging,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707120304976?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707120304976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302235/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.11.046,747

643892,An effective model for the outpatient management of COVID-19,2020-03-26,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an influenza-like disease that chiefly infects the lungs through respiratory transmission. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a transmembrane protein in its outer portion, targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding receptor for the cell entry. As ACE2 is highly expressed in the gut and pulmonary tissues, SARS-CoV-2 infections frequently result in gastrointestinal inflammation, with presentations ordinarily ranging from intestinal cramps to complications with intestinal perforations. However, the evidence detailing successful therapy for gastrointestinal involvement in COVID-19 patients is currently limited. A significant change in fecal microbiomes, namely dysbiosis, was characterized by the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and the depletion of beneficial commensals and their crucial association to COVID-19 severity has been evidenced. Oral probiotics had been evidenced to improve gut health in achieving homeostasis by exhibiting their antiviral effects via the gut–lung axis. Although numerous commercial probiotics have been effective against coronavirus, their efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients remain debated. In ClinicalTrials.gov, 19 clinical trials regarding the dietary supplement of probiotics, in terms of Lactobacillus and mixtures of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, for treating COVID-19 cases are ongoing. Accordingly, the preventive or therapeutic role of probiotics for COVID-19 patients can be elucidated in the near future.","Hung, Yuan-Pin; Lee, Ching-Chi; Lee, Jen-Chieh; Tsai, Pei-Jane; Ko, Wen-Chien",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442684/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081605,747

Evaporation increases the sedimentation time by reducing the droplet mass. In fact, small droplets can, depending on their solute content, almost completely evaporate during their descent to the ground and remain airborne as so-called droplet nuclei for a long time. Considering that viruses possibly remain infectious in aerosols for hours, droplet nuclei formation can substantially increase the infectious viral air load.

METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing testing outcomes with HIVST to standard testing in the general population and published between January 1, 2006 and June 4, 2019. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted and pooled risk ratios (RRs) were reported. The certainty of evidence was determined using the GRADE methodology. FINDINGS: We identified 14 eligible RCTs, 13 of which were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Support provided to self-testers ranged from no/basic support to one-on-one in-person support. HIVST increased testing uptake overall (RR:2.09; 95% confidence interval: 1.69–2.58; p < 0.0001;13 RCTs; moderate certainty evidence) and by service delivery model including facility-based distribution, HIVST use at facilities, secondary distribution to partners, and community-based distribution. The number of persons diagnosed HIV-positive among those tested (RR:0.81, 0.45–1.47; p = 0.50; 8 RCTs; moderate certainty evidence) and number linked to HIV care/treatment among those diagnosed (RR:0.95, 0.79–1.13; p = 0.52; 6 RCTs; moderate certainty evidence) were similar between HIVST and standard testing. Reported harms/adverse events with HIVST were rare and appeared similar to standard testing (RR:2.52: 0.52–12.13; p = 0.25; 4 RCTs; very low certainty evidence).

Objectives: To describe the patterns of older adults' mental and psychosocial health related to acute respiratory disease propagated-type epidemics and pandemics and to evaluate the differences with how other age groups respond. Eligibility criteria: quantitative and qualitative studies evaluating mental illness, wellbeing, or psychosocial health outcomes associated with respiratory propagated epidemics and pandemics exposure or periods (COVID-19, SARS-CoV, MERS, and Influenza) in people 65 years or older. Data source: Original articles published until June 1st, 2020, in any language searched in the electronic healthcare and social sciences database: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, WHO Global literature on coronavirus disease database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( - CNKI). Furthermore, EPPI Centre's COVID-19 living systematic map and the publicly available publication list of the COVID-19 living systematic review will be incorporated for preprints and recent COVID-19 publications. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers will extract predefined parameters. The risk of bias will be assessed. Data synthesis: Data synthesis will be performed according to study type and design, type of epidemic and pandemic, types of outcomes (mental health and psychosocial outcomes), and participant characteristics (e.g., sex, race, age, socioeconomic status, food security, presence of dependency in daily life activities independent/dependent older adults). Comparison between sex, race, and other age groups will be performed qualitatively, and quantitatively if enough data is available. The risk of bias and study heterogeneity will be reported for quantitative studies. Conclusion: This study will provide information to take actions to address potential mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and to understand responses on this age group. Furthermore, it will be useful to identify potential groups that are more vulnerable or resilient to the mental-health challenges of the current worldwide pandemic.","Aravena, J.

Methods: Observational cohort study based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide registry that collects sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain. Patients aged 20-65 years were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with mortality. Results: As of 22 May 2020, 4393 patients were included, of whom 419 (9.5%) were HCW. Median (interquartile range) age of HCW was 52 (15) years and 62.4% were women. Prevalence of comorbidities and severe radiological findings upon admission were less frequent in HCW. There were no difference in need of respiratory support and admission to intensive care unit, but occurrence of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was lower in HCW (1.7% vs. 3.9%; p=0.024 and 0.7% vs. 4.8%; p<0.001 respectively). Age, male sex and comorbidity, were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and healthcare working with lower mortality (OR 0.219, 95%CI 0.069-0.693, p=0.01). 30-days survival was higher in HCW (0.968 vs. 0.851 p<0.001). Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 HCW had fewer comorbidities and a better prognosis than NHCW. Our results suggest that professional exposure to COVID-19 in HCW does not carry more clinical severity nor mortality.","Diez-Manglano, J.; Solis Marquinez, N.; Alvarez Garcia, A.; Alcala Rivera, N.; Maderuelo Riesco, I.; Gerico Aseguinolaza, M.; Beato Perez, J.

In the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, the Social Mobilisation Action Consortium was formed to scale-up structured, data-driven community engagement. The consortium became operational across all 14 districts and supported an expansive network of 2500 community mobilisers, 6000 faith leaders and 42 partner radio stations. The benefit of a more agile digital reporting system became apparent within few months of implementing paper-based reporting given the need to rapidly use the data to inform the fast-evolving epidemic. In this paper, we aim to document the design, deployment and implementation of a digital reporting system used in six high transmission districts. We highlight lessons learnt from our experience in scaling up the digital reporting system during an unprecedented public health crisis. The lessons learnt from our experience in Sierra Leone have important implications for designing and implementing similar digital reporting systems for community engagement and community-based surveillance during public health emergencies.","Jalloh, Mohamed F; Sengeh, Paul; James, Nyuma; Bah, Saiku; Jalloh, Mohammad B; Owen, Katharine; Pratt, Samuel Abu; Oniba, Allan; Sangarie, Musa; Sesay, Samuel; Bedson, Jamie",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355270/,747

671524,Infección por SARS-CoV-2 asociada a diplopía y anticuerpos antirreceptor de acetilcolina,2020-04-18,"A number of nations were forced to declare a total shutdown due to COVID-19 infection, as extreme measure to cope with dramatic impact of the pandemic, with remarkable consequences both in terms of negative health outcomes and economic loses. However, in many countries a “Phase-2” is approaching and many activities will re-open soon, although with some differences depending on the severity of the outbreak experienced and SARS-COV-2 estimated diffusion in the general population. At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM(10) and PM(2.5)) that characterize this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM(10). Although no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM(10) of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.","Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria; Miani, Alessandro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17092986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344853/,747

As part of this, silico were studied to discover and introduce COVID-19 antiviral drugs and results showed that protease inhibitors could be very effective in controlling. This study aims to investigate the binding affinity of three curcumin derived polyphenols against COVID-19 the main protease (Mpro), binding pocket, and identification of important residues for interaction. In this study, molecular modeling, auto-dock coupled with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the conformational, and stability of COVID-19 binding pocket with diferuloylmethane, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. All three compounds have shown binding affinity −39, −89 and −169.7, respectively. Demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin showed an optimum binding affinity with target molecule and these could be one of potential ligands for COVID-19 therapy. And also, COVID-19 main protease binding pocket binds with the interface region by one hydrogen bond. Moreover, the MD simulation parameters indicated that demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin were stable during the simulation run. These findings can be used as a baseline to develop therapeutics with curcumin derived polyphenols against COVID-19.","Mulu, Aweke; Gajaa, Mulugeta; Woldekidan, Haregewoin Bezu; W/mariam, Jerusalem Fekadu",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322316/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11590,747

METHODS: A total of 684 patients with TMD were included in the study. Diagnosis for TMD was conducted according to the international criteria. Two professional radiologists were selected for professional training, and the Kappa values were compared for the diagnosis results to determine the consistency of the diagnosis. Then MRI images of these 684 patients were analyzed and the diagnosis results were obtained. RESULTS: MRI can be used for the diagnosis of TMD. There were significantly more females (518 cases) than males (166 cases) with TMD; Disc displacement with/without reduction is more common in the youth group, with the majority aged 20-30 years. The highest incidence of temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis is in the 60-year-old age group, followed by the 70-year-old age group. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral temporomandibular joint MRI can clearly show their changes; there are significantly more female with TMD than male; osteoarthritis has a significant correlation with age.","Cong, Nuonuo; Wang, Ning; Huang, Shengyuan; Cheng, Taiqi; Yan, Xing",BMC Oral Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01826-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583663/,747

677583,Crisis hiperglucémica concomitante con infección por SARS-CoV-2: una serie de casos,2021-03-20,"INTRODUCTION The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic raises many questions about the management of patients with significant comorbidities. Hematologic patients are usually fragile due to an important immunosuppression, so the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is yet to be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a single-center retrospective observational study of patients with hematologic malignancies diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Vall d´Hebron University Hospital (HUVH) between March 1st and May 31st 2020 to analyze their clinical characteristics and evolution. Patient’s demographic data, underlying pathology, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, treatment received and clinical course were collected. A statistical analysis was performed to identify the possible variables associated with COVID-19 mortality. For this purpose, we used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS We identified 70 patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hematologic malignancy. The median age was 75 years (range 22-91), and 44% were female. The majority (74%) had evidence of active malignancy and 53% were receiving active therapy. Lymphoid pathology (73%) predominated over myeloid. The median number of previous lines of treatment was 0 (range 0-6), 23% had received at least 2 lines, whereas 10% underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (5 patients allo-HSCT, 2 auto-HSCT). Half of the patients had more than one pre-existing comorbidity (17% obstructive pulmonary disease). At diagnosis the most common symptoms were fever (76%), cough (60%) and dyspnea (31%). We observed that 58% of patients presented a chest X-ray compatible with COVID-19. Regarding laboratory parameters, stood out lymphopenia (65% of patients presented <1200 lymphocytes/mm3) and elevation of inflammation parameters, such as D-dimer (median 365 ng/mL, range 50-5860), ferritin (median 1063 ng/mL, range 73-14191), IL-6 (median 59,6 pg/mL, range 3-4079) and PCR (median 11,2 mg/dL, range 0,3-79,9). Empirical therapy for COVID-19 included antibiotics (78%), anti-virals (50%, 3% remdesivir), and hydroxychloroquine (88%). Only 24% received tocilizumab, 50% heparin (33% prophylactic dose), 12% G-CSF, 9% norepinephrine, 4% corticosteroids and 1% ß-IFN. Most of patients (73%) required oxygen therapy: 36% high-flow, 29% low flow and 8% endotracheal intubation. There were 6 patients who did not receive any treatment. COVID-19 was acquired via nosocomial infection in 23% of patients, 91% of them requiring hospitalization, 14% in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The median days of hospitalization since diagnosis was 17 (range 3-55). The case fatality rate (CFR) from COVID-19 was higher in hematologic patients than the one observed in non-hematologic patients at the HUVH (figure 1), being of 41% at 11 days from diagnosis. CFR was higher in patients older than 75 years old (61%), while the mortality among patients receiving active therapy was 42%. The main cause of death was acute respiratory failure (93%). In the univariate logistic regression model, age >75 years (OR 1.07; p=0.008), active malignancy (OR 5; p=0,02), >1 comorbidity (OR 5.3; p=0,049) and high levels of IL-6 (OR 8.2; p= 0.005) were statistically significant. In the multivariable logistic regression model, age ≥75 years (OR 4.4; p=0.01) and IL-6 levels at baseline > 59.6 pg/mL (OR 7.2; p=0.01) were associated with a higher mortality (table 1). The presence of an active malignancy was not a significant variable in the multivariable logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS Patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 presented similar symptoms, signs and radiological characteristics to those described in the general population at diagnosis. In our cohort, advanced age and high IL-6 values were associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, it was observed that active hematologic disease is a factor of poor prognosis of COVID-19.

679357,Covid-19 : deuxième rapport d’étape,2020-10-31,"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (SARS COVID-19) has significant morbidity and mortality. The downstream complications resulting from this infection are not well characterized. There have been case reports of patients with COVID-19 infection presenting with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) Here, we present a case of one such patient, who failed initial management with intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG), requiring plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with a four day history of progressive paresthesias and weakness. This began in his bilateral lower extremities and ascended to the bilateral upper limb and face. Concurrent mild dysarthria and dysphagia were noted. On this encounter, he had a first time positive test for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On physical exam he had reduced dorsiflexion of the right ankle, with normal power throughout the rest of the body. He had graded sensory loss in the lower extremities, without a sensory level and diminished reflexes throughout. Lumbar puncture and MRI imaging were suggestive of demyelinating neuropathy. Due to the clinical history and albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, he was assessed with GBS and commenced on IVIG 0.4g/kg for 5 days. On day 4 of hospitalization, worsening dysarthria and dysphagia was noted and he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Subsequently, due to lack of adequate improvement in the patient's symptoms, plasmapheresis was initiated. The patient completed 7 additional sessions of plasmapheresis and had symptom resolution. DISCUSSION: There have been several case reports of GBS in the setting of COVID-19, which has been thought to be a para-infectious in origin. According to a systematic review, 96.6% of patients affected with COVID-19 GBS experienced typical COVID-19 symptoms prior to being diagnosed with GBS. This syndrome has been seen in other viral illnesses, such as West Nile virus and the Zika virus. Most of these cases have been treated successfully with IVIG, but in this report, the patient required plasmapheresis to achieve successful resolution of his symptoms. At this time, there have been approximately three published cases of GBS in the setting of COVID-19 in the USA which required plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. Additionally, all of these cases presented with typical clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: This patient's findings highlight one of the first cases of GBS in the setting of sub-clinical COVID-19 infection. This adds to the growing set of literature establishing a neurological component of the disease. It also demonstrates the use of plasmapheresis as an additional tool in the treatment of COVID-19 associated GBS.
