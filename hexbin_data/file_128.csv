261,261,261,Reading chest radiographs in the critically ill (Part II): Radiography of lung pathologies common in the ICU patient,18.438257,9.235274,2009,This is part II of two series review of reading chest radiographs in the critically ill. Conventional chest radiography remains the cornerstone of day to day management of the critically ill occasionally supplemented by computed tomography or ultrasound for specific indications. In this second review we discuss radiographic findings of cardiopulmonary disorders common in the intensive care patient and suggest guidelines for interpretation based not only on imaging but also on the pathophysiology and clinical grounds.,"Khan, Ali Nawaz; Al-Jahdali, Hamdan; AL-Ghanem, Sarah; Gouda, Alaa",Ann Thorac Med,128,22
568,568,568,Maternal Influenza Immunization and Reduced Likelihood of Prematurity and Small for Gestational Age Births: A Retrospective Cohort Study,18.258436,9.063081,2011-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Infections during pregnancy have the potential to adversely impact birth outcomes. We evaluated the association between receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and prematurity and small for gestational age (SGA) births. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cohort analysis of surveillance data from the Georgia (United States) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Among 4,326 live births between 1 June 2004 and 30 September 2006, maternal influenza vaccine information was available for 4,168 (96.3%). The primary intervention evaluated in this study was receipt of influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. The main outcome measures were prematurity (gestational age at birth <37 wk) and SGA (birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age). Infants who were born during the putative influenza season (1 October–31 May) and whose mothers were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature compared to infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38–0.94). The magnitude of association between maternal influenza vaccine receipt and reduced likelihood of prematurity increased during the period of at least local influenza activity (adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26–0.73) and was greatest during the widespread influenza activity period (adjusted OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11–0.74). Compared with newborns of unvaccinated women, newborns of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower odds of being SGA (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13–0.75) during the period of widespread influenza activity. The adjusted and unadjusted ORs were not significant for the pre-influenza activity period. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an association between immunization with the inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and reduced likelihood of prematurity during local, regional, and widespread influenza activity periods. However, no associations were found for the pre-influenza activity period. Moreover, during the period of widespread influenza activity there was an association between maternal receipt of influenza vaccine and reduced likelihood of SGA birth.

The present study was performed to design epitope-based peptide vaccine against Teschovirus A by identifying the potential T cell and B-cell epitopes from capsid proteins (VP1, VP3 and VP2) of the virus using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches. In the current study, hexapeptide T-cell and octapeptide B-cell epitopes were analyzed for immunogenicity, antigenicity and hydrophilicity scores of each epitope. Each potential epitope was further characterized using ExPASy-ProtParam and Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD3) tools for determining various physical and chemical parameters of the epitope. One linear hexapeptide T-cell epitope, i.e., RPVNDE (epitope position 77–82) and one linear octapeptide B-cell epitope, i.e., AYSRSHPQ (236–243) were identified from the viral capsid protein as they possess the capability to raise effective immunogenic reaction in the host organism against the virus. Pharmaceutical industries could harness the results of this investigation to develop epitope-based peptide vaccines by loading the identified epitopes in combination with targeting signal peptides of T-cells and B-cells and then inserting the combination into virus like particle (vlp) or constructing subunit vaccines for further trial.","Barman, Antara; Deb, Bornali; Chakraborty, Supriyo",Int J Pept Res Ther,128,12

However, the SBT has not been evaluated in a specific cohort of tracheostomized patients in whom weaning is prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the trial was to investigate the relevance of SBT failure criteria in chronic respiratory failure subjects undergoing long-term invasive home mechanical ventilation following tracheostomy and weaning failure. METHODS: Measurement of all established failure criteria including pneumotachygraphical assessment of the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) took place during an SBT. The decision to continue spontaneous breathing was based on failure criteria as well as the subjective willingness of the patient. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects with a median age of 58 years (interquartile range [IQR] 44–74) were studied; 10 with COPD, 4 with neuromuscular diseases and 1 with both. Twelve subjects met the SBT failure criteria within 30 min, but one third of these subjects were still able to continue with spontaneous breathing. In contrast, 3 subjects could not be weaned despite the SBT being successful. An increased RSBI was the most frequently observed SBT failure criterion (57% of all SBT). However, the SBT varied substantially in individual subjects who were able to sustain spontaneous breathing, despite having reached the cut-off for SBT failure. CONCLUSION: The SBT was of low predictive value regarding spontaneous breathing ability in chronic respiratory failure subjects with prolonged, unsuccessful weaning.","Magnet, F.

The identification of modified proteins has proven challenging and has mainly been achieved via enrichment methodologies. Random mutagenesis was used here to develop an engineered Af1521 ADP-ribose binding macro domain protein with 1000-fold increased affinity towards ADP-ribose. The crystal structure reveals that two point mutations K35E and Y145R form a salt bridge within the ADP-ribose binding domain. This forces the proximal ribose to rotate within the binding pocket and, as a consequence, improves engineered Af1521 ADPr-binding affinity. Its use in our proteomic ADP-ribosylome workflow increases the ADP-ribosylated protein identification rates and yields greater ADP-ribosylome coverage. Furthermore, generation of an engineered Af1521 Fc fusion protein confirms the improved detection of cellular ADP-ribosylation by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. Thus, this engineered isoform of Af1521 can also serve as a valuable tool for the analysis of cellular ADP-ribosylation under in vivo conditions.","Nowak, Kathrin; Rosenthal, Florian; Karlberg, Tobias; Bütepage, Mareike; Thorsell, Ann-Gerd; Dreier, Birgit; Grossmann, Jonas; Sobek, Jens; Imhof, Ralph; Lüscher, Bernhard; Schüler, Herwig; Plückthun, Andreas; Leslie Pedrioli, Deena M.; Hottiger, Michael O.",Nat Commun,128,12

The prognostic significance of this finding for mortality is unclear. METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with colorectal perforation who underwent emergency surgery were retrospectively reviewed in the study. Dirty mass identified on multi-detector row CT (MDCT) was 3D-reconstructed and its volume was calculated using Ziostation software. Dirty mass volume and other clinical characteristics were compared between survivor (n = 45) and mortality groups (n = 13) to identify predictive factors for mortality. Mann–Whitney U test and Χ(2) test were used in univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis was used in multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Dirty mass was identified in 36/58 patients (62.1%) and located next to perforated colorectum in all cases. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified the highest peak at 96.3 cm(3), with sensitivity of 0.643 and specificity of 0.864. Univariate analysis revealed dirty mass volume, acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as prognostic markers for mortality (p<0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed dirty mass volume and APACHE II score as independent prognostic indicators for mortality. Mortality was stratified by dividing patients into four groups according to dirty mass volume and APACHE II score. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of dirty mass volume and APACHE II score could stratify the postoperative mortality risk in patients with colorectal perforation. According to the risk stratification, surgeons might be able to decide the surgical procedures and intensity of postoperative management.","Ishikawa, Daichi; Takehara, Yukako; Takata, Atsushi; Takamura, Kazuhito; Sato, Hirohiko",World J Emerg Surg,128,1

Although disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) are tightly linked and comprising virtually identical practices in vulnerable countries in Southern Africa, research has identified parallel governance structures across the region. This study applied comparative case study research, based on 27 semi-structured interviews, to investigate the reasons for and effects of such parallel structures for DRR and CCA in Botswana, Mozambique, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia. It revealed overwhelmingly negative effects in terms of unclear mandates and leadership, uncoordinated efforts, duplication of efforts, suboptimal use of resources and competition over resources and control. The study identified both external reasons for the parallel structures, in terms of global or international initiatives or incentives, and internal reasons, with regard to the history and quality of the governance structures. Although the identified negative effects are common to a range of complex nexuses, there is a clear distinction with the DRR–CCA nexus comprising virtually indistinguishable practices in Southern Africa. There is, as such, no practical reason for keeping them apart. The parallel structures for DRR and CCA are instead the result of pervasive institutionalisation across the region, driven by coercive, mimetic and normative pressures coming from both within and abroad. Although much point to the difficulties of changing the studied institutional arrangements, these parallel structures for DRR and CCA must be addressed if the populations in Southern Africa are to enjoy safety and sustainable development.","Becker, Per; Hagelsteen, Magnus; Abrahamsson, Marcus",Jamba,128,33

Lesion formation and morphology from a temperature-controlled diamond tip radiofrequency ablation catheter is not well described. We hypothesize that lesion formation from a temperature-controlled radiofrequency system is independent of applied force over short application durations. METHODS: This study examined lesion depth, surface width, temperature, and ablation parameters of the DiamondTemp Ablation (Medtronic, Inc) system for ablation applications delivered with varying application duration (5, 10, and 15 s) and applied force (5, 10, and 30 g). Lesions from perpendicular radiofrequency applications were analyzed in a stepwise fashion from a computational model, thermochromic gel data (n=36), and porcine thigh preparation (n=231) experiments. RESULTS: Varying applied force across each application duration consistently generated comparable lesion dimensions for each model. In the computational model, lesion depths from a 5 s application with 5, 10, and 30 g of applied force were similar (2.3, 2.6, and 3.0 mm, respectively). Also, the 5 s lesion depths in the gel model were consistent across applied force (5 g, 3.2±0.1 mm; 10 g, 3.5±0.1 mm; 30 g, 3.5±0.2 mm). In the thigh model, the 5, 10, and 30 g applied forces for 5 s created lesion depths of 3.1±0.5, 3.2±1.0, and 3.2±1.1 mm, respectively. For the 10 and 15 s durations, the lesion depth and width remained consistent for the 10 and 30 g applied forces. Increases in lesion depth and width, percentage of impedance reduction, minimum power, and maximum temperature were only significant when application duration increased (from 5 to 15 s). CONCLUSIONS: Lesion dimensions with the DiamondTemp Ablation temperature-controlled radiofrequency ablation system showed no marked change with increased applied force. Short application durations generated consistent lesion dimensions across computational, thermochromic gel, and thigh models.","Verma, Atul; Schmidt, Megan M.; Lalonde, Jean-Pierre; Ramirez, David A.; Getman, Michael K.",Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol,128,31

Although the prevalence of norovirus infection is known to have increased in various countries, in India there are few reports pertaining to the norovirus disease burden. We investigated the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of noroviruses in children seeking health care at two hospitals in Kolkata, Eastern India. Faecal specimens were collected between January 2018 and December 2019 from 2812 children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis. Noroviruses were detected in 6.04% (170/2812) of the samples, and 12.9% (22/170) of these were cases of coinfection with rotavirus. Among children (≤5 years), a higher infection rate (8.2%, n = 94/1152) was observed in the 6 to 12 month age group. GII.4 Sydney 2012 was the dominant norovirus capsid genotype (n = 75/90, 83.3%), followed by GII.3 (n = 10/90, 11.1%). Other capsid types GII.13 (n = 4/90, 4.4%) and GII.17 (n = 1/90; 1.1%) were also detected at low frequency. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the GII.P16 polymerase of strains in this region clustered with those of the phylogenetically distinct monophyletic clade of GII.P16 strains, whose members have been circulating worldwide since 2014. Inter-genotypic norovirus recombinants such as GII.P16-GII.3 (n = 10) and GII.P16-GII.13 (n = 4) were also observed among the circulating strains. In comparison to previous studies from eastern India, the present study shows a higher detection rate of norovirus infection in the paediatric population suffering from acute gastroenteritis. Continuous surveillance is required for predicting the emergence of novel genotypes and recombinant strains and for future vaccine development.

The presence, characterization, and antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus from 38 retail raw chicken meat samples was performed using a standard microbiological method involving mannitol salt agar (MSA) and Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA). All the samples were positive for Staphylococcus species, of which 34 (89.5%) were positive for S. aureus. The S. aureus isolates were most resistant to tetracycline (88.24%), erythromycin (82.35%), and chloramphenicol (61.77%). Nevertheless, decreased resistance towards gentamycin (23.53%) and cotrimoxazole (38.24%) were recorded. All the S. aureus isolates in this study were resistant to cloxacillin, amoxicillin, and augmentin (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid). The present findings show how the raw chicken meat samples could be a potential source of multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains dissemination. Therefore, this study suggests high-level contamination of meat with multidrug-resistant S. aureus and highlights the public health consequences of consuming such products. Undoubtedly, uncontrolled drugs in food animal production as growth stimulators or medicinal treatment present a possible consequence to people’s health. Having the aforementioned in mind, there is a necessity to control the use of drugs and monitor any residues left in the food intended for human consumption.","Lika, Erinda; Puvača, Nikola; Jeremić, Dejan; Stanojević, Slobodan; Shtylla Kika, Tana; Cocoli, Sonila; de Llanos Frutos, Rosa",Antibiotics (Basel),128,1

Here we demonstrate that DKO ABCs show sex-specific differences in cell number, upregulation of an ISG signature, and further differentiation. DKO ABCs undergo oligoclonal expansion and differentiate into both CD11c(+) and CD11c(−) effector B cell populations with pathogenic and pro-inflammatory function as demonstrated by BCR sequencing and fate-mapping experiments. Tlr7 duplication in DKO males overrides the sex-bias and further augments the dissemination and pathogenicity of ABCs, resulting in severe pulmonary inflammation and early mortality.

This pathway is activated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), a major mediator of the cytokine storm during shock. To determine its role in the vascular response to shock, we challenged mice lacking SOCS3 in the adult endothelium (SOCS3(iEKO)) with a nonlethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SOCS3(iEKO) mice died 16–24 hours postinjection after severe kidney failure. Loss of SOCS3 led to an LPS-induced type I IFN–like program and high expression of prothrombotic and proadhesive genes. Consistently, we observed intraluminal leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil extracellular trap–osis (NETosis), as well as retinal venular leukoembolization. Notably, heterozygous mice displayed an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a gene dose effect. In vitro studies were performed to study the role of SOCS3 protein levels in the regulation of the inflammatory response. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, pulse-chase experiments showed that SOCS3 protein had a half-life less than 20 minutes. Inhibition of SOCS3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation led to protein accumulation and a stronger inhibition of IL-6 signaling and barrier function loss. Together, our data demonstrate that the regulation of SOCS3 protein levels is critical to inhibit IL-6–mediated endotheliopathy during shock and provide a promising therapeutic avenue to prevent multiorgan dysfunction through stabilization of endothelial SOCS3.","Martino, Nina; Ramos, Ramon Bossardi; Lu, Shuhan; Leyden, Kara; Tomaszek, Lindsay; Sadhu, Sudeshna; Fredman, Gabrielle; Jaitovich, Ariel; Vincent, Peter A.; Adam, Alejandro P.",,128,27

SC's early and accurate diagnosis is the key procedure to reduce these rates and improve survivability. However, the manual diagnosis is exhausting, complicated, expensive, prone to diagnostic error, and highly dependent on the dermatologist's experience and abilities. Thus, there is a vital need to create automated dermatologist tools that are capable of accurately classifying SC subclasses. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have verified the success of computer-assisted dermatologist tools in the automatic diagnosis and detection of SC diseases. Previous AI-based dermatologist tools are based on features which are either high-level features based on DL methods or low-level features based on handcrafted operations. Most of them were constructed for binary classification of SC. This study proposes an intelligent dermatologist tool to accurately diagnose multiple skin lesions automatically. This tool incorporates manifold radiomics features categories involving high-level features such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-201, and DarkNet-53 and low-level features including discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and local binary pattern (LBP). The results of the proposed intelligent tool prove that merging manifold features of different categories has a high influence on the classification accuracy. Moreover, these results are superior to those obtained by other related AI-based dermatologist tools. Therefore, the proposed intelligent tool can be used by dermatologists to help them in the accurate diagnosis of the SC subcategory. It can also overcome manual diagnosis limitations, reduce the rates of infection, and enhance survival rates.","Attallah, Omneya; Sharkas, Maha",Contrast Media Mol Imaging,128,22

C5a levels were significantly higher in patients with SAB as compared to patients with GNB. Low C4 and C3 levels were associated with septic shock and 30-day mortality in patients with GNB, and elevated C3 was associated with a desirable outcome defined as absence of (1) septic shock, (2) acute renal failure, and (3) death within 30 days of bacteremia. Low levels of C9 were associated with septic shock in patients with GNB but not SAB. Elevated IL-10 was associated with increased 30-day mortality in patients with SAB.

METHODS: This is an observational study conducted at four tertiary hospitals in Mumbai. Parameters including demographics, symptomatology, laboratory markers, medications and outcome were obtained from patient hospital records and analyzed in patients treated for MIS-C (as per WHO criteria) from 1 May, 2020 to 15 July, 2020. RESULTS: 23 patients (11 males) with median (range) age of 7.2 (0.8–14) years were included. COVID-19 RT-PCR or antibody was positive in 39.1% and 30.4%, respectively; 34.8% had a positive contact. 65% patients presented in shock; these children had a higher age (P=0.05), and significantly higher incidence of myocarditis with elevated troponin, NT pro BNP and left ventricular dysfunction, along with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, as compared to those without shock. Coronary artery dilation was seen in 26% patients overall. Steroids were used most commonly for treatment (96%), usually along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (65%). Outcome was good with only one death. CONCLUSION: Initial data on MIS-C from India is presented. Further studies and longer surveillance of patients with MIS-C are required to improve our diagnostic, treatment and surveillance criteria.","Jain, Shreepal; Sen, Supratim; Lakshmivenkateshiah, Srinivas; Bobhate, Prashant; Venkatesh, Sumitra; Udani, Soonu; Shobhavat, Laxmi; Andankar, Parmanand; Karande, Tanuja; Kulkarni, Snehal",Indian Pediatr,128,1

However, the nature of the relationship between SI and infectious disease(s) is not well understood. Accordingly, this retrospective study investigated the relationship between SI and infection. METHODS: Hospital records of patients with SI, who visited Inha University Hospital (Incheon, Republic of Korea) between January 2008 and December 2018, were reviewed. Patient data regarding clinical presentation, causative pathogens, risk factors, and radiological findings were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 353 patients with SI, 101 with infectious conditions were enrolled in this study, and their data were analyzed to identify associations between SI and infection. Ten patients were diagnosed with infective endocarditis (IE), and 26 exhibited bacteremia without IE. Twenty-seven patients experienced systemic infection due to miscellaneous causes (negative result on conventional automated blood culture), including the following intracellular organisms: parasites (malaria [n = 12], babesiosis [n = 1]); bacteria (scrub typhus [n = 5]); viruses (Epstein–Barr [n = 1], cytomegalovirus [n = 1]); and unidentified pathogen[s] (n = 7). Splenomegaly was more common among patients with miscellaneous systemic infection; infarction involving other organs was rare. Thirty-eight patients had localized infections (e.g., respiratory, intra-abdominal, or skin and soft tissue infection), and most (35 of 38) had other risk factors for SI. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, various infectious conditions were found to be associated with SI, and intracellular organisms were the most common causative pathogens. Further studies are needed to examine other possible etiologies and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.","Im, Jae Hyoung; Chung, Moon-Hyun; Lee, Hye-Jin; Kwon, Hea Yoon; Baek, Ji Hyeon; Jang, Ji-Hun; Lee, Jin-Soo",BMC Infect Dis,128,1

Lockdown or home isolation reduces sunlight exposition and increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency. Special attention is needed for older people at risk of both severe forms of COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. This review aims to highlight the association of vitamin D and COVID-19 in two instances, the direct influence of vitamin D on the immune system, and the indirect risks for other vitamin D deficiency-related diseases, such as musculoskeletal properties in older persons. METHODS: We performed a narrative review. RESULTS: Whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 poor prognosis, and if vitamin D supplementation may improve the post-infection outcomes is still unclear. In any case, the pandemic generates indirect burden, such as the sequence: home isolation, low sunlight exposition, vitamin D deficiency, and fragility fractures. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it is time to debate how to optimize vitamin D status in older people, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schmidt Azevedo, Paula; Fock, Ricardo Ambrosio; Pereira, Filipe Leal; dos Santos, Priscila Portugal; Ferro, Flavio Cruz; Sacco, Nataly; Polegato, Bertha Furlan; Zornoff, Leonardo Mamede; Okoshi, Marina Politi; Achterberg, Wilco; de Paiva, Sergio Rupp",Nutrire,128,1

While studies have been conducted on the entrepreneurial team, their focus has centered on team size and degree of diversity - cultural, age, gender - leaving a gap in the analysis of the effect of a team’s competencies on the outcome of the ventures. This research aims to help fill this gap by using the psychometric instrument DISC. This research analyzes entrepreneurship by opportunity, evaluating the performance of 109 Colombian companies and the composition of their entrepreneurial teams. The results obtained provide the basis for better understanding of the make-up of entrepreneurial teams, considering the variances and interdependencies of the competency development level among their members. They reveal that identifying the similarity or heterogeneity in certain groups of competencies, as well as how developed they are, can have an impact on the ventures’ success. The cluster analysis carried out suggests that highly developed competencies associated with the ‘dominance’ dimension in the members of an entrepreneurial team are essential. These must be above-average in heterogeneous levels among the team members. They must also be accompanied by the ‘steadiness’ competency provided by the team-oriented partners, as well as an average, homogeneous level of competencies associated with ‘conscientiousness’ if the new business is to achieve good financial results in its early years. The ‘influence’ dimension did not play a significant role. The teams made up of more homogeneous partners obtained the poorest financial results. Furthermore, the study provides new perspectives for measuring business performance in a venture, as well as for evaluating the relationships between the entrepreneurial team's competencies and the company’s results in the first years of business. Accordingly, it offers inputs for future research.","Fuel, Patricia; Pardo-del-Val, Manuela; Revuelto-Taboada, Lorenzo",Int Entrep Manag J,128,33

In this paper, we used two variables natural logarithm of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and natural logarithm of per capita international and national tourism expenditure (ITE) to study the relationship between the tourism sector and economic growth in Algeria over the period of 1995–2017. We established with the unit root test with and without breakpoint that the variables are stationary in the first difference and there is a structural break in (ITE) and (GDP). Thus, with the presence of a breakpoint, we employed the methodology of Gregory–Hansen to avoid such issue, but we found that there was no evidence of cointegration with breakpoint, so then we used the vector autoregressive model (VAR). The model showed that the tourism sector has a positive and insignificant coefficient on the economic growth, while the economic growth factor has a positive and significant on the tourism sector. In the short run, there was a one-way causality from GDP to ITE at the level of 1%, confirming the economic-driven tourism growth hypothesis. Also, we found with Breitung and Candelon causality that there was same causality at the level of 10%.","Sari Hassoun, Salah Eddine; Adda, Khayereddine Salim; Sebbane, Asma Hadjira",Futur Bus J,128,22

I construct regional Covid-19 Risk Factors (CRFs) to assess how the risk exposure of stocks to the pandemic affects their performance. I find substantial differences between stocks in Asia and the US as a result of the pandemic. During the early stages of the pandemic, the sensitivity of Asian real estate companies to the market becomes negative, while it remains positive and increases in the US. Real estate sectors experience strong divergence in performance in the US while little sectoral difference is observed in Asia. The most affected sectors in the US are retail and hotels, while in Asia it is office. A Fama–MacBeth regression shows evidence for a low-risk effect during the Covid period: while insignificant prior to the pandemic, the return-risk relationship becomes significantly negative during the Covid period, with valuation effects driving the results in both regions. Firms in the US perform significantly worse if their exposure to the pandemic is higher, which is not the case in Asia. The results point towards strong divergence of expectations between US and Asian real estate companies in the onset of Covid-19, which may be associated with the level of prior experience to similar pandemics.","Milcheva, Stanimira",J Real Estate Finan Econ,128,26

Health insurance companies play an important role here, as they act as multipliers of relevant information with their communication to insured persons. OBJECTIVES: The core element of this paper is a comparative analysis of the COVID-19 crisis communication of health insurance companies based on findings from crisis communication and health insurance communication research. The aim is to highlight how the website communication of health insurance companies can be optimized with regard to target groups, information needs and textual design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, selected models of crisis communication are presented to contextualize the empirical findings on this basis. The subject of the empirical study is a selection of statutory and private health insurance companies, with a sample of the ten insurers with most members in each sector. The analysis focuses on one of the central mediums of health insurance communication, the websites. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the communication of German health insurance companies could be implemented in a more target-group-specific manner. The linguistic comprehensibility of the information and the structure of the COVID-19 subsites could also be optimized. The analysis also shows that the insurers address prevention and the acute case of COVID-19 disease to varying degrees, but not follow-up care. However, the latter is one of the elements of crisis communication in terms of follow-up and coping with the crisis.","Goetz, Miriam; Christiaans, Lena",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,128,17

Only few antifungal drugs are currently in use for therapeutic treatment. However, evolution of a drug-resistant C. albicans fungal pathogen is of major concern in the treatment of patients, hence the clinical need for novel drug design and development. In this study, in vitro screening of novel putative pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives as the lead drug targets and in silico prediction of the binding potential of these lead molecules against C. albicans pathogenic proteins, such as secreted aspartic protease 3 (SAP3; 2H6T), surface protein β-glucanase (3N9K) and sterol 14-alpha demethylase (5TZ1), were carried out by molecular docking analyses. Further, biological activity-based QSAR and theoretical pharmacokinetic analysis were analyzed. Here, in vitro screening of novel analogue derivatives as drug targets against C. albicans showed inhibitory potential in the concentration of 0.4 µg for BQ-06, 07 and 08, 0.8 µg for BQ-01, 03, and 05, 1.6 µg for BQ-04 and 12.5 µg for BQ-02 in comparison to the standard antifungal drug fluconazole in the concentration of 30 µg. Further, in silico analysis of BQ-01, 03, 05 and 07 analogues docked on chimeric 2H6T, 3N9K and 5TZ1 revealed that these analogues show potential binding affinity, which is different from the therapeutic antifungal drug fluconazole. In addition, these molecules possess good drug-like properties based on the determination of conceptual Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based descriptors, QSAR and pharmacokinetics. Thus, the study offers significant insight into employing pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline analogues as novel antifungal agents against C. albicans that warrants further investigation.","Uppar, Vijayakumar; Chandrashekharappa, Sandeep; Shivamallu, Chandan; P, Sushma; Kollur, Shiva Prasad; Ortega-Castro, Joaquín; Frau, Juan; Flores-Holguín, Norma; Basarikatti, Atiyaparveen I.; Chougala, Mallikarjun; Mohan M, Mrudula; Banuprakash, Govindappa; Jayadev,; Venugopala, Katharigatta N.; Nandeshwarappa, Belakatte P.; Veerapur, Ravindra; Al-Kheraif, Abdulaziz A.; Elgorban, Abdallah M.; Syed, Asad; Mudnakudu-Nagaraju, Kiran K.; Padmashali, Basavaraj; Glossman-Mitnik, Daniel",Molecules,128,10

Since the overall prognosis for BC has not changed in the last 30 years, there is a compelling medical need to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Nanotechnology has been extensively developed for cancer management, including cancer diagnosis, detection, and treatment. Several nanoparticles (NP) can be used in in vitro cancer diagnostics, in vivo imaging enhancement, and drug loading techniques. In this review, we examine the current state of nanotechnology in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. We investigated the function of metal NPs, polymeric NPs, liposomes, and exosomes accompanied therapeutic agents for BC therapy, and then focused on the potential of nanotechnology to improve conventional approaches in sensing. ABSTRACT: Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer of the urinary tract in men and the fourth most common cancer in women, and its incidence rises with age. There are many conventional methods for diagnosis and treatment of BC. There are some current biomarkers and clinical tests for the diagnosis and treatment of BC. For example, radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy and surgical, but residual tumor cells mostly cause tumor recurrence. In addition, chemotherapy after transurethral resection causes high side effects, and lack of selectivity, and low sensitivity in sensing. Therefore, it is essential to improve new procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of BC. Nanotechnology has recently sparked an interest in a variety of areas, including medicine, chemistry, physics, and biology. Nanoparticles (NP) have been used in tumor therapies as appropriate tools for enhancing drug delivery efficacy and enabling therapeutic performance. It is noteworthy, nanomaterial could be reduced the limitation of conventional cancer diagnosis and treatments. Since, the major disadvantages of therapeutic drugs are their insolubility in an aqueous solvent, for instance, paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the important therapeutic agents utilized to treating BC, due to its ability to prevent cancer cell growth. However, its major problem is the poor solubility, which has confirmed to be a challenge when improving stable formulations for BC treatment. In order to reduce this challenge, anti-cancer drugs can be loaded into NPs that can improve water solubility. In our review, we state several nanosystem, which can effective and useful for the diagnosis, treatment of BC. We investigate the function of metal NPs, polymeric NPs, liposomes, and exosomes accompanied therapeutic agents for BC Therapy, and then focused on the potential of nanotechnology to improve conventional approaches in sensing.","Barani, Mahmood; Hosseinikhah, Seyedeh Maryam; Rahdar, Abbas; Farhoudi, Leila; Arshad, Rabia; Cucchiarini, Magali; Pandey, Sadanand",Cancers (Basel),128,2

METHODS: A sample of 849 pregnant persons, representing all 50 states and 5 US territories, were recruited via social media advertisements to take a 78-item web-based survey between May and December of 2020. The survey items assessed prenatal breastfeeding self-efficacy using the valid PREP to BF scale, breastfeeding intention, anxiety with giving birth during COVID-19, concern for the baby being exposed at birth, and confusion with pregnancy recommendations during COVID-19. RESULTS: The sample, mean age 28.9 years, had a relatively high mean PREP to BF score (308.52 ± 62.74; range 39–390). Over 95% indicated a plan to incorporate breastmilk into their infant feeding routine either exclusively (68.96%) or in combination (26.5%). Seventy-one % were not confused by safe pregnancy recommendations, while 50.7% were “concerned” or “very concerned” their baby would be exposed to COVID-19 at birth, and 63.3% indicated they were “anxious” or “very anxious” about giving birth during the pandemic. One-way ANOVAs revealed persons with higher perceived anxiety (P = .024), more confusion over recommendations (P < .001), and more concern for their baby's exposure (P = .002) had significantly lower PREP to BF scores than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: A pregnant person's anxiety, confusion over recommendations, and concern for their baby's safety had significant negative effects on prenatal self-efficacy for successful breastfeeding after birth during COVID-19. Prenatal healthcare teams should aim to discuss these aspects and reassure of proven safety protocols with pregnant patients to ease anxiety, confusion, or fear while helping to maintain or improve self-efficacy for the intended infant feeding method.

It is possible much of lexical diffusion happens via the changing rates of existing word categories or concepts (those that are already being used, at least to some extent, regularly) rather than new ones. In this study we introduce a new metric, contrastive lexical diffusion (CLD) coefficient, which attempts to measure the degree to which ordinary language (here clusters of common words) catch on over friendship connections over time. For instance topics related to meeting and job are found to be sticky, while negative thinking and emotion, and global events, like ‘school orientation’ were found to be less sticky even though they change rates over time. We evaluate CLD coefficient over both quantitative and qualitative tests, studied over 6 years of language on Twitter. We find CLD predicts the spread of tweets and friendship connections, scores converge with human judgments of lexical diffusion (r=0.92), and CLD coefficients replicate across disjoint networks (r=0.85). Comparing CLD scores can help understand lexical diffusion: positive emotion words appear more diffusive than negative emotions, first-person plurals (we) score higher than other pronouns, and numbers and time appear non-contagious.","Zamani, Mohammadzaman; Schwartz, H.

Evaluation must account for social, political, environmental and other conditions, such as flood state expectations and local priorities. The evaluation method should be able to quickly identify evolving investment needs as the incidence and magnitude of flood events continue to grow. Quantification is essential and must consider multiple direct and indirect effects on flood related outcomes. The method proposed is this study is a Bayesian network, which may be used ex-post for evaluation, but also ex-ante for future assessment, and near real-time for the reallocation of investment into interventions. The particular case we study is the effect of flood interventions upon mental health, which is a gap in current investment analyses. Natural events such as floods expose people to negative mental health disorders including anxiety, distress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Such outcomes can be mitigated or exacerbated not only by state funded interventions, but by individual and community skills and experience. Success is also dampened when vulnerable and previously exposed victims are affected. Current measures evaluate solely the effectiveness of interventions to reduce physical damage to people and assets. This paper contributes a design for a Bayesian network that exposes causal pathways and conditional probabilities between interventions and mental health outcomes as well as providing a tool that can readily indicate the level of investment needed in alternative interventions based on desired mental health outcomes.","Sedighi, Tabassom; Varga, Liz; Hosseinian-Far, Amin; Daneshkhah, Alireza",Int J Environ Res Public Health,128,1

Platelet responses at the site of an injury are rapid; their immediate activation and structural changes minimize the loss of blood. The majority of coagulation proteins are produced by the liver—a multifunctional organ that also plays a critical role in many processes: removal of toxins and metabolism of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and drugs. Chronic inflammation, trauma, or other causes of irreversible damage to the liver can dysregulate these pathways leading to organ and systemic abnormalities. In some cases, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios can also be a predictor of disease outcome. An example is cirrhosis, which increases the risk of bleeding and prothrombotic events followed by activation of platelets. Along with a triggered coagulation cascade, the platelets increase the risk of pro-thrombotic events and contribute to cancer progression and metastasis. This progression and the resulting tissue destruction is physiologically comparable to a persistent, chronic wound. Various cancers, including colorectal cancer, have been associated with increased thrombocytosis, platelet activation, platelet-storage granule release, and thrombosis; anti-platelet agents can reduce cancer risk and progression. However, in cancer patients with pre-existing liver disease who are undergoing chemotherapy, the risk of thrombotic events becomes challenging to manage due to their inherent risk for bleeding. Chemotherapy, also known to induce damage to the liver, further increases the frequency of thrombotic events. Depending on individual patient risks, these factors acting together can disrupt the fragile balance between pro- and anti-coagulant processes, heightening liver thrombogenesis, and possibly providing a niche for circulating tumor cells to adhere to—thus promoting both liver metastasis and cancer-cell survival following treatment (that is, with minimal residual disease in the liver).","Kanikarla Marie, Preeti; Fowlkes, Natalie W.; Afshar-Kharghan, Vahid; Martch, Stephanie L.; Sorokin, Alexey; Shen, John Paul; Morris, Van K.; Dasari, Arvind; You, Nancy; Sood, Anil K.; Overman, Michael J.; Kopetz, Scott; Menter, David George",Front Oncol,128,16

The deposition of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on textiles has received increased attention due to their well-known antimicrobial properties. Recently, the technique of in situ synthesis and deposition of AgNPs on cotton is being used frequently to prepare antimicrobial nanotextiles. The technique involves complexation of the Ag(+) ions in cotton fibers followed by their reduction to generate the particles. This in situ synthesis and deposition approach provides several advantages over the post synthesis deposition or grafting process. In this brief overview, we have presented basic information about different biocides used to prepare antimicrobial nanotextiles and highlighted the importance of in situ synthesis and deposition of AgNPs on cotton to prepare the antimicrobial nanotextiles.

This change in practice patterns may place patients at risk of a perceived lower-quality exchange with their healthcare provider, which may in turn impact satisfaction. OBJECTIVE This study compares patient satisfaction scores between in-person clinic visits and telemedicine video visits in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS Sixty-nine patients with CRS presenting to an academic rhinology clinic between March to April 2020 were retrospectively divided into video visits (VV) and clinic visits (CV) groups based on mandated state quarantine orders on March 19. Patient demographics, disease severity measures, and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 (PSQ-18) scores were collected and analyzed. Chi square test and Fisher's exact test were performed. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age (p = 0.81), gender (p = 0.55), CRS phenotype (p = 0.16), and disease severity measures (Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) (p = 0.92); Lund-Mackay score (p = 0.96)) between the video and clinic visit groups. There were no significant differences in PSQ-18 total scores (VV PSQ-18 mean score = 78.1, CV PSQ-18 mean score = 78.4; p = 0.67) or the following subdomain scores between the two groups: general satisfaction (p = 0.73), technical quality (p = 0.62), interpersonal manner (p = 0.41), communication (p = 0.31), financial aspects (p = 0.89), time spent with doctor (p = 0.88), and accessibility and convenience (p = 0.47). CONCLUSION Patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic parallels that of traditional in-person visits. Video visits can serve as a viable alternative to clinic visits, while still maintaining high satisfaction.","Morisada, Megan V; Hwang, Joshua; Gill, Amarbir S; Wilson, Machelle D; Strong, E Bradley; Steele, Toby O",American journal of rhinology & allergy,128,1

However, both provider and patient-specific challenges exist. PCP-specific challenges include unfamiliarity with depressive symptom profiles in diverse patient populations, limited time to address mental health, and limited referral options for mental health care. Patient-specific challenges include stigma around mental health issues and reluctance to seek mental health treatment. To address these issues, we implemented a multi-component intervention for Asian American and Latino American primary care patients with depression at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). METHODS/DESIGN We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a culturally appropriate intervention to improve the diagnosis and treatment of depression in our target population. Our goals are to facilitate a) primary care providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally informed care of depression, and b) patients' knowledge of and resources for receiving treatment for depression. Our two-year long intervention targets Asian American and Latino American adult (18 years of age or older) primary care patients at MGH screening positive for symptoms of depression. All eligible patients in the intervention arm of the study who screen positive will be offered a culturally focused psychiatric (CFP) consultation. Patients will meet with a study clinician and receive toolkits that include psychoeducational booklets, worksheets and community resources. Within two weeks of the initial consultation, patients will attend a follow-up visit with the CFP clinicians. Primary outcomes will determine the feasibility and cost associated with implementation of the service, and evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the CFP service. Exploratory aims will describe the study population at screening, recruitment, and enrollment and identify which variables influenced patient participation in the program. DISCUSSION The study involves an innovative yet practical intervention that builds on existing resources and strives to improve quality of care for depression for minorities. Additionally, it complements the current movement in psychiatry to enhance the treatment of depression in primary care settings. If found beneficial, the intervention will serve as a model for care of Asian American and Latino American patients.","Trinh, Nhi-Ha T; Bedoya, C A; Chang, Trina E; Flaherty, Katherine; Fava, Maurizio; Yeung, Albert",BMC psychiatry,128,11

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 137 patients (SILS-TEP, 100; conventional TEP, 37) scheduled to undergo elective inguinal hernia from January 2011 to July 2013 at Osaka Police Hospital. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the patient demographics. There were no significant differences in the length of the operation between the two groups (SILS-TEP group, 93 min vs. conventional TEP group, 92 min for unilateral hernias, p = 0.8; SILS-TEP group, 142 min vs. conventional TEP, 128 min for bilateral hernias, p = 0.4). The postoperative hospital stay, total medical charge for the hospital stay and the numerical rating scale before and 3 months after surgery were comparable in both groups. Two cases treated by SILS-TEP repair were converted to conventional three-port TEP repair (one case) and mesh-plug method (one case). The postoperative complications were comparable in both groups, and these were managed conservatively. One recurrence (2 %, 1/37) developed in the conventional TEP group, compared with 0 recurrences (0/100) in the SILS-TEP group. CONCLUSIONS SILS-TEP repair seems to be safe and feasible, with no significant differences in the total medical charges for the hospital stay or the postoperative pain score 3 months after surgery compared with conventional three-port TEP repair.","Wakasugi, Masaki; Masuzawa, Toru; Tei, Mitsuyoshi; Omori, Takeshi; Ueshima, Shigeyuki; Tori, Masayuki; Akamatsu, Hiroki",Surgery today,128,1

Our meta-analysis investigated the prevalence and possible factors associated with adverse events (AEs) during IHT. METHODS Searching PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases until February 12, 2021, we included studies that a priori defined AEs for adult medical patients. We excluded case reports, non-full-text, and non-English language studies. We performed a random effects meta-analysis and moderator analyses. RESULTS We identified 554 studies and included 19 studies (14,969 patients) in our final analysis. The mean patients' (standard deviation) age was 60 (13.7). The pooled medical AEs for IHT was 1,059 (11%, 95% confidence interval, 7.5%-16%). The most common AE (n, %) was hypotension (424, 2.8%). Moderator analyses and meta-regressions suggested that conditions (P < .001) such as respiratory failure from coronavirus infection (88%), stroke (19%), and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (40%) were associated with higher AE prevalence. Transport by nurses (31%) and physicians (11%) was associated with a higher AE prevalence, whereas transport type did not influence AE prevalence. CONCLUSION Our study suggests the prevalence of AEs of critically ill patients during IHT is low and likely due to patients' disease severity. Further studies should focus on interventions to mitigate AEs to improve patients' outcomes.","Jeyaraju, Maniraj; Andhavarapu, Sanketh; Palmer, Jamie; Bzhilyanskaya, Vera; Friedman, Eric; Lurie, Tucker; Patel, Priya; Raffman, Alison; Wang, Jennifer; Tran, Quincy K",Air medical journal,128,1

We tested whether TE in ALL and TE in the general adult population have a shared genetic etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively registered TE events and collected germline DNA in patients 1.0-45.9 years in the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 study (7/2008-7/2016). Based on summary statistics from two large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on venous TE in adults (the International Network of VENous Thromboembolism Clinical Research Networks (INVENT) consortium and the UK Biobank), we performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis on TE development in the NOPHO cohort, progressively expanding the PRS by increasing the p-value threshold of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) inclusion. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Eighty-nine of 1252 patients with ALL developed TE, 2.5 year cumulative incidence 7.2%. PRS of genome-wide significant SNPs from the INVENT and UK Biobank data were not significantly associated with TE, HR 1.16 (p 0.14) and 1.02 (p 0.86), respectively. Expanding PRS by increasing p-value threshold did not reveal polygenic overlap. However, subgroup analysis of adolescents 10.0-17.9 years (n = 231), revealed significant polygenic overlap with the INVENT GWAS. The best fit PRS, including 16,144 SNPs, was associated with TE with HR 1.76 (95% CI 1.23-2.52, empirical p-value 0.02). Our results support an underlying genetic predisposition for TE in adolescents with ALL and should be explored further in future TE risk prediction models.","Jarvis, Kirsten Brunsvig; Nielsen, Rikke Linnemann; Gupta, Ramneek; Hede, Freja Dahl; Huttunen, Pasi; Jónsson, Ólafur Gisli; Rank, Cecilie Utke; Ranta, Susanna; Saks, Kadri; Trakymiene, Sonata Saulyte; Tuckuviene, Ruta; Tulstrup, Morten; Ruud, Ellen; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; LeBlanc, Marissa",Thrombosis research,128,31

We tested 49 known coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients and 111 prepandemic stored serology specimens. This resulted in a sensitivity of 95.9%, 100.0%, and 91.3% and a specificity of 98.2%, 98.2%, and 90.8% respectively, using manufacturer recommended cutoffs after inconclusive results (one for EuroImmun IgG and five for EuroImmun IgA) being excluded in the final statistical analyses.

If a two-tiered algorithmic approach was applied, that is, testing with Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay followed by EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, 100% specificity and sensitivity could be obtained after six inconclusive results were excluded from data set before statistical analyses. Performance characteristics presented demonstrate the superior performance of IgG class antibodies for investigating previous infections. In addition, utilizing a second antibody test for supplementary testing may significantly enhance performance, particularly in lower prevalence settings.","Needle, Robert; Gilbert, Laura; Zahariadis, George; Yu, Yang; Dalton-Kenny, Hedy; Russell, Rodney S; Wang, Peter; Donovan, Catherine; Hookey, Sandy; Jiao, Lei",Viral immunology,128,27

Methods Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Scoping Reviews guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of primary studies that identified a theory/framework explaining the aetiology of suicidal behaviour in adulthood, following childhood exposure to external-cause parental death, including suicide. Results The search yielded 1598 articles. Following full-text screening, 23 studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Data extraction was then completed and found that the studies collectively referenced nine theories. The specific theories identified covered a range of biopsychosocial frameworks and included attachment theory, familial transmission of suicide, conservation of resources framework, diathesis-stress model, social integration theory, socio-ecological model, social learning theory, critical period hypothesis or life course approach and the developmental model of antisocial behaviour. Limitations It was beyond the scope of this review to conduct rigorous testing and evaluation of the theories identified. Future research could extend on this study by developing criteria to assess the range of theories and frameworks on suicide exposure, as well as the studies providing evidence for these theories, in order to guide more advanced theory development as well as policies, programs and interventions. Conclusions Based on these theories, the authors proposed that using an integrated biopsychosocial model will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse risk and protective factors for suicidal behaviour following parental death.","Hua, Phuong; Maple, Myfanwy; Hay, Kieran; Bugeja, Lyndal",Heliyon,128,1

METHODS AND RESULTS The strict anaerobe Clostridium perfringens was isolated by cultivating wound homogenates using the drip-flow reactor (DFR), and a three-species biofilm model was established using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cl. perfringens in the colony-drip-flow reactor model. Plate counts revealed that MRSA, Ps. aeruginosa and Cl. perfringens grew to 7·39 ± 0·45, 10·22 ± 0·22 and 7·13 ± 0·77 log CFU per membrane, respectively. The three-species model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of two antimicrobial dressings, Curity™ AMD and Acticoat™, compared to sterile gauze controls. Microbial growth on Curity™ AMD and gauze was not significantly different, for any species, whereas Acticoat™ was found to significantly reduce growth for all three species. CONCLUSIONS Using the colony-DFR, a three-species biofilm was successfully grown, and the biofilms displayed a unique structure consisting of distinct layers that appeared to be inhabited exclusively or predominantly by a single species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY The primary accomplishment of this study was the isolation and growth of an obligate anaerobe in an in vitro model without establishing an artificially anaerobic environment.","Woods, J; Boegli, L; Kirker, K R; Agostinho, A M; Durch, A M; Delancey Pulcini, E; Stewart, P S; James, G A",Journal of applied microbiology,128,25

METHODS We reviewed the databases of two comprehensive stroke centers in in Germany and Switzerland for MT due to LVO in the anterior circulation with either ERIC or another SR as a first device. Co-primary outcome was defined as successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3) after the first device and favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) at 90 days' follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS 183 consecutive patients with stroke were treated with either ERIC (49%) or a SR (51%) as the first device and successful recanalization was seen in 82% and 57%, respectively (P<0.001). Adding SR to futile ERIC recanalization or vice versa increased final recanalization rates (ERIC: 87%, SR: 79%). The use of ERIC as a first device resulted in favorable clinical outcome in 50% compared with 35% when a SR was used (P=0.038), an effect driven by age, stroke severity, presence of carotid-T-occlusion, and general anesthesia and not by the device deployed. CONCLUSION The use of ERIC as a first device appeared to be associated with higher rates of successful recanalization and resulted in better functional outcome. However, favorable outcome was not attributable to ERIC. Most importantly, both device types complemented one another and improved final recanalization rates when used successively.","Gruber, Philipp; Zeller, Salome; Garcia-Esperon, Carlos; Berberat, Jatta; Anon, Javier; Diepers, Michael; Nedeltchev, Krassen; Flottmann, Fabian; Fiehler, Jens; Remonda, Luca; Kahles, Timo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,128,19

This review aims to synthesise the available data on the delivery, coverage, and effectiveness of the nutrition programmes for conflict affected women and children living in LMICs. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases and grey literature using terms related to conflict, population, and nutrition. We searched studies on women and children receiving nutrition-specific interventions during or within five years of a conflict in LMICs. We extracted information on population, intervention, and delivery characteristics, as well as delivery barriers and facilitators. Data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS Ninety-one pubblications met our inclusion criteria. Nearly half of the publications (n=43) included population of sub-Saharan Africa (n=31) followed by Middle East and North African region. Most publications (n=58) reported on interventions targeting children under 5 years of age, and pregnant and lactating women (n=27). General food distribution (n=34), micronutrient supplementation (n=27) and nutrition assessment (n=26) were the most frequently reported interventions, with most reporting on intervention delivery to refugee populations in camp settings (n=63) and using community-based approaches. Only eight studies reported on coverage and effectiveness of intervention. Key delivery facilitators included community advocacy and social mobilisation, effective monitoring and the integration of nutrition, and other sectoral interventions and services, and barriers included insufficient resources, nutritional commodity shortages, security concerns, poor reporting, limited cooperation, and difficulty accessing and following-up of beneficiaries. DISCUSSION Despite the focus on nutrition in conflict settings, our review highlights important information gaps. Moreover, there is very little information on coverage or effectiveness of nutrition interventions; more rigorous evaluation of effectiveness and delivery approaches is needed, including outside of camps and for preventive as well as curative nutrition interventions.

All the recombinant proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and 3 subunits of spike protein, S1, S2, and Smid, showed positive reactivity in MFI with mouse antisera to 4 MHV strains (MHV-S, -A59, -JHM, and -Nu67) and rat antiserum to a strain of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV-681). The MFI was evaluated for its diagnostic power, with panels of mouse sera classified as positive or negative for anti-MHV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MHV virion antigen and indirect fluorescent antibody assay. The reactivities of 236 naturally infected mouse sera were examined; 227 samples were positive by MFI using S2 antigen (96% sensitivity), and 208 samples were positive using N antigen (88% sensitivity). Based on the assessment by MFI using the S2 and N antigens, only 3 serum samples showed double-negative results, indicating a false-negative rate of 1.3%. In 126 uninfected mouse sera, including 34 ELISA false-positive sera, only 7 samples showed false-positive results by MFI using either the S2 or N antigen (94% specificity). Similarly, the S2 and N antigen-based MFI was 98% sensitive and 100% specific in detecting anticoronavirus antibodies in rat sera. Thus, this MFI-based serologic assay using the S2 and N antigens promises to be a reliable diagnostic method, representing a highly sensitive and specific alternative to traditional ELISA for detection of coronavirus infections in laboratory mouse and rat colonies.","Kunita, Satoshi; Kato, Kanako; Ishida, Miyuki; Hagiwara, Kozue; Kameda, Shuko; Ishida, Tomoko; Takakura, Akira; Goto, Kazuo; Sugiyama, Fumihiro; Yagami, Ken-Ichi",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,128,16

The ovary is the first organ to show overt signs of aging, including increased fibrosis in the ovarian stroma. How this fibrosis affects ovarian biomechanics and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using instrumental indentation, we demonstrated a quantitative increase in ovarian stiffness, as evidenced by an increase in Young's modulus, when comparing ovaries from reproductively young (6-12 weeks) and old (14-17 months) mice. This ovarian stiffness was dependent on collagen because ex vivo enzyme-mediated collagen depletion in ovaries from reproductively old mice restored their collagen content and biomechanical properties to those of young controls. In addition to collagen, we also investigated the role of hyaluronan (HA) in regulating ovarian stiffness. HA is an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan that maintains tissue homeostasis, and its loss can change the biomechanical properties of tissues. The total HA content in the ovarian stroma decreased with age, and this was associated with increased hyaluronidase (Hyal1) and decreased hyaluronan synthase (Has3) expression. These gene expression differences were not accompanied by changes in ovarian HA molecular mass distribution. Furthermore, ovaries from mice deficient in HAS3 were stiffer compared to age-matched WT mice. Our results demonstrate that the ovary becomes stiffer with age and that both collagen and HA matrices are contributing mechanisms regulating ovarian biomechanics. Importantly, the age-associated increase in collagen and decrease in HA are conserved in the human ovary and may impact follicle development and oocyte quality.","Amargant, Farners; Manuel, Sharrón L; Tu, Qing; Parkes, Wendena S; Rivas, Felipe; Zhou, Luhan T; Rowley, Jennifer E; Villanueva, Cecilia E; Hornick, Jessica E; Shekhawat, Gajendra S; Wei, Jian-Jun; Pavone, Mary Ellen; Hall, Adam R; Pritchard, Michele T; Duncan, Francesca E",Aging cell,128,1

Within the Nox family only Nox4 produces H2O2 which can directly oxidize cysteine residues. With this post-translational modification, activity, stability, localization and protein-protein interactions of the affected protein is altered. Nox4 controls differentiation, cellular homeostasis and prevents inflammation. Therefore, is likely that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the effects of Nox4. One group of epigenetic modifiers are class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). We hypothesize that Nox4-derived H2O2 oxidizes HDACs and analyzed whether HDACs can be differentially oxidized by Nox4. As an artificial system, we utilized HEK293 cells, overexpressing Nox4 in a tetracycline-inducible manner. HDAC4 was oxidized upon Nox4 overexpression. Additionally, Nox4 overexpression increased HDAC4 phosphorylation on Ser632. H2O2 disrupted HDAC4/Mef2A complex, which de-represses Mef2A. In endothelial cells such as HUVECs and HMECs, overexpression of HDAC4 significantly reduced tube formation. Overexpression of a redox insensitive HDAC4 had no effect on endothelial tube formation. Treatment with H2O2, induction of Nox4 expression by treatment of the cells with TGFβ and co-overexpression of Nox4 not only induced phosphorylation of HDAC4, but also restored the repressive effect of HDAC4 for tube formation, while overexpression of a redox dead mutant of Nox4 did not. Taken together, Nox4 oxidizes HDAC4, increases its phosphorylation, and eventually ensures proper tube formation by endothelial cells.","Schader, Tim; Löwe, Oliver; Reschke, Christina; Malacarne, Pedro; Hahner, Fabian; Müller, Niklas; Gajos-Draus, Anna; Backs, Johannes; Schröder, Katrin",Redox biology,128,16

We evaluated whether supernatants from effusions retain the ability to induce cell clumping and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of this modified ΔTNC method. Effusions were collected from FIP cats ( n = 19) and from cats with other diseases ( n = 15). ΔTNC was measured on fresh samples and on frozen-thawed supernatants after the addition of feline blood at 1:10 dilution. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed at the cutoffs of suggestive of FIP (ΔTNC = 1.7) and consistent with FIP (ΔTNC = 3.4). The influence of the protein content, number of added cells, and magnitude of dilution were also investigated. Specificity and positive predictive value were 100% for both the methods. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were higher for the modified ΔTNC (84.2% and 83.3%, respectively, at the cutoff of 1.7; 78.9% and 78.9%, respectively, at the cutoff of 3.4) than for the ΔTNC on fresh samples (78.6% and 81.3%, respectively, at the cutoff of 1.7; 57.1% and 68.4%, respectively, at the cutoff of 3.4). Protein content, total cell count of the added blood, and magnitude of dilutions did not influence the results.

Individuals have thus been experiencing social pain through social distance regulations. Prior research has shown that social and physical pains share a common neural alarm system. Hence, COVID-19 social distancing should enhance sensitivity to physical pain. Two laboratory studies were conducted to test the spillover effect of COVID-19 social distancing on physical pain. The findings supported our hypothesis by showing that participants who were reminded of COVID-19 social distancing reported a higher level of pain perception in response to immersion in hot water (Experiment 1, N = 102) and expressed a lower pain threshold measured by a pressure algometer than did those of controls (Experiment 2, N = 140). This may be the first experimental evidence demonstrating that people primed with COVID-19 social distancing have increased sensitivity to physical pain. Our findings suggest that people might be more likely to experience physical pain under the impact of COVID-19 social distancing.

The Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) recommend the use of bailout procedures and subtotal cholecystectomy to prevent VBI. Performing a safe LC is challenging, even when followed by an accurate pre-surgical assessment. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LSC) requires advanced skills, and there is a risk of recurrence of cancer and/or gallbladder stones (GBS) in the remnant gallbladder (GB). Moreover, it is sometimes impossible to safely close the cystic duct with either a loop tie or linear staples because of anatomical and fragility problems. Here, we report a novel technique employing barbed sutures for LSC in difficult AC cases. CASE PRESENTATION We performed urgent LSC using barbed sutures for the stump of the cystic duct in two patients. In preoperative assessments, we found that these cases were qualified for operations rather than GB drainages, but the cystic ducts appeared difficult to close due to their severe inflammation and fragility during the operations. We applied barbed suture as a surrogate technique to close the stump of cystic duct. In patient 1, a 67-year-old woman with severe heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with grade III AC. Pathological diagnosis was gangrenous cholecystitis. In patient 2, a 68-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital after 15 days of treatment for AC with antibiotics without drainage. The severity of AC was grade II according to TG18. Pathological diagnosis was acute-on-chronic cholecystitis. Both patients were discharged without complication. CONCLUSIONS The utilization of barbed sutures in LSC stems as a feasible and safe surrogate technique. Furthermore, this approach could decrease the risks associated with the remnant GB.","Fujiwara, Sho; Kaino, Kenji; Iseya, Kazuki; Koyamada, Nozomi",Surgical case reports,128,23

Accurate assessment of fracture risk is a crucial step for clinicians to consider patient-by-patient optimal treatments for effective prevention of fractures. Image-based biomechanical modeling has shown promising progress in assessment of fracture risk, and there is still a great possibility for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to identify key issues that need be addressed to improve image-based biomechanical modeling. MATERIALS AND METHODS We critically examined issues in consideration and determination of the four biomechanical variables, i.e., risk of fall, fall-induced impact force, bone geometry and bone material quality, which are essential for prediction of hip fracture risk. We closely inspected: limitations introduced by assumptions that are adopted in existing models; deficiencies in methods for construction of biomechanical models, especially for determination of bone material properties from bone images; problems caused by separate use of the variables in clinical study of hip fracture risk; availability of clinical information that are required for validation of biomechanical models.

METHODS In this study, we described the process of converting our MFM clinic from a conventional medical treatment model to a telemedicine platform. We compared clinical productivity between the two models. Outcomes were analysed using standard statistical tests. RESULTS We suffered three symptomatic COVID-19 infections among our clinical providers and staff prior to the conversion, compared with none after the conversion. We had a significant decrease in patient visits following the conversion (53.35 visits per day versus 40.3 visits per day, p < 0.0001). However, our average daily patient visits per full-time equivalent (FTE) were only marginally reduced (11.1 visit per FTE versus 7.6 visits per FTE, p < 0.0001), resulting in a relative decrease in adjusted work relative value units (6987 versus 5440). There was an increase in more basic follow-up ultrasound procedures, complexity (current procedural technology [CPT] code 76816 (10.7% versus 19.5%, relative risk [RR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.60-2.05, p < 0.0001)) over comprehensive follow-up ultrasound procedures, CPT code 76805 (17.2% versus 7.8%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, p < 0.0001) after conversion. Despite similar proportions of new consults, there was an increase in the proportion of follow-up visits and medical decision-making complexity evaluation and management CPT codes (e.g. 99214/99215) after the conversion (17.2% versus 24.6%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-163, p < 0.0001). There were no differences between amniocentesis procedures performed between the two time periods (0.3% versus 0.2%, p = 0.5805). CONCLUSION The rapid conversion of an MFM platform from convention medical treatment to telemedicine platform in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic resulted in protection of healthcare personnel and MFM patients, with only a modest decrease in clinical productivity during the initial roll-out. Due to the ongoing threat from the novel coronavirus-19, an MFM telemedicine platform is a practicable and innovative solution and merits the continued support of CMS and health care administrators.","Shields, Andrea D; Wagner, Richard K; Knutzen, Dana; Deering, Shad; Nielsen, Peter E",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,128,7

Laboratory parameters to monitor disease progression include lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and ferritin. The development of a cytokine storm and extensive chest computed tomography imaging patterns are indicators of a severe disease. In addition, socioeconomic status, diet, lifestyle, geographical differences, ethnicity, exposed viral load, day of initiation of treatment, and quality of health care have been reported to influence individual outcomes. In this review, we highlight the scientific evidence on the risk factors of severity of COVID-19.","Gao, Ya-Dong; Ding, Mei; Dong, Xiang; Zhang, Jin-Jin; Azkur, Ahmet Kursat; Azkur, Dilek; Gan, Hui; Sun, Yuan-Li; Fu, Wei; Li, Wei; Liang, Hui-Ling; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Yan, Qi; Cao, Can; Gao, Hong-Yu; Brüggen, Marie-Charlotte; van de Veen, Willem; Sokolowska, Milena; Akdis, Mübeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A",Allergy,128,14

Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications. Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. Patients and Methods: We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. Results: Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. Among them, five (62%) required mechanical ventilation and two (25%) died. All had abnormal chest CT with typical findings of COVID-19 in 87%. Computed tomography provided an alternate diagnosis in 53% of patients who did not have COVID-19. The average time between a COVID-19-positive chest CT and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation was 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days). Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19. In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.","Moliere, Sebastien; Veillon, Francis",Surgical infections,128,31

Although numerous studies have reported that neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive impairments are involved in neuroinflammation, relationship between psychological disturbance and neuroinflammation with aging (neuroinflammaging) remains unclear. Here, to clarify the relationship, we examined whether neuroinflammaging affects emotional behaviors in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Microglial inflammatory responses to a subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were significantly enhanced in male SAMP8 mice relative to normal aging senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice at 17 weeks, but not 8 weeks of age. LPS injection also significantly increased brain and systemic inflammation in SAMP8 mice at 17 weeks. In a battery of behavioral tests, SAMP8 mice at 17 weeks, but not 8 weeks, exhibited anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and circadian rhythm disruption. Taken together, SAMP8 mice at 17 weeks possess a brain microenvironment in which it is easier to trigger neuroinflammatory priming; this may lead to an emergence of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and circadian rhythm disruption. These findings provide new insights into the temporal relationship between neuroinflammaging and emotion.","Ito, Naoki; Takemoto, Hiroaki; Hasegawa, Ayana; Sugiyama, Chika; Honma, Kengo; Nagai, Takayuki; Kobayashi, Yoshinori; Odaguchi, Hiroshi",Experimental gerontology,128,16

The hanging maneuver during laparoscopic liver resection is not routinely utilized. MATERIALS AND METHODS We describe the technique and results of a modified hanging maneuver using the Goldfinger dissector in 13 right and 5 left hepatectomies. This technique allowed us to dissect the space between right and middle hepatic veins; to create the infero-superior arcade through the space between the anterior surface of the vena cava and the posterior surface of the liver; to lift the cutting area of the liver from the posterior to the anterior direction; to indicate the parenchymal transection line. RESULTS The median resection time and blood loss were 96 min and 220 ml respectively. No conversion was recorded. Two complications (11%) occurred: a biliary fistula and a respiratory distress syndrome, spontaneously resolved.

Despite evidence that monetary incentives can motivate healthy behavior, well-powered studies have yet to examine incentives for improving children's oral hygiene. AIM Describe the rationale and design of the BEhavioral EConomics for Oral health iNnovation (BEECON) trial, which tests lottery-based monetary incentives as a consumer-oriented, value-based care model for improving children's oral hygiene. DESIGN Phase II, stratified, permuted block randomized, controlled, two-arm, parallel groups, prevention trial. SETTING Study visits occur at three Los Angeles, CA health clinics. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and forty-four parent-child dyads with a child aged 6-48 months. INTERVENTIONS Eligible dyads were randomized in equal allocation to one of two groups: lottery incentive group or waitlist (delayed incentive) control group. Weekly lottery incentives were offered for 6 months based on Bluetooth-recorded toothbrushing frequency. Both groups received weekly text message feedback on toothbrushing performance. OUTCOMES The primary outcome was toothbrushing performance from baseline to 6 months, measured as the mean number of qualifying half-day Bluetooth-recorded episodes per week when the child's teeth were brushed. Secondary outcomes included toothbrushing performance sustainability through 12 months and dental caries status. CONCLUSIONS BEECON offers a consumer-oriented approach to promoting value-based oral health care. We hypothesize that lottery-based incentives can improve oral hygiene in young children.

In this work we evaluated the concentration of VitD in COVID-19 patients experiencing acute respiratory infections of different levels of severity excluding those who underwent invasive respiratory support. METHODS The levels of serum VitD and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed in 118 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients (74M, 44F), confirmed with rRT-PCR. Of these patients with ventilation support 52 (44.1%) received oxygen via nasal cannula, oxygen mask or an oxygen mask with a reservoir, 48 (40.7%) were on a continuous positive airway pressure device (CPAP) and 18 (15,3%) on non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). RESULTS The median values (range) of VitD and of CRP were 15.1 ng/mL (1.3-73.3) and 14.2 mg/L (5.0-151.2), respectively. A negative correlation from VitD levels and those of CRP (correlation coefficient - 0.259: P=0.005) was observed. VitD levels in O2 support patients were significantly higher than in both CPAP and NIMV patients. No statistical differences were found for CRP levels (P=0.834) among the three type of oxygen support. Fewer patients with O2 support had VitD <30 ng/mL and <20 ng/mL than CPAP and NIMV patients. There were no relationships between VitD and the three classes of IgM (P=0.419) and of IgG (P=0.862) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies values. The behavior was the same for CRP. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients have a VitD deficiency and that this condition is more frequent in CPAP and in NIMV patients.","Barassi, Alessandra; Pezzilli, Raffaele; Mondoni, Michele; Rinaldo, Rocco F; DavÌ, Matteo; Cozzolino, Mario; Melzi D'Eril, Gian Vico; Centanni, Stefano",Panminerva medica,128,1

Standard management includes oxygen supplementation, physiotherapy, cough assistance, and, whenever needed, antibiotics and intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) via nasal, buccal or full-face devices has become routine practice in many centres. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this review was to compare the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation with invasive ventilation in improving short-term survival in acute respiratory failure in people with neuromuscular disease and chest wall disorders. The secondary objectives were to compare the effects of NIV with those of invasive mechanical ventilation on improvement in arterial blood gas after 24 hours and lung function measurements after one month, incidence of barotrauma and ventilator-associated pneumonia, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and length of hospital stay. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases on 11 September 2017: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings and clinical trials registries. SELECTION CRITERIA We planned to include randomised or quasi-randomised trials with or without blinding. We planned to include trials performed in children or adults with acute onset neuromuscular diseases or chronic neuromuscular disease or chest wall disorders presenting with acute respiratory failure that compared the benefits and risks of invasive ventilation versus NIV. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors reviewed searches and independently selected studies for assessment. We planned to follow standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis. MAIN RESULTS We did not identify any trials eligible for inclusion in the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening complication of acute onset neuromuscular disease and of chronic neuromuscular disease and chest wall disorders. We found no randomised trials on which to elaborate evidence-based practice for the use of non-invasive versus invasive mechanical ventilation. For researchers, there is a need to design and conduct new randomised trials to compare NIV with invasive ventilation in acute neuromuscular respiratory failure. These trials should anticipate variations in treatment responses according to disease condition (acute onset versus acute exacerbation on chronic neuromuscular diseases) and according to the presence or absence of bulbar dysfunction.","Luo, Fang; Annane, Djillali; Orlikowski, David; He, Li; Yang, Mi; Zhou, Muke; Liu, Guan J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,128,7

Conventional mesh fixation may cause chronic neuralgia, groin paresthesia or other complications. This study aimed at introducing a new vacuum suction technique for mesh fixation and evaluating its efficacy and safety compared with traditional staple fixation way. METHODS Clinical data of 242 patients undergoing TAPP from July 2011 to March 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into vacuum suction fixation group and staple fixation group. The operation time, hospital stay, complications, recurrence, visual analogue scale pain score and cost were evaluated. RESULTS All surgeries were successful. The operation time of staple group was (42.34 ± 10.15) min for unilateral hernia and (64.08 ± 16.01) min for bilateral hernias. The postoperative hospital stay was (2.76 ± 0.84) days. One recurrence was observed (0.90%). For vacuum group, the operation time was (42.66 ± 7.76) min and (63.92 ± 10.49) min, and hospital stay was (2.60 ± 0.74) days. No recurrence was observed. There was no significant difference in recurrence, operation time, postoperative pain and hospital stay between two groups (P > 0.05). Average cost were (11,714 ± 726) RMB for vacuum group which was lower than staple group (14,837 ± 1568) RMB (P < 0.05). The top three complications of staple group were scrotal emphysema (10.81%), scrotal seroma (6.31%) and temporary nerve paresthesia (4.50%) while for vacuum group, they were scrotal seroma (3.82%), temporary nerve paresthesia (3.05%), scrotal emphysema (1.53%) and uroschesis (1.53%). The incidence of scrotal emphysema was lower in vacuum group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in other complications (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Both techniques for mesh fixation are safe and effective. There is no significant difference in recurrence, operation time, postoperative pain or hospital stay. The vacuum suction fixation technique is more economical with lower incidence of scrotal emphysema.","Zhang, Guangyong; Zhang, Xiang; Zhan, Hanxiang; Hu, Sanyuan",Surgical endoscopy,128,26

Our aim was to review the uses and limitations of such noninvasive monitoring methods. Colorimetry is primarily utilized during resuscitation to determine whether successful intubation has occurred. False negative and positive results can however lead to delays in detecting tracheal versus esophageal intubation. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide sensors have limited use during resuscitation, but can be utilized to provide continuous trend data during on-going ventilation. End-tidal capnography can provide clinicians with quantitative end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2 ) values and a continuous real-time capnogram waveform trace. These devices are becoming more widely accepted for use in the neonatal population as the new devices are lightweight with minimal additional dead space. Nevertheless, they have been reported to have variable accuracy when compared to arterial CO2 measurements, however, divergence of results may be related to disease severity rather than technological limitations. During resuscitation EtCO2 can be detected by capnography more rapidly than by colorimetry. Furthermore, capnography can be currently utilized in neonatal research settings to determine the physiological dead space and ventilation inhomogeneity, and thus has potential to be beneficial to clinical care. In conclusion, novel modes of noninvasive carbon dioxide monitoring can be safely and reliably utilized in newborn infants during mechanical ventilation. Future randomized trials should aim to address which device provides the most optimal form of monitoring in different clinical contexts.","Williams, Emma; Dassios, Theodore; Greenough, Anne",Pediatric pulmonology,128,31

The aim of this study was to determine whether a positive serology for mimivirus was associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). DESIGN Prospective matched-cohort study. SETTING A 12-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS Patients ventilated for at least 2 days presenting with a suspicion of VAP. Patients with a positive serology for mimivirus were matched to seronegative patients. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Matching criteria were: 1) the same main diagnosis on ICU admission, 2) the same age (+/- 10 yrs), 3) the same Simplified Acute Physiology II score (+/-10 points), 4) the same McCabe and Jackson comorbidity score, 5) admission within 1 year, and 6) diagnosis of at least one bacterial VAP during the ICU stay or not. A total of 55 pairs were submitted for analysis. The effectiveness of matching was 94.8%.

The vesicourethral anastomosis is a critical step, which most likely impacts urinary continence and urethral stenosis. To date, it still remains unclear whether interrupted and continuous suturing for the anastomosis have different outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare different suture techniques for vesicourethral anastomosis in terms of surgical and functional parameters. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A comprehensive literature search will be conducted covering MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing interrupted versus continuous suturing will be included in the analyses. No language restrictions will be applied. Screening, data extraction, statistical analysis and reporting will be done in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Quality assessment will be performed with the help of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing quality of non-randomised studies. The quality of evidence will be evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. The primary outcome will be the time until removal of the urinary catheter. Secondary outcomes include rate of extravasation, length of hospital stay, time needed to perform the anastomosis, continence level at defined postoperative intervals and development of urethral strictures. Quantitative analysis will be calculated if meaningful. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION In order to meet the highest ethical and methodological standards. we followed the PRISMA Protocol 2015 checklist.

Many PDZ proteins that have been identified as targets of viral pathogens by promoting viral replication and spread are also involved in epithelial cell polarity. Here, we briefly review the PDZ polarity proteins in cells of the immune system to subsequently focus on our hypothesis that the viral PDZ-dependent targeting of PDZ polarity proteins in these cells may alter the cellular fitness of the host to favor that of the virus; we further hypothesize that this modification of the cellular fitness landscape occurs as a common and widespread mechanism for immune evasion by viruses and possibly other pathogens.-Gutiérrez-González, L.

Advanced analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to find brain abnormalities and their relationship to neurocognitive impairments in children and adolescents with DS. Because genetic factors affect brain development in early fetal life, there is a growing interest in analyzing brains from living fetuses with DS. In this study, we investigated regional sulcal folding depth as well as global cortical gyrification from fetal brain MRIs. Nine fetuses with DS (29.1 ± 4.24 gestational weeks [mean ± standard deviation]) were compared with 17 typically developing [TD] fetuses (28.4 ± 3.44). Fetuses with DS showed lower whole-brain average sulcal depths and gyrification index than TD fetuses. Significant decreases in sulcal depth were found in bilateral Sylvian fissures and right central and parieto-occipital sulci. On the other hand, significantly increased sulcal depth was shown in the left superior temporal sulcus, which is related to atypical hemispheric asymmetry of cortical folding. Moreover, these group differences increased as gestation progressed. This study demonstrates that regional sulcal depth is a sensitive marker for detecting alterations of cortical development in DS during fetal life, which may be associated with later neurocognitive impairment.","Yun, Hyuk Jin; Perez, Juan David Ruiz; Sosa, Patricia; Valdés, J Alejandro; Madan, Neel; Kitano, Rie; Akiyama, Shizuko; Skotko, Brian G; Feldman, Henry A; Bianchi, Diana W; Grant, P Ellen; Tarui, Tomo; Im, Kiho",Cerebral cortex,128,16

In this study, we aimed to explore a more effective treatment method by combining human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for ALIRI. Fifty rats were firstly divided into five groups, namely sham surgery group (sham) and four model groups (model, ACE2, HUMSCs and HUMSCs + ACE2) that were reperfused with 0.1 ml physiological saline (PS), 0.1 ml PS containing 1 × 10(6) lentiviral-ACE2/HUMSCs/ACE2 + UMSCs, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays were then conducted to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines [intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and angiotensin II (Ang II)], antioxidant proteins [NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)], DNA damage and apoptotic indicators [BCL2-associated X (Bax), cleaved caspase-3 (C-Csp 3), cleaved-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (C-PARP), Y-H2AX], anti-apoptotic indicator (Bcl-2) and smooth muscle cell proliferation indicator [connexin 43 (Cx43)]. According to the qRT-PCR and western results, the mRNA and protein expression levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, TNF-α, NF-κB, PDGF, Bax, C-Csp 3, C-PARP and Y-H2AX were significantly higher in model group than those in sham group and they were significantly reduced by HUMSCs or ACE2 treatment (P < 0.05). On the contrary, Bcl-2 showed an opposite expression trend with the previous proteins. The mRNA and protein levels of NQO1 and HO-1 were sequentially increased in sham, model, ACE2, HUMSCs and HUMSCs + ACE2 groups. Besides, HUMSCs combined with ACE2 exhibited a better inhibition effect on ALIRI than HUMSCs or ACE2 alone (P < 0.05). In summary, HUMSCs combined with ACE2 was demonstrated to have the best therapeutic effect on ALIRI through anti-inflammation, oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic processes.","Zhang, Xiaomiao; Gao, Fengying; Yan, Yunqi; Ruan, Zheng; Liu, Zhenwei",Cell biochemistry and function,128,11

This is particularly true of the humoral response generated against influenza A viruses. Although it is known that immunological memory developed against previously encountered influenza A virus strains affects the outcome of subsequent infections, exactly how sequential exposures to antigenically variant viruses shape the humoral immune response in humans remains poorly understood. To address this important question, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers against various pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza virus spanning a 20-year period (1987 to 2008) with samples from 40 individuals (birth dates, 1917 to 1952) obtained from the Framingham Heart Study. Longitudinal increases in neutralizing antibody titers were observed against previously encountered pandemic H2N2, H3N2, and H1N1 influenza A virus strains. Antibody titers against seasonal strains encountered later in life also increased longitudinally at a rate similar to that against their pandemic predecessors. Titers of cross-reactive antibodies specific to the hemagglutinin stalk domain were also investigated because they are influenced by exposure to antigenically diverse influenza A viruses. These titers rose modestly over time, even in the absence of major antigenic shifts. No sustained increase in neutralizing antibody titers against an antigenically more stable virus (human cytomegalovirus) was observed. The results herein describe a role for antigenic variation in shaping the humoral immune compartment and provide a rational basis for the hierarchical nature of antibody titers against influenza A viruses in humans.","Miller, Matthew S; Gardner, Thomas J; Krammer, Florian; Aguado, Lauren C; Tortorella, Domenico; Basler, Christopher F; Palese, Peter",Science translational medicine,128,16

Methods Whole exome sequencing was performed in 99 cases of aortic dissection. All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (InDels), and copy number variations (CNVs) were filtered to exclude the benign variants. Enrichment analysis and disease-gene correlation analysis were performed. Results 3425873 SNPs, 685245 InDels, and 1177 CNVs were identified, and aortic dissection-associated SNPs, InDels, and CNVs were collected. After the disease correlation analysis, 20 candidate genes were identified. Part of these genes such as MYH11, FBN1, and ACTA2 were consistent with previous studies, while MLX, DAB2IP, EP300, ZFYVE9, PML, and PRKCD were newly identified as candidate aortic dissection-associated genes. Conclusion The pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in most of AD-associated genes (FBN1, MYH11, EFEMP2, TGFBR2, FBN2, COL3A1, and MYLK) were identified in our cohort study, and pathogenic CNVs involved in MYH11, COL family, and FBN were also identified which are not detectable by other NGS analysis. The correlation between MLX, DAB2IP, EP300, ZFYVE9, PML, PRKCD, and aortic dissection was identified, and EP300 may play a key role in AD.","Wang, Zanxin; Zhuang, Xianmian; Chen, Bailang; Wen, Junmin; Peng, Fang; Liu, Xiling; Wei, Minxin",BioMed research international,128,27

In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use during this sensitive developmental stage. METHODS In this longitudinal, population-based study, surveys were administered to a nationwide sample of 13-18-year-olds in Iceland in October or February in 2016 and 2018, and in October, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The surveys assessed depressive symptoms with the Symptom Checklist-90, mental wellbeing with the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, and the frequency of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication. Demographic data were collected, which included language spoken at home although not ethnicity data. We used mixed effects models to study the effect of gender, age, and survey year on trends in mental health outcomes. FINDINGS 59 701 survey responses were included; response rates ranged from 63% to 86%. An increase in depressive symptoms (β 0·57, 95% CI 0·53 to 0·60) and worsened mental wellbeing (β -0·46, 95% CI -0·49 to -0·42) were observed across all age groups during the pandemic compared with same-aged peers before COVID-19. These outcomes were significantly worse in adolescent girls compared with boys (β 4·16, 95% CI 4·05 to 4·28, and β -1·13, 95% CI -1·23 to -1·03, respectively). Cigarette smoking (OR 2·61, 95% CI 2·59 to 2·66), e-cigarette use (OR 2·61, 95% CI 2·59 to 2·64), and alcohol intoxication (OR 2·59, 95% CI 2·56 to 2·64) declined among 15-18-year-olds during COVID-19, with no similar gender differences. INTERPRETATION Our results suggest that COVID-19 has significantly impaired adolescent mental health. However, the decrease observed in substance use during the pandemic might be an unintended benefit of isolation, and might serve as a protective factor against future substance use disorders and dependence. Population-level prevention efforts, especially for girls, are warranted. FUNDING Icelandic Research Fund.

Objective: To investigate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes. Design: All suspected cases of pregnant women with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted into one center of Wuhan from Jan 20, 2020 to March 19, 2020 were included. Detailed clinical data of those pregnancies with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: Twenty-seven laboratory or clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection pregnant women (4 early pregnancies included) and 24 neonates born to the 23 late pregnant mothers were analyzed. On admission, 46.2% (13/27) of the patients had symptoms, including fever (11/27), cough (9/27) and vomiting (1/27). Decreased total lymphocytes count was observed in 81.6% (22/27) patients. Twenty-six patients showed typical viral pneumonia by chest computed tomography (CT) scan, while one patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection showed no abnormality on chest CT. One mother developed severe pneumonia three days after her delivery. No maternal and perinatal death occurred. Moreover, one early preterm newborn, born to a mother with complication of premature rupture of fetal membranes, highly suspected with SARS-CoV-2 infection, was SARS-CoV-2 negative after repeated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. Statistical difference was observed between the groups of early pregnant and late pregnant women with COVID-19 in the occurrence of lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: No major complication were reported among the studied cohort, though one serious case and one perinatal infection were observed.

CLINICAL FINDINGS An apparently nonpainful firm cutaneous mass (approx 2 × 2 mm) was located on the lateral third of the left upper eyelid near the scar from the previous surgical excision. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Approximately one-third of the left upper lip was used as a subdermal plexus (lip-to-lid) flap to cover the defect created by en bloc excision of the eyelid mass. A bridge incision between the donor and recipient sites was used so that the eyelid could be reconstructed in 1 procedure. Histologic evaluation confirmed that the mass had been completely excised. Both the donor and recipient flap sites healed well without complications. The procedure resulted in excellent functional and cosmetic results with no recurrence of the mass at 14 months after surgery.

We investigated changes in perceived diet quality and cooking practices during the lockdown in comparison with the preceding period. Between June 9 and 30, 2020, 2422 participants were recruited and completed a questionnaire regarding the evolution of their overall diet and cooking habits during the lockdown. Descriptive analyses showed that 41.5% of participants described dietary changes with a similar proportion reporting positive or negative changes (22.0% and 19.5%, respectively). The exceptional circumstances of the lockdown provided a positive opportunity for some people to improve their diet quality by spending more time cooking (54.8% of those reporting a positive change) or eating more fresh products, including fruits and vegetables (47.4%). By contrast, other participants reported a decline in their diet quality, mainly caused by poorer dietary choices due to the consumption of comfort food (50.3% of those reporting a negative change), snacking (40.1%), or food supply issues (35.9%). The lockdown led to a massive rise in home cooking with 42.0% of all participants cooking more frequently (vs 7.0% cooking less), as barriers such as time constraints were reduced. Using multivariate analyses, we found that this change in cooking frequency varied among population subgroups, especially in regard to financial situation, as individuals in financial difficulty tended to cook less. As home cooking has already been linked to better diet quality and thus health status, our results suggest that the lockdown increased social health inequalities. An adequate public health response is therefore needed to support nutritionally vulnerable populations.","Sarda, Barthélemy; Delamaire, Corinne; Serry, Anne-Juliette; Ducrot, Pauline",Appetite,128,31

Blood smears for malaria were negative. Brain MRI showed multiple hypersignal cerebral lesions. Investigations didn't show any infectious, metabolic, toxic, vascular or tumoral etiology. Thus, the diagnosis of PMNS was considered. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone with favorable outcome. Two years later, he was completely asymptomatic. Conclusion PMNS should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms occurring within two months of cured acute disease in which blood smears for malaria are negative and other etiologies have been ruled out. In most cases, the disease is self-limited while in severe cases corticosteroid therapy should be prescribed with favorable outcome.","Bellazreg, Foued; Slama, Dorsaf; Lasfar, Nadia Ben; Abid, Maha; Zaghouani, Houneida; Rouis, Sana; Hachfi, Wissem; Letaief, Amel",African health sciences,128,1

METHODS A single center retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate morbidity and long-term survival in patients who had undergone selective versus routine lymphadenectomy during surgery for colorectal liver metastasis. From January 2006 to December 2009, eighty-one patients undergoing radical resection due to liver metastasis from colorectal cancer were included. The combination of two surgical teams with different approaches to hepatoduodenal ligament lymphadenectomy at our institution allowed us to select two cohorts of patients undergoing selective or routine lymphadenectomy. RESULTS No significant differences between the cohorts were found in age, American Society of Anesthesiology score or Fong's prognostic criteria. Patients with pN+ disease had significantly inferior survival compared to patients with pN0 disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.33, 95% CI 2.16-18.57, p = 0.0001). No significant difference in postoperative morbidity was observed in the group undergoing routine opposed to selective lymphadenectomy (13.63% vs. 8.69%, p = 0.36). There was no difference in long-term survival between the groups (HR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.52-1.58, p = 0.70). There were also no significant differences in the subgroup of patients with pN0 stage (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.6-2.11, p = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that there is no survival benefit from the use of routine lymphadenectomy during surgery for colorectal liver metastasis, but these data should be confirmed in a prospective randomized study.","Pindak, Daniel; Pavlendova, Jana; Tomas, Miroslav; Dolnik, Jozef; Duchon, Robert; Pechan, Juraj",BMC surgery,128,1

The concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice have recently been shown to be more complex than previously thought. Several randomised clinical trials of facemasks have been conducted in community and healthcare settings, using widely varying interventions, including mixed interventions (such as masks and handwashing), and diverse outcomes. Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance. Two trials in healthcare workers favoured respirators for clinical respiratory illness. The use of reusable cloth masks is widespread globally, particularly in Asia, which is an important region for emerging infections, but there is no clinical research to inform their use and most policies offer no guidance on them. Health economic analyses of facemasks are scarce and the few published cost effectiveness models do not use clinical efficacy data. The lack of research on facemasks and respirators is reflected in varied and sometimes conflicting policies and guidelines. Further research should focus on examining the efficacy of facemasks against specific infectious threats such as influenza and tuberculosis, assessing the efficacy of cloth masks, investigating common practices such as reuse of masks, assessing compliance, filling in policy gaps, and obtaining cost effectiveness data using clinical efficacy estimates.","MacIntyre, C Raina; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad",BMJ,128,16

It is uncertain if the sexes differ for neuromuscular responses to ECC exercise and the ensuing RBE. Twenty-six young adults (13 females) performed two bouts (four weeks apart) of 200 ECC maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the dorsiflexors. Isometric (ISO) MVC torque and the ratio of ISO torque in response to low- vs. high-frequency stimulation (10:100Hz) were compared before and after (2-10min and 2, 4, and 7d) exercise. The decline in ECC and ISO MVC torque, and the 10:100Hz ratio following bout one did not differ between sexes (P > 0.05), with reductions from baseline of 31.5 ± 12.3, 24.1 ± 15.4, and 51.3 ± 12.2%, respectively. After bout two, the 10:100Hz ratio declined less (45.0 ± 12.4% from baseline) and ISO MVC torque recovered sooner compared to bout one but no differences between sexes were evident for the magnitude of the RBE (P > 0.05). These data suggest that fatigability with ECC exercise does not differ for the sexes and adaptations that mitigate impairments to calcium handling are independent of sex. NOVELTY BULLETS: • One bout of 200 maximal eccentric dorsiflexor contractions caused equivalent muscle fatigue and damage for females and males • The repeated bout effect observed after a second bout four weeks later also had no sex-related differences • Prolonged low-frequency force depression is promoted as an indirect measure of muscle damage in humans.","Bruce, Christina D; Ruggiero, Luca; Dix, Gabriel U; Cotton, Paul D; McNeil, Chris J","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",128,31

We determined the predictors of successful reperfusion and good clinical outcome at 90 days after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with AIS with tandem lesions in a pooled collaborative study. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients presenting to 18 comprehensive stroke centers with AIS due to tandem lesion of the anterior circulation who underwent MT. RESULTS A total of 395 patients were included. Successful reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b-3) was achieved in 76.7%. At 90 days, 52.2% achieved a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2), 13.8% suffered a parenchymal hematoma and 13.2% were dead. Lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score [odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.07-1.48, P = 0.004], Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ≥7 (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.07-3.43, P = 0.011), intravenous thrombolysis (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01-2.12, P = 0.042) and stenting of the extracranial carotid lesion (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.04-2;53, P = 0.030) were independently associated with successful reperfusion. Lower age (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.26-1.97, P < 0.001), absence of hypercholesterolemia (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.10-2.84, P = 0.018), lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.53-2.72, P < 0.001), Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ≥7 (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.24-6.10, P = 0.013) and proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.03-2.44, P = 0.035) independently predicted a good 90-day outcome.

SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney. The goal of the present study was to determine whether developmental delays, possibly mediated by systemic or local hypothyroidism, contribute to the failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc26a4 (Slc26a4(-/-)). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurements, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination of plasma thyroxine levels. Cochlear development was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. No differences in plasma thyroxine levels were found in Slc26a4(-/-) and sex-matched Slc26a4(+/-) littermates between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P90. In adult Slc26a4(-/-) mice, the transepithelial potential and the pH of thyroid follicles were reduced. No differences in the expression of genes that participate in thyroid hormone synthesis or ion transport were observed at P15, when plasma thyroxine levels peaked. Scala media of the cochlea was 10-fold enlarged, bulging into and thereby displacing fibrocytes, which express Dio2 to generate a cochlear thyroid hormone peak at P7. Cochlear development, including tunnel opening, arrival of efferent innervation at outer hair cells, endochondral and intramembraneous ossification, and developmental changes in the expression of Dio2, Dio3, and Tectb were delayed by 1-4 days. These data suggest that pendrin functions as a HCO3- transporter in the thyroid, that Slc26a4(-/-) mice are systemically euthyroid, and that delays in cochlear development, possibly due to local hypothyroidism, lead to the failure to develop hearing.","Wangemann, Philine; Kim, Hyoung-Mi; Billings, Sara; Nakaya, Kazuhiro; Li, Xiangming; Singh, Ruchira; Sharlin, David S; Forrest, Douglas; Marcus, Daniel C; Fong, Peying",American journal of physiology.

AIMS The study was conducted as a meta-analysis and a systematic review, with the aim of addressing the following question: Which intravascular access method shouldbe used when wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE)to patients with COVID-19? METHODS We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing intravascular access methods performed by operators wearing full level C PPE. We evaluated the procedure time and success rate of intraosseous and peripheral intravenous access. RESULTS Eight RCTs were included in quantitative synthesis. The use of PPE during intravascular access procedures has an influence on the procedure time of intraosseous access (MD=11.69; 95%CI: 6.47, 16.92; P<0.001), as well as reduced the success rate by 0.8% in intraosseous access and by 10.1% in intravenous access. Under PPE conditions, intraosseous access, compared with peripheral intravenous access, offered a shorter procedure time (MD = -41.43; 95% CI: -62.36, -24.47; P< 0.001). CONCLUSION This comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that the use of PPE significantly extends the duration of intravascular procedures. However, under PPE conditions, operators were able to obtain intraosseousaccess in a significantly shorter time and with a higher success rate.","Drozd, Anna; Smereka, Jacek; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Jaguszewski, Miłosz; Ładny, Jerzy R; Bielski, Karol; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Ruetzler, Kurt; Szarpak, Łukasz",Kardiologia polska,128,19

Chest radiographic scores and comorbidities were also examined as indicators of a fatal outcome to determine their potential prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest radiographs of 33 patients and 22 HCWs infected with MERS-CoV were examined for radiologic features indicative of disease and for evidence of radiographic deterioration and progression. Chest radiographic scores were estimated after dividing each lung into three zones. The scores (1 [mild] to 4 [severe]) for all six zones per chest radiographic examination were summed to provide a cumulative chest radiographic score (range, 0-24). Serial radiographs were also examined to assess for radiographic deterioration and progression from type 1 (mild) to type 4 (severe) disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare data of deceased patients with those of individuals who recovered to identify prognostic radiographic features. RESULTS Ground-glass opacity was the most common abnormality (66%) followed by consolidation (18%). Overall mortality was 35% (19/55). Mortality was higher in the patient group (55%, 18/33) than in the HCW group (5%, 1/22). The mean chest radiographic score for deceased patients was significantly higher than that for those who recovered (13 ± 2.6 [SD] vs 5.8 ± 5.6, respectively; p = 0.001); in addition, higher rates of pneumothorax (deceased patients vs patients who recovered, 47% vs 0%; p = 0.001), pleural effusion (63% vs 14%; p = 0.001), and type 4 radiographic progression (63% vs 6%; p = 0.001) were seen in the deceased patients compared with those who recovered. Univariate and logistic regression analyses identified the chest radiographic score as an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.77; p = 0.01). The number of comorbidities in the patient group (n = 33) was significantly higher than that in the HCW group (n = 22) (mean number of comorbidities, 1.90 ± 1.27 vs 0.17 ± 0.65, respectively; p = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a median survival time of 15 days (95% CI, 4-26 days). CONCLUSION Ground-glass opacity in a peripheral location was the most common abnormality noted on chest radiographs. A higher chest radiographic score coupled with a high number of medical comorbidities was associated with a poor prognosis and higher mortality in those infected with MERS-CoV. Younger HCWs with few or no comorbidities had a higher survival rate.","Das, Karuna M; Lee, Edward Y; Al Jawder, Suhayla E; Enani, Mushira A; Singh, Rajvir; Skakni, Leila; Al-Nakshabandi, Nizar; AlDossari, Khalid; Larsson, Sven G",AJR.

It has been proposed as a proxy for pulse pressure variation used in the determination of the response to intravascular volume expansion in hypovolemic patients. Many studies have now reported on the parameter, and many research groups have constructed algorithms for its computation from the first principles where the implementation details have been described. This review focuses on the signal processing aspects of ΔPOP, as reported in the literature, and aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the wide-ranging algorithmic strategies that have been attempted in its computation. A search was conducted for articles concerning the use of ΔPOP as a fluid responsiveness parameter. In particular, articles concerning the correlation between ΔPOP and pulse pressure variation were targeted. Comments and replies to comments by the authors in which signal processing aspects were discussed were also included in the review. The parameter is first defined, and a history of the early work surrounding pleth-based fluid responsiveness parameters is presented. This is followed by an overview of the signal processing methods used in the reported studies, including details of exclusion criteria, manual filtering (preprocessing), gain change issues, acquisition details, selection of registration periods, averaging methods, physiological influences on the pleth, and comments by the investigators themselves. It is concluded that to develop a robust, fully automated ΔPOP algorithm for use in the clinical environment, more rigorous signal processing is required. Specifically, signals should be evaluated over significant periods of time, with emphasis on the quality and temporal relevance of the information.","Addison, Paul S",Anesthesia and analgesia,128,19

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed from 2008 to 2010 in 620 children <6 years of age with acute respiratory infection. Respiratory samples were studied for classical respiratory viruses by immunofluorescence and for human rhinoviruses (HRV) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical and demographic data were recorded. RESULTS Viral detection by immunofluorescence was 48% in 434 inpatients and 37% in 186 outpatients. Viral diagnosis increased to 83% and 62%, respectively, when testing for HRV. HRV (41%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (27%) were most common viruses identified, followed by metapneumovirus (9%), influenza A and parainfluenza (3%), adenovirus and influenza B (2%). HRV frequency was significantly higher in hospitalized patients (47%) than in outpatients (27%) (P < 0.001). Coinfection was detected in 12% of hospitalized and 4% of outpatients (P < 0.031). HRV and adenovirus circulated throughout the entire year. RSV, influenza A and B predominated in winter, whereas metapneumovirus and parainfluenza predominated in spring. Of 362 patients with bronchiolitis, 84% had a virus identified; HRV (42%) and RSV (38%) were predominant. Of 77 patients with pneumonia, 84% had a virus detected with HRV (43%) and RSV (29%) predominating. CONCLUSIONS HRV were significant pathogens associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially in hospitalized patients. Both, HRV and coinfections, were risk factors for hospitalization. These findings support the importance of including HRV detection in children with acute respiratory infection.","Marcone, Débora Natalia; Ellis, Alejandro; Videla, Cristina; Ekstrom, Jorge; Ricarte, Carmen; Carballal, Guadalupe; Vidaurreta, Santiago Manuel; Echavarría, Marcela",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,128,16

In deuterostomes, the surface ectoderm and the anterior part of the archenteron are reconfigured and reconnected to make a mouth opening. This study of the larval development of the larvacean, Oikopleura dioica, investigates the cellular organization of the oral region, the developmental processes of the mouth, and the formation of associated sensory cells. O. dioica is a simple chordate whose larvae are transparent and have a small number of constituent cells. It completes organ morphogenesis in 7 h, between hatching 3 h after fertilization and the juvenile stage at 10 h, when it attains adult form and starts to feed. It has two types of mechanosensory cell embedded in the oral epithelium, which is a single layer of cells. There are twenty coronal sensory cells in the circumoral nerve ring and two dorsal sensory organ cells. Two bilateral lip precursor cells (LPCs), facing the anterior surface, divide dorsoventrally and make a wedge-shaped cleft between the two daughter cells named the dorsal lip cell (DLC) and the ventral lip cell (VLC). Eventually, the DLC and VLC become detached and separated into dorsal and ventral lips, triggering mouth opening. This is an intriguing example of cell division itself contributing to morphogenesis. The boundary between the ectoderm and endoderm is present between the lip cells and coronal sensory cells. All oral sensory cells, including dorsal sensory organ cells, were of endodermal origin and were not derived from the ectodermal placode. These observations on mouth formation provide a cellular basis for further studies at a molecular level, in this simple chordate.","Morita, Ryo; Onuma, Takeshi A; Manni, Lucia; Ohno, Nobuhiko; Nishida, Hiroki",Development genes and evolution,128,1

ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 protein spike triggers viral fusion with the cell plasma membrane, resulting in viral RNA genome delivery into the host. Despite ACE2's critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, full understanding of ACE2 expression, including in response to viral infection, remains unclear. ACE2 was thought to encode five transcripts and one protein of 805 amino acids. In the present study, we identify a novel short isoform of ACE2 expressed in the airway epithelium, the main site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Short ACE2 is substantially upregulated in response to interferon stimulation and rhinovirus infection, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection. This short isoform lacks SARS-CoV-2 spike high-affinity binding sites and, altogether, our data are consistent with a model where short ACE2 is unlikely to directly contribute to host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Blume, Cornelia; Jackson, Claire L; Spalluto, Cosma Mirella; Legebeke, Jelmer; Nazlamova, Liliya; Conforti, Franco; Perotin, Jeanne-Marie; Frank, Martin; Butler, John; Crispin, Max; Coles, Janice; Thompson, James; Ridley, Robert A; Dean, Lareb S N; Loxham, Matthew; Reikine, Stephanie; Azim, Adnan; Tariq, Kamran; Johnston, David A; Skipp, Paul J; Djukanovic, Ratko; Baralle, Diana; McCormick, Christopher J; Davies, Donna E; Lucas, Jane S; Wheway, Gabrielle; Mennella, Vito",Nature genetics,128,1

METHODS Prospectively, consecutive 333 ulcerative colitis patients operated adopting different IPAA techniques during the open surgery period 1984-2011 were enrolled. IPAA was performed using single stapling (SS) technique in 38 patients, double stapling (DS) technique in 235 patients (TIA stapler 42 patients, Endo-GIA 131 patients, Contour 62 patients) and handsewn IPAA in 60 patients. RESULTS Statistically different early and late complications were recorded among the different IPAA techniques. A lower frequency of daily and nocturnal defecations and a higher level of continence were observed in the DS-IPAA compared to handsewn IPAA. The distance between the anastomotic line and the anal verge was significantly lower in DS Endo-GIA or DS Contour groups than in the DS TIA and SS. In SS IPAA group, 31.6% developed cuffitis compared to 14.4% belonging to DS group, at a mean follow-up of 140.4 months. CONCLUSIONS Technical improvements changed the IPAA technique.

Above average temperatures and below average rainfall resulted in drought across many parts of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which then contributed to catastrophic bushfires. However, by late summer, above average rainfall resulted in a dramatic increase in mosquito abundance. While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded, NSW experienced increased activity of mosquito-borne Ross River virus. All these extreme events created many challenges for managing the pest and the public health risks associated with mosquitoes, from maintenance of mosquito monitoring and control programs through to unique challenges of communicating mosquito bite prevention advice to local communities. There are important lessons to be learned in situations where extreme weather events may influence the risk of mosquito-borne disease through driving changes in the abundance and diversity of mosquito populations, while also influencing the abundance and distribution of native wildlife that represents important local reservoirs of arboviruses. Similarly, supporting the maintenance of mosquito monitoring and management programs while local authorities face competing priorities due to extreme natural disasters and/or public health events is critical.","Webb, Cameron E",Public health research & practice,128,16

Despite the claim that PM errors [compared to retrospective memory (RM) errors] are perceived as character flaws, little empirical work has tested this assertion. In particular, no study has examined how adults perceive children's PM errors. Thus, the aim of the current studies was to examine adults' perceptions of children's forgetfulness depending on child age (4 vs. 10-year-olds), domain of the memory error (academic vs. social), and memory type (PM vs. RM). In Study 1, adult participants rated children's PM errors on seven traits. Findings showed that social errors were rated more negatively than academic errors, and age and domain interacted such that 10-year-olds were rated more negatively than 4-year-olds for making social errors but not academic errors. Study 2 examined the impact of child age, domain, and memory type on perceptions of forgetful children to specifically test differences between PM and RM errors. Results showed a larger difference between ratings of 10-year-olds for their academic and social memory errors compared to 4-year-olds, but only for RM errors.","Moeller, Samantha; Mazachowsky, Tessa R; Lavis, Lydia; Gluck, Stephanie; Mahy, Caitlin E V",Memory,128,1

A systematic literature search was carried out using CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Embase, and Ovid Nursing Database for studies: published up to April 2019; including people diagnosed with POAG; and assessing visual function or QoL in response to changing lighting/luminance levels or glare. Two researchers independently screened studies for eligibility. Data were extracted from eligible studies regarding study design, participant characteristics, outcomes, and results. Quality of included studies was critically appraised. Of 8437 studies, 56 eligible studies were included. Studies investigated the effects of lighting on the following domains among people with POAG: QoL (18/56), psychophysical measures (16/56), functional vision (10/56), activities of daily living (10/56), and qualitative findings (2/56). POAG negatively affects low-luminance contrast sensitivity, glare symptoms, and dark adaptation time and extent. In vision-related QoL questionnaires, people with POAG report problems with lighting, glare, and dark adaptation more frequently than any other domain. These problems worsen with progressing visual field loss. Early-stage POAG patients experience significantly more difficulties in low-luminance or changing lighting conditions than age-matched controls (AMCs), challenging perceptions of early-stage POAG as asymptomatic. However, performance-based studies seldom show significant differences between POAG participants and AMCs on tasks simulating daily activities under non-optimal lighting conditions. Further research with larger samples is required to optimise ambient and task-oriented lighting that can support patients' adaptation to POAG.","Enoch, Jamie; Jones, Lee; Taylor, Deanna J; Bronze, Carol; Kirwan, James F; Jones, Pete R; Crabb, David P",Eye,128,29

STUDY DESIGN In vivo experimental study. STUDY POPULATION Nine horses donated for medical conditions unrelated to respiratory system. METHODS The triangle-tip knife was applied in contact fashion. Left VC was performed under standing sedation. Endoscopic images of the upper airway were graded for inflammation by 2 masked surgeons preoperatively and immediately, 24 hours and, in 2 cases, 7 and 14 days postoperatively. Four larynxes were examined for histological evidence of inflammation and collagen deposition at 24 hours (n = 2) and at 14 days (n = 2) after surgery. RESULTS Ventriculocordectomy was successfully performed in all horses. Endoscopic evidence of inflammation was scored as normal (preoperatively), mild (immediately postoperatively), mild (24 hours postoperatively), mild (7 days postoperatively), and normal (14 days postoperatively). According to histopathology, inflammation of the surgical site and ventricularis muscle was generally increased (variable is common and is present in most high-power fields) 24 hours and 14 days postoperatively. Fibrosis and collagen deposition also seemed increased at the surgical site 14 days postoperatively. CONCLUSION Ventriculocordectomy was successfully performed with an electrosurgical triangle-tip knife and resulted in acceptable short-term outcomes. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The use of an electrosurgical triangle-tip knife alternative instrumentation may be offer an alternative option to perform VC in practices when diode laser is not available or is cost prohibitive. Longer term evaluation of the VC site is required to determine the effect on rima glottic cross-sectional area.","Suarez-Fuentes, David G; Tatarniuk, Dane M; Caston, Stephanie S; Bell, Chris D; Loinaz, Ricardo J; Hostetter, Jesse M",Veterinary surgery : VS,128,1

To date, a systematic review of the literature examining this topic is lacking. METHODS This systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Three different electronic databases (PubMed, Embase OVID, and Cochrane CENTRAL) were queried. RESULTS A total of 34 studies were included. The rate of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) in noncomparative studies (28) ranged from 0% to 10%, with 8 studies reporting patient deaths resulting from HAT. Within comparative studies, the rate of HAT in patients who underwent arterial reconstruction using the operating microscope ranged from 0% to 5.3%, whereas the rate of HAT in patients who underwent arterial reconstruction using loupe magnification ranged from 0% up to 28.6%, and 2 studies reported patient deaths resulting from HAT. Two comparative studies did not find statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Our comprehensive systematic review of the literature seems to suggest that overall, rates of HAT may be lower when the operating microscope is used for hepatic arterial reconstruction in liver transplantation.

Recently, many case reports have been published regarding dermatological manifestations associated with the COVID-19 disease. Yet, there is little information about the clinical features. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an ulcerative noninfectious inflammatory disease of the skin. At least in 50% of the cases the etiology is unknown. Nevertheless, PG has been known to be associated with many systemic diseases. In this paper, the authors report a case series of two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed sacral ulcers during their recovery at the ICU. These ulcers had an atypical course showing an exacerbation after surgical debridements. Thus, PG was suspected and confirmed by the clinical evolution and biopsies taken from the wounds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous papers have reported sacral pressure injuries associated with pyoderma gangrenosum in patients with COVID-19. PG should be suspected in those with COVID-19 who developed nonhealing pressure injuries.","Elkhatib, Rania; Giunta, Gabriele; Hanssens, Valerie; Kapila, Ayush; De Baerdemaeker, Randy; Zeltzer, Assaf; Hamdi, Moustapha",Advances in skin & wound care,128,1

In addition to these measures, we urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not touching one's eyes, nose or mouth.

A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-MA15) lacking the envelope (E) protein (rSARS-CoV-MA15-ΔE) is attenuated in vivo. To identify E protein regions and host responses that contribute to rSARS-CoV-MA15-ΔE attenuation, several mutants (rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*) containing point mutations or deletions in the amino-terminal or the carboxy-terminal regions of the E protein were generated. Amino acid substitutions in the amino terminus, or deletion of regions in the internal carboxy-terminal region of E protein, led to virus attenuation. Attenuated viruses induced minimal lung injury, diminished limited neutrophil influx, and increased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell counts in the lungs of BALB/c mice, compared to mice infected with the wild-type virus. To analyze the host responses leading to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation, differences in gene expression elicited by the native and mutant viruses in the lungs of infected mice were determined. Expression levels of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines associated with lung injury were reduced in the lungs of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*-infected mice, whereas the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased, both at the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggested that the reduction in lung inflammation together with a more robust antiviral T cell response contributed to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation. The attenuated viruses completely protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, indicating that these viruses are promising vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Human coronaviruses are important zoonotic pathogens. SARS-CoV caused a worldwide epidemic infecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality of around 10%. Therefore, understanding the virulence mechanisms of this pathogen and developing efficacious vaccines are of high importance to prevent epidemics from this and other human coronaviruses. Previously, we demonstrated that a SARS-CoV lacking the E protein was attenuated in vivo. Here, we show that small deletions and modifications within the E protein led to virus attenuation, manifested by minimal lung injury, limited neutrophil influx to the lungs, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, and enhanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell counts in vivo, suggesting that these phenomena contribute to virus attenuation. The attenuated mutants fully protected mice from challenge with virulent virus. These studies show that mutations in the E protein are not well tolerated and indicate that this protein is an excellent target for vaccine development.","Regla-Nava, Jose A; Nieto-Torres, Jose L; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Fett, Craig; Castaño-Rodríguez, Carlos; Perlman, Stanley; Enjuanes, Luis; DeDiego, Marta L",Journal of virology,128,26

We asked how universal is the benefit of a pictorial cue? To test this, we trained observers to categorize sinusoidal gratings in which categories were distinguished by spatial frequency or orientation. Next, participants completed a search task in which targets were pictorially and categorically cued. Measures of target and distractor processing that primarily rely on foveal processing showed universal benefits; however, the benefit was larger in the orientation condition. Importantly, an index of the direction of spatial attention (i.e., target guidance) showed that the orientation condition produced a pictorial benefit but the spatial frequency condition did not. Experiment 2 replicated the spatial frequency results and also included conditions that increased the discriminability, lowered the spatial frequencies, or both increased the discriminability and decreased the spatial frequencies of the categories. We found that only categories utilizing lower spatial frequencies produced a pictorial guidance benefit. This demonstrates that pictorial cues do not universally improve search performance above categorical cues; it depends on the features that distinguish the categories. Additionally, the increased discriminability condition improved guidance but failed to produce a pictorial benefit, suggesting an interesting disassociation between the amount of target guidance and the existence of a pictorial benefit. Given that perception is known to progress from low/coarse to high/fine spatial frequencies, this suggests that the pictorial guidance benefit acts on early low-spatial frequency processing only, but foveal object recognition processes utilize both early and late spatial frequency processing.","Ercolino, Ashley M; Patel, Pooja; Bohil, Corey; Neider, Mark B; Schmidt, Joseph","Attention, perception & psychophysics",128,1

It is necessary to provide evidence on its unprecedented psychological effects to develop effective psychological interventions. The current study aims to determine the anxiety severity level, coping strategies, and influencing factors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among people aged 15 years and above in Gonabad, Iran. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires between February and March 2020. We evaluated the anxiety severity levels and coping strategies using the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations-Short Form (CISS-SF), respectively. Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of coping strategies and anxiety. RESULTS Totally, 500 people completed the questionnaires (response rate: 73%). Of them, 53.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.9%- 57.8%) suffered moderate to severe levels of anxiety. More than half of the respondents (52.0%; 95% CI: 47.5%-56.4%) utilized emotional-based or avoidant coping strategies. People with no academic education (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.41- 3.31) and without physical exercise (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.22-3.33) preferred emotional-based coping instead of problem-based coping strategy. Female gender (OR: 1.60, 95%, CI: 1.13-2.28), underlying medical conditions (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.65-3.87), and emotional-based coping (OR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.76-5.99) were associated with higher severity levels of anxiety. CONCLUSION The severity of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was significant among participants. Further attention is needed to enhance the mental health of the vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identified some factors related to the severity level of anxiety related to COVID-19 that could help formulate better psychological interventions.","Mohammadzadeh, Fatemeh; Delshad Noghabi, Ali; Khosravan, Shahla; Bazeli, Javad; Armanmehr, Vajihe; Paykani, Toktam",Archives of Iranian medicine,128,16

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study in women undergoing Uphold mesh-augmented sacrospinous ligament fixation between 2010 and 2017. We compared 3 groups: (1) women with a wide genital hiatus preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively (""Persistently Wide"" cohort), (2) women with a wide genital hiatus preoperatively but normal hiatus 6 weeks postoperatively (""Improved"" cohort), and (3) women with a normal genital hiatus preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively (""Stably Normal"" cohort). We defined a wide hiatus as 4 cm or greater and a normal hiatus as less than 4 cm. The primary outcome was anatomic failure, defined as recurrent prolapse beyond the hymen or retreatment for prolapse with surgery or pessary. RESULTS Ninety-seven women were included in the study. Overall, mean age was 68 years (±7.15 years), mean body mass index was 28.36 kg/m2 (±5.34 kg/m2) and mean follow up time was 400 ± 216 days. Anatomic failure did not differ between groups (Persistently Wide, 15.4%; Improved, 11.1%; Stably Normal, 10.0%; P = 0.88). In logistic regression, the odds of anatomic failure remained similar among all groups (P = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS A persistently wide genital hiatus alone was not associated with anatomic failure in this small study cohort. Therefore, surgical reduction of the genital hiatus with level III support procedures may not affect prolapse recurrence at the time of mesh-augmented sacrospinous ligament fixation. Further studies are needed to confirm this relationship and investigate other potential mechanisms for these findings.","Vaughan, Monique H; Giugale, Lauren E; Siddiqui, Nazema Y; Bradley, Megan S",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,128,19

Methods- Between February and October 2018, all stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy at 2 university hospitals and 2 associated remote hospitals were included. Primary outcome measures were time from onset to groin puncture and time from imaging to groin puncture. Secondary outcome measures were time from onset to imaging and time from onset to thrombolysis. Results- In total, 440 patients were included (mothership 32.3%, DS 55.9%, DD 11.8%). Median time from onset to groin puncture (168 minutes) and time from imaging to groin puncture (51 minutes) were the shortest in the mothership group.

Some NIV ventilators may be better than others at compensating for leak. METHODS We bench studied 3 NIV ventilators (Vision, Carina, and Trilogy100) and 2 ICU ventilators (Puritan Bennett 840 and Evita XL) to assess how they coped with 2 leak levels and zero leak during NIV. With a 2-bellows-in-a-box lung model we simulated spontaneous breathing with tidal volumes of 300 mL and 500 mL, at pressure support of 0 and 10 cm H(2)O and PEEP of 5 and 10 cm H(2)O. We affixed the airway opening of the lung model to the mouth of a mannequin head and secured a mask on the mannequin face. We created a medium leak and a large leak with different size holes, and measured PEEP in the presence of leak. We also measured the actual pressure-support values and calculated the deviations from the set pressure-support value and the pressure-time product (PTP) of the airway opening pressure below and above baseline. RESULTS With the medium leak only the Vision and Carina maintained the set PEEP and pressure support. With the large leak the pressure support was decreased with all the tested ventilators. With the larger leak and pressure support of 10 cm H(2)O the PTP below baseline for triggering increased with 2 ventilators, and the PTP above baseline for supporting the patient's inspiratory effort decreased with all 5 ventilators. The larger tidal volume increased the PTP below baseline with all 5 ventilators and at all leak sizes. CONCLUSIONS Some of the ventilators compensated for leak better than others. With the larger leak none of the ventilators maintained the set PEEP or pressure support.","Ueno, Yoshitoyo; Nakanishi, Nobuto; Oto, Jun; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Respiratory care,128,27

In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated and compared clinical results of combined AVR with CABG using MECC. We prospectively collected preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative and follow-up data of 65 patients who underwent combined AVR with CABG using MECC and compared these with 135 patients undergoing combined AVR with CABG using standard CPB. No significant differences were seen in patients demographic characteristics or intraoperative data. Patients in the MECC group experienced a smaller preoperative haemoglobin drop (4.5±0.8 g/dl vs. 5.0±0.5 g/dl, P=0.002) resulting in higher haemoglobin at discharge (11.3±1.3 g/dl vs. 10.8±1.1 g/dl, P=0.03). They had decreased blood products requirements (P=0.004) compared to patients in the standard CPB group. No differences were noted in pulmonary complications, neurological events or mortality.

METHODS We systematically searched the literature databases WanFang Data, VIP, CNKI, and CBM for studies published between 1978 and 2012 to identify and select CPGs of traditional medicine. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument to evaluate these guidelines. RESULTS A total of 75 guidelines were included, of which 46 guidelines (62%) were on Traditional Chinese Medicine, 19 (25%) on Chinese Integrated Medicine, and 10 (13%) on Uyghur Medicine. Most traditional medicine CPGs published in domestic journals scored <20% (range: 0% to 63%). Eleven (14%) CPGs were developed following the methodology of evidence-based medicine. In each domain of AGREE II, traditional medicine CPGs performed clearly better than international CPGs. The same trend was seen in guidelines of modern medicine. CONCLUSIONS An increasing amount of CPGs are being published, but their quality is low. Referring to the key points of international guidelines development, supervision through AGREE II, cooperating with international groups and exploring the strategy of guideline development could improve the quality of CPGs on traditional medicine.","Deng, Wei; Li, Le; Wang, Zixia; Chang, Xiaonan; Li, Rui; Fang, Ziye; Wei, Dang; Yao, Liang; Wang, Xiaoqin; Wang, Qi; An, Guanghui; Chen, Yaolong",Journal of evidence-based medicine,128,16

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is an emerging operative approach that utilizes the umbilical scar to hide the surgical incision. OBJECTIVE To describe our initial experience with single-incision laparoscopic pyloromyotomy in 15 infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy was performed through a single skin incision in the umbilicus, using a 4-mm 30 degrees endoscope and a 5-mm trocar. The 3-mm working instruments were inserted directly into the abdomen via separate lateral fascial stab incisions. All patients were prospectively evaluated. RESULTS The procedure was performed in 15 infants (13 male) with mean age of 45 +/- 16 days and mean weight of 4.04 +/- 0.5 kg. All procedures were completed laparoscopically, and one case was converted to a conventional triangulated laparoscopic work configuration after a mucosal perforation was noted. The perforation was repaired laparoscopically. On average, operating time was 29.8 +/- 13.6 min, and postoperative length of stay was 1.5 +/- 0.8 days. All patients were discharged home on full feeds. Follow-up was scheduled 2-3 weeks after discharge, and no postoperative complications were noted in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic pyloromyotomy is a safe and feasible procedure with good postoperative results and excellent cosmesis. The main challenge is the spatial orientation of the instruments and endoscope in a small working space. This can be overcome by a more longitudinally oriented working axis than used in the conventional angulated laparoscopic configuration.","Muensterer, Oliver J; Adibe, Obinna O; Harmon, Carrol M; Chong, Albert; Hansen, Erik N; Bartle, Donna; Georgeson, Keith E",Surgical endoscopy,128,16

However, the underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 altering human immune response is still elusive. The existing literature on miRNA mediated pathogenesis of RNA virus viz. Dengue virus, West Nile virus, etc. raises a suspicion that miRNA encoded by SARS-CoV-2 might facilitate virus replication and regulate the host's gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. METHODS We investigated this possibility via computational prediction of putative miRNAs encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome using a novel systematic pipeline that predicts putative mature-miRNA and their targeted genes transcripts. To trace down if viral-miRNAs targeted the genes critical to the immune pathway, we assessed whether mature miRNA transcripts exhibit effective hybridization with the 3'UTR region of human gene transcripts. Conversely, we also tried to study human miRNA-mediated viral gene regulation to get insight into the miRNA mediated offense and defense mechanism of viruses and their host organisms in too. RESULTS Our analysis led us to shortlist six putative miRNAs that target, majorly, genes related to cell proliferation/differentiation/signaling, and senescence. Nonetheless, they also target immune-related genes that directly/indirectly orchestrate immune pathways like TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways putatively serving as the nucleus to cytokine storms. CONCLUSION Besides, these six miRNAs were found to conserved so far across 80 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI Virus, last assessed 12 April 2020) including Indian strains that are also targeted by 7 human miRNAs and can, therefore, be exploited to develop MicroRNA-Attenuated Vaccines.","Satyam, Rohit; Bhardwaj, Tulika; Goel, Sachin; Jha, Niraj Kumar; Jha, Saurabh Kumar; Nand, Parma; Ruokolainen, Janne; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Kesari, Kavindra Kumar",Current pharmaceutical design,128,17

However, HP is still commonly performed. Hartmann's reversal is associated with considerable morbidity. It is of interest whether laparoscopic reversal results in a lower morbidity as retrospective data suggest. Here, we compared the combined morbidity rates for two surgical strategies: strategy A, HP followed by laparoscopic reversal, and strategy B, sigmoid resection with PA followed by ileostomy closure. METHODS Prospectively collected data of all consecutive patients undergoing HP for benign left-sided colonic perforation between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively compared to data of patients undergoing PA. Groups were matched for age and Charlson comorbidity index. Additionally, patients were analyzed for American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, and peritonitis stage. End points were morbidity, operation time, reversal rate, time to reversal, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The study included 32 patients for whom Hartmann's reversal was planned, along with 32 matched patients who underwent PA and diverting ileostomy. Median age was 75 and 72 years, Charlson score was 6 (4-9) and 6 (5-7), and patients classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) higher than III were 81 % in both groups. Combined major morbidity rates were 21 % for strategy A and 20 % for strategy B (p = 1.0). Combined comprehensive complication index was 16.4 ± 14.1 and 12.3 ± 19.1 (p = 0.08). HP reversal by laparoscopy was achieved in 71 %. The colostomy reversal rate was 75 % compared to ileostomy closure rate of 88 % (p = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Hartmann's reversal is achievable in a high proportion of patients. Strategy B tends to have lower overall morbidity; meanwhile, major morbidity seems to be similar. Yet, in critically ill patients and in the absence of expertise of the surgeon on call, HP followed by elective laparoscopic reversal represents a viable alternative.","Steinemann, D C; Stierle, T; Zerz, A; Lamm, S H; Limani, P; Nocito, A",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,128,17

OBJECTIVES We assessed whether there were unintended health consequences to seriously ill hospitalized patients. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Population-based longitudinal cohort study of patients residing in Toronto or an urban control region with an incident admission for 1 of 7 serious conditions in the 3 years before, or the 4 months during or after restrictions. OUTCOME MEASURES Short-term mortality, overall readmissions, cardiac readmissions for acute myocardial infarction patients, serious complications for very low birth weight babies, and quality of care measures, comparing adjusted rates across time periods within regions. RESULTS Mortality, readmission, and complication rates did not change for any condition during or after severe acute respiratory syndrome restrictions. Although rates of invasive cardiac procedures for acute myocardial infarction patients decreased 11-37% in Toronto, rates of nonfatal cardiac outcomes did not change. CONCLUSIONS Restrictions on non-urgent hospital utilization and hospital transfers may be a safe public health strategy to employ to control nosocomial outbreaks or provide hospital surge capacity for up to several months, in large, well-developed healthcare systems with good availability of community-based care.","Stukel, Thérèse A; Schull, Michael J; Guttmann, Astrid; Alter, David A; Li, Ping; Vermeulen, Marian J; Manuel, Douglas G; Zwarenstein, Merrick",Medical care,128,16

Current practice is moving toward multimodal analgesia regimens that limit narcotic use. OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review is to address the following research question: In patients with non-traumatic headaches (Population), does administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate (Intervention) compared to placebo, corticosteroids, dopamine antagonists, ergot alkaloids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans, or usual care result in better pain control, lower rate of recurrence at 24 hours, lower requirements for rescue analgesia, and less adverse medication effects (Outcomes)? METHODS Scholarly databases and relevant bibliographies were searched, as were clinical trial registries and relevant conference proceedings to limit publication bias. Studies were not limited by date, language, or publication status. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized clinical trial (RCT), (2) patients age ≥18 years, (3) non-traumatic headache, (4) patients treated in ED or an outpatient acute care treatment center, and (5) magnesium sulfate administered intravenously (IV). Eligible comparison groups included: placebo, conventional therapy, dopamine antagonist, NSAID, corticosteroid, ergot alkaloid, or triptans. RESULTS Out of 4018 identified references, 7 RCTs (545 participants) that treated migraine headaches (n = 6) and benign non-traumatic headaches (n = 1) met inclusion criteria. Pain intensity was improved with magnesium sulfate vs comparators at 60-120 minutes, but not at earlier time points. Result for the endpoint of pain reduction by 50% were conflicting as 3 studies reported that headache was improved, unchanged, and less with magnesium sulfate. Complete pain relief was improved with magnesium sulfate in 1 study, and in the migraine with aura (MA) subgroup in another. The need for rescue analgesia at any point was improved with magnesium sulfate in 1 study, and in the MA subgroup in another. Twenty-four-hour headache recurrence was improved with magnesium sulfate in 1 study, but unchanged in a second. The intended meta-analysis was not performed due to the clinical heterogeneity among studies. CONCLUSION While we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the efficacy or benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute non-traumatic headaches, the existing evidence indicates potential benefits in pain control beyond 1 hour, aura duration, and need for rescue analgesia.","Miller, Andrew C; K Pfeffer, Brandon; Lawson, Michael R; Sewell, Kerry A; King, Alexandra R; Zehtabchi, Shahriar",Headache,128,19

These devices have been shown to reduce operative time and thermal nerve injury. As hemostasis is paramount in thyroid surgery, we sought to examine the relative efficacy of 2 alternate energy devices compared to conventional hemostasis in preventing postoperative hematoma following total thyroidectomy. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. REVIEW METHODS A systematic literature search was performed for all relevant English-language studies published between 1946 and July 2018. Two authors independently extracted data and analyzed articles for quality using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Scale. Our primary outcome of interest was hematoma requiring reoperation. RESULTS A total of 348 studies were screened, with 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. We found no significant difference in postoperative hematoma rates using alternate energy devices compared to conventional hemostasis (P = .370, .317). Network meta-analysis echoed the results of conventional meta-analysis, demonstrating no significant difference in hematoma rates. CONCLUSIONS We found no significant difference in postoperative hematoma rates following total thyroidectomy for any indication with the use of alternate energy devices compared to conventional hemostatic techniques. This suggests that hematoma occurrence does not necessarily need to be considered when choosing between these hemostatic devices. This information may help guide surgeons' decisions regarding choice of hemostatic technique during thyroid surgery.","Hua, Nadia; Quimby, Alexandra Elizabeth; Johnson-Obaseki, Stephanie",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,128,1

SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. Objective To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. Results LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. Conclusion A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Nalla, Arun K; Huang, Meei-Li; Zhu, Haiying; Wei, Yulun; Stensland, Larry; Loprieno, Michelle A; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,128,1

Standards of acute stroke care vary widely both regionally and nationally; consequently, various healthcare organizations have undertaken initiatives to measure and improve quality of care. To date, most quality measures have been process-based, focusing primarily on metrics of patient care in the acute hospital-based setting (e.g., time to recombinant tPA administration). Therefore, there remains a need for metrics designed to assess how improvements in process translate into patient outcomes. A global forum was convened to share best practice and provide consensus recommendations on core metrics for measuring improvements in access to care and patient outcomes. Recommendations for core metrics of patient outcomes include hospital-based outcomes (e.g., neurological status at 24 h, ambulatory status at discharge) and post-discharge outcomes (e.g., modified Rankin Scale score at 30 and/or 90 days). Recommendations for best practice relating to aspects of people, process, and technology involved in the stroke treatment pathway that may help provide improvements in these core outcome measures are also outlined.","Rymer, M M; Anderson, C S; Harada, M; Jarosz, J; Ma, N; Rowley, H A; Summers, D; Tastula, K; Williams, O; Bornstein, N M",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,128,1

Tissue adhesives may be an alternative, so as to be able to improve levels of postoperative comfort, but clinical experience using them is limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of cyanoacrylate as a substitute for sutures in the treatment of inguinal hernias. PATIENTS Randomized clinical trial in abdominal wall unit. A total of 208 patients were operated upon for inguinal hernias of which 102 were unilateral hernias via open surgery using the Lichtenstein technique, randomized to receive prolene sutures (n = 52) or n-hexyl-α-cyanoacrylate glue (n = 50) and 106 were patients with bilateral inguinal hernias operated upon via totally extraperitoneal laparoscopy and randomized to receive either tackers (n = 54) or glue (n = 52). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoints were pain and recurrence. Secondary endpoints were operating time, postoperative morbidity, pain, and analgesic consumption. RESULTS No morbidity associated with the use of the glue existed. The use of glue significantly reduced the mean of surgical time (12 minutes in open surgery, 13 minutes in laparoscopic surgery), pain, and analgesics consumption, both via the open and laparoscopic approaches (P < .001). After 1 year the adhesive did not change the recurrence rate in either of the approaches. The economic analysis shows potential yearly savings of 123 916.3 Euros.

PURPOSE To study the effectiveness of combination therapy with RFA and TACE compared to that of TACE alone in a Scandinavian tertiary liver cancer center. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study of the patients treated with combination therapy vis-à-vis TACE alone from June 2007 to November 2012 was performed. Eighteen patients were treated with a combination of RFA and TACE with an interval of 1-4 days between the treatments. For comparison, a group of 18 patients treated with TACE as monotherapy in the same time period was matched with the combination group by demographic data, tumor characteristics, biochemical and clinical parameters, and performance status (PS). RESULTS Each group consisted of 14 patients with cirrhosis and four without. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, gender, tumor characteristics, causes of cirrhosis, levels of bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time, Child Pugh score, or World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. The median survival of patients in the RFA + TACE combination group was 586 days compared to 296 days in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). However, when we stratified the data for cirrhosis and WHO performance status, patients in the combination group had significantly better survival (P = 0.024).

Nevertheless, accurate interpretation of radiographic and CT studies requires a thorough knowledge of the gross and the cross-sectional anatomy. Despite the increasing success of reptiles as pets, only a few reports over their normal imaging features are currently available. The aim of this study is to describe the normal cadaveric, radiographic and computed tomographic features of the heads of the green iguana, tegu and bearded dragon. RESULTS 6 adult green iguanas, 4 tegus, 3 bearded dragons, and, the adult cadavers of: 4 green iguana, 4 tegu, 4 bearded dragon were included in the study. 2 cadavers were dissected following a stratigraphic approach and 2 cadavers were cross-sectioned for each species. These latter specimens were stored in a freezer (-20°C) until completely frozen. Transversal sections at 5 mm intervals were obtained by means of an electric band-saw. Each section was cleaned and photographed on both sides. Radiographs of the head of each subject were obtained. Pre- and post- contrast computed tomographic studies of the head were performed on all the live animals. CT images were displayed in both bone and soft tissue windows. Individual anatomic structures were first recognised and labelled on the anatomic images and then matched on radiographs and CT images. Radiographic and CT images of the skull provided good detail of the bony structures in all species.

The United States stands alone among developed nations in permitting one androgen, oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), to be freely available OTC and online as a ""dietary supplement."" DHEA is widely used by males in the US to offset the age-related decline in circulating androgens. This fact may contribute to the disparate statistics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in this country. In regulatory antithesis, every other developed nation regulates DHEA as a controlled substance. DHEA is an extremely potent inhibitor of Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD), with uniquely unstable uncompetitive inhibition kinetics. This has particular relevance to COVID-19, because G6PD-deficient human cells have been demonstrated to be exceptionally sensitive to infection by human coronavirus. Because DHEA is lipophilic and freely passes into cells, oral DHEA bypasses the normal controls regulating androgen biology and uncompetitive G6PD inhibition. DHEA's status as a ""dietary supplement"" means that no clinical trials demonstrating safety have been performed, and, in the absence of physician supervision, no data on adverse events has been collected. During the current pandemic, the unrestricted availability of oral DHEA as a ""dietary supplement"" cannot be considered safe without proof from placebo-controlled clinical trials that it is not contributing to the severity of COVID-19. US physicians may therefore wish to query their patients' use of DHEA.","Nyce, Jonathan Wesley",Endocrine-related cancer,128,31

High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may have the potential to overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth and pyocyanin production of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC ® 10145™ and clinical isolates were cultured in BHI media for 18 hours followed by optical density measurements at 600 nm wavelength to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). After 36 hours of incubation, pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm. Pyocyanin concentrations were calculated using extinction coefficient 4310 M -1cm -1. Results: Results of the MIC tests of both strains were 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC ® 10145™, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Conclusions: This study concluded royal jelly concentrations of 25% or above could inhibit bacterial growth; however, only the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% could increase pyocyanin production in P. aeruginosa, both in ATCC ® 10145™ and clinical isolates. In conclusion, it is advisable to determine the appropriate concentration of royal jelly to obtain beneficial virulence inhibiting activity.","Amly, Dina Auliya; Hajardhini, Puspita; Jonarta, Alma Linggar; Yulianto, Heribertus Dedy Kusuma; Susilowati, Heni",F1000Research,128,30

To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.","Mina, Michael J; Kula, Tomasz; Leng, Yumei; Li, Mamie; de Vries, Rory D; Knip, Mikael; Siljander, Heli; Rewers, Marian; Choy, David F; Wilson, Mark S; Larman, H Benjamin; Nelson, Ashley N; Griffin, Diane E; de Swart, Rik L; Elledge, Stephen J",Science,128,23

Catching and introducing the wrong needle resulted in a knot formed around the right adnexa. DESIGN A step-by-step demonstration of the mistake and technique to correct it. SETTING A Para 0+V patient with cervical insufficiency was managed with laparoscopic interval cerclage [1,2,3]. The patient's two most recent pregnancies had been managed with emergency transvaginal cerclage, which failed to prolong her gestation beyond 24 weeks. INTERVENTIONS Prior to the cerclage procedure a 2.0 × 0.8cm deep endometriotic nodule was excised. Both curved needles were straightened extracorporeally, and the tape was dropped inside the peritoneal cavity. The 1st needle was introduced successfully through the right side. After insertion of - what was believed to be - the same needle through the left side following the opposite direction, it was discovered that a tight knot had been formed around the right adnexa (Figure 1). To avoid complete removal, the needles-less tape was pulled back completely from the right side (Supplemental Figure 1), and this end was stitched to a straight needle 2-0 polyglactin suture. The much thinner needle passed easily through the already created path, along with the tape (Supplemental Figure 2), and the procedure was completed as planned (Supplemental Figure 3). CONCLUSION When performing laparoscopic cervical cerclage with the tape and needles inside the abdomen it is important to keep both under constant view. In the event of mis-placement, no need to completely remove the tape. The tape's cut end can still be re-introduced successfully, stitched to a straight needle suture.","Protopapas, Athanasios; Kypriotis, Konstantinos; Samartzis, Konstantinos; Lardou, Ioanna; Karagiannis, Vasilios; Chatzipapas, Ioannis",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,128,16

However, studies can be limited by small sample sizes and sparse clinical follow-up data. We utilized a large sample of prostate specimens to identify a predictive model of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy and we validated this model in two external data sets. METHODS We analyzed prostate specimens from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at Hartford Hospital between 2008 and 2011. RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostates was hybridized to a custom Affymetrix microarray. Regularized (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [Lasso]) Cox regression was performed with cross-validation to identify a model that incorporated gene expression and clinical factors to predict biochemical recurrence, defined as postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 0.2 ng/ml or receipt of triggered salvage treatment. Model performance was assessed using time-dependent receiver operating curve (ROC) curves and survival plots. RESULTS A total of 606 prostate specimens with gene expression and both pre- and postoperative PSA data were available for analysis. We identified a model that included Gleason grade and stage as well as five genes (CNRIP1, endoplasmic reticulum protein 44 [ERP44], metaxin-2 [MTX2], Ras homolog family member U [RHOU], and OXR1). Using the Lasso method, we determined that the five gene model independently predicted biochemical recurrence better than a model that included Gleason grade and tumor stage alone. The time-dependent ROCAUC for the five gene signature including Gleason grade and tumor stage was 0.868 compared to an AUC of 0.767 when Gleason grade and tumor stage were included alone. Low and high-risk groups displayed significant differences in their recurrence-free survival curves. The predictive model was subsequently validated on two independent data sets identified through the Gene Expression Omnibus. The model included genes (RHOU, MTX2, and ERP44) that have previously been implicated in prostate cancer biology. CONCLUSIONS Expression of a small number of genes is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence independent of classical pathological hallmarks.","Corradi, John P; Cumarasamy, Christine White; Staff, Ilene; Tortora, Joseph; Salner, Andrew; McLaughlin, Tara; Wagner, Joseph",The Prostate,128,29

Expressed in several tissues, apoD is up-regulated under different stress stimuli and in a variety of pathologies. Numerous studies have revealed that overexpression of apoD led to neuroprotection in various mouse models of acute stress and neurodegeneration. This multifunctional protein is internalized in several cells types, but the specific internalization mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the internalization of apoD involves a specific cell surface receptor in 293T cells, identified as the transmembrane glycoprotein basigin (BSG, CD147); more particularly, its low glycosylated form. Our results show that internalized apoD colocalizes with BSG into vesicular compartments. Down-regulation of BSG disrupted the internalization of apoD in cells. In contrast, overexpression of basigin in SH-5YSY cells, which poorly express BSG, restored the uptake of apoD. Cyclophilin A, a known ligand of BSG, competitively reduced apoD internalization, confirming that BSG is a key player in the apoD internalization process. In summary, our results demonstrate that basigin is very likely the apoD receptor and provide additional clues on the mechanisms involved in apoD-mediated functions, including neuroprotection.","Najyb, Ouafa; Brissette, Louise; Rassart, Eric",The Journal of biological chemistry,128,1

Most events occur in patients who are at low to intermediate risk for CHD; and in low-risk asymptomatic patients, percutaneous coronary intervention in ""screen-positive"" patients does not improve outcomes and creates unnecessary risks. As a result, the ACP recommended against screening for asymptomatic patients who are at low risk for CHD. Instead, it recommended a focus on proven strategies, such as treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, to reduce risk in appropriately selected asymptomatic persons. Two discussants weigh the evidence for and against screening for CHD in asymptomatic patients with varying degrees of risk and provide recommendations for a specific patient who is uncertain whether to proceed to screening.","Smetana, Gerald W; Cutlip, Donald E; Pinto, Duane S",Annals of internal medicine,128,1

Diseases endemic to Canada are also likely to re-emerge. This special issue describes key infectious disease risks associated with climate change. These include emergence of tick-borne diseases in addition to Lyme disease, the possible introduction of exotic mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, more epidemics of Canada-endemic vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, and increased incidence of foodborne illnesses. Risk is likely to be compounded by an aging population affected by chronic diseases, which results in greater sensitivity to infectious diseases.

The region is characterized by a low contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 5.4%. Lack of awareness of contraceptive use, husband objection and religious barriers are attributed to low CPR in the region. This study assessed the effect of community-based interventions for promoting family planning (FP) use among pastoralist communities in Ethiopia. METHODS The study design was a three-arm, parallel, clustered randomized controlled trial (CRT). The three study arms were: (1) male involvement in family planning (FP) education; (2) women's education on FP; and (3) control. A total of 33 clusters were randomized and allocated with a one-to-one ratio. Intervention components included (1) health education on FP to married women and men by faema leaders (a traditional community-based structure that serves as a social support group); (2) video-assisted message on FP; and (3) assisting the faema leader using health workers and health extension workers (HEWs). The intervention was given for a total of nine months. FP use and intentions were measured as outcome variables. In addition, a cluster-level summary considering a cluster effect analysis was performed. The result was presented with t.test, adjusted risks and its 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS The proportion of FP use among the arms was 34% in the male involvement in FP education, 17.5% in women's education on FP and 4.3% in the control. There was a positive change in the proportion of FP use in the male involvement in FP education and women's education on FP arms with absolute risk (AR) of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.23,0.34) and 0.13 (95% CI,0.08,0.17), respectively, as compared to the control arm. Similarly, married women in the male involvement in FP education and women's education on FP arms had 3.4 (2.48, 4.91) and 2.1 (1.50, 2.95) higher intention to use FP, respectively, as compared with the control arm. CONCLUSION The present study suggests that in such male-dominated pastoralist communities with more considerable religious barriers, the community-based health education mainly targeting males appears to be a promising strategy for improving FP use and intention to use FP.

Here, we show that the contact time of bouncing droplets on high solid fraction surfaces can be reduced by reducing the texture size to ~100 nm. We demonstrated that the texture size-dependent contact time reduction could be attributed to the dominance of line tension on nanotextures and that compact arrangement of nanotextures is essential to withstand the impact pressure of raindrops.

Such a system could be useful for improving minimally invasive procedures-as in the case of large hiatal hernia with paraesophageal involvement (PEH) repair. Studies reporting on the robotic-assisted PEH repair are scarce, and a comparison to the standard operation techniques is lacking. Therefore, we decided to investigate the feasibility and safety of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) compared to conventional laparoscopic (CLS) and open surgery (OS) for the first time. METHODS We investigated 42 patients for the perioperative outcome after PEH repair. Twelve patients were operated on with RAS, 17 with CLS, and 13 with OS. Operating time, intraoperative blood loss, intra- and postoperative complications, mortality, and duration of hospital stay were analyzed in each method. RESULTS On average, operating time in the RAS group was 38 min longer, and the intraoperative blood was loss 217 ml lower compared to OS. Both results were similar to the CLS group. The intraoperative complication rate was similar in all groups. The postoperative complication rate in the RAS group was significantly lower than the OS group, though again similar to the CLS group. The hospital stay was 5 days shorter in the RAS group than the OS group and once again similar to the CLS group. CONCLUSION The results show that RAS is feasible and safe.

Here, one-dimensional cobalt selenide (CoSe2) NMs with different vacancies were synthesized through the same precursor while calcined at different temperatures (P-CoSe2 which calcined at 200 °C and N-CoSe2 which calcined at 230 °C). According to the positron annihilation spectrum, the VSeSe vacancy associate in P-CoSe2 was endowed with two positive charges, while the VCoCoCoSeSe vacancy associate in N-CoSe2 possessed four negative charges. Cell viability assays revealed that N-CoSe2 had higher toxicity to macrophages than P-CoSe2, which was attributed to higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by N-CoSe2. Further investigation showed that N-CoSe2 had higher affinity to the mitochondrion-targeting peptide, leading to its preferential distribution in the mitochondria and consequent induction of mitochondrial superoxide production. In contrast, P-CoSe2 exhibited higher affinity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting peptide, facilitating its preferential distribution in the ER and the nuclei and causing higher damage to both organelles as compared to N-CoSe2. These results demonstrated that type of surface vacancies significantly affected biodistribution of NMs in subcellular organelles, which contributed to differential biological behaviors of the NMs.","Wu, Guizhu; Chen, Xue; Zhang, Ze; Zhu, Nali; Yu, Qilin; Liu, Huajie; Liu, Lu",Nanotoxicology,128,16

The posterolateral laparoscopic splenectomy approach may be a feasible and safe technique for these patients. Aim To evaluate the feasibility and safety of the posterolateral laparoscopic splenectomy approach in patients with platelet counts < 1 × 109/l secondary to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Material and methods In the period from January 2013 to December 2016, 11 patients with platelet counts < 1 × 109/l secondary to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension underwent posterolateral laparoscopic splenectomy in our institution. Pre-, peri-, and postoperative medical managements were reviewed retrospectively. Results Patients' median platelet count was 0.7 × 109/l at the time of inpatient admission. The median operating time was 75 min, and the median intraoperative blood loss was 30 ml. One patient underwent intraoperative transfusion. The median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 5 days. No intra- or postoperative complications ensued, all patients were followed for 12-32 months (median: 24 months), and none had postoperative complications.

BACKGROUND The effect of music in the operating room (OR) is controversial. Some studies from the anesthesiology literature suggest that OR music is distracting and should be banned. Other nonblinded studies have indicated that music improves surgeons' efficiency with simple tasks. DESIGN/METHODS A prospective, blinded, randomized trial of 19 novice surgical trainees was conducted using an in vitro model. Each trainee performed a baseline vascular anastomosis (VA) without music. Subsequently, they performed one VA with music (song validated to reduce anxiety) and one without, in random order and without prior knowledge of the study's purpose. The primary endpoint was a difference in differences from baseline with and without music with respect to time to completion, acceleration/deceleration (using a previously validated hand-tracking motion device), and video performance scoring (3 blinded experts using a validated scale). The participants completed a poststudy survey to gauge their opinions regarding music during tasks. RESULTS Overall, 57 VAs by 19 trainees were evaluated. Average time to completion was 11.6 minutes. When compared to baseline, time to completion improved for both the music group (p = 0.01) and no-music group (p = 0.001). When comparing music to no music, there was no difference in time to completion (p = 0.7), acceleration/deceleration (p = 0.3), or video performance scorings (p = NS). Among participants, 89% responded that they enjoy listening to music while performing tasks. CONCLUSIONS Using three outcome measures, relaxing music did not improve the performance of novice surgical trainees performing a complex surgical task, and the music did not make their performance worse. However, nearly all trainees reported enjoying listening to music while performing tasks.","Shover, Andrew; Holloway, Janell; Dauphine, Christine; Benharash, Peyman; Xing, Hanning; Kansal, Nikhil; Bowens, Nina; Archie, Mark; Kaji, Amy H; de Virgilio, Christian",Journal of surgical education,128,8

We demonstrated in the past that volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver resection. In this randomized study, we examined if volatile anesthetics have an effect on acute graft injury and clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. METHODS Cadaveric liver transplant recipients were enrolled from January 2009 to September 2012 at 3 University Centers (Zurich/Sao Paulo/Ghent). Recipients were randomly assigned to propofol (control group) or sevoflurane anesthesia. Postoperative peak of aspartate transaminase was defined as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints were early allograft dysfunction, in-hospital complications, intensive care unit, and hospital stay. RESULTS Ninety-eight recipients were randomized to propofol (n = 48) or sevoflurane (n = 50). Median peak aspartate transaminase after transplantation was 925 (interquartile range, 512-3274) in the propofol and 1097 (interquartile range, 540-2633) in the sevoflurane group. In the propofol arm, 11 patients (23%) experienced early allograft dysfunction, 7 (14%) in the sevoflurane one (odds ratio, 0.64 (0.20 to 2.02, P = 0.45). There were 4 mortalities (8.3%) in the propofol and 2 (4.0%) in the sevoflurane group. Overall and major complication rates were not different. An effect on clinical outcomes was observed favoring the sevoflurane group (less severe complications), but without significance. CONCLUSIONS This first multicenter trial comparing propofol with sevoflurane anesthesia in liver transplantation shows no difference in biochemical markers of acute organ injury and clinical outcomes between the 2 regimens. Sevoflurane has no significant added beneficial effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury compared to propofol.","Beck-Schimmer, Beatrice; Bonvini, John M; Schadde, Erik; Dutkowski, Philipp; Oberkofler, Christian E; Lesurtel, Mickael; DeOliveira, Michelle L; Figueira, Estela R R; Rocha Filho, Joel A; Auler, Jose Otavio Costa; D'Albuquerque, Luiz A C; Reyntjens, Koen; Wouters, Patrick; Rogiers, Xavier; Debaerdemaeker, Luc; Ganter, Michael T; Weber, Achim; Puhan, Milo A; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Breitenstein, Stefan",Transplantation,128,19

Although surgical cricothyroidotomy remains the technique recommended in many 'CICV' algorithms, the insertion of a tracheostomy as a cannula over a trocar, or using the Seldinger method, may have advantages as they are more familiar to the anaesthetist. We compared the utility of three cuffed cricothyroidotomy devices: cuffed Melker®, Quicktrach 2®, and PCK® devices, with surgical cricothyroidotomy. METHODS After ethical committee approval and written informed consent, 20 anaesthetists performed cricothyroidotomy with all four devices in random order, in a pig larynx and trachea model covered in cured pelt. The primary endpoints were the rate of successful placement of the cricothyroidotomy device into the trachea and the duration of the insertion attempt. RESULTS The Melker® and Quicktrach 2® devices possessed advantages over the surgical approach, in contrast to the PCK® device, which performed less well. All 20 participants inserted the Melker®, with 19 being successful using the surgical approach and the Quicktrach 2®, whereas only 12 successfully inserted the PCK® device (PCK® vs surgical, P=0.02). The Quicktrach 2® had the fastest insertion times and caused least trauma to the posterior tracheal wall. The Melker® was rated highest by the participants and was the only device rated higher than the surgical technique. CONCLUSIONS The Melker® and Quicktrach 2® devices appear to hold particular promise as alternatives to surgical cricothyroidotomy. Further studies, in more clinically relevant models, are required to confirm these initial positive findings.","Murphy, C; Rooney, S J; Maharaj, C H; Laffey, J G; Harte, B H",British journal of anaesthesia,128,6

Design: This study used a cross-sectional design and total enumeration sample (n = 439) from all enrolled nursing students in the College of Nursing of a state-run university. Method: The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and 14-item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) were used to collect data from the participants. A correlational analysis was employed to determine the relationship between the responses of the participants to their profile variables.

RECENT FINDINGS New data strengthen the evidence against a causal link between MS and vaccination. Recent consensus statements agree on the need to start vaccination early. Timings for vaccine administration should be adjusted to ensure safety and optimize vaccine responses, given the potential interference of DMDs. Patients treated with Ocrelizumab (and potentially other B-cell depleting therapies) are at risk of diminished immunogenicity to vaccines. This has relevant implications for the upcoming vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY An early assessment and immunization of MS patients allows optimizing vaccine responses and avoiding potential interference with treatment plans. Vaccinations are safe and effective but some specific considerations should be followed when vaccinating before, during, and after receiving immunotherapy. A time-window for vaccination taking into account the kinetics of B cell repopulation could potentially improve vaccine responses. Further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response dynamics in MS patients under specific therapies will be key for defining the best vaccination strategy.","Otero-Romero, Susana; Ascherio, Alberto; Lebrun-Frénay, Christine",Current opinion in neurology,128,16

RECENT FINDINGS Sustained increases in ambulatory surgical care reflect advances in surgical techniques and perioperative anaesthetic care. Use of patient-reported outcomes allows identification of minor adverse events that are more common in this population compared with traditional endpoints such as mortality. Variability in reported outcomes restricts research potential and limits the ability to benchmark providers. The standardized endpoints in perioperative medicine initiative's recommendations on patient-reported outcomes and patient comfort measures are relevant to evaluating ambulatory care. Combining validated generic and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) examines the widest spectrum of outcomes. Technological advances can be used to facilitate outcome measurement in ambulatory surgery with digital integration optimizing accurate real-time data collection. Telephone or web-based applications for reviewing ambulatory patients were found to be acceptable in multiple international settings and should be harnessed to allow remote follow-up.

More oxidized‑oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) and sulfate showed the dominant enhancements, especially in large particle-mode. Meanwhile, relative humidity (RH) showed a positive promotion on the formation of sulfate and MO-OOA during the lockdown, but had no obvious correlation with less oxidized‑oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) or nitrate. Organosulfurs (OS) displayed a higher contribution (~58%) than inorganic sulfate to total sulfate enhancement in the polluted episode during the lockdown. Although the total nitrate (TN) decreased during the lockdown ascribing to a larger reduction of inorganic nitrate, organic nitrate (ON) showed an obvious increase from pre-lockdown (0.5 ± 0.6 μg m-3 and 1 ± 2% of TN) to lockdown (5.3 ± 3.1 μg m-3 and 17 ± 9% of TN) in the polluted case (P < 0.05). In addition, RH also displayed a positive promotion on the formation of ON and OS, and the increases of both OS and ON were much efficient in the nighttime than in the daytime.

OBJECTIVE To retrospectively analyze the clinical results for emergent endovascular carotid recanalization in patients with acute proximal (cervical) ICA occlusion and to assess predictors of recanalization and clinical, neurological, and functional outcome. METHODS Emergent endovascular revascularization was attempted in 22 patients presenting with acute stroke secondary to complete cervical ICA occlusion. Patients with pseudo-occlusion were excluded. Recanalization was assessed with the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) system: grade 0 (no flow) to grade 3 (normal flow). RESULTS The median age of the patients was 65 years; mean admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14. Recanalization (TIMI grade 2/3) occurred in 17 patients (77.3%). Ten patients (45.5%) demonstrated significant clinical improvement during hospitalization (NIHSS improved ≥4 points). Fifty percent of patients had good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) after a median follow-up of 3 months. Patient age <70 years and successful recanalization (TIMI grade 2/3) predicted a good outcome (P ≤ .01). Presence of atrial fibrillation, admission NIHSS score ≥20, and complete ICA occlusion at all levels (cervical, petrocavernous, and intracranial) were associated with poor outcomes (P ≤ .05). Patients with complete cervical ICA occlusion but partial distal preservation of the vessel were most likely to benefit from the intervention (recanalization in 88.2%; good outcome in 64.7%). CONCLUSION Attempts at emergent endovascular carotid recanalization for acute stroke are encouraged, particularly in younger patients with partial distal preservation of the ICA.","Hauck, Erik F; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Ohta, Hajime; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,128,1

Although these dynamics are routinely explored independently, the relationships among them and how their interactions facilitate or constrain adaptation to climate change are poorly understood. In migratory species, advancing phenology may impose selection on morphological traits to increase migration speed. Advancing spring phenology might also expose species to cooler temperatures during the breeding season, potentially mitigating the effect of a warming global environment on body size. We use a dataset of birds that died after colliding with buildings in Chicago, IL to test whether changes in migration phenology are related to documented declines in body size and increases in wing length in 52 North American migratory bird species between 1978 and 2016. For each species, we estimate temporal trends in morphology and changes in the timing of migration. We then test for associations between species-specific rates of phenological and morphological changes while assessing the potential effects of migratory distance and breeding latitude. We show that spring migration through Chicago has advanced while the timing of fall migration has broadened as a result of early fall migrants advancing their migrations and late migrants delaying their migrations. Within species, we found that longer wing length was linked to earlier spring migration within years. However, we found no evidence that rates of phenological change across years, or migratory distance and breeding latitude, are predictive of rates of concurrent changes in morphological traits. These findings suggest that biotic responses to climate change are highly multidimensional and the extent to which those responses interact and influence adaptation to climate change requires careful examination.","Zimova, Marketa; Willard, David E; Winger, Benjamin M; Weeks, Brian C",The Journal of animal ecology,128,14

Research that would normally require years has been completed in months.

These vaccines are extremely promising and will eventually be distributed widely. Unfortunately, as the science of vaccine development has swiftly progressed, the equally important science of community engagement, which should guide the establishment of mutually beneficial partnerships and promote eventual vaccine uptake, has lagged behind. Research methods focused on the development of effective public health interventions place communities-groups with shared culture, norms, beliefs, or language-at their core and emphasize the primacy of community ownership as essential for uptake and sustainability.1 Yet, communities of color (i.e., Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities), who remain at highest risk for infection, have been peripheral, not central actors in the pursuit of COVID-19 vaccines.

Our primary aims included tolerability, feasibility, and acceptability of use of the platform, and secondary outcomes were changes in SPPB and in scores of physical activity and disability measured using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) and Lung Transplant-Value Life Activities (LT-VLA). Notably, no adverse events were reported. Subjects reported the app was easy to use, usability improved over time, and the app enhanced motivation to engage in rehabilitation. Comments highlighted the complexities of immediate post-transplant rehabilitation, including functional decline, pain, tremor, and fatigue. At the end of the intervention, SPPB scores improved a median of 5 points from a baseline of 4. Physical activity and patient-reported disability also improved. The DASI improved from 4.5 to 19.8 and LT-VLA score improved from 2 to 0.59 at closeout. Overall, utilization of an mHealth rehabilitation platform was safe and well received. Remote rehabilitation was associated with improvements in frailty, physical activity and disability.

Sprague-Dawley rats (6-7 weeks) were randomly divided into control, sham, 2VO + V (bilateral carotid vessel occlusion + vehicle), 2VO + E-PRP (early after 2VO), and 2VO + L-PRP (late after 2VO) groups. The injection of PRP started immediately or on the day 20 after 2VO in 2VO + E-PRP and 2VO + L-PRP, respectively, and continued until 28th day (two-time a week). The passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests were used for evaluation of fear and spatial memory formation. The in-vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) was evaluated by field-potential recording, paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and input-output (I/O) curve which were monitored as indexes for evaluation of short-term plasticity (STP) and basal-synaptic transmission (BST), respectively. The 2VO decreased PPR at inter-stimuli interval (ISI) 10 ms and BST, but injection of PRP in both treated groups rescued the PPR and BST depression. In addition, the induction of LTP, fear and spatial memory performance decreased in the 2VO + V group. However, early treatment, but not late, recovered LTP and memory. The PPR and BST improved with early and late treatment; therefore, the number and time of injection seem to be not important for recovery of BST. However, we found that LTP and memory loss rescued only with early administration. Hence, timely injection, before development of the disease, or number of injections could be critical.","Bayat, Mahnaz; Zabihi, Shahrbanoo; Karbalaei, Narges; Haghani, Masoud",Brain research bulletin,128,1

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach using long myotomy and fundopexy for NEMD. METHODS The VATS approach using myotomy and fundopexy was performed for 4 patients of NEMD between 2005 and 2008. A total of 4 patients with NEMD that underwent treatment at our institution were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The patients included 2 males and 2 females with a median age of 48 years (range 21-74 years). The median duration of NEMD symptoms was 58 months (range 4-108 months). Dysphagia was a primary symptom in all patients. Chest pain was a primary symptom in 3 of 4 patients (75 %). Treatment with medication was attempted before the operation. The median operative time was 344.5 min (range 210-476 min). The median time before starting oral feeding was 2.5 days (range 2-22 days).

Literature shows how nursing work is particularly stressful and how this condition is closely connected to the development of anxiety disorders, sleep quality and can also influence eating behavior with consequent variations in BMI values. OBJECTIVE The study aims to investigate and correlate the levels of anxiety, insomnia and Body Mass Index among nurses directly involved in the care of patients in the intensive care units with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHOD An observatory study was conducted assessing and correlating the anxiety and insomnia levels and BMI values of each nurse before (until December 2019) and during (until May 2020) the pandemic. RESULTS In total, 291 Italian nurses joined the study. There are no statistically significant differences between female nurses and male nurses for both groups of participants with or without anxiety (p=0.655). Female nurses with mild, moderate and severe insomnia levels were statistically more numerous than male nurses (p=0.025). For the same BMI differences, the levels of anxiety and insomnia were statistically significant between them (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Nurses engaged in the treatment of the most serious patients with Covid-19 are subjected to very high levels of stress due to the nature of the nursing job, shifting, poor rest, anxiety due to health emergency period and weight gain.","Vitale, Elsa; Mea, Rocco; Di Dio, Francesca; Canonico, Anna; Galatola, Vito","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",128,1

We adapted NOTES to perform transvaginal NOTES-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in living donors. OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of this procedure and compare it with conventional laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From July 2009 to October 2010, 20 women underwent transvaginal NOTES-assisted living donor nephrectomy (LDN) in our centre. We compared the prospectively collected clinical data of each donor with those of a contemporaneous matched pair of conventional LLDNs (40 donors). SURGICAL PROCEDURE The procedure was performed using three abdominal trocars and one trocar through the vaginal wall. MEASUREMENTS Variables evaluated for donors were procedure length, blood loss, warm ischaemia time (WIT), complications, hospital stay, and first-month creatinine nadir. In the transvaginal LDN group, sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire before and after surgery. Variables evaluated for recipients were complications, graft function, and creatinine evolution. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The procedure was completed in all cases. Operative variables were similar for both groups except for WIT, which was longer in the transvaginal LDN group (p<0.001) without consequences for graft functioning. One transvaginal LDN case had postoperative bleeding requiring immediate open surgery. All transvaginal LDN donors reported unaltered sexual function after surgery and satisfaction with the results. All recipients had immediate urine output, and all had a functioning graft at last follow-up except for one recipient of the transvaginal LDN group who required transplantectomy. Despite promising results, randomised controlled studies with longer follow-up are warranted to further elucidate the potential of this novel technique. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal NOTES-assisted LDN appears to be a feasible and reproducible surgical technique. The WIT was longer in the transvaginal group, and there was no effect on graft function after the short follow-up.","Alcaraz, Antonio; Musquera, Mireia; Peri, Lluis; Izquierdo, Laura; García-Cruz, Eduard; Huguet, Jorge; Alvarez-Vijande, Ricardo; Campistol, Josep M; Oppenheimer, Federico; Ribal, Maria J",European urology,128,1

The results indicate that both provinces have carried out better control of the infected, but there are still differences in the intensity of control for people who need close observation. Especially in Chongqing, the estimated strength is significantly smaller than that in Guizhou. Furthermore, qualitative evaluations on the epidemic of COVID-19 under different PCIs scenarios suggest that containment strategy is still necessary to ensure the safety of resumption of work and school, and quarantining the city of Wuhan is an important and effective containment strategy to reduce the epidemic in other provinces.","Dai, Chen Xi; Yang, Jing; Wang, Kai Fa",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,128,1

Semi-structured in-depth interviews with leading UK-based OE researchers, and a survey of UK-based OE researchers were conducted. Seven leading researchers were interviewed, and there were 54 survey respondents. Key reported challenges for OE were diminishing resources during recent decades, influenced by social, economic and political drivers, and changing fashions in research policy. Consequently, the community is getting smaller and less influential. These challenges may have negatively affected OE research, causing it to fail to keep pace with recent methodological development and impacting its output of high-quality research. Better communication with, and support from other researchers and relevant policy and funding stakeholders was identified as the main facilitators to OE research. Many diseases were initially discovered in workplaces, as these make exceptionally good study populations to accurately assess exposures. Due to the decline of manufacturing industry, there is a perception that occupational diseases are now a thing of the past. Nevertheless, new occupational exposures remain under-evaluated and the UK has become reliant on overseas epidemiology. This has been exacerbated by the decline in the academic occupational medicine base. Maintaining UK-based OE research is hence necessary for the future development of occupational health services and policies for the UK workforce.","Sweity, Samaher; Sutton, Chris; Downe, Soo; Balaam, Marie-Clare; McElvenny, Damien M",Health policy,128,14

This paper proposes a modified Wells-Riley model for risk analysis in public transportation systems to capture the passenger flow characteristics, including spatial and temporal patterns, in the number of boarding and alighting passengers, and in number of infectors. The model is used to assess overall risk as a function of origin–destination flows, actual operations, and factors such as mask-wearing and ventilation. The model is integrated with a microscopic simulation model of subway operations (SimMETRO). Using actual data from a subway system, a case study explores the impact of different factors on transmission risk, including mask-wearing, ventilation rates, infectiousness levels of disease, and carrier rates. In general, mask-wearing and ventilation are effective under various demand levels, infectiousness levels, and carrier rates. Mask-wearing is more effective in mitigating risks. Impacts from operations and service frequency are also evaluated, emphasizing the importance of maintaining reliable, frequent operations in lowering transmission risks. Risk spatial patterns are also explored, highlighting locations of higher risk.","Zhou, Jiali Koutsopoulos Haris N.",Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board,128,16

Here, we investigated the role of the parasite’s nuclear receptor, Ss-DAF-12, in governing infection. We identified Δ7-DA as the endogenous Ss-DAF-12 ligand and elucidated the hormone’s biosynthetic pathway. Genetic loss of function of the ligand’s rate-limiting enzyme demonstrated that Δ7-DA synthesis is necessary for parasite reproduction, whereas its absence is required for development of infectious larvae. Availability of the ligand permits Ss-DAF-12 to function as an on/off switch governing autoinfection, making it vulnerable to therapeutic intervention. In a preclinical model of hyperinfection, pharmacologic activation of DAF-12 suppressed autoinfection and markedly reduced lethality. Moreover, when Δ7-DA was administered with ivermectin, the current but limited drug of choice for treating strongyloidiasis, the combinatorial effects of the two drugs resulted in a near cure of the disease.","Wang, Zhu; Cheong, Mi Cheong; Tsien, Jet; Deng, Heping; Qin, Tian; Stoltzfus, Jonathan D.

The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal domain to block the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosome to inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the SL1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique strategy of unleashing a virus’ own virulence mechanism against itself could force a critical trade off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.","Vora, Setu M.; Fontana, Pietro; Leger, Valerie; Zhang, Ying; Fu, Tian-Min; Lieberman, Judy; Gehrke, Lee; Shi, Ming; Wang, Longfei; Wu, Hao",bioRxiv,128,16

Continuous monitoring of the virus has become a cornerstone to make rational decisions on implementing societal and sanitary measures to curtail the virus spread. Additionally, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have increased the need for genomic surveillance to detect particular strains because of their potentially increased transmissibility, pathogenicity and immune escape. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing of wastewater has been explored as an epidemiological surveillance method for the competent authorities. Few quality criteria are however available when sequencing wastewater samples, and those available typically only pertain to constructing the consensus genome sequence. Multiple variants circulating in the population can however be simultaneously present in wastewater samples. The performance, including detection and quantification of low-abundant variants, of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the detection and quantification of mutations present at low abundances using the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (alpha variant) defining mutations as a case study. Real sequencing data were in silico modified by introducing mutations of interest into raw wild-type sequencing data, or by mixing wild-type and mutant raw sequencing data, to mimic wastewater samples subjected to WGS using a tiling amplicon-based targeted metagenomics approach and Illumina sequencing. As anticipated, higher variation, lower sensitivity and more false negatives, were observed at lower coverages and allelic frequencies. We found that detection of all low-frequency variants at an abundance of 10%, 5%, 3% and 1%, requires at least a sequencing coverage of 250X, 500X, 1500X and 10,000X, respectively. Although increasing variability of estimated allelic frequencies at decreasing coverages and lower allelic frequencies was observed, its impact on reliable quantification was limited. This study provides a highly sensitive low-frequency variant detection approach, which is publicly available at https://galaxy.sciensano.be, and specific recommendations for minimum sequencing coverages to detect clade-defining mutations at specific allelic frequencies.","Van Poelvoorde, L.

Since the outbreak of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a key question has focused on whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells stimulated during acute infection give rise to long-lived memory T cells3. Using spectral flow cytometry combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing we longitudinally characterize individual SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 patients from acute infection to one year into recovery and find a distinct signature identifying long-lived memory CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells persisting one year after acute infection re-express CD45RA and interleukin-7 receptor α (CD127), upregulate T cell factor-1 (TCF1), and maintain low CCR7, thus resembling CD45RA+ effector-memory T (TEMRA) cells. Tracking individual clones of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, we reveal that an interferon signature marks clones giving rise to long-lived cells, whereas prolonged proliferation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling are associated with clone contraction and disappearance. Collectively, we identify a transcriptional signature differentiating short-from long-lived memory CD8+ T cells following an acute virus infection in humans.","Adamo, Sarah; Michler, Jan; Zurbuchen, Yves; Cervia, Carlo; Taeschler, Patrick; Raeber, Miro E.; Sain, Simona Baghai; Nilsson, Jakob; Moor, Andreas E.; Boyman, Onur",bioRxiv,128,17

Experience report: the teaching methodology used by FPS is problem-based learning, which greatly facilitated the non-discontinuity of theoretical activities carried out in-person in tutorial sessions involving a tutor and 10 to 12 students. This format was transferred to Webex Meetings rooms and held remotely. Practical laboratory activities were suspended and resumed when allowed in July. The teaching outpatient activities (third and fourth year) were suspended and resumed in August. Two years of internship were interrupted for 30 days (fifth year) and for 15 days (sixth year). External activities of practices in primary care were also suspended and resumed gradually. All assessments and activities that required face-to-face meetings, integrations, scientific initiation program orientations, collegiate meetings, meetings of the self-assessment committee were and are being carried out remotely. Conclusions: we believe that we were able to mitigate impairment in students' learning without compromising the conclusion of the school year that was facilitated by Problem Based Learning method.","Falbo, Gilliatt Hanois; Araújo, Carla Adriane Leal de; Souza, Edvaldo da Silva",Rev.

Many businesses and institutions need ways to account for their attendees on a daily basis, but COVID-19 has created a rift in some of the normal ways that this can be done while abiding by social distancing rules and maintaining proper sanitation of objects and devices. In this study, we propose a zero-effort and zero-interaction approach, especially for being in the midst of a pandemic, as well as a probable solution for well beyond the pandemic due to this system's ease of use. This paper utilizes a Wi-Fi-enabled device (e.g., smartphone) and access points to calculate a user's location within a building and account for its activeness to consider a user's social distancing or not.

Although various modified procedures using a circular stapler for esophagojejunostomy have been reported, an optimal technique has not yet been established. In addition, in intracorporeal techniques, twisting of the esophagojejunostomy, which might be the cause of stenosis, is often encountered because application of the shaft is restricted. To prevent twisting of the esophagoejunostomy, we underwent LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located at the left side of the patient. METHODOLOGY From November 2013 to November 2014, a series of 9 patients underwent LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), whose efferent loop was located at the left side of the patient. RESULTS No twisting of the esophagojejunostomy was encountered in all cases. In addition, no stenosis or leakage of the esophagojejunostomy occurred.

The serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), troponin I (TnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and myoglobin (MYO) were measured. RESULTS CK, LDH and AST levels in patients were higher than those of control group (P < 0.01); furthermore, among patients the levels were higher in fatal cases than in survivors. The positive rates of TnI, CK-MB and MYO in patients were higher than those in controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The patients with SARS are subject to complicating myocardiac injury.

Quantitative numerical methods like Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been used on QSAR to establish correlations between molecular properties and bioactivity. However, ANN may be advantageous over PLS because it considers the interrelations of the modeled variables. This study focused on the HIV-1 Protease (HIV-1 Pr) inhibitors belonging to the peptidomimetic class of compounds. The main objective was to select molecular descriptors with the best predictive value for antiviral potency (Ki). PLS and ANN were used to predict Ki activity of HIV-1 Pr inhibitors and the results were compared. To address the issue of dimensionality reduction, Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used for variable selection and their performance was compared against that of ANN. Finally, the structure of the optimum ANN achieving the highest Pearson's-R coefficient was determined. On the basis of Pearson's-R, PLS and ANN were compared to determine which exhibits maximum performance. Training and validation of models was performed on 15 random split sets of the master dataset consisted of 231 compounds. For each compound 192 molecular descriptors were considered. The molecular structure and constant of inhibition (Ki) were selected from the NIAID database. Study findings suggested that non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobicity, shape and hydrogen bonding describe well the antiviral activity of the HIV-1 Pr compounds.

Stool samples have been shown to be appropriate for diagnostic testing for SARS CoV, although it has been recognized to be a heterogeneous and difficult sample that contains amplification inhibitors. Limited information on the efficiency of extraction methods for the purification and concentration of SARS CoV RNA from stool samples is available. Our study objectives were to determine the optimal extraction method for SARS CoV RNA detection and to examine the effect of increased specimen volume for the detection of SARS CoV RNA in stool specimens. We conducted a multicenter evaluation of four automated and four manual extraction methods using dilutions of viral lysate in replicate mock stool samples, followed by quantitation of SARS CoV RNA using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The sensitivities of the manual methods ranged from 50% to 100%, with the Cortex Biochem Magazorb method, a magnetic bead isolation method, allowing detection of all 12 positive samples. The sensitivities of the automated methods ranged from 75% to 100%. The bioMérieux NucliSens automated extractor and miniMag extraction methods each had a sensitivity of 100%. Examination of the copy numbers detected and the generation of 10-fold dilutions of the extracted material indicated that a number of extraction methods retained inhibitory substances that prevented optimal amplification. Increasing the volume of sample input did improve detection.

Sequence analysis of the genomic RNA from the four heterologous IBV strains (M41, H120, HV10 and D207) identified nucleotide differences of up to 17% within the leader sequence and up to 4.3% within the whole of the adjacent 5' untranslated region (UTR). Analysis of the 5' ends of the rescued D-RNAs showed that the Beaudette leader sequence, present on the initial CD-61, had been replaced with the corresponding leader sequence from the helper IBV strain but the adjacent 5' UTR sequence of the rescued D-RNAs corresponded to the original CD-61 Beaudette sequence. These results demonstrated that the phenomenon of leader switching previously identified for the coronaviruses murine hepatitis virus and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) also occurred during the replication of IBV D-RNAs. Three predicted stem-loop structures were identified within the 5' UTR of IBV. Stem-loop I showed a high degree of covariance amongst the IBV strains providing phylogenetic evidence that this structure exists and is potentially involved in replication, supporting previous observations that a BCoV stem-loop homologue was essential for replication of BCoV defective interfering RNAs.","Stirrups, K; Shaw, K; Evans, S; Dalton, K; Cavanagh, D; Britton, P",The Journal of general virology,128,20

The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics (age, gender, profession, sector, medical history, and general health), COVID-19 related knowledge, and personal history of influenza vaccination. The intention to get the vaccine once it is available was directly asked, and attitudes towards the diseases and the vaccine were studied using a four-point Likert scale statement based on the health belief model's constructs. The study included 1159 HCWs; 62.9% were females, and 52.5% were between the ages of 30-49 years. The intention to get vaccinated was only 37.8% [95%CI: 35.0%-40.6%], while 31.5% were undecided, and 30.7% planned to refuse it.

This includes instructional videos with simulated patients, structured homework to document a mental status examination, structured hand-offs, and practical examinations in video format. Motivational techniques include podcasts with interviews with clinicians and patients and teaching with the use of cinematic material. DISCUSSION: Switching to online formats creates opportunities and advantages for the advancement of time- and location-independent learning. A fast conversion in this direction might also pose some disadvantages. A direct patient-student interaction is critical for engaging with transference, countertransference and situational aspects for teaching in psychosocial disciplines.

Older persons with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, hepatic impairment, renal disorders and respiratory pathologies or immune impairing conditions are more vulnerable and have a higher mortality from COVID-19. Earlier, the Indian Resuscitation Council (IRC) had proposed the Comprehensive Cardiopulmonary Life Support (CCLS) for management of cardiac arrest victims in the hospital setting. However, in patients with COVID-19, the guidelines need to be modified,due to various concerns like differing etiology of cardiac arrest, virulence of the virus, risk of its transmission to rescuers, and the need to avoid or minimize aerosolization from the patient due to various interventions. There is limited evidence in these patients, as the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infection and not much literature is available with high-level evidence related to CPR in patients of COVID-19.

However, the specific cellular mediators and inflammatory components driving diverse clinical disease outcomes remain poorly understood. We undertook longitudinal immune profiling on both whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of hospitalized patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Here, we report key immune signatures present shortly after hospital admission that were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Immune signatures were related to shifts in neutrophil to T cell ratio, elevated serum IL-6, MCP-1 and IP-10, and most strikingly, modulation of CD14+ monocyte phenotype and function. Modified features of CD14+ monocytes included poor induction of the prostaglandin-producing enzyme, COX-2, as well as enhanced expression of the cell cycle marker Ki-67. Longitudinal analysis revealed reversion of some immune features back to the healthy median level in patients with a good eventual outcome. These findings identify previously unappreciated alterations in the innate immune compartment of COVID-19 patients and lend support to the idea that therapeutic strategies targeting release of myeloid cells from bone marrow should be considered in this disease. Moreover, they demonstrate that features of an exaggerated immune response are present early after hospital admission suggesting immune-modulating therapies would be most beneficial at early timepoints.","Mann, Elizabeth R; Menon, Madhvi; Knight, Sean Blandin; Konkel, Joanne E; Jagger, Christopher; Shaw, Tovah N; Krishnan, Siddharth; Rattray, Magnus; Ustianowski, Andrew; Bakerly, Nawar Diar; Dark, Paul; Lord, Graham; Simpson, Angela; Felton, Timothy; Ho, Ling-Pei; Feldmann, Marc; Grainger, John R; Hussell, Tracy",Sci. immunol,128,10

METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database until August 12, 2020. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 software. RESULTS: 14 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that the incidence of COVID-19 patients developing DIC was 3% (95%: 1%-5%, P < 0.001). In addition, deaths were more likely to be associated with DIC (Log OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 0.94-3.99, P < 0.001) with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: DIC is associated with the severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, attention should be paid to coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.

Besides the evident health impacts, other emerging impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as water-related impacts, merits in-depth investigation. This includes strategies for the identification of these impacts and technologies to mitigate them, and to prevent further impacts not only in water ecosystems, but also in relation to human health.

A polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation. Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer, and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images, achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes.

The leap in the number of cases in Brazil has imposed a huge strain on the healthcare system. We sought to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered by pharmacy services in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency in Brazil and discuss the role of clinical pharmacists in this context. Pharmaceutical services play a key role in the emergency response to the pandemic. The pharmacy workforce has been actively working to manage drug shortages, redesign workflow, and review drug formularies/protocols to improve safety for patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). COVID-19 patients may present high risk in the use of medications and clinical pharmacists can contribute substantially as part of a multidisciplinary team to improve outcomes in drug therapy in severe and critical illness. The participation of pharmacists as members of antimicrobial stewardship programs should be enhanced to ensure appropriate and safe use of antibiotics in this context. HCPs should be encouraged to seek improvements in the performance of pharmaceutical services and innovative practices to respond to the pandemic. Further studies are needed to generate knowledge on COVID-19 to improve patient care in vulnerable populations.","Parreiras Martins, Maria Auxiliadora; Fonseca de Medeiros, Amanda; Dias Carneiro de Almeida, Claudmeire; Moreira Reis, Adriano Max",Drugs Ther Perspect,128,26

The ongoing race to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, highlights the importance of vaccination to combat infectious pathogens. The highly accessible cutaneous microenvironment is an ideal target for vaccination since the skin harbors a high density of antigen-presenting cells and immune accessory cells with broad innate immune functions. Microarray patches (MAPs) are an attractive intracutaneous biocargo delivery system that enables safe, reproducible, and controlled administration of vaccine components (antigens, with or without adjuvants) to defined skin microenvironments. This review describes the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and relevant antigenic targets for vaccination, summarizes key concepts of skin immunobiology in the context of prophylactic immunization, and presents an overview of MAP-mediated cutaneous vaccine delivery.

But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes in Africa. Our study examined associations between perceived preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare worker stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among healthcare workers in Ghana. METHODS: Healthcare workers in Ghana completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey from April to May 2020; 414 and 409 completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial scales. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors. RESULTS: The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD = 8.8), 16.3 (SD = 5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD = 15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, healthcare workers who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress (ß = -1.89, 95% CI: -3.49 to -0.30 and ß = -2.66, 95% CI: -4.48 to -0.84) and burnout (ß = -7.74, 95% CI: -11.8 to -3.64 and ß = -9.25, 95% CI: -14.1 to -4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress/burnout, accounting for about 16 to 17% of the effect. CONCLUSIONS: Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions, incentives, and health systemic changes to increase healthcare workers' morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed.","Afulani, Patience A; Gyamerah, Akua O; Nutor, Jerry J; Laar, Amos; Aborigo, Raymond A; Malechi, Hawa; Sterling, Mona; Awoonor-Williams, John K",PLoS One,128,22

Data were retrospectively collected from seven males (age 37-61 years) who were referred for inpatient rehabilitation following the stay in the ICU (14-22 days). On admission, six patients were still supported by mechanical ventilation. All patients were first placed in isolation in a special COVID unit for 6-22 days. Patients attended 11-24 treatment sessions for the duration of rehabilitation stay (13-27 days), including 6-20 sessions in the COVID unit. The treatment included pulmonary and physical rehabilitation. The initially nonventilated patient was discharged prematurely due to gallbladder problems, whereas all six mechanically ventilated patients were successfully weaned off before transfer to a COVID-free unit where they stayed for 7-19 days. At discharge, all patients increased limb muscle strength and thigh circumference, reduced activity-related dyspnea, regained functional independence and reported better quality of life. Rehabilitation plays a vital role in the recovery of seriously ill post-COVID-19 patients. Facilities should develop and implement plans for providing multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatments in various settings to recover functioning and prevent the development of long-term consequences of the COVID-19 disease.","Pancera, Simone; Bianchi, Luca N C; Porta, Roberto; Galeri, Silvia; Carrozza, Maria C; Villafañe, Jorge H",Int. j. rehabil. res,128,30

Recommendations are useful as little guidance is available for repeat testing in patients being followed expectantly for changes in disease. METHODS: A review of laboratory data of tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was performed selecting patients who had changing results. Time between changes in test results was determined to provide guidance for repeat testing. RESULTS: The Interquartile Range (IQR) of data for patients who had a negative to positive change in laboratory testing (progression) was 6-16 days (median=9 days). The IQR of data for patients who had a positive to negative change in test results (remission) was 9-21 days (median=14 days). CONCLUSION: Because sampling of the nares or nasopharynx can be variable, repeat testing should be performed swiftly when symptomatic patients are negative.

The objective was to assess COVID-19 mortality rates in patients with cancer versus patients without cancer and uncover possible statistically significant characteristics contributing to mortality. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed patients with cancer and patients without cancer who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 1 through April 30, 2020. This was a multicenter study in the state of Louisiana throughout the Ochsner Health System in both tertiary and nontertiary centers. Patients older than 18 years were eligible. Three hundred twelve patients with cancer were compared with 4833 patients without cancer. RESULTS: Mortality was found to be higher in the cancer group. Patients of advanced age with cancer had a significant increase in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; P < .001). Other significant risk factors for increased mortality were male sex (OR, 2.15), a history of chronic kidney disease (OR, 3.84), and obesity (OR, 1.30). In hospitalized patients with cancer, adverse vital signs on admission, decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, lactic acidosis, and elevated procalcitonin all seemed to increase the risk of death. Among patients with cancer, active or progressive disease (P < .001) and recent therapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.08) were shown to increase mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer have increased mortality in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer who are 65 years of age or older and those with certain comorbidities have the greatest risk of death. Recent cancer-directed therapy and disease status also seem to play roles in mortality. LAY SUMMARY: This is the largest study of patients with cancer versus patients without cancer to date and is the first multivariate analysis study comparing these 2 patient populations. This study confirms the hypothesis that patients with cancer are at increased risk for mortality and that there are multiple characteristics posing the potential to risk-stratify these patients in the setting of a future outbreak.","Lunski, Michael J; Burton, Jeffrey; Tawagi, Karine; Maslov, Diana; Simenson, Victoria; Barr, Daniel; Yuan, Helen; Johnson, Daniel; Matrana, Marc; Cole, John; Larned, Zoe; Moore, Brian",Cancer,128,16

Algae can be a source of essential micronutrients and bioactive phytochemicals, although select varieties also often contain elevated concentrations of heavy metal contaminants. Due to the effects thermal processing of foodstuffs can have on levels of nutrients, phytochemicals, and contaminants, it is important to consider the role processing has on the levels of these components in algae food products. Here, we evaluate the literature covering how different types of processing, including commercial thermal application and in-home preparation, affect constituents such as vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, pigment compounds, and metal contaminants. Overall, the literature suggests that there are optimum processing conditions and specific cooking techniques that can be used to increase retention of important nutritional components while also reducing concentrations of metal contaminants. Although further research is needed on how thermal processing affects individual compounds in algae and their ultimate bioavailability, these data should be taken into consideration in order to inform design of product processing to both increase retention of nutritional components and limit metal contaminants.","Ho, Kacie K H Y; Redan, Benjamin W",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,128,10

The study adopts critical discourse analysis (CDA) of Van Dijk's tripartite framework of news text structure and production at microstructure level and Fairclough's insights on the interactivity between language and social cognition in the process of producing and interpreting texts. The data for this study is samples of online news on COVID-19 reported in two English Saudi website;Saudi Gazette and Arab News, six from each journal. The samples cover the period between March 4 and August 14, 2020, and are purposefully chosen to understand the language of the news reports on a specific issue over a period of time. A qualitative analysis of the data is carried out so that the perceived effect of the linguistic encoding of the news events is examined. The findings show that most of the reports on COVID-19 heavily rely on foregrounding evidentiality of statistics of new and cumulative infections as well as recoveries and deaths. Evidentiality strategy often overlaps with categorization strategy as proof of the threat of the virus which is broken down into units, each with its features and evidence. Authority strategy is used to support statistics with verifiable sources. Similarly, in representing hope to the populace, two strategies of evidentiality and authority are often used. Evidentiality strategy is employed to clear off doubts through for grounding statistics of growing recoveries, comparisons and underrepresentation of infection cases and mortalities and sometimes choice of verbs plays a role in imparting hope in the residents. Authority strategy is deployed in order to give some weight to the ideology inherent in the report.","Al-Ghamdi, N. A.",Heliyon,128,26

This was primarily based on numerous reports, which stated that the RASi could increase the organ Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in rodents. RASi can theoretically antagonize the potential influence of angiotensin II (Ang II) on ACE2. However, while Ang II decreases the ACE2 levels in cultured cells, there is little evidence that supports this phenomenon in living animals. In this study, we tested whether Ang II or Ang II combined with its antagonist would alter the ACE2 and other molecules associated with the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Male C57BL6/J mice were administered vehicle, Ang II (400 ng/kg/min), or Ang II with losartan (10 mg/kg/min) for 2 weeks. ACE2 knockout mice were used as a negative control for the ACE2 assay. We found that both Ang II, which elevated blood pressure by 30 mm Hg, and Ang II with losartan, had no effect on the expression or protein activity of ACE2 in the lung, left ventricle, kidney, and ileum. Likewise, these interventions had no effect on the expression of Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Furin, proteases that facilitate the virus-cell fusion, and the expression or activity of Tumor Necrosis Factor &#945;-Convertase (TACE) that cleaves cell-surface ACE2. Collectively, physiological concentrations of Ang II do not modulate the molecules associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results support the recent observational studies suggesting that the use of RASi is not a risk factor for COVID-19.","Wang, Yu; Takeshita, Hikari; Yamamoto, Koichi; Huang, Yibin; Wang, Cheng; Nakajima, Tsuneo; Nozato, Yoichi; Fujimoto, Taku; Yokoyama, Serina; Hongyo, Kazuhiro; Nakagami, Futoshi; Akasaka, Hiroshi; Takami, Yoichi; Takeya, Yasushi; Sugimoto, Ken; Rakugi, Hiromi",FASEB J,128,31

Methods and ResultsIn 23 vaccinated subjects, we documented high anti-SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titers. Average virus neutralization by antibodies, assessed as inhibition of ACE2 binding to RBD, was 2.2-fold reduced for delta mutant vs. wt RBD. Specific CD4+ T cell responses as measured using stimulation with peptides representing wt or alpha, beta, gamma and delta variant SARS-CoV2 entire spike proteins by flow cytometric intracellular cytokine staining, did not differ significantly between vaccinees. One year post infection in one of the earliest SARS-CoV2 populations in the Western world, mean specific antibody titers were lower than in vaccinees; ACE2 binding to delta mutant vs. wt RBD was 1.65-fold reduced. T cell responses, especially interferon gamma expression, to mutant SARS-CoV2 spike were significantly reduced compared to those in vaccinees. ConclusionStrong T cell responses occurred for wildtype and mutant SARS-CoV2 variants, including delta (B.1.617.2), in fully vaccinated individuals, whereas they were partly reduced 1 year after natural infection. Antibody neutralisation of delta mutant was reduced compared to wt, as assessed in a novel inhibition assay with a finger stick drop of blood. Hence, immune responses after vaccination are stronger compared to those after naturally occurring infection, pointing out the need of the vaccine to overcome the pandemic.","Richardson, Jennifer R; Goetz, Ralph; Mayr, Vanessa; Lohse, Martin J; Holthoff, Hans-Peter; Ungerer, Martin",,128,1

METHODS: Using a retrospective, open-cohort design, we examined visit data of MOUD patients at a family medicine clinic across three identified periods: pre-COVID, COVID transition, and COVID. Outcome measures include the number and type of visits (in-person or telehealth), the number of new patients entering treatment, and the number of urine drug screens performed. Distance from patient residence to clinic was calculated to assess access to care in rural areas. Goodness-of-Fit Chi-Square tests and ANOVAs were used to identify differences between time periods. FINDINGS: Total MOUD visits increased during COVID (436 pre vs. 581 post, p < 0.001), while overall new patient visits remained constant (33 pre vs. 29 post, p = 0.755). The clinic's overall catchment area increased in size, with new patients coming primarily from rural areas. Length of time between urine drug screens increased (21.1 days pre vs. 43.5 days post, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of MOUD care utilization during this period demonstrate the effectiveness of telehealth in this area. Policy changes allowing for MOUD to be delivered via telehealth, waiving the need for in-person initiation of MOUD, and increased Medicaid compensation for MOUD may play a valuable role in improving access to MOUD during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Hughes, Phillip M; Verrastro, Genevieve; Fusco, Carriedelle Wilson; Wilson, Courtenay Gilmore; Ostrach, Bayla",J Rural Health,128,16

A retrospective study was conducted on COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan No. 1 Hospital (Hubei, China) from January 21, 2020 to March 4, 2020. A two-way ANOVA analysis was used to compare the serum CRP and SAA levels between mild group and severe group during hospitalization days. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the serum CRP, SAA levels and treatment days in recovered patients. The Logistic regression analysis and the area under curve (AUC) were calculated to determine the probability for predicting the severity and recovery of COVID-19. The severe group displayed higher CRP and SAA levels compared with the mild group during hospitalization (P&lt;0.001). Logistic regression indicated that SAA and CRP were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. The corresponding AUC of CRP and SAA values for severity of COVID-19 were 0.804 and 0.818, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed that CRP and SAA levels were negatively correlated with treatment days in recovered patients (r=-0.761, -0.795, respectively). Logistic regression demonstrated that SAA was an independent factor for predicting the recovery of COVID-19. However, CRP could not predict the recovery of COVID-19. The corresponding AUC of SAA for the recovery of COVID-19 was 0.923. The results of the present study indicated that SAA can be considered to be a biomarker for predicting the severity and recovery of COVID-19.","Fu, Jun; Huang, Pian-Pian; Zhang, Shuang; Yao, Qing Dong; Han, Rui; Liu, Hai Feng; Yang, Yi; Zhang, Dong You",Exp.

This paper draws on the concept of the triple burden in theorizing the gender divisions in productive and reproductive work and community activities in the context of disaster. Events that include famine, war, natural disaster or disease outbreak are all well documented as increasing women's vulnerability to a worsening of gendered burdens. In the case of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, this is no different. Focussing on Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia, the four vignettes in this paper serve to highlight the intersections between Covid-19 and gendered burdens, particularly in frontline work, unpaid care work and community activities. While pre-disaster gender burdens are well established as strong, our analysis during the early months of the pandemic indicates that women's burdens are escalating. We estimate that women will endure a worsening of their burdens until the pandemic is well under control, and for a long time after.

In this respect, the evaluation of shape complementarity at molecular interfaces is one of the key factors to be considered. Focusing on the peculiar case of antibody-antigen interaction, we designed a novel computational strategy based on in-silico mutagenesis of antibody binding site residues, where a Monte Carlo procedure aims at increasing the shape complementarity between the antibody paratope and a given epitope on a target protein surface. To quantify the complementarities occurring at the interface, we relied on a method we recently developed, which employs the 2D Zernike descriptors. To this end, we preliminary considered an experimental structural dataset of antibody-antigen complexes, where our method statistically identifies, in terms of shape complementarity, pairs of interacting regions from non-interacting ones. We thus constructed our protocol against a molecular region in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, already experimentally identified in interaction with antibodies in humans. We, therefore, optimized the shape of several possible template antibodies for the interaction with such a region. Lastly, we performed an independent molecular docking validation of the results of our protocol, thus evaluating also if the mutagenesis protocol introduced residues with chemical characteristics compatible with the target region.","Lauro, Alfredo De; Rienzo, Lorenzo Di; Miotto, Mattia; Olimpieri, Pier Paolo; Milanetti, Edoardo; Ruocco, Giancarlo",,128,10

However, the contribution of antibodies to protection and to the course of the disease during first-time exposure to a pathogen is unknown. We analyzed the antibodies and B cell responses in severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Despite our primary assumption that high antibody titers contribute to a mild disease, we found that severe COVID-19 illness, and not mild infection, correlates with strong anti-viral antibody and memory B cell responses. This phenomenon was also demonstrated for anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibiting antibodies that we recently isolated from an actively infected Tuberculosis-sick donor. This correlation between disease severity and antibody responses can be explained by the fact that high viral loads drive B cell stimulation and generation of high-affinity antibodies that will be protective upon future encounter with the particular pathogen.","Freund, Natalia T",Hum Vaccin Immunother,128,23

From a recovered SARS-CoV donor sample, we identify and characterize a panel of six monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with CoV spike (S) proteins from the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrate a spectrum of reactivity against other CoV. Epitope mapping reveals that these antibodies recognize multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S, including the receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S2 subunit. Functional characterization demonstrates that the antibodies mediate phagocytosis - and in some cases trogocytosis - but not neutralization in vitro. When tested in vivo in murine models, two of the antibodies demonstrate a reduction in hemorrhagic pathology in the lungs. The identification of cross-reactive epitopes recognized by functional antibodies expands the repertoire of targets for pan-coronavirus vaccine design strategies.","Shiakolas, Andrea R; Kramer, Kevin J; Wrapp, Daniel; Richardson, Simone I; Schäfer, Alexandra; Wall, Steven; Wang, Nianshuang; Janowska, Katarzyna; Pilewski, Kelsey A; Venkat, Rohit; Parks, Robert; Manamela, Nelia P; Raju, Nagarajan; Fechter, Emilee Friedman; Holt, Clinton M; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Chen, Rita E; Martinez, David R; Nargi, Rachel S; Sutton, Rachel E; Ledgerwood, Julie E; Graham, Barney S; Diamond, Michael S; Haynes, Barton F; Acharya, Priyamvada; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Baric, Ralph S; Morris, Lynn; McLellan, Jason S; Georgiev, Ivelin S",Cell Rep Med,128,14

It is documented that health-seeking behaviors change during pandemics. The objective of this study was to examine social determinants associated with decisions to seek dental care in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 4372 participants were invited to this cross-sectional web-based survey distributed from April 21 to June 20, 2020. The survey included a list of emergency, urgent, and routine dental procedures. Participants were asked if they would seek dental care for these conditions during the pandemic, and what pain severity would make them seek dental treatment. Logistic regression models were performed for predicting variables that explain the decision to go or not to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for each dental condition. RESULTS: A total of 3443 responded to this survey. The emergency dental situation participants were most willing to go to the dental clinic for was trauma involving facial bones compromising the airway (94.5%). Only 65.8% were willing to seek care for facial cellulitis compromising the airway. On average 35.2% reported seeking teleconsultation as the first step. Eighteen percent of participants were still willing to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for routine dental procedures. Multiple logistic regression showed that females (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.6, OR 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), people who had never visited a dentist (OR: 1.8, OR 95% CI 1.3, 2.5), and people living in metropolitan regions (OR: 1.8, OR 95%: 1.4, 2.3) had higher odds for not seeking emergency dental care during this pandemic. The pain threshold for seeking dental care during the pandemic was 7 out of 10. Female, those who never visited a dentist, and those from urban regions reported higher pain threshold before seeking dental care (P value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Social disparities were found in emergency dental care seeking decision-making in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was alarming that some people were afraid to seek dental care for life-threatening dental emergencies as cellulitis during this pandemic. This reflects the importance of increasing public health awareness and governmental regulations.","Meisha, Dalia E; Alsolami, Ahad Mosallem; Alharbi, Ghaliah Muslih",BMC Oral Health,128,20

Remarkably, many patient-derived antibodies that potently inhibit viral infection harbor few to no mutations from the germline, suggesting that naïve antibody libraries are a viable means for discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used a yeast surface-display library of human naïve antibodies to isolate and characterize three novel neutralizing antibodies that target the RBD: one that blocks interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and two that target other epitopes on the RBD. These three antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50 values as low as 60 ng/ml in vitro. Using a biolayer interferometry-based binding competition assay, we determined that these antibodies have distinct but overlapping epitopes with antibodies elicited during natural COVID-19 infection. Taken together, these analyses highlight how in vitro selection of naïve antibodies can mimic the humoral response in vivo, yielding neutralizing antibodies and various epitopes that can be effectively targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.","Bell, Benjamin N; Powell, Abigail E; Rodriguez, Carlos; Cochran, Jennifer R; Kim, Peter S",Protein Sci,128,26

The purpose of this study was to provide an insight of the impact of the COVID-19 on ERAS protocols for knee arthroplasty patients in a tertiary hospital and potential strategy changes for postpandemic practice. We retrospectively reviewed all cases that underwent surgery utilizing ERAS protocols in the quarter prior to the pandemic (fourth quarter of 2019) and during the first quarter of 2020 when the pandemic started. A review of the literature on ERAS protocols for knee arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic was also performed and discussed. A total of 199 knee arthroplasties were performed in fourth quarter of 2019 as compared with 76 in the first quarter of 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients who underwent surgery in the first quarter of 2020 had shorter inpatient stays (3.8 vs. 4.5 days), larger percentage of discharges by postoperative day 5 (86.8 vs. 74.9%), and a larger proportion of patients discharged to their own homes (68 vs. 54%). The overall complication rate (1.3 vs. 3%) and readmission within 30 days (2.6 vs. 2%) was similar between both groups. ERAS protocols appear to reduce hospital lengths of stay for patients undergoing knee arthroplasty without increasing the risk of short-term complications and readmissions. The beneficial effects of ERAS appear to be amplified by and are synchronous with the requirements of operating in the era of a pandemic.","Ding, Benjamin Tze Keong; Ng, Jensen; Tan, Kelvin Guoping",J. knee surg,128,16

Privacy-centric analysis treats data as private property, frames the relationship between individuals and governments as adversarial, entrenches technology platforms as gatekeepers, and supports a conception of emergency public health authority as limited by individual consent and considerable corporate influence that is in some tension with the more communitarian values that typically inform public health ethics.

This is their sole purpose, to provide a presence and space to meet individual need and promote healing, even when cure isn't possible. Their value is priceless to families in desperate times. However, despite growing evidence for their impact, chaplains are commonly undervalued and misunderstood by their organisations, and the global pandemic revealed the consequences of this confusion. Whilst some chaplains were applauded as heroes along with their fellow health colleagues, others were seen as little more than an infection risk. A survey was designed to capture and learn from the full range of chaplain experiences of the impact of the pandemic across the globe. In June 2020, 1657 chaplains responded from 36 countries. They all experienced considerable disruption to their usual practice, with enforced social distancing having the biggest impact. Out of necessity they embraced technology to maintain contact with patients and families, and shifted focus of their support to staff. Whilst some chaplains were viewed as essential employees by their organisations, most were not. Despite the majority thinking that their organisations understood what they did, chaplains themselves were neither clear or unclear about their role during and post pandemic. More surprisingly, they felt similarly unclear about their role before the pandemic.

METHODS: We included 54 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean interval between the initial and follow-up CT scans was 7.82±3.74 days. Patients were divided into progression and recovery groups according to their outcomes. We evaluated CT images in terms of distribution of lesions and imaging manifestations. The manifestations included ground-glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, irregular line, and air bronchogram sign. RESULTS: COVID-19 lesions showed mainly subpleural distribution, which was accompanied by bronchovascular bundle distribution in nearly 30% of the patients. The lower lobes of both lungs were the most commonly involved. In the follow-up, the progression group showed more involvement of the upper lobe of the left lung than the recovery group. GGO was the most common sign. As the disease progressed, round GGO decreased and patchy GGO increased. On follow-up CT, consolidation increased in the progression group while decreasing in the recovery group. Air bronchogram sign was more commonly observed at the initial examination (90.9%) than at follow-up (30%) in the recovery group, but there was no significant change in the progression group. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were absent in the initial examination, but pleural effusion was observed in three cases after follow-up.

The virus is distinct from its cousins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of severity of the infection. The obligated killing properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mediated by its unique structure. Efforts for developing vaccines for COVID-19 are ongoing, but it is unlikely to be available in the immediate future. Due to the absence of precise treatment, the investigators are discovering other effective, protective, and healing choices. However, the lower than a predictable number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries with fragile health systems is mystifying. Recently, there has been a buzz about the protective effect of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine in COVID-19 through long-term boosting of trained immunity. Based on epidemiological correlations, we link up that BCG vaccination adopted by different countries might influence the SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns and/or COVID-19 associated mortality through the vaccine's capacity to confer heterologous protection. A number of clinical studies are underway to investigate this possibility but even if they prove effective-many questions will remain. Moreover, responsible stewardship of the BCG vaccine in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic is directly needed.","Islam, Md Zahurul; Zahan, Md Kudrat-E; Al-Bari, Md Abdul Alim",J. med. virol,128,26

This scientific note brings reflections on the trajectory of the Conselho Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional, the repercussions of its extinction in the last year, and the project to dismantle social protection policies in Brazil, with serious consequences at a time when the country is going through a crisis in public health due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The absence of the Conselho Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional and the weakening of the set of policies for Food and Nutritional Security has mobilized the civil society to defend the human rights to food, food sovereignty, and to democracy itself. The resistance of the different social movements in order to maintain the spaces of civil participation related to Food and Nutrition Security public policies are still going to be long and arduous, demanding the continued vocalization and strengthening of partnership networks within the different movements of the organized civil society. Finally, we highlight the urgent need for restoration of the National System of Food and Nutritional Security (Sistema Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional) with all its instances, and of other social policies, so that the negative consequences of the pandemic are avoided or mitigated and the State complies with its obligations to guarantee the rights of the Brazilian population.","RECINE, Elisabetta; FAGUNDES, Andhressa; SILVA, Barbara Leone; GARCIA, Giselle Silva; RIBEIRO, Rita de Cássia Lisboa; GABRIEL, Cristine Garcia",Rev.

We report that FACS-sorted rods and cones both express Cx36 but no other connexins. We created rod- and cone-specific Cx36 knockout mice to dissect the photoreceptor network. In the wild type, Cx36 plaques at rod/cone contacts accounted for more than 95% of photoreceptor labeling and paired recordings showed the transjunctional conductance between rods and cones was ~300 pS. When Cx36 was eliminated on one side of the gap junction, in either conditional knockout, Cx36 labeling and rod/cone coupling were almost abolished. We could not detect direct rod/rod coupling, and cone/cone coupling was minor. Rod/cone coupling is so prevalent that indirect rod/cone/rod coupling via the network may account for previous reports of rod coupling.","Jin, Nange; Zhang, Zhijing; Keung, Joyce; Youn, Sean B; Ishibashi, Munenori; Tian, Lian-Ming; Marshak, David W; Solessio, Eduardo; Umino, Yumiko; Fahrenfort, Iris; Kiyama, Takae; Mao, Chai-An; You, Yanan; Wei, Haichao; Wu, Jiaqian; Postma, Friso; Paul, David L; Massey, Stephen C; Ribelayga, Christophe P",Sci.

Herein, we reported an approach to encapsulate native anti-inflammatory proteins in wind chimes like cyclodextrin (WCC) for efficient oral protein delivery. The amphiphilic WCC can self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solution and achieve superior encapsulation of two antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) by simply mixing with protein solution, avoiding any extra cumbersome steps that might inactivate protein. WCC nanovehicles can effectively protect enzyme activity and enhance their intracellular delivery. SOD and CAT co-loaded WCC nanoparticles (SC/WCC) can integrate the synergistic effect of SOD and CAT for enhancing the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), effectively inhibit the inflammatory response by reducing the secretion of proinflammatory factors and protect cells from ROS-induced oxidative damage. In the mouse colitis model, SC/WCC administered orally was able to efficiently accumulate in the inflamed colon, significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators and notably alleviated the symptoms related to colitis. Therefore, we believe that the strategies we described here may provide a convenient and powerful platform for the treatment of other inflammatory diseases.","Zeng, Zhiying; He, Xiao; Li, Changying; Lin, Shan; Chen, Hui; Liu, Libing; Feng, Xuli",Biomaterials,128,1

A standardized procedure analogous to algorithms for mass casualty incidents (MCI) is lacking. METHODS: Based on a case report and the literature, the authors present a management strategy for infectious MCI during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and distinguish it from traumatic MCI deployment tactics. RESULTS: This management strategy can be divided into three phases, beginning with the acute emergency response including triage, stabilization of critical patients, and transport of patients requiring hospitalization. Phase 2 involves securing the facility's operational readiness, or housing residents elsewhere in case staff are infected or quarantined to a relevant degree. Phase 3 marks the return to regular operations. DISCUSSION: Phase 1 is based on usual MCI principles, phase 2 on hospital crisis management. Avoiding evacuation of residents to relieve hospitals is an important operational objective. The lack of mission and training experience with such situations, the limited applicability of established triage algorithms, and the need to coordinate a large number of participants pose challenges. CONCLUSION: This strategic model offers a practical, holistic approach to the management of infectious mass casualty scenarios in nursing facilities.","Schreiber, Wolfgang; Wolf, Philipp; Bigalke, Nicole; Bigalke, Marc U; Graf, Bernhard M; Dittmar, Michael S",Med.

This study contributes by reporting and analysing data from a national survey conducted in line with UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommendations and standard methods, providing an internationally comparable pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) snapshot of food insecurity. METHODS: Data came from a nationally representative 2019 UK sample (N = 2000) surveyed by Ipsos-Mori. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using the UN FAO Food Insecurity Experience Scale. Logistic regression was used to model food insecurity in relation to geographic and socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: Severe food insecurity was reported by 3% of the sample, an increase of 66.7% over the last directly comparable UK analysis (Gallup World Poll data from 2016 to 2018). Indication of some degree of food insecurity was reported by 14.2% of the sample and tended to be higher amongst younger age groups, those on lower incomes, and home renters (as opposed to owners). No geographic variables were significantly associated with food insecurity prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that prevalence of severe food insecurity was already increasing before the COVID-19 pandemic, across all areas of the UK, is cause for concern.

Accurate contact detection and contact location estimation are of critical importance for soft robot modeling, control, trajectory planning, and eventually affect the success of task completion. In this article, we focus on the investigation of a one degree of freedom (1-DoF) soft pneumatic bending robot, which is regarded as one of the fundamental components to construct complex, multi-DoFs soft robots. This 1-DoF soft robot is modeled through the integral representation of the spatial curve, where direct and instantaneous kinematics are calculated explicitly through a modal method. The fixed centrode deviation method is used to detect the external contact and estimate the contact location. Simulation results and experimental studies indicate that the contact location can be accurately estimated by solving a nonlinear least-square optimization problem. Experimental validation shows that the proposed algorithm is able to successfully estimate the contact location with the estimation error of 1.46 mm.","Chen, Yue; Wang, Long; Galloway, Kevin; Godage, Isuru; Simaan, Nabil; Barth, Eric",Soft robot.

Therefore, the investigation of endogenous pathways leading to resolution of inflammation is of interest to uncover strategies for mitigating inflammation in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This becomes particularly urgent in individuals with preexisting pathologies characterized by chronic respiratory inflammation and prone to bacterial infection, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we analyzed the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virion spike 1 glycoprotein (S1) of macrophages (M&#934;) from volunteers with and without CF and tested the efficacy of resolvins (Rv) D1 and D2 in regulating the inflammatory and antimicrobial functions of M&#934; exposed to S1. S1 significantly increased chemokine release, including interleukin (IL)-8, in CF and non-CF M&#934;, while it enhanced IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; in non-CF M&#934;, but not in CF cells. S1 also triggered the biosynthesis of RvD1 and modulated microRNAs miR-16, miR-29a, and miR-103, known to control the inflammatory responses.

METHODS: Secondary analysis from the PRoVENT-COVID study. The PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicenter, retrospective observational study done at 22 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The aim was to quantify the dynamics and determine the prognostic value of surrogate markers of wasted ventilation in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. RESULTS: A total of 927 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19-related ARDS were included in this study. Estimations of wasted ventilation such as the estimated dead space fraction (by Harris-Benedict and direct method) and ventilatory ratio were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors at baseline and during the following days of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio was lower in non-survivors than in survivors (p < 0.001). As ARDS severity increased, mortality increased with successive tertiles of dead space fraction by Harris-Benedict and by direct estimation, and with an increase in the VR. The same trend was observed with decreased levels in the tertiles for the end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio. After adjustment for a base risk model that included chronic comorbidities and ventilation- and oxygenation-parameters, none of the dead space estimates measured at the start of ventilation or the following days were significantly associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant impairment of ventilation in the early course of COVID-19-related ARDS but quantification of this impairment does not add prognostic information when added to a baseline risk model.

This is in stark contrast with the pandemic-time situation. Many governments, at least initially, listened to the recommendations of expert advisers, most notably public health authorities, who proceeded from considerations of equality and common good. I suggest that we should continue on this path when the immediate threat of the disease is over. Other crises are already ongoing-poverty, conflicts, climate change, financial bubbles, and so on-and it would be good to use expert knowledge rather than interests and ideologies in dealing with them.

The standard process of introduction of a new drug into a market involves a lot of clinical trials and tests. This is a tedious and time consuming process and also involves a lot of monetary resources. The faster approval of a drug helps the patients who are in need of the drug. The in silico prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions can help speed up the aforementioned process. The challenges involved are lack of negative data present and predicting ADR from just the chemical structure. Although many models are already available to predict ADR, most of the models use biological activities identifiers, chemical and physical properties in addition to chemical structures of the drugs. But for most of the new drugs to be tested, only chemical structures will be available. The performance of the existing models predicting ADR only using chemical structures is not efficient. Therefore, an efficient prediction of ADRs from just the chemical structure has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method involves a separate model for each ADR, making it a binary classification problem. This paper presents a novel CNN model called Drug Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to predict ADRs using chemical structures of the drugs. The performance is measured using the metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specificity, F1 score, AUROC and MCC. The results obtained by the proposed DCNN model outperform the competing models on the SIDER4.1 database in terms of all the metrics. A case study has been performed on a COVID-19 recommended drugs, where the proposed model predicted the ADRs that are well aligned with the observations made by medical professionals using conventional methods.","Mantripragada, Anjani Sankar; Teja, Sai Phani; Katasani, Rohith Reddy; Joshi, Pratik; Masilamani, V; Ramesh, Raj",J Bioinform Comput Biol,128,16

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature on COVID-19-associated neuroradiological findings and examine the prevalence of different findings in patients with both severe and mild COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed. Any studies reporting CT or MRI neuroimaging findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Patient demographics, main radiological findings, neurological symptoms, and severity of COVID-19 infection were tabulated and quantified according to infection severity. RESULTS: Sixty-one studies published between 2019 and 2020 comprising 711 patients were analyzed according to severity of respiratory symptoms. The main neuroradiological findings for patients with mild classification were cranial nerve abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and white matter abnormalities, while the main findings in patients with severe classification were white matter abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSION: Neuroradiological manifestations in COVID-19 infection are highly heterogeneous and differ based on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Cranial nerve abnormalities appear exclusive to mild infection, with a high degree of olfactory tract involvement, while hemorrhagic events are more common in severe infection. Notably, ischemic infarction was equally prevalent in both mild and severe COVID-19 infection.

In the present study, Solea senegalensis juveniles were exposed under laboratory conditions to contaminated whole-sediments for 7 and 28 days. Sediments were obtained from a low to moderately polluted estuary, a highly polluted harbour and from the mixture of both field-collected sediments. Biometry data were recorded. Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour's sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour's sediment. The Integrative Biomarker Response index (IBR/n) evidenced that exposure to the three sediments caused an impact of diverse magnitude in sole health (IBR/nHarbour > IBR/nMixture > IBR/nEstuary). The magnitude of biological responses essentially depended on the presence of contaminants in source sediments, which seemed to be altered by the conditions imposed by whole-sediment toxicity assays.","Briaudeau, Tifanie; Zorita, Izaskun; Izagirre, Urtzi; Marigómez, Ionan",Sci Total Environ,128,1

In Canada, there is limited data to quantify and characterize this issue. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study by distributing online surveys to physicians across Ontario. The survey included three sections: provider characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, and impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood immunization services. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with modification of immunization services. RESULTS: A total of 475 respondents answered the survey from May 27th to July 3rd 2020, including 189 family physicians and 286 pediatricians. The median proportion of in-person visits reported by physicians before the pandemic was 99% and dropped to 18% during the first wave of the pandemic in Ontario. In total, 175 (44.6%) of the 392 respondents who usually provide vaccination to children acknowledged a negative impact caused by the pandemic on their immunization services, ranging from temporary closure of their practice (n = 18; 4.6%) to postponement of vaccines in certain age groups (n = 103; 26.3%). Pediatricians were more likely to experience a negative impact on their immunization services compared to family physicians (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.48-4.68), as well as early career physicians compared to their more senior colleagues (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.30-5.56), whereas physicians from suburban settings were less impacted than physicians from urban settings (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39-0.99). Some of the proposed solutions to decreased immunization services included assistance in accessing personal protective equipment, dedicated centers or practices for vaccination, universal centralized electronic immunization records and education campaigns for parents. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has caused substantial modifications to pediatric immunization services across Ontario. Strategies to mitigate barriers to immunizations during the pandemic need to be implemented in order to avoid immunity gaps that could lead to an eventual increase in vaccine preventable diseases.","Piché-Renaud, Pierre-Philippe; Ji, Catherine; Farrar, Daniel S; Friedman, Jeremy N; Science, Michelle; Kitai, Ian; Burey, Sharon; Feldman, Mark; Morris, Shaun K",Vaccine,128,12

Studies are focused on developing new strategies through novel chemo- and immuno-therapeutic drug targets. Different types of oncogenes such as MYCN, tumor suppressor genes such as p53, and some structural genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor are considered as targets for neuroblastoma therapy. The individual expression patterns in NB cells make them appropriate for this purpose. The combined effect of nano-drug delivery systems and specific drug targets will result in lower systemic side effects, prolonged therapeutic effects, and improvements in the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs. Some of these novel drug delivery systems with a focus on liposomes as carriers are also discussed. In this review, genes and protein products that are beneficial as drug targets in the treatment of neuroblastoma have been discussed.","Mobasheri, Taranom; Rayzan, Elham; Shabani, Mahsima; Hosseini, Mina; Mahmoodi Chalbatani, Ghanbar; Rezaei, Nima",J. cell. physiol,128,29

Participants completed the measures of background characteristics, exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 health worries, subjective accelerated aging and COVID-19-based peritraumatic distress.ResultsHigher levels of COVID-19 health worries were correlated with higher levels of peritraumatic distress symptoms among older adults. Moreover, those reporting accelerated aging also reported a higher level of peritraumatic distress. Finally, the interaction between COVID-19 health worries and subjective accelerated aging predicted peritraumatic distress, suggesting that COVID-19 worries were associated with peritraumatic distress to a stronger degree among older adults who felt they were aging faster.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that negative views of aging may serve as an amplifying factor for traumatic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although preliminary, the findings provide insight for potential screening and interventions of older adults at risk of developing peritraumatic distress symptoms during the global pandemic.","Lee, Greenblatt-Kimron Ring Lia Hoffman Yaakov Shrira Amit Bodner Ehud Palgi Yuval",Global Mental Health,128,29

HCWs were challenged with new guidelines and practices to protect themselves from occupational risks. AIM: To determine whether hand hygiene behaviour by real-time measurement was related to the dynamic of the epidemic, and the type of patient being cared for in France. METHODS: This study used an automated hand hygiene recording system to measure HCW hand hygiene on entry to and exit from patient rooms throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation between hand hygiene compliance and COVID-19 epidemiological data was analysed. Analysis of variance was performed to compare compliance rate during the different periods of the epidemic. FINDINGS: HCW hand hygiene rate on room entry decreased over time; on room exit, it increased by 13.73% during the first wave of COVID-19, decreased by 9.87% during the post-lockdown period, then rebounded by 2.82% during the second wave of the epidemic. Hand hygiene during patient care and hand hygiene on room exit had a positive relationship with the local COVID-19 epidemic; conversely, hand hygiene on room entry did not depend on the trend of the epidemic, nor on nursing of COVID-19 patients, and it decreased over time. CONCLUSION: HCWs modified their behaviours to face the risk propensity of the pandemic. However, to improve the poor compliance at room entry, reducing confusion between the hand hygiene recommendation and glove recommendation may be necessary; disinfection of gloving hands might solve this issue.","Huang, F; Armando, M; Dufau, S; Florea, O; Brouqui, P; Boudjema, S",J Hosp Infect,128,20

As these characteristics easily lead to global pandemics, studying the evolutionary relationship between viruses is essential for clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing has played an important role in evolutionary analysis. Recent alignment-free methods can overcome the problems of traditional alignment-based methods, which consume both time and space. This paper proposes a novel alignment-free method called the correlation coefficient feature vector (CCFV), which defines a correlation measure of the L-step delay of a nucleotide location from its location in the original DNA sequence. The numerical feature is a 16 × L-dimensional numerical vector describing the distribution characteristics of the nucleotide positions in a DNA sequence. The proposed L-step delay correlation measure is interestingly related to some types of L + 1 spaced mers. Unlike traditional gene comparison, our method avoids the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment, and hence improves the speed of sequence comparison. Our method is applied to evolutionary analysis of the common human viruses including SARS-CoV-2, Dengue virus, Hepatitis B virus, and human rhinovirus and achieves the same or even better results than alignment-based methods. Especially for SARS-CoV-2, our method also confirms that bats are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","He, Lily Sun Siyang Zhang Qianyue Bao Xiaona Li Peter K.","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",128,16

However, there are hardly any published independent safety data on KN95 masks. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the seal, fit and filtration efficiency of several brands of KN95 masks marketed for widespread use in SA healthcare facilities, using standardised testing protocols. METHODS: The verifiability of manufacturer and technical details was first ascertained, followed by evaluation of the number of layers comprising the mask material. The testing protocol involved a directly observed positive and negative pressure user seal check, which if passed was followed by qualitative fit testing (sodium saccharin) in healthy laboratory or healthcare workers. Quantitative fit testing (3M) was used to validate the qualitative fit testing method. The filtration efficacy and integrity of the mask filter material were evaluated using a particle counter-based testing rig utilising aerosolised saline (expressed as filtration efficacy of 0.3 µm particles). Halyard FLUIDSHIELD 3 N95 and 3M 1860 N95 masks were used as controls. RESULTS: Twelve KN95 mask brands (total of 36 masks) were evaluated in 7 participants. The mask type and manufacturing details were printed on only 2/12 brands (17%) as per National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and European Union regulatory requirements. There was considerable variability in the number of KN95 mask layers (between 3 and 6 layers in the 12 brands evaluated). The seal check pass rate was significantly lower in KN95 compared with N95 masks (1/36 (3%) v. 12/12 (100%); p&lt;0.0001). Modification of the KN95 ear-loop tension using head straps or staples, or improving the facial seal using Micropore 3M tape, enhanced seal test performance in 15/36 KN95 masks evaluated (42%). However, none of these 15 passed downstream qualitative fit testing compared with the control N95 masks (0/15 v. 12/12; p&lt;0.0001). Only 4/8 (50%) of the KN95 brands tested passed the minimum filtration requirements for an N95 mask (suboptimal KN95 filtration efficacy varied from 12% to 78%, compared with 56% for a surgical mask and &gt;99% for the N95 masks at the 0.3 µm particle size). CONCLUSIONS: The KN95 masks tested failed the stipulated safety thresholds associated with protection of healthcare workers against airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results: A total of 18â¯472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12â¯725 (69%) were white. Of 18â¯472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18â¯472 patients (9.4%). Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity. These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.","Mehta, Neil; Kalra, Ankur; Nowacki, Amy S; Anjewierden, Scott; Han, Zheyi; Bhat, Pavan; Carmona-Rubio, Andres E; Jacob, Miriam; Procop, Gary W; Harrington, Susan; Milinovich, Alex; Svensson, Lars G; Jehi, Lara; Young, James B; Chung, Mina K",JAMA Cardiol,128,33

However, use of these therapies, if ineffective, might delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in some patients. We aimed to determine early predictors of NIRS failure and develop a simple nomogram and online calculator that can identify patients at risk of NIRS failure. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre observational study in 23 hospitals designated for patients with COVID-19 in China. Adult patients (&#8805;18 years) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and acute respiratory failure receiving NIRS were enrolled. A training cohort of 652 patients (21 hospitals) was used to identify early predictors of NIRS failure, defined as subsequent need for IMV or death within 28 days after intensive care unit admission. A nomogram was developed by multivariable logistic regression and concordance statistics (C-statistics) computed. C-statistics were validated internally by cross-validation in the training cohort, and externally in a validation cohort of 107 patients (two hospitals). FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between Jan 1 and Feb 29, 2020. NIV failed in 211 (74%) of 286 patients and HFNC in 204 (56%) of 366 patients in the training cohort. NIV failed in 48 (81%) of 59 patients and HFNC in 26 (54%) of 48 patients in the external validation cohort. Age, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate-oxygenation index (ratio of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate), Glasgow coma scale score, and use of vasopressors on the first day of NIRS in the training cohort were independent risk factors for NIRS failure. Based on the training dataset, the nomogram had a C-statistic of 0·80 (95% CI 0·74-0·85) for predicting NIV failure, and a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·82-0·89) for predicting HFNC failure. C-statistic values were stable in both internal validation (NIV group mean 0·79 [SD 0·10], HFNC group mean 0·85 [0·07]) and external validation (NIV group value 0·88 [95% CI 0·72-0·96], HFNC group value 0·86 [0·72-0·93]). INTERPRETATION: We have developed a nomogram and online calculator that can be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of NIRS failure. These patients might benefit from early triage and more intensive monitoring.

The study aimed to investigate for a relationship in bicycle related injuries in the paediatric population during the time of COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: A retrospective study of the incident of motorized and non-motorized bicycle related injuries and trauma presentations during the COVID-19 'shutdown' period from March to June 2020. Data were collected from the Emergency Department Information System, discharge summaries, operation and radiology reports. The data presented is from Perth Children's Hospital, the only tertiary paediatric hospital and the only referral centre for childhood trauma in the state of Western Australia. Participants were children aged 15 years and younger attending the emergency department (ED) at Perth Children's Hospital during the designated time period. The primary outcomes included total ED presentations, bicycle related presentations and bicycle related admissions during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Bicycle related presentations to the ED increased by 42.7% over the COVID-19 period from 1.4% to 3.0% of all children attending the ED. Children admitted to the hospital with bicycle related injuries or trauma increased by 48.7% from 76 to 113 children in comparison to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSION: During the period of COVID-19 restrictions, paediatric ED presentations decreased dramatically, but bicycle related injuries and trauma increased substantially. Safety equipment including helmets and protective gear should be worn for all children riding bicycles, and social distancing should be maintained.","van Oudtshoorn, Sarah; Chiu, Kei Y C; Khosa, Japinder",ANZ j.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its impact on social work education as it forced students to quickly transition to online learning and leave field sites abruptly to do remote activities. The degree to which and how social work students effectively coped with these changes has not been adequately studied, despite recognition that understanding how personal experiences and affective reactions influence professional judgment and behavior is a critical social work competency. To help fill this void, a mixed-methods study was conducted using video narratives and survey data to assess the coping and self-regulation skills of a cohort of undergraduate social work students. Findings indicate that these students experienced multiple stressors in all aspects of their biopsychosocial functioning due to COVID-19. Many coping skills learned for use with clients were demonstrated by students themselves. Self-sufficient, avoidant, and socially-supported coping mechanisms were frequently used and relied on by students. Use of self-distraction and active coping increased, while denial decreased within the first month after transitioning to remote learning. Implications of the findings for social work education, practice, and research are discussed.","Apgar, Dawn; Cadmus, Thomas",Clin Soc Work J,128,33

These risk factors, however, do not account for the other 52% of deaths arising from COVID-19 in often seemingly healthy individuals. This paper investigates the potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and bacterial load, questioning whether bacteria may play a role in bacterial superinfections and complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. The connection between COVID-19 complications and oral health and periodontal disease is also examined, as the comorbidities at highest risk of COVID-19 complications also cause imbalances in the oral microbiome and increase the risk of periodontal disease. We explore the connection between high bacterial load in the mouth and post-viral complications, and how improving oral health may reduce the risk of complications from COVID-19.","Sampson, Victoria; Kamona, Nawar; Sampson, Ariane",Br Dent J,128,16

Peer-to-peer systems, collaborative creation (wikipedia), open source software (Linux), universal shared knowledge, and the hopes for disintermediation contributed to this major vision. However, the reality is bleak: centralization is reigning in the cyberspace, with huge technological corporations controlling our data, and re-intermediation and control are stronger than ever in the so-called""sharing""economy. The Internet is also fragmented by countries, with many states imposing heavy controls to information and communication services. The XXI century will witness the major clash between centralization and decentralization in human history. And the major struggle will be around the communication and feedback technologies that will intermediate and govern every interaction in our lives. Unlike previous approaches that propose to socialize the feedback infrastructure or to use anti-monopoly laws to break Big Tech companies, in this article we advocate for the decentralization of the information and communication infrastructure. And the key to this decentralization is the creation of standards enabling interoperability between data platforms. This will in turn produce a true disintermediation from well established technological players and open competition to small third parties. In this article, we sketch such a decentralized open infrastructure including communication, sharing, matchmaking, and reputation services that can be constructed over open source technologies and standards.","Lopez, Pedro Garcia",,128,13

Positivity rates have not been analyzed on scale because only 4 states report race/ethnicity as part of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing. Previous studies also have had little ability to control for many known risk factors to better identify the effects of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic communities. Using test results from a large national reference laboratory database that included patients from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this study compared positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) among various race/ethnicity groups by linking zip code-based race/ethnicity proportions from US Census data. Analysis of 2,331,175 unique patients tested March-May 2020 demonstrated an increasing trend in SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity across Black non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 7.8% to 17.2%, P < 0.0001) and Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 8.4% to 15.5%, P < 0.0001) and a decreasing trend across White non-Hispanic community progressive quintiles (from 17.4% to 7.1%, P < 0.0001). These trends in viral ribonucleic acid positivity remained in stratified analyses and in multivariable models that controlled for known risk factors including sex, population density, and the states initially hardest hit by COVID-19. These findings indicate that communities with the highest proportions of Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations have the highest SARS-CoV-2 NAAT positivity rates, even after controlling for other risk factors. More efforts are needed to mitigate the increased impact of COVID-19 on both the African American and Hispanic communities.","Kaufman, Harvey W; Niles, Justin K; Nash, David B",Popul. health manag.

World health organization (WHO) had recommended online education to keep social distance which still needs further evaluation. This study aimed to examine whether an open online course is superior to conventional education in emergency nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two groups of conventional education students (CG) and two groups of students participating in an online course that utilized an application (called SuperStar) as the SuperStar Group (SSG) were studied to compare their abilities in the process of new knowledge acquisition. The SSG was divided into a blended group (S1) and an online group (S2). The emergency nursing course was scheduled in 16 independent classes, which contained stochastic tests at least eight times. RESULTS: The CG group showed better performance on the final exam than the SSG group, but there was no statistically significant difference. The CG group obtained better scores on the memory capacity tests while the SSG had better scores on the application capacity tests. The SSG group scored higher on the later tests during the process of education compared to the CG group. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehension of an emergency nursing course was stronger in the SSG group than in the CG group. Horizontal comparison of subentry tests discriminated between the groups, with a better trend for the SSG group in application ability. There are potential effects on chronological learning through the use of the online course for emergency nursing education, not only during COVID-19 but also in the post-pandemic era.","Lei, Tao; Yu, Xiaoxue; Zou, Min; Wang, Peipei; Yuan, Rong Hua",Australas.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS-CoVs) of this family have emerged before and SARS-CoV-2 has emerged now globally. The characterization of spike glycoproteins, polyproteins and other viral proteins from viruses is important for antiviral drug development. Homology modelling of these proteins with known templates offers the opportunity to discover ligand-binding sites and explore the possible antiviral properties of these protein-ligand complexes. In this study, we performed a complete bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment, comparison of multiple sequences and modelling of the SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences, the spike protein and the polyproteins for homology with known proteins. We also analysed binding sites in these models for possible binding with ligands that exhibit antiviral properties. Our results indicated that the sequence of the polyprotein isolate SARS-CoV-2_HKU-SZ-001_2020 showed 98.94 percent identity to SARS-coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors. The results also indicated that a part of the viral genome (residues 3268-3573 in Frame 2 with 306 amino acids) of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank Accession Number MN908947.3) when modelled with templateof the PDB database showed 96 percent identity to a 3C-like peptidase of SARS-CoVs, which has the ability to bind with an aza-peptide epoxide (APE) known for the irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV main peptidase. A docking profile with 9 different conformations of the ligand with the protein model using Autodock Vina showed an affinity of −7.1 kcal mol−1.

These changes allowed them to manage the storm while minimizing the disruption of important continuity of care to their patients with cancer. The authors hope that their experiences will be helpful to other oncology practices about to experience their own individual COVID-19 crises.","Shah, Manish A; Emlen, M Frances; Shore, Tsiporah; Mayer, Sebastian; Leonard, John P; Rossi, Adriana; Martin, Peter; Ritchie, Ellen; Niesvizky, Ruben; Pastore, Raymond; Cigler, Tessa; De Sancho, Maria; Scheff, Ronald; Van Besien, Koen; Roboz, Gail; Nanus, David; Goldstein, Paula; Scrimenti, Lara; Hidalgo, Manuel",CA cancer j. clin,128,16

Numerous studies have revealed the existence of significant associations between certain HLA alleles and the susceptibility and prognosis of different infectious diseases. In this pilot study we analyse the binding affinity between 66 class I HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 viral peptides, and its association with the severity of the disease. A total of 45 Spanish patients with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were typed for HLA class I; after that, we analysed if an in silico model of HLA I-viral peptide binding affinity and classical HLA supertypes could be correlated to the severity of the disease. Our results suggest that patients with mild disease present Class I HLA molecules with a higher theoretical capacity for binding SARS-Cov-2 peptides and showed greater heterozygosity when comparing them with moderate and severe groups. In this regard, identifying HLA-SARS-CoV-2 peptides binding differences between individuals would help to clarify the heterogeneity of clinical responses to the disease and will also be useful to guide a personalized treatment according to its particular risk.","Iturrieta-Zuazo, Ignacio; Rita, Claudia Geraldine; García-Soidán, Ana; de Malet Pintos-Fonseca, Ana; Alonso-Alarcón, Nieves; Pariente-Rodríguez, Roberto; Tejeda-Velarde, Amalia; Serrano-Villar, Sergio; Castañer-Alabau, José Luis; Nieto-Gañán, Israel",Clin Immunol,128,33

In obstetrics and gynecology, practice of telehealth has not been commonplace and no practical procedural guidelines have been published. The authors have created such guidelines for use of telehealth in a moderate-risk academic generalist practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This document highlights the process to determine which obstetrics and gynecology patients are candidates for telehealth, the frequency of follow-up, and the technical aspects of designing and delivering a de novo telehealth system.

A variety of claims have garnered considerable traction, including the assertion that COVID is a hoax or deliberately manufactured, that 5G frequency radiation causes coronavirus, and that the pandemic is a ruse by big pharmaceutical companies to profiteer off a vaccine. An estimated 30% of some populations subscribe some form of COVID medico-scientific conspiracy narratives, with detrimental impacts for themselves and others. Consequently, exposing the lack of veracity of these claims is of considerable importance. Previous work has demonstrated that historical medical and scientific conspiracies are highly unlikely to be sustainable. In this article, an expanded model for a hypothetical en masse COVID conspiracy is derived. Analysis suggests that even under ideal circumstances for conspirators, commonly encountered conspiratorial claims are highly unlikely to endure, and would quickly be exposed. This work also explores the spectrum of medico-scientific acceptance, motivations behind propagation of falsehoods, and the urgent need for the medical and scientific community to anticipate and counter the emergence of falsehoods.","Grimes, David Robert",PLoS One,128,29

Adherence to IPC practices has been suboptimal with limited available evidence. The study aim was to examine the impact of individual, home environment, and organizational factors on IPC practices using human factors model. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-three nurses were surveyed across two large home care agencies to examine the relationship between IPC adherence and individual, home environment, and organizational factors. RESULTS: Nurses reported multiple barriers to IPC practices in patients' homes (meanâ¯=â¯4.34, standard deviationâ¯=â¯2.53). Frequent barriers included clutter (reported by 74.5% of nurses) and a dirty environment (70.3%). Nurses also reported limited availability of some IPC supplies (meanâ¯=â¯7.76, standard deviation = 2.44), including personal protective equipment. Home environment factors were significant barriers, and availability of IPC supplies were significant enablers of IPC adherence. Agency-provided training and decision-making resources were not significant factors for IPC adherence in the presence of home environment barriers and IPC supplies. CONCLUSIONS: This study findings suggest that IPC adherence strategies point to addressing barriers in the home environment and increasing availability of IPC supplies. The relationship between the patient's home environment, organizational factors, and IPC practices among home health care nurses warrants further study.","Adams, Victoria; Song, Jiyoun; Shang, Jingjing; McDonald, Margaret; Dowding, Dawn; Ojo, Marietta; Russell, David",Am J Infect Control,128,16

To effectively manage what is shaping up as a multidimensional crisis, the challenge unquestionably goes beyond the necessary upgrading of public health infrastructures. It is also a matter of anticipating and taking timely action with regard to factors that may mitigate the propagation of SARS-CoV2 and thereby cushion the shock of the pandemic on the African continent.

Trade barriers, seasonal labor shortages, food loss and waste, and food safety concerns combine to engender vulnerabilities in food systems. A variety of actors-from academics to policy-makers, community organizers, farmers, and homesteaders-are considering the undertaking of creating more resilient food systems. Conventional approaches include fine-tuning existing value chains, consolidating national food distribution systems and bolstering inventory and storage. This paper highlights three alternative strategies for securing a more resilient food system, namely: (i.) leveraging underutilized, often urban, spaces for food production;(ii.) rethinking food waste as a resource;and (iii.) constructing production-distribution-waste networks, as opposed to chains. Various food systems actors have pursued these strategies for decades. Yet, we argue that the COVID-19 pandemic forces us to urgently consider such novel assemblages of actors, institutions, and technologies as key levers in achieving longer term food system resilience. These strategies are often centered around principles of redistribution and reciprocity, and focus on smaller scales, from individual households to communities. We highlight examples that have emerged in the spring-summer of 2020 of household and community efforts to reconstruct a more resilient food system. We also undertake a policy analysis to sketch how government supports can facilitate the emergence of these efforts and mobilization beyond the immediate confines of the pandemic.","Glaros, A.; Alexander, C.; Koberinski, J.; Scott, S.; Quilley, S.; Si, Z.

Evidence on income security during periods of ill health is growing but has not previously been reviewed as a full body of work concerning low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We performed a scoping review to map the range, features, coverage, protective effects and equity of policies that aim to provide income security for adults whose ill health prevents them from participating in gainful work. A total of 134 studies were included, providing data from 95% of LMICs. However, data across the majority of these countries were severely limited. Collectively the included studies demonstrate that coverage of contributory income-security schemes is low, especially for informal and low-income workers. Meanwhile, non-contributory schemes targeting low-income groups are often not explicitly designed to provide income support in periods of ill health, they can be difficult to access and rarely provide sufficient income support to cover the needs of eligible recipients. While identifying an urgent need for more research on illness-related income security in LMICs, this review concludes that scaling up and diversifying the range of income security interventions is crucial for improving coverage and equity. To achieve these outcomes, illness-related income protection must receive greater recognition in health policy and health financing circles, expanding our understanding of financial hardship beyond direct medical costs.","Thorpe, Jennifer; Viney, Kerri; Hensing, Gunnel; Lönnroth, Knut",,128,26

Specific factors, such as hearing loss severity and location of residence, may disproportionately impact patients during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the relative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hearing loss patients, based on hearing device type and location of residence. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional questionnaire study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Adults with hearing loss. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data included sociodemographic data, communication challenges, pandemic preparedness, access to healthcare, and mental and emotional health. RESULTS: A total of 614 patients responded (27.8% response rate). Compared with hearing aid users, cochlear implant users reported more difficulty communicating with family/friends (53% versus 41%, pâ=â0.017), obtaining pandemic information (10% versus 3%, pâ=â0.002), and understanding live broadcasts (47% versus 17%, pâ=â0.001) during the pandemic. CI users were less likely than hearing aid users to seek general (52% versus 69%, pâ=â0.001) and hearing healthcare services (20% versus 34%, pâ=â0.002). Rural residents reported greater difficulty than urban residents communicating with friends/family (53% versus 39%, pâ=â0.001), obtaining food/supplies (41% versus 20%, pâ=â0.004), understanding live broadcasts (31% versus 20%, pâ=â0.001) during the pandemic.

Among the far-reaching implications of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial improvement in air quality was observed worldwide after the lockdowns imposed by many countries. We aimed to assess the implications of different lockdown measures on air pollution levels in Europe and China, as well as the short-term and long-term health impact. METHODS: For this modelling study, observations of fine particulate matter (PM2·5) concentrations from more than 2500 stations in Europe and China during 2016-20 were integrated with chemical transport model simulations to reconstruct PM2·5 fields at high spatiotemporal resolution. The health benefits, expressed as short-term and long-term avoided mortality from PM2·5 exposure associated with the interventions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic, were quantified on the basis of the latest epidemiological studies. To explore the long-term variability in air quality and associated premature mortality, we built different scenarios of economic recovery (immediate or gradual resumption of activities, a second outbreak in autumn, and permanent lockdown for the whole of 2020). FINDINGS: The lockdown interventions led to a reduction in population-weighted PM2·5 of 14·5 µg m-3 across China (-29·7%) and 2·2 µg m-3 across Europe (-17·1%), with unprecedented reductions of 40 µg m-3 in bimonthly mean PM2·5 in the areas most affected by COVID-19 in China. In the short term, an estimated 24â200 (95% CI 22â380-26â010) premature deaths were averted throughout China between Feb 1 and March 31, and an estimated 2190 (1960-2420) deaths were averted in Europe between Feb 21 and May 17. We also estimated a positive number of long-term avoided premature fatalities due to reduced PM2·5 concentrations, ranging from 76â400 (95% CI 62â600-86â900) to 287â000 (233â700-328â300) for China, and from 13â600 (11â900-15â300) to 29â500 (25â800-33â300) for Europe, depending on the future scenarios of economic recovery adopted. INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that lockdown interventions led to substantial reductions in PM2·5 concentrations in China and Europe. We estimated that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution were avoided, although with significant differences observed in Europe and China. Our findings suggest that considerable improvements in air quality are achievable in both China and Europe when stringent emission control policies are adopted.

Grief is a natural consequence. Many mental health concerns, which can be identified as grief outcomes (e.g. anxiety and depression) in those who have experienced a bereavement, can be improved through physical activity. The objective of this review was to identify from the existing literature if physical activity can benefit grief outcomes in individuals who have been bereaved. METHODS: A systematic review of nine databases was performed. Included studies (qualitative and quantitative) explored physical activity to help individuals (of any age) who had experienced a human bereavement (excluding national loss). RESULTS: From 1299 studies screened, 25 met the inclusion criteria, detailing eight types of bereavement (parental (n = 5), spousal (n = 6), patient (n = 4), pre-natal (n = 3), later life (n = 1), caregiver (n = 1), multiple (n = 4) and non-defined (n = 1). Activities including yoga, running, walking and martial arts were noted as beneficial. Physical activity allowed a sense of freedom, to express emotions, provided a distraction and an escape from grief, whilst enhancing social support. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that physical activity may provide benefit for the physical health and psychological wellbeing of those who have been bereaved, including when the loss has happened at a young age. This review is timely, given the wide-scale national loss of life due to COVID-19 and extends knowledge in this area. More research is needed to explore the benefits of physical activity for those who have been bereaved. In particular, there is a need for well-designed interventions which are tailored to specific activities, populations and grief outcomes.","Williams, Jane; Shorter, Gillian W; Howlett, Neil; Zakrzewski-Fruer, Julia; Chater, Angel M",Sports Med Open,128,0

However, the results of studies on the effect of COVID-19 on male reproduction are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current research on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproduction. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was performed using PubMed and Ovid Embase up to 18 August 2020. Research articles on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, the effects of the virus on semen parameters and any pathological changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Six of 176 survivors (3.4%) and 1 of 13 decedents (7.7%) in 2 of 12 studies were positive for viral RNA in semen and testicular tissue, respectively. After stratification of patient groups, we found that the virus was detected in the relatively early stage of infection, 6-16 days after disease onset, in semen from survivors. Two of 3 studies reported that some participants had substandard semen quality after COVID-19, and 1 study found that COVID-19 may impair semen quality in a severity-related manner. Pathological analyses showed that injuries to the seminiferous tubule occurred in all decedents (N = 11). Another study found that orchitic and testis fibrin microthrombi occurred in patients with fatal disease (100%, N = 2). Scrotal discomfort of orchiepididymitis or spermatic cord inflammation has also been reported in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Current studies suggest that semen is rarely considered a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material during the infection period but not in the semen of recovered patients. Fatal COVID-19 may cause testicular structure damage without the presence of virus.","Yao, Yangcheng; Yuan, Xiaoqiong; Wu, Linjing; Guo, Na; Yin, Li; Li, Yufeng",Androl. (Online),128,16

OBJECTIVES: To describe outbreak containment actions initiated by MDA, including a COVID-19 tele-triage center and home testing by paramedics. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted of de-identified data from the call management and command and control systems during the first period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (23 February 2020-15 March 2020). RESULTS: During the study period, the total number of calls to the dispatch centers was 477,321 with a daily average of 21,696, compared to 6000-6500 during routine times. The total number of COVID-19 related calls was 334,230 (daily average 15,194). There were 28,454 calls (8.51% of all COVID-19 related calls, average 1293/day) transferred to the COVID-19 call center.

In order to properly weigh risks against potential benefits, particularly when decisions must be made quickly, mathematical modeling of both drug disposition and drug action can be useful for predicting patient response and making informed decisions. Here we explored the potential effects on cardiac electrophysiology of 4 drugs proposed to treat COVID-19: lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and azithromycin, as well as combination therapy involving these drugs. Our study combined simulations of pharmacokinetics (PK) with quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling of ventricular myocytes to predict potential cardiac adverse events caused by these treatments. Simulation results predicted that drug combinations can lead to greater cellular action potential prolongation, analogous to QT prolongation, compared with drugs given in isolation. The combination effect can result from both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Importantly, simulations of different patient groups predicted that females with pre-existing heart disease are especially susceptible to drug-induced arrhythmias, compared with diseased males or healthy individuals of either sex. Statistical analysis of population simulations revealed the molecular factors that certain females with heart failure especially susceptible to arrhythmias. Overall, the results illustrate how PK and QSP modeling may be combined to more precisely predict cardiac risks of COVID-19 therapies.","Varshneya, Meera; Irurzun-Arana, Itziar; Campana, Chiara; Dariolli, Rafael; Gutierrez, Amy; Pullinger, Taylor K; Sobie, Eric A",CPT: pharmacomet. syst. pharmacol,128,33

In some cases, cutaneous signs were the only manifestation of COVID-19 rather than the typical syndrome of fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, there is considerable heterogeneity amongst the cutaneous signs described so far, which has been published extensively.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for streamlined regulatory approval processes-which can be achieved in part through regulatory convergence and cooperation-both to accelerate availability of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics and to maintain the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19. METHODS: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) established the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) in 2008 to advance regulatory convergence among APEC's 21 member economies. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed in 2018 to measure convergence. RESULTS: This paper reports survey results collected from KPI tracking in March 2020 from medical product regulatory authorities in all 21 APEC economies concerning areas of regulatory practice in which they could converge and cooperate. For example, from 2008 to 2020, there was a 14.3% increase in the number of APEC member economy regulatory authorities sharing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Certificates and a 28% increase in the number of regulatory authorities accepting multisite licenses in that same period. In addition, this paper explores how APEC economies could realize a maximum level of regulatory convergence and cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence efforts within APEC can accelerate availability of medical products including that related to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, while maintaining the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. New KPIs and capability building are to be considered to enable a new era of innovation ushered in by COVID-19.","Chong, Sannie Siaw Foong; Kim, Mirinea; Limoli, Michelle; Obscherning, Eric; Wu, Patricia; Feisee, Lila; Nakashima, Nobumasa; Lim, John C W",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

Impediments to address this question are primarily due to critical experimental barriers. An integrated perspective on large scale neural information processing requires an in vivo approach that can combine the advantages of exhaustively observing all neurons dedicated to a given type of stimulus, and simultaneously achieve a resolution that is precise enough to capture individual neuron activity. Current experimental data from in vivo observations are either restricted to a small fraction of the total number of neurons, or are based on larger brain volumes but at a low spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, fundamental questions as to how sensory information is represented on a population scale remain unanswered. In Drosophila melanogaster, the mushroom body (MB) represents an excellent model to analyze sensory coding and memory plasticity. In this work, we present an experimental setup coupled with a dedicated computational method that provides in vivo measurements of the activity of hundreds of densely packed somata uniformly spread in the MB. We exploit spinning-disk confocal 3D imaging over time of the whole MB cell body layer in vivo while it is exposed to olfactory stimulation. Importantly, to derive individual signal from densely packed somata, we have developed a fully automated image analysis procedure that takes advantage of the specificities of our data. After anisotropy correction, our approach operates a dedicated spot detection and registration over the entire time sequence to transform trajectories to identifiable clusters. This enabled us to discard spurious detections and reconstruct missing ones in a robust way. We demonstrate that this approach outperformed existing methods in this specific context and made possible high-throughput analysis of approximately 500 single somata uniformly spread over the MB in various conditions. Applying this approach, we find that learned experiences change the population code of odor representations in the MB. After long-term memory (LTM) formation, we quantified an increase in responsive somata count and a stable single neuron signal. We predict that this method, which should further enable studying the population pattern of neuronal activity, has the potential to uncover fine details of sensory processing and memory plasticity.","Delestro, Felipe; Scheunemann, Lisa; Pedrazzani, Mélanie; Tchenio, Paul; Preat, Thomas; Genovesio, Auguste",Sci Rep,128,20

It represents the first new dedicated brain stereotactic radiosurgery platform in almost half a century optimizing the goals of safety, speed, and accuracy. The Zap-X system was used in a required Chinese National Medical Products Administration clinical study. In early January 2020, 2 patients were treated with the Zap-X robot prior to a national COVID-19 lockdown. Both were closely followed via clinical exam and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Prospectively collected data were used to generate this report. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two female patients, each harboring either a trigeminal schwannoma or petroclival meningioma, were treated with the Zap-X robot. Respective tumor volumes were 2.60 and 4.02 cm3. A radiation dose of 13 Gy was prescribed to the 50% isodose line. At 8 mo of follow-up, preoperative symptoms were either resolved or stable and MRI imaging demonstrated a 31% and 56% reduction in lesion volume, respectively. In both patients, symptoms improved, and tumor volumes decreased, whereas no major complication was observed. CONCLUSION: Given only 2 patients and short-term follow-up, any conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the Zap-X radiosurgery robot are preliminary. However, in the absence of any other published outcomes to date, this small case series may be of interest to many radiosurgical specialists.","Pan, Longsheng; Qu, Baolin; Bai, Jingmin; Huang, Lichao; Wang, Jinyuan; Wang, Chengcheng; Dai, Xiangkun; Weidlich, Georg; Adler, John R",Neurosurgery,128,16

The present study evaluated sleep patterns, sleep disturbances, and associated factors in Chinese preschoolers confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. Caregivers of 1619 preschoolers (aged 4-6 years) recruited from 11 preschools in Zunyi, Guizhou province completed the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) between 17th and 19th February 2020. Data were compared to a sociodemographically similar sample of preschoolers (included in the 11 preschools) in 2018. Compared to the 2018 sample, the confined preschoolers demonstrated changes in sleep patterns characterized by later bedtimes and wake times, longer nocturnal and shorter nap sleep durations, comparable 24-hr sleep duration, and fewer caregiver-reported sleep disturbances. Moreover, behavioural practices (sleeping arrangement, reduced electronic device use, regular diet) and parenting practices (harmonious family atmosphere and increased parent-child communication) were associated with less sleep disturbances in the confined sample. The present study provides the first description of the impact of prolonged home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep patterns and sleep disturbances in preschoolers, as well as highlighting the importance of the link between sleep health and family factors. Given that disrupted and insufficient sleep has been linked to immune system dysfunction, our findings also have potential implications for resilience to infection in young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should further explore deficient sleep as a risk factor for coronavirus infection.","Liu, Zhijun; Tang, Hui; Jin, Qiyun; Wang, Guanghai; Yang, Zixin; Chen, Hongyan; Yan, Hongxia; Rao, Wenjie; Owens, Judith",J Sleep Res,128,25

As states begin to lift these orders to reopen the economy, the risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 may be related to the public's voluntary adherence to public health recommendations. We conducted a nationally representative survey of 604 African Americans to generate a risk assessment based on African Americans' compliance with public health recommendations to frequently wash hands, maintain social distancing, avoid touching face, and wear a mask in public. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive study of African Americans and public health adherence specific to COVID-19. The percent of respondents reporting that they always comply with these recommendations was 72%, 67%, 55%, and 65%, respectively. Based on this threshold, African Americans' level of adherence with COVID-19 public health recommendations suggests they may be at high risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 during reopening, and there is an urgent need for targeted, culturally responsive public health messaging that is accessible to communities of color to help address racial disparities in COVID-19 risk.

A strong relationship is found when correlating the virus spread to the mean temperature, minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure in different Spanish provinces. In this analysis we have used the ratio of the PCR COVID-19 positives with respect to the population size. A linear regression model using the mean temperature is implemented. Moreover, an analysis of variance is used to confirm the influence of mean temperature on the spread of virus. As a second measurement of the COVID-19 outbreak we have used the results of the antibodies tests carried out in Spain that provide an estimation of the heard immunity achieved. Based on this analysis, an estimation of the asymptomatic population is performed. All these results exhibit significant correlation with weather variables. The most affected provinces were Soria, Segovia and Ciudad Real, which are the coldest. On the opposite side, places such as Southern Spain, the Baleares, and Canary Islands showed a lower rate of spread. This might be related to the warmer climate and the insularity of these islands. Besides, the coastal influence and the daily sun hours might also influence the lower rates in the east and west regions in Spain. This analysis provides a deeper insight of the influence of weather variables onto the COVID-19 spread in Spain.","Loché Fernández-Ahúja, José María; Fernández Martínez, Juan Luis",Int J Hyg Environ Health,128,32

To study the impact of this reduction and closing down, hourly concentrations of PM2.5-related elements were measured at a rural site before (12-25 January 2020), during (26 January-9 February 2020) and after (22 March-2 April 2020) the control period when all people remained socially isolated in their homes and could not return to economic zones for work. Nine major sources were identified by the positive matrix factorization model, including fireworks burning, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, dust, Cr industry, oil combustion, Se industry, Zn smelter, and iron and steel industry. Before the control period, K, Fe, Ca, Zn, Ba and Cu were the main elements, and fireworks burning, Zn smelter and vehicle emissions provided the highest contributions to the total element mass with 55%, 12.1% and 10.3%, respectively. During the control period, K, Fe, Ba, Cu and Zn were the dominating elements, and fireworks burning and vehicle emissions contributed 55% and 27% of the total element mass. After the control period, Fe, K, Ca, Zn and Ba were the main elements, and dust and iron and steel industry were responsible for 56% and 21% of the total element mass. The increased contribution from vehicle emissions during the control period could be attributed to our sampling site being near a town hospital and the fact that the vehicle activities were not restricted. The source apportionment results were also related to air mass backward trajectories. The largest reductions of dust, coal combustion, and the industrial sources (Cr industry, Zn smelter, Se industry, iron and steel industry) were distinctly seen for northwest transport (Ulanqab) and were least significant for northeast transport (Tangshan and Tianjin).","Cui, Yang; Ji, Dongsheng; Maenhaut, Willy; Gao, Wenkang; Zhang, Renjian; Wang, Yuesi",Sci Total Environ,128,1

Since then, the disease has spread all over the world, with the United States becoming the country with the highest number of cases. Governments around the world have undertaken varying degrees of public safety measures, including recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain in effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We find that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according to this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the total number of deaths to ~72 thousand.

METHODS: Following scoping review methods, we included 30 studies that varied in terms of methodology and theoretical approaches. The search included peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published between March and September 2020. RESULTS: Based on the studies reviewed, we found that COVID-19 infection and death rates increased not only with age and comorbidities, but also with discrimination and structural inequities based on racism and sexism. Racial and ethnic minority workers, including migrant workers, are concentrated in high-risk occupations and this concentration is correlated to lower socioeconomic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic appears in the occupational health and safety spotlight as an exacerbator of already existing socioeconomic inequalities and social inequalities in health, especially in light of the intersection of issues related to racism, ethnic minority status, and sexism. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides early evidence about the limitations of institutions' responses to the pandemic, and their capacity to provide a safe and decent working environment for all workers, regardless of their employment status or the social protections they may enjoy under normal circumstances. It is also important to think about these issues in the postpandemic context, when conditions of precariousness and vulnerability persist and possibly worsen.","Côté, Daniel; Durant, Steve; MacEachen, Ellen; Majowicz, Shannon; Meyer, Samantha; Huynh, Ai-Thuy; Laberge, Marie; Dubé, Jessica",Am J Ind Med,128,16

This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E), and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we identified phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol kinases and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses.

The U.S. government is working to produce and deliver safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the entire U.S. population. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* has broadly outlined its approach for developing recommendations for the use of each COVID-19 vaccine authorized or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization or licensure (1). ACIP's recommendation process includes an explicit and transparent evidence-based method for assessing a vaccine's safety and efficacy as well as consideration of other factors, including implementation (2). Because the initial supply of vaccine will likely be limited, ACIP will also recommend which groups should receive the earliest allocations of vaccine. The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group and consultants with expertise in ethics and health equity considered external expert committee reports and published literature and deliberated the ethical issues associated with COVID-19 vaccine allocation decisions. The purpose of this report is to describe the four ethical principles that will assist ACIP in formulating recommendations for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccine while supply is limited, in addition to scientific data and implementation feasibility: 1) maximize benefits and minimize harms; 2) promote justice; 3) mitigate health inequities; and 4) promote transparency. These principles can also aid state, tribal, local, and territorial public health authorities as they develop vaccine implementation strategies within their own communities based on ACIP recommendations.","McClung, Nancy; Chamberland, Mary; Kinlaw, Kathy; Bowen Matthew, Dayna; Wallace, Megan; Bell, Beth P; Lee, Grace M; Talbot, H Keipp; Romero, José R; Oliver, Sara E; Dooling, Kathleen",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,128,21

Risks associated with acquiring the virus have been found to most significantly vary by age and presence of underlying comorbidity. In this rapid literature review we explore the prevalence of comorbidities and associated adverse outcomes among individuals with COVID-19 and summarize our findings based on information available as of May 15, 2020. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar to find articles published until May 15, 2020. All relevant articles providing information on PCR tested COVID-19 positive patient population with clinical characteristics and epidemiological information were selected for review and analysis. RESULTS: A total of 27 articles consisting of 22,753 patient cases from major epicenters worldwide were included in the study. Major comorbidities seen in overall population were CVD (8.9%), HTN (27.4%), Diabetes (17.4%), COPD (7.5%), Cancer (3.5%), CKD (2.6%), and other (15.5%). Major comorbidity specific to countries included in the study were China (HTN 39.5%), South Korea (CVD 25.6%), Italy (HTN 35.9%), USA (HTN 38.9%), Mexico, (Other 42.3%), UK (HTN 27.8%), Iran (Diabetes 35.0%). Within fatal cases, an estimated 84.1% had presence of one or more comorbidity. Subgroup analysis of fatality association with having comorbidity had an estimated OR 0.83, CI [0.60-0.99], p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, hypertension followed by diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were the most common comorbidity seen in COVID-19 positive patients across major epicenters world-wide. Although having one or more comorbidity is linked to increased disease severity, no clear association was found between having these risk factors and increased risk of fatality.","Bajgain, Kalpana Thapa; Badal, Sujan; Bajgain, Bishnu B; Santana, Maria J",Am. j. infect. control,128,0

After the first alert message from the local healthcare service, a series of drastic measures were taken at our outpatient clinic to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this retrospective study, all consecutive cancer outpatients completed a baseline SARS-CoV­2 test via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 15 March to 26 May 2020. In the later phase, after the peak of the pandemic, patients as well as healthcare workers were tested for anti-SARS-CoV­2 IgG antibodies. RESULTS: Between 15 March and 26 May 2020, 0.78% (Nâ¯= 5/640) cancer patients tested positive for SARS-CoV­2 by RT-PCR. Between 22 June and 17 July 2020, anti-SARS-CoV­2 IgG antibodies were detected in 2 out of 250 (0.8%) cancer patients and 2 out of 36 (5.5%) healthcare workers. In only 1 out of 4 cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, could SARS-CoV­2 antibodies be detected. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the majority of our patients and healthcare workers had not been infected with SARS-CoV­2 and rapidly implemented measures were effective.

Clinicians claim that the surge demonstrates a deregulated immune defence in host, as infected cell expression analysis depicts a delay in type-I (interferon-I) and type-III IFNs expression, along with a limited Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) response, which later resume and culminates in elicitation of several cytokines including- IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF&#945;, IL-17, MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-10 etc. Although cytokines are messenger molecules of the immune system, but their increased concentration results in inflammation, infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lung injury in patients. This inflammatory response results in the precarious pathogenesis of COVID-19; thus, a complete estimation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is vital in designing a harmless and effective vaccine. In pathogenesis analysis, it emerges that a timely forceful type-I IFN production (18-24hrs post infection) promotes innate and acquired immune responses, while a delay in IFNs production (3-4 days post infection) actually renders both innate and acquired responses ineffective in fighting infection. Further, underlying conditions including hypertension, obesity, cardio-vascular disease etc may increase the chances of putting people in risk groups, which end up having critical form of infection. This review summarizes the events starting from viral entry, its struggle with the immune system and failure of host immunological parameters to obliterate the infections, which finally culminate into massive release of CRS and inflammation in gravely ill patients.","Pasrija, Ritu; Naime, Mohammad",Int Immunopharmacol,128,2

METHODS: From 1 July to 30 September 2020, cases of T asahii fungemia (TAF) in a Brazilian COVID-19 referral centre were investigated. The epidemiology and clinical courses were detailed, along with a mycological investigation that included molecular species identification, haplotype diversity analysis and antifungal susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Five critically ill COVID-19 patients developed TAF in the period. All five patients had common risk conditions for TAF: central venous catheter at fungemia, previous exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior echinocandin therapy and previous prolonged corticosteroid therapy. The average time of intensive care unit hospitalisation previous to the TAF episode was 23 days. All but one patient had voriconazole therapy, and TAF 30-day mortality was 80%. The five T asahii strains from the COVID-19 patients belonged to 4 different haplotypes, mitigating the possibility of skin origin and cross-transmission linking the 5 reported episodes. The antifungal susceptibility testing revealed low minimal inhibitory concentrations for azole derivatives. CONCLUSIONS: Judicious prescription of antibiotics, corticosteroids and antifungals needs to be discussed in critically ill COVID-19 patients to prevent infections by hard-to-treat fungi like T asahii.","Nobrega de Almeida, João; Moreno, Lis; Francisco, Elaine Cristina; Noronha Marques, Gabriela; Mendes, Ana Verena; Barberino, Maria Goreth; Colombo, Arnaldo Lopes",Mycoses,128,12

This so-called the Coronavirus Blues has been bringing high level of stress to many people and in turn they are suffering worse and worse changes in their daily lives. This study is designed to resolve these social problems. It aims to represent stress states musically by use of stress-induced EEG features known to be highly correlated to stress, and also attempts to intuitively show whether stress is relieved by scent therapy through changes in musical expression of brain signals. The theta/alpha enhancement protocol is utilized to generate music from stress-evoked EEG features. Four subjects (19∼24 age, all right-handed) participated in the experiment. Their stress levels measured by the cognitive stress scale-14(PSS-14) before and after the experiment. While measuring their EEG data in stress or non-stress condition, music is generated in line with their stress states. The results showed that music changed from slow tempo and calm mood toward faster and louder, while the brain state transits from normal to stress by stimulation inducing stress and subject becomes deeper in stress. During aromatherapy in stress condition, there was no noticeable change in music as compared with stress condition. Nevertheless, all participants show lower stress scores after aromatherapy and two subjects has gained higher theta/alpha ratio during aromatherapy. This is because aromatherapy for stress alleviation is considered to be highly inter-subjective variable or some specific subjects are still exposed to stress in spite of sufficient scent to them. Thus, we expect that sometime after stress condition, aromatherapy could mitigate stress and music could be returned to normal state. © 2021 IEEE.","Kim, T.; Seo, Y.; Lee, J.; Chae, S.; An, J.","IEEE Int.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Rho is immediately activated in left ventricles after pressure overload, and that Rho signalling plays crucial regulatory roles in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement during cardiac hypertrophic responses. However, the mechanisms by which Rho and its downstream proteins control actin dynamics during hypertrophic responses remain not fully understood. In this study, we identified the pivotal roles of mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia) 1, a Rho-effector molecule, in pressure overload-induced ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male wild-type (WT) and mDia1-knockout (mDia1KO) mice (10-12 weeks old) were subjected to a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham operation. The heart weight/tibia length ratio, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, left ventricular wall thickness, and expression of hypertrophy-specific genes were significantly decreased in mDia1KO mice 3 weeks after TAC, and the mortality rate was higher at 12 weeks. Echocardiography indicated that mDia1 deletion increased the severity of heart failure 8 weeks after TAC. Importantly, we could not observe apparent defects in cardiac hypertrophic responses in mDia3-knockout mice. Microarray analysis revealed that mDia1 was involved in the induction of hypertrophy related genes, including immediate early genes, in pressure overloaded hearts. Loss of mDia1 attenuated activation of the mechanotransduction pathway in TAC-operated mice hearts. We also found that mDia1 was involved in stretch-induced activation of the mechanotransduction pathway and gene expression of c-fos in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). mDia1 regulated the filamentous/globular (F/G)-actin ratio in response to pressure overload in mice. Additionally, increases in nuclear myocardin-related transcription factors and serum response factor were perturbed in response to pressure overload in mDia1KO mice and to mechanical stretch in mDia1 depleted NRVMs. CONCLUSIONS: mDia1, through actin dynamics, is involved in compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: Heart disease is associated with increased cardiac mass resulting from hypertrophic growth and remodelling in response to excessive mechanical stress. Although numerous signalling pathways have been shown to influence cardiac hypertrophy, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy have remained incompletely understood. Here, we present evidence that the cardioprotective functions of actin polymerization by mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous 1, a Rho-effector molecule, in response to mechanical stress. Understanding this mechanotransduction pathway may provide new prospects for identifying a novel strategy for pressure overload-induced cardiovascular disease.","Abe, Ichitaro; Terabayashi, Takeshi; Hanada, Katsuhiro; Kondo, Hidekazu; Teshima, Yasushi; Ishii, Yumi; Miyoshi, Miho; Kira, Shintaro; Saito, Shotaro; Tsuchimochi, Hirotsugu; Shirai, Mikiyasu; Yufu, Kunio; Arakane, Motoki; Daa, Tsutomu; Thumkeo, Dean; Narumiya, Shuh; Takahashi, Naohiko; Ishizaki, Toshimasa",Cardiovasc. res,128,23

Healthcare workers play an essential role and are one of the most exposed groups. Information about the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers is limited. METHODS: 3109 healthcare workers completed a national, internet-based, cross-sectional 45-item survey between 9 and 19 April 2020. The objective is to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish healthcare workers. A Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score (PSAS) was defined combining four modified versions of validated psychological assessment tests (A) Healthcare Stressful Test, (B) Coping Strategies Inventory, (C) Font-Roja Questionnaire and (D) Trait Meta-Mood Scale. RESULTS: The highest psychosocial impact was perceived in Respiratory Medicine, the mean (S.D.) PSAS was 48.3 (13.6) and Geriatrics 47.6 (16.4). Higher distress levels were found in the geographical areas with the highest incidence of COVID-19 (>245.5 cases per 100 000 people), PSAS 46.8 (15.2); p < 0.001. The least stress respondents were asymptomatic workers PSAS, 41.3 (15.4); p < 0.001, as well as those above 60 years old, PSAS, 37.6 (16); p < 0.001.

As measures of contact restrictions were introduced to contain the virus, and schools and childcare facilities closed, the potential risk to child welfare could hardly be overlooked. OBJECTIVES: Focusing on Germany, this article aims to explore some of the effects of the COVID-19 measures on children and families. Furthermore, it examines a number of key challenges for child protection practitioners. These include identifying potential cases of child maltreatment without the support normally provided by teachers and child carers; and establishing and maintaining contact with clients under physical distancing rules. METHODS: The article is based on a review of German and English language scientific and journalistic articles, position papers from professional associations and other gray literature. It benefits from recently published (interim) results of empirical studies conducted in Germany, which explore child welfare issues in the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Under COVID-19, the child welfare system faces unprecedented challenges and uncertainty (e.g. (partial) loss of cooperation opportunities with key partners) whilst showing signs of remarkable resilience (e.g. child protection workers' ability to adjust to new conditions). While the potential of digitalising work processes in child protection has become apparent in the pandemic, the proven continuous face-to-face contact between practitioners and their clients is neither dispensable nor replaceable.","Jentsch, Birgit; Schnock, Brigitte",Child Abuse Negl,128,5

Unlike influenza, most SARS-CoV-2-infected people do not transmit while a small percentage infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models which link observed viral loads with epidemiologic features of each virus, including distribution of transmissions attributed to each infected person and duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person. We identify that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza can be highly contagious for less than 1 day, congruent with peak viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events occur when an infected person is shedding at a very high viral load and has a high number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 toward super-spreading events cannot be attributed to additional weeks of shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks, likely due to aerosolization.","Goyal, Ashish; Reeves, Daniel B; Cardozo-Ojeda, E Fabian; Schiffer, Joshua T; Mayer, Bryan T",eLife (Cambridge),128,24

This is a time of urgent need for mental health support for workers affected by the pandemic crisis. Clinicians may employ empirically supported interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and related therapies. Psychological First Aid, an evidence-based crisis intervention, may be utilized to emphasize basic needs and support, but is intended as an acute disaster intervention. Given that a pandemic is an ongoing and prolonged stressor, additional CBT-informed interventions are likely needed to fully support essential workers during these times. It is recommended that clinicians help essential worker clients meet their basic needs by modifying health and sleep habits where possible and helping them advocate for their needs using interpersonal effectiveness skills. Empathic listening, validation of the crisis at hand, and values clarification can aid the therapeutic relationship, help them feel a renewed sense of purpose and meaning in their careers and with their families, and facilitate behavior change consistent with chosen values. Self-monitoring through a daily diary can help clients focus their thoughts and recognize maladaptive patterns in their thoughts and behaviors. In tandem with these techniques, behavioral activation and coping strategies including relaxation, distress tolerance, and acceptance promote engaging in positive and adaptive activities. Finally, therapists can help clients reduce anxiety related to the pandemic by helping them limit information intake.","Benhamou, Kathy; Piedra, Alexandra",J Contemp Psychother,128,14

The high volume of media coverage played an important role in calling for improved public health services for the older population. Nevertheless, problematic media representations of older people might evoke or amplify ageism during the pandemic. Therefore, drawing on empirical data collected from five mainstream Chinese media outlets between January 3 and May 3, 2020, this study examined how the media constructed the vulnerability of older adults and its underlying ageist thinking during the pandemic. The findings showed that the media had clear preferences in constructing older people as passive recipients while seeking resources from families, public institutions and governments at various levels to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the media adopted a biomedical-centred framework presenting older people as a homogenous group that was vulnerable to the pandemic. In addition, we found that the media representations of older adults intensified the dichotomised relationship between the young and the old, causing the younger generations to perceive older people as a 'threat' to public health. Moving beyond the Chinese case, this article appeals to the media to be socially responsible by avoiding the stereotyping of the older population and uniting the whole society to combat COVID-19. The findings of this study will help raise awareness among policymakers and care service providers, which is crucial to eliminating ageist attitudes across society and to further allowing the values of older individuals to be fully recognised.","Zhang, Jingjing; Liu, Xiaoting",Eur J Ageing,128,16

These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness and is associated with variations in coinfection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE: Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as related to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this article seeking to further clarify the effects and underlying immunologic imprinting. METHODS: Here, we have combined a model of chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady-state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we have uncovered previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T-cell responses during immunization that are dependent on vaccine formulation and have functional impact on the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION: In addition to steady-state modifications to CD4+ T-cell polarization and B-cell priming, we have traced these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal cross talk.","Lacorcia, Matthew; Bhattacharjee, Sonakshi; Laubhahn, Kristina; Alhamdan, Fahd; Ram, Marija; Muschaweckh, Andreas; Potaczek, Daniel P; Kosinska, Anna; Garn, Holger; Protzer, Ulrike; Renz, Harald; Prazeres da Costa, Clarissa",J. allergy clin. immunol,128,12

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to: i) identify the number and type of treatments for pain currently used by stroke survivors with chronic pain; and ii) examine the self-perceived effectiveness of medication and non-medication treatments for pain. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. Participants with stroke and self-reported chronic pain completed an online survey that measured demographics, stroke related factors, intensity of pain, treatments for pain, and perceived effect of medication and non-medication treatments for pain. RESULTS: Of 322 stroke survivors who completed the survey, the majority (90.1%) reported current use of pain treatment(s). Medications were accessed by 257 (79.8%), with the most common being anti-inflammatories (39.8%), anticonvulsants (29.5%) and antidepressants (24.8%). Paracetamol (12.1%) was the most common non-prescribed medication used. Polypharmacy was high, with 129 (40.1%) reporting taking 2 or more medications. Medication treatments were self-reported to be effective in 47.1% of those taking medication. Non-medication treatments were accessed by 208 (64.6%), with Physical Therapy/Physiotherapy being most common (48.1%), followed by Occupational Therapy (15.5%) and Psychology (11.8%). Use of multiple non-medication treatments was reported by 85 (26.4%). Non-medication treatments were reported to be effective by 52.4% of those receiving them. CONCLUSIONS: Survey findings indicate that stroke survivors with chronic pain demonstrate high utilization of pain treatments, despite the perception that treatment is often ineffective. This highlights the need to develop effective pain interventions for stroke survivors.","Haslam, Brendon S; Butler, David S; Kim, Anthony S; Carey, Leeanne M",Disabil Health J,128,10

In this paper, we will describe lessons learned from past pandemics and vaccine campaigns about the path to successful vaccine delivery. The historical record suggests that to have a widely immunized population, leaders must invest in evidence-based vaccine delivery strategies that generate demand, allocate and distribute vaccines, and verify coverage. To generate demand, we must understand the roots of vaccine hesitancy, engage trusted sources of authority to advocate for vaccination, and commit to longitudinal engagement with communities. To allocate vaccines, we must allow qualified organizations and expert coalitions to determine evidence-based vaccination approaches and generate the political will to ensure the cooperation of local and national governments. To distribute vaccines, we must ensure that the people and organizations with expertise in manufacturing, supply chains, and last-mile distribution are positioned to direct efforts. To verify vaccine coverage, we must identify vaccination tracking systems that are portable, interoperable, and secure. Lessons of past pandemics suggest that nations should invest in evidence-informed strategies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines protect individuals, suppress transmission, and minimize disruption to health services and livelihoods.

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential. Conclusions: Given the limited time and resources to develop vaccine and treatments for 2019-nCoV, our work provides a shortlist of candidates for experimental validation and thus can accelerate development pipeline.","Lee, Chloe H; Koohy, Hashem",F1000Res,128,3

Mentoring may have mediating effects by enhancing social support. The University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) offers a voluntary general mentoring program (g-mentoring) for all interested students and a mentoring program for students with excellent course results and scientific interest (e-mentoring) We aimed to investigate the mental burden and views of their study situation during COVID-19 among students who did or did not participate in one of the formal mentoring programs. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey (May 2020) examining students' mental burden using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and assessing their perception of study conditions and digital teaching using self-developed items. Results: Of 1193 invited students, 543 (45.5%) completed the survey. 35% of those participated in the g-mentoring and 7% in the e-mentoring. 59% did not participate in any program. More e-mentees than g-mentees and nonparticipants reported clinically unproblematic levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. The majority of students (55%) was somewhat worried about the impact of the pandemic on their study situation. Regarding digital teaching students did not feel overburdened by the lack of a fixed schedule and structure, e-mentees even less than g-mentees and nonparticipants. Both g-mentees and nonparticipants were significantly more appreciative of the possible repeated use of the digital teaching materials than e-mentees (both groups M=5.7 vs. M=5.4 in e-mentees, p=.045). Conclusion: The results indicate that while students feel substantially burdened by the situation and the majority worries about the impact of the pandemic on their studies, they also seem to cope well with the digital course format. Study motivation during COVID-19 decreased among the majority of students with and without mentoring. These aspects may be important to address by medical schools interested in developing effective interventions to support students during a pandemic and continuous online teaching.","Guse, Jennifer; Heinen, Ines; Kurre, Jana; Mohr, Sonja; Bergelt, Corinna",GMS J Med Educ,128,26

Notably, coix seed is currently being used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 in China. However, coix seeds are generally contaminated by mycotoxins, and this risk cannot be ignored. In this paper, we developed a method that involves direct extraction and UHPLC-HRMS analysis for the simultaneous detection of 24 mycotoxins in coix seeds. UHPLC-HRMS instrument and data acquisition parameters, and the sample pretreatment were optimised. One-step extraction showed several advantages compared to the three commercial solid-phase extraction clean-up methods, including ease of use, reduced time of sample preparation, low cost, good recovery, and acceptable matrix effect. The method validation results indicate that all mycotoxins have good linearity and sensitivity. Recoveries were between 74.2-101.1%, and RSD ranged from 0.1-5.8%. The LOQs for 24 mycotoxins were in the range of 0.5-100 µg/kg. To survey the contamination levels of these mycotoxins in commercial coix seeds, more than 70 samples were collected from Chinese markets and were analysed using the newly developed method. Zearalenone (positive ratio: 98.7%, range:1.1-1562 µg/kg), deoxynivalenol (positive ratio: 87%, range: 8.4-382.5 µg/kg), nivalenol (positive ratio: 85.7%, range: 26.8-828.2 µg/kg), fumonisin B1 (positive ratio: 84.4%, range:2.5-314.5 µg/kg), fumonisin B2 (positive ratio: 75.3%, range:1.6-72.8 µg/kg), fumonisin B3 (positive ratio: 48%, range:1.0-203.6 µg/kg), aflatoxin B1 (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 0.39-14.7 µg/kg), sterigmatocystin (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 1.4-51.6 µg/kg), and tenuazonic acid (positive ratio: 19.5%, range 36.1-105.7 µg/kg) were the most frequent mycotoxin contaminants. These results highlight the importance of routine monitoring and control of mycotoxins in coix seeds.","Wu, Yu; Ye, Jin; Xuan, Zhihong; Li, Li; Wang, Haibo; Wang, Songshan; Liu, Hongmei; Wang, Songxue",Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess,128,26

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-two healthy children were assigned at random to 1 of 2 groups: one group wearing N95 masks without an exhalation valve and the other group wearing N95 masks with an exhalation valve. We tracked changes in partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and respiratory rate over 72 minutes of mask use. All subjects were monitored every 15 minutes, the first 30 minutes while not wearing a mask and the next 30 minutes while wearing a mask. They then performed a 12-minute walking test. RESULTS: The children did not experience a statistically significant change in oxygen saturation or pulse rate during the study. There were significant increases in respiratory rate and PETCO2 in the children wearing an N95 mask without an exhalation valve, whereas these increases were seen in the children wearing a mask with an exhalation valve only after the walking test. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an N95 mask could potentially cause breathing difficulties in children if the mask does not have an exhalation valve, particularly during a physical activity. We believe that wearing a surgical mask may be more appropriate for children.","Lubrano, Riccardo; Bloise, Silvia; Marcellino, Alessia; Ciolli, Claudia Proietti; Testa, Alessia; De Luca, Enrica; Dilillo, Anna; Mallardo, Saverio; Isoldi, Sara; Martucci, Vanessa; Sanseviero, MariaTeresa; Del Giudice, Emanuela; Malvaso, Concetta; Iacovelli, Claudio; Leone, Rita; Iorfida, Donatella; Ventriglia, Flavia",J. pediatr.

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of COPD patients among the population with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with positive PCR test were included in our multicentered, retrospective study. Patients with airway obstruction (previous spirometry) were included in 'COPD group'. RESULTS: The prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was 4.96%(53/1069). There was a significant difference between COPD and non-COPD COVID-19 patients in terms of gender, mean age, presence of dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia and presence of pneumonia. The mortality rate was 13.2% in COPD, 7% in non-COPD patients(p = 0.092). The significant predictors of mortality were higher age, lymphopenia (p < 0.001), hypoxemia (p = 0.028), high D-dimer level (p = 0.011), and presence of pneumonia (p = 0.043) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our research is one of the first studies investigating characteristics of COPD patients with COVID-19 in Turkey. Although COPD patients had some poor prognostic features, there was no statistical difference between overall survival rates of two groups. Age, status of oxygenization, serum D-dimer level, lymphocyte count and pneumonia were significantly associated parameters with mortality in COVID-19.","Turan, Onur; Arpinar Yigitbas, Burcu; Turan, Pakize Ayse; Mirici, Arzu",Expert Rev Respir Med,128,21

METHOD: Cross-sectional study based on a survey administered to medical and nursing staff. In May 2020, Argentine facilities with more than 500 annual births were contacted; 58 % of these were from the public sector. RESULTS: In total, 104/147 facilities answered (71 %). All had guidelines for care during the pandemic, and 93 % indicated they had been trained on how to use them. A companion was not allowed during childbirth in 26 % of private facilities and in 60 % of public ones (p < 0.01). Deferred cord clamping was recommended in 87 %; rooming-in with asymptomatic newborns was promoted in 62 %; breastfeeding using protective measures was recommended in 70 %; and breast milk using a bottle, in 23 %. In 94 %, family visiting in the Neonatology Unit was restricted. Difficulties included the unavailability of individual rooms for symptomatic newborn infants and a potential shortage of health care staff and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: All facilities are aware of the national guidelines to fight the pandemic. Most have the resources to comply with the recommended protective measures. There is uncertainty as to whether personal protective equipment, staff, and physical space available at the different facilities would be enough if cases increased significantly.","Geffner, Sofía C; Ávila, Aldana S; Etcharrán, M Luz; Fernández, Ariel L; Mariani, Gonzalo L; Vain, Néstor E",Arch Argent Pediatr,128,16

Reporting output, training impact, and quality improvement were measured. RESULTS: Reporting output increased by 140%. Trainee satisfaction was high in a qualitative survey, particularly for out-of-hours support and teaching. Clinicians found the service to be similar to the same service provided by a locally based radiologist. CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 era, remote working has developed rapidly. This study shows that radiology departments can provide remote reporting that is equal in standard to reporting from within the hospital, and in addition, that there are advantages to output and training.","Dick, E A; Raithatha, A; Musker, L; Redhead, J; Mehta, A; Amiras, D",Clin Radiol,128,16

In total, 4430 articles and other scientific literature were found, and 24 articles were included in this one-year narrative review. The mean BMI value of severe COVID-19 patients ranged from 24.5 to 33.4 kg/m2, versus <18.5 to 24.3 kg/m2 for non-severe patients. Articles using the terms obesity or overweight without indicating the BMI value in these patients were common, but this is not useful, as the anthropometric parameters, when not defined by this index, are confusing due to the classification being different in the West compared to among Asian and Korean criteria-based adults. We proposed a new term, called COVID obesity, to define the importance of this anthropometric parameter, among others, in relation with this pandemic.","Ovalle, Diana L Palacios; Rodrigo-Cano, Susana; González, Aránzazu; Soler, Carla; Catalá-Gregori, Ana I; Merino-Torres, J Francisco; Soriano, Jose M",Nutrients,128,12

Poor allocation of limited testing resources leads to misutilization of health system resources, which complementary rapid testing tools could ameliorate. OBJECTIVE: To predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity based on complete blood count components and patient sex. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control design for collection of data and a logistic regression prediction model was used. Participants were emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. 33 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and 357 negative patients at Stanford Health Care were used for model training. Validation cohorts consisted of emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in Northern California (41 PCR positive, 495 PCR negative), Seattle, Washington (40 PCR positive, 306 PCR negative), Chicago, Illinois (245 PCR positive, 1015 PCR negative), and South Korea (9 PCR positive, 236 PCR negative). RESULTS: A decision support tool that utilizes components of complete blood count and patient sex for prediction of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity demonstrated a C-statistic of 78 %, an optimized sensitivity of 93 %, and generalizability to other emergency department populations. By restricting PCR testing to predicted positive patients in a hypothetical scenario of 1000 patients requiring testing but testing resources limited to 60 % of patients, this tool would allow a 33 % increase in properly allocated resources. CONCLUSIONS: A prediction tool based on complete blood count results can better allocate SARS-CoV-2 testing and other health care resources such as personal protective equipment during a pandemic surge.","Joshi, Rohan P; Pejaver, Vikas; Hammarlund, Noah E; Sung, Heungsup; Lee, Seong Kyu; Furmanchuk, Al039; ona,; Lee, Hye-Young; Scott, Gregory; Gombar, Saurabh; Shah, Nigam; Shen, Sam; Nassiri, Anna; Schneider, Daniel; Ahmad, Faraz S; Liebovitz, David; Kho, Abel; Mooney, Sean; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Banaei, Niaz",J Clin Virol,128,2

Even if a rather mild course is assumed among pregnant women the measures to prevent transmission of the infection are of outstanding importance. METHODS: To screen asymptomatic pregnant women during admission to our university maternal hospital we focused on anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses. Hundred and fifty one women admitted to the hospital for childbirth or caesarean delivery were included. In case of suspicious anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels an RT-PCR was performed to confirm an ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 89% showed negative results for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA antibodies, whereas 3% were borderline and 7% positive (both labeled as suspicious). In only one patient with suspicious serology we detected SARS-CoV-2-RNA in the following RT-PCR. 2% presented anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies, all being positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA. The observed positive rate of our study collective of 10.6% seemed much higher than the expected one (1.3%) based on the reports of the Robert Koch Institute and the specifications given by the test's manufacturer. The expected positive predictive value (PPV) was 4.3-6.7 times higher than the observed one. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first report of anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels in the peripartum period of asymptomatic women. As the positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology poorly correlated with the confirmatory RT-PCR and the fact that mainly the detection of the virus by PCR correlates with the patient's infectiousness we suggest to rather perform a SARS-CoV-2-PCR-based admission screening in perinatal centers to prevent the spread of the disease.","Häusler, Sebastian; Weigl, Marco; Ambrosch, Andreas; Gruber, Rudolf; Seelbach-Göbel, Birgit; Fill Malfertheiner, Sara",J. perinat. med,128,1

According to risk communication researchers, effective, transparent, and timely information sharing is the most important tool after vaccines for responding to pandemics. This study aims to start a scholarly discussion on the risk communication efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed WHO's communication efforts during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the leading international health organization, WHO was responsible for providing rapid, up-to-date, and credible information for the public and the media. The selected research items were 42 news releases and statements provided by WHO between December 31, 2019, and March 30, 2020. These were subjected to qualitative and quantitative content analyses using the NVivo 12 qualitative analysis software program for coding. The data were coded under 6 variables (date of publication, topics, frequency, wording of the COVID-19 outbreak, sourcing, and themes of the releases). While 54.7% of WHO's communications were devoted to the COVID-19 outbreak, more than half were not issued until March. That is, instead of early risk communication and clear warnings about the outbreak, WHO acted overcautiously, preferring messages related to solidarity and cooperation during the most devastating pandemic of the 21st century.","Toker, Huriye",Int J Health Serv,128,28

The aim of this study was to assess eating habits and lifestyle behaviors among residents of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during the lockdown. A cross-sectional study among adult residents of the MENA region was conducted using an online questionnaire designed on Google Forms during April 2020. A total of 2970 participants from 18 countries participated in the current study. During the pandemic, over 30% reported weight gain, 6.2% consumed five or more meals per day compared to 2.2% before the pandemic (p<0.001), and 48.8% did not consume fruits on daily basis. Moreover, 39.1% did not engage in physical activity, over 35% spent more than five hours per day on screens. A significant association between the frequency of training during the pandemic and the reported change in weight was found (p < 0.001). A significantly higher percentage of participants reported physical and emotional exhaustion, irritability, and tension either all the time or a large part of the time during the pandemic (p < 0.001). Although a high percentage of participants reported sleeping more hours per night during the pandemic, 63% had sleep disturbances.

Nowadays it has been proven that a deficiency of certain micronutrients in the diet can disrupt chemical, structural and regulatory processes in the organism, which negatively affects, first of all, the state of immune system. Zinc is one of the most significant essential trace elements affecting immunological resistance. The aim of the study was to substantiate the need of including zinc-containing products and diet supplements in the diet of the population during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the basis of the study of pathogenetic mechanisms of various disorders of the immunological status under zinc deficit. Material and methods. This review analyzes the data from scientific electronic libraries CyberLeninka, eLIBRARY.RU, the Google Scholar databases and bibliographic medical databases MEDLINE and PubMed-NCBI. Results and discussion. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, adequate zinc supply is especially important, due to its antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic effects. This element also regulates the severity of the cytokine response, exhibits antibacterial properties and helps to compensate for chronic comorbid diseases, which plays a particularly significant role in preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 and recurrent respiratory diseases. Prevention and correction of zinc deficiency is considered as one of the important measures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, aimed at increasing antiviral and general immunity, reducing the systemic inflammatory response and correcting hormonal and metabolic status. Conclusion. The pathogenetically substantiated inclusion of zinc-containing foods and supplements in the diet will enhance the immunity of the population during the SARSCoV- 2 pandemic.","Sankova, M V; Kytko, O V; Dydykina, I S; Chilikov, V V; Laptina, V I; Markina, A D",Vopr Pitan,128,16

Apart from association to neuromyelitis optica and other chronic demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, many other aetiologies are known. Particularly systemic infections and vaccination are considered potential triggers for immune mediated inflammation of the spinal cord. In the course of the current Covid-19 pandemic several cases of TM following Covid-19 infection have been described. Here we present a case of LETM following vaccination against Covid-19 with AZD1222, AstraZeneca. An extensive diagnostic work up was performed to rule out alternative causes, including prior and current Covid-19 infection.

Despite this, there has been little research to date on the relationship between loneliness and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. We studied these associations in a sample of the Japanese population. METHODS: Data were analysed from an online survey of 2000 adults undertaken in April and May 2020. Loneliness was assessed with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Information was also collected on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Regression analyses were used to examine associations. RESULTS: In linear regression models adjusted for demographic and mental health variables, both dichotomous and continuous loneliness measures were negatively associated with engaging in COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Logistic regression analyses further showed that loneliness was also associated with reduced odds for a variety of individual preventive behaviours including wearing a mask (odds ratio [OR]: 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.95), disinfecting hands (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.94) and social distancing when outdoors (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.92).

Animal experiments have shown that a variety of animals can become infected with the virus. While coronaviruses have been known to infect animals for decades, the true intermediate host of the virus has not been identified, with no cases of SARS-CoV-2 in wild animals. The screening of wild, farmed, and domesticated animals is necessary to help us understand the virus and its origins and prevent future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases. There is intriguing evidence that farmed mink infections (acquired from humans) have led to infection of other farm workers in turn, with a recent outbreak of a mink variant in humans in Denmark. A thorough examination of the current knowledge and evidence of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect different animal species is therefore vital to evaluate the threat of animal to human transmission and reverse zoonosis.","Prince, Tessa; Smith, Shirley L; Radford, Alan D; Solomon, Tom; Hughes, Grant L; Patterson, Edward I",Viruses,128,20

Design: Research Study. Setting: Clinical IVF treatment center. Patients: IVF patients treated at the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine. Interventions: Oocytes (GV, MII) and embryos (1 cell (1C); blastocyst (BL)) were donated to research at disposition by IVF patients. Follicular cells (cumulus (CC); granulosa (GC)) were collected from women undergoing egg retrieval after ovarian stimulation without an ovulatory trigger for IVM/IVF treatment cycles. Main Outcome Measures: The presence or absence of ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL mRNA using RT-qPCR and protein using capillary Western blotting in human oocytes, embryos and ovarian follicular cells. Result s: RT- q-PCR analysis revealed high abundance of ACE2 gene transcripts in GV and MII oocytes compared to CC, GC, and BL. ACE2 protein was only present in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL embryos, but other ACE2 protein variants were observed in all the samples. TMPRSS2 protein was present in all samples while mRNA was observed only at the blastocyst stage. All the samples were positive for CD147 and CTSL mRNA expression. However, cumulus and granulosa cells were the only samples that showed co-expression of both CD147 and CTSL proteins in low abundance. Conclusions: Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases combination (ACE2/TMPRSS2 or CD147/CTSL) in high abundance. Co-expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in MII oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts demonstrate that these gametes and embryos have the cellular machinery required and thus are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection if exposed to the virus. However, we do not yet know if infection occurs in vivo, or in vitro in an ART setting.","Rajput, Sandeep K; Logsdon, Deirdre M; Kile, Becca; Engelhorn, Heidi J; Goheen, Ben; Khan, Shaihla; Swain, Jason; McCormick, Sue; Schoolcraft, William B; Yuan, Ye; Krisher, Rebecca L",,128,26

Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects.

We conducted this retrospective case-control observational study with the hypothesis that low serum albumin at presentation can predict serious outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Methods: We included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed, hospitalized patients from March to July 2020 in a tertiary care hospital in the USA. Patients were followed for 21 days for the development of the primary endpoint defined as the composite outcome which included acute encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, the requirement of new renal replacement therapy, acute hypercoagulability, acute circulatory failure, new-onset heart failure, acute cardiac injury, acute arrhythmia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high flow oxygen support, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation or death;and the secondary endpoint of death only. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study the effect of albumin level and outcomes. Results: The mean age was 56.76 years vs. 55.67 years (P = 0.68) in the normal albumin vs. the low albumin group. We noticed an inverse relationship between serum albumin at presentation and serious outcomes. The low albumin group had a higher composite outcome (93.88% vs. 6.12%, P &lt; 0.05) and higher mortality (13.87% vs. 2.38%, P &lt; 0.05) in comparison to the normal albumin group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed higher odds of having composite outcomes with lower albumin group (odds ratio (OR) 10.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.74 - 24.97, P &lt; 0.05). In the subgroup analysis, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed higher odds of having composite outcomes with the very low albumin group (OR 7.94, 95% CI 1.70 - 37.14, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Low serum albumin on presentation in COVID-19 infection is associated with serious outcomes not limited to mortality. The therapeutic option of albumin infusion should be investigated.","Acharya, R.; Poudel, D.; Bowers, R.; Patel, A.; Schultz, E.; Bourgeois, M.; Paswan, R.; Stockholm, S.; Batten, M.; Kafle, S.; Lonial, K.; Locklear, I.",Journal of Clinical Medicine Research,128,22

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: Patients aged 18 or older with DME and/or PDR, nAMD, or RVO scheduled to be seen by a retina specialist during the mandated lock down period from March 14 - May 4, 2020 (COVID-19 period) and who had received an intravitreal injection in the 12 weeks prior. METHODS: Chart review was performed and demographics, ophthalmic diagnoses, procedures performed, and visual acuity at all visits were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity in patients who completed, canceled, and no-showed for the COVID-19 period visit. RESULTS: Of the 1,041 total patients in this study, 620 (60%) completed the scheduled visit, while 376 (36%) canceled and 45 (4%) were no-shows. In patients who missed the scheduled visit, the average delay in care was 5.34 weeks. In those who missed a visit, the visual acuity was assessed at the subsequent visit. Patients who canceled a visit were older, and patients who no-showed had lower baseline vision [mean EDTRS letters (±SE); no-show: 53.27 (±3.21), canceled: 60.79 (±1.11), completed: 62.81 (±0.84), p=0.0101] and were more likely to have DME and/or PDR [no-show: 13 (29%), canceled: 56 (16%), completed: 81 (13%), p=0.0456]. Patients who missed a visit lost more vision as compared to the patients who completed the scheduled visit [no-show: -5.024 (±1.88), canceled: -1.633 (±0.65), completed: 0.373 (±0.50), p=0.0028]. In particular, patients with DME and/or PDR [- 3.48 (±1.95) vs 2.71 (±1.75) letters, p=0.0203] and RVO [-3.22 (±1.41) vs 0.95 (±1.23) letters, p=0.0230], and to lesser degree with nAMD [-1.23 (±0.70) vs -0.24 (±0.56) letters, p=0.2679], lost vision compared to patients with same diagnoses who completed the scheduled visit. CONCLUSIONS: In patients requiring intravitreal injections, a delay in care of 5.34 weeks resulted in vision loss. It was seen in all patients but was more prominent in DME and/or PDR and RVO patients. Further studies are necessary to examine whether these vision changes persist over a longer duration of time.","Song, Weilin; Singh, Rishi P; Rachitskaya, Aleksandra V",,128,16

Fast, reliable and early clinical assessment of the severity of the disease can help in allocating and prioritizing resources to reduce mortality. In order to study the important blood biomarkers for predicting disease mortality, a retrospective study was conducted on 375 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to Tongji Hospital (China) from January 10 to February 18, 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and patient outcomes were investigated using machine learning tools to identify key biomarkers to predict the mortality of individual patient. A nomogram was developed for predicting the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophils (%), lymphocyte (%), high sensitive C-reactive protein, and age - acquired at hospital admission were identified as key predictors of death by multi-tree XGBoost model. The area under curve (AUC) of the nomogram for the derivation and validation cohort were 0.961 and 0.991, respectively. An integrated score (LNLCA) was calculated with the corresponding death probability. COVID-19 patients were divided into three subgroups: low-, moderate- and high-risk groups using LNLCA cut-off values of 10.4 and 12.65 with the death probability less than 5%, 5% to 50%, and above 50%, respectively. The prognostic model, nomogram and LNLCA score can help in early detection of high mortality risk of COVID-19 patients, which will help doctors to improve the management of patient stratification.","Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4-6 days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) across the spectrum of clinical disease-mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40-80% of COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is essential for the management, treatment, and tracking of clinical illness, and to inform the quarantine measures and social distancing that can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","McArthur, Laura; Sakthivel, Dhanasekaran; Ataide, Ricardo; Chan, Felicia; Richards, Jack S; Narh, Charles A",Am J Trop Med Hyg,128,22

Meeting these responsibilities is critical in the field of global health, where study abroad programs are often designed to provide healthcare services in under-resourced communities. Leaders in global health have thus formed working groups to study the ethical implications of overseas programming and have led the way in establishing socially responsible best practices for study abroad. Their recommendations include development of bidirectional programming that is designed for mutual and equitable benefits, focused on locally identified needs and priorities, attentive to local community costs, and structured to build local capacity to ensure sustainability. Implementation remains a key challenge, however. Sustainable, bidirectional programming is difficult and costly. In the present study, authors questioned how technology could be used to connect students of global health in distant countries to make socially responsible global health programming more accessible. Drawing on empirical research in the learning sciences and leveraging best practices in technology design, the authors developed a Virtual Exchange in Global Health to connect university students in the U.S. with counterparts in Lebanon, who worked in teams to address humanitarian problems in Syrian refugee camps. Early results demonstrate the value of this approach. At dramatically lower cost than traditional study abroad-and with essentially no carbon footprint-students recognized complementary strengths in each other through bidirectional programming, learned about local needs and priorities through Virtual Reality, and built sustaining relationships while addressing a difficult real-world problem. The authors learned that technology could effectively facilitate socially responsible global health programming and do so at low cost. The program has important implications for teaching and learning during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.","Bowen, K.; Barry, M.; Jowell, A.; Maddah, D.; Alami, N.

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were common (44% and 15%, respectively). Compared to those with sufficient vitamin D status, participants with vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency had strongly increased respiratory mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 2.1 (1.3-3.2) and 3.0 (1.8-5.2) overall, 4.3 (1.3-14.4) and 8.5 (2.4-30.1) among women, and 1.9 (1.1-3.2) and 2.3 (1.1-4.4) among men.

METHOD: Data come from a national sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults. Using an online platform, information was gathered during the third week of March 2020, and post-stratification weighted to proportionally represent the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and geography. RESULTS: Nearly 15 percent of sampled respondents were categorized as high risk, scoring 7+ on the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). This level of risk varied across social vulnerability groupings: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, families with children, unmarried, and younger respondents reported higher SBQ-R scores than their counterparts (p < .000). Regression results confirm these bivariate differences and also reveal that risk factors (food insecurity, physical symptoms, and CES-D symptomatology) are positive and significantly related to suicidality (p < .000).

The partially open state of S1 subunit in spike glycoprotein is considered vital for its infection with host cell and is represented as a key target for neutralizing antibodies. However, the mechanism elucidating the transition from the closed state to the partially open state still remains unclear. Here, we applied a combination of Markov state model, transition path theory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results explored a promising complete conformational movement of receptor-binding domain, from buried, partially open, to detached states. We also numerically confirmed the transition probability between those states. Based on the asymmetry in both the dynamics behavior and backbone C$\alpha$ importance, we further suggested a relation between chains in the trimer spike protein, which may help in the vaccine design and antibody neutralization.","Tian, Hao; Tao, Peng",,128,33

While complete recovery of language in chronic aphasia is rare, patients' naming ability can be significantly improved by speech therapy. A growing number of neuroimaging studies have tried to pinpoint the neural changes associated with successful outcome of naming treatment. However, the mechanisms supporting naming practice in the healthy brain have received little attention. Yet, understanding these mechanisms is crucial for teasing them apart from functional reorganization following brain damage. To address this issue, we trained a group of healthy monolingual Italian speakers on naming pictured objects and actions for ten consecutive days and scanned them before and after training. Although activity during object versus action naming dissociated in several regions (lateral occipitotemporal, parietal and left inferior frontal cortices), training effects for the two word classes were similar and included activation decreases in classical language regions of the left hemisphere (posterior inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula), potentially due to decreased lexical selection demands. Additionally, MVPA revealed training-related activation changes in the left parietal and temporal cortices associated with the retrieval of knowledge from episodic memory (precuneus, angular gyrus) and facilitated access to phonological word forms (posterior superior temporal sulcus).","Delikishkina, Ekaterina; Lingnau, Angelika; Miceli, Gabriele",Cortex,128,17

The current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted even greater expansion and implementation of teledermatology. This review discusses the research examining the potential impact of teledermatology addressing disparities in care. Recent Findings: Teledermatology appears to increase access to dermatology given expanded means to deliver care. Specifically, recent studies have found increased access among Medicaid-insured, resource-poor urban and rural, and elderly populations. Teledermatology implementation also facilitates education among providers at different levels of training. Still, as some patients have inconsistent access to the required technology, increased reliance on telemedicine may also potentially increase disparities for some populations. Summary: Teledermatology may serve to reduce disparities in health care access in many underserved and marginalized communities. Future research should continue to study implementation, especially given the expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, teledermatology may play an important role in ensuring equitable care access for all.","Maddukuri, Spandana; Patel, Jay; Lipoff, Jules B",Curr Dermatol Rep,128,16

It causes the Covid-19 disease in humans, which mainly affects the respiratory system, through inflammatory and procoagulant mechanisms at the level of alveolar microcirculation. Material and method: There are 145 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, treated in the Colentina Surgery Clinic during March-August 2020, whose cases were analysed to identify some elements that would help to improve the medical management of these patients from multiple perspectives. Discussion: There was a slight predominance of male impairments, and the ages of interest were mostly over 60 years. The cases that required surgery were in an absolute minority (14 cases). The operations were performed only in conditions of a surgical emergency.

A report of six cases with excellent outcome,18.084768,9.27583,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic is having considerable impact on cancer care, including restricted access to hospital-based care, treatment and psychosocial support. We investigated the impact on unmet needs and psychosocial well-being. METHODS: One hundred and forty four participants (77% female), including people with cancer and their support networks, were recruited. The most prevalent diagnosis was breast cancer. Forty-one participants recruited pre-pandemic were compared with 103 participants recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured participants' unmet supportive care needs, psychological distress and quality of life. RESULTS: Half of our patient respondents reported unexpected changes to treatment following pandemic onset, with widespread confusion about their longer-term consequences. Although overall need levels have not increased, specific needs have changed in prominence. People with cancer reported significantly reduced anxiety (p = 0.049) and improved quality of life (p = 0.032) following pandemic onset, but support network participants reported reduced quality of life (p = 0.009), and non-significantly elevated anxiety, stress and depression. CONCLUSION: Psychological well-being of people with cancer has not been detrimentally affected by pandemic onset. Reliance on home-based support to compensate for the lost availability of structured healthcare pathways may, however, explain significant and detrimental effects on the well-being and quality of life of people in their support and informal care networks.","Hulbert-Williams, Nicholas J; Leslie, Monica; Hulbert-Williams, Lee; Smith, Eilidh; Howells, Lesley; Pinato, David J",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),128,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all successive COVID-19 patients, hospitalized in four ICUs, with secondary deterioration and one or more respiratory samples sent to the mycology department. We used a strengthened IPA testing strategy including seven mycological criteria. Patients were classified as probable IPA according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) classification if immunocompromised, and according to the recent COVID-19-associated IPA classification otherwise. RESULTS: Probable IPA was diagnosed in 21 out of the 366 COVID-19 patients (5.7%) admitted to the ICU and in the 108 patients (19.4%) who underwent respiratory sampling for deterioration. No significant differences were observed between patients with and without IPA regarding age, gender, medical history and severity on admission and during hospitalization. Treatment with azithromycin for &#8805;3 days was associated with the diagnosis of probable IPA (odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-8.5, p = 0.02). A trend was observed with high-dose dexamethasone and the occurrence of IPA. Overall mortality was higher in the IPA patients (15/21, 71.4% versus 32/87, 36.8%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: IPA is a relatively frequent complication in severe COVID-19 patients and is responsible for increased mortality.

However, the spectrum of abnormalities associated with CIC has been highly variable. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature (until 1 June 2020) to assess CIC and disease severity during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were pooled mean differences in platelet count, D-dimer level, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen level between non-severe and severe patients, stratified by degree of hypoxaemia or those who died. The risk factors for CIC were analysed. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed using R version 3.6.1, and certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Of the included 5,243 adult COVID-19 patients, patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly lower platelet count, and higher D-dimer level, prothrombin time and fibrinogen level than non-severe patients. Pooled mean differences in platelet count (-19.7×109/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -31.7 to -7.6), D-dimer level (0.8μg/mL, 95% CI 0.5-1.1), prothrombin time (0.4 second, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and fibrinogen level (0.6g/L, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) were significant between the groups. Platelet count and D-dimer level were significant predictors of disease severity on meta-regression analysis. Older men had higher risks of severe coagulopathic disease. CONCLUSION: Significant variability in CIC exists between non-severe and severe patients, with platelet count and D-dimer level correlating with disease severity. Routine monitoring of all coagulation parameters may help to assess CIC and decide on the appropriate management.","Mitra, S.; Ling, R. R.; Yang, I. X.; Poon, W. H.; Tan, C.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is associated with central nervous system disease. We describe central nervous system manifestations in critical patients with COVID-19 at our tertiary center. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of all actively critical patients with COVID-19 admitted to our tertiary care academic center in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 22, 2020, with new onset of neurologic disease. Patients were grouped into 1 of 3 categories according to imaging and clinical features; encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and vasculopathy. RESULTS: A total of 27 of 76 (35.5%) critical patients with COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. Twenty patients (74%) were designated with COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, 2 (7%) with COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and 5 (19%) with COVID-19-associated vasculopathy. Sixty-three percent of neurologic findings were demonstrated on computed tomography, 30% on magnetic resonance imaging, and 44% on electroencephalography. Findings most often included ischemic strokes, diffuse hypoattenuation, subcortical parenchymal hemorrhages, and focal hypodensities within deep structures. Magnetic resonance imaging findings included diffuse involvement of deep white matter, the corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. For patients with large-territory ischemic stroke, all but one displayed irregular proximal focal stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of active critical COVID-19 admissions at our revealed a high percentage of patients with new neurologic disease. Although variable, presentations followed 1 of 3 broad categories. A better understanding of the neurologic sequalae and radiographic findings will help clinicians mitigate the impact of this disease.","Scullen, Tyler; Keen, Joseph; Mathkour, Mansour; Dumont, Aaron S; Kahn, Lora",World Neurosurg,128,1

Consensus has been reached on a set of representative research problems in services computing, such as service selection, service composition, service recommendation, and service quality prediction. An obvious fact is that most services keep constant changes to timely adapt to changes of external business/technical environment and changes of internal development strategies. However, traditional services computing research does not consider such changes sufficiently. Many works regard services as \textit{static} entities; this leads to the situation that some proposed models/algorithms do not work in real world. Sensing various types of service changes is of great significance to the practicability and rationality of services computing research. In this paper, a new research problem \textit{External Service Sensing} (ESS) is defined to cope with various changes in services, and a research framework of ESS is presented to elaborate the scope and boundary of ESS. This framework is composed of four orthogonal dimensions: sensing objects, sensing contents, sensing channels, and sensing techniques. Each concrete ESS problem is defined by combining different values in these dimensions, and existing research work related to service changes can be well adapted to this framework.

During periods with high test positivity rates, however, case numbers may be underreported, whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation. Here we investigated how the dynamics of new COVID-19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true COVID-19 incidence dynamics. We focused on the first pandemic wave in Switzerland (February to April, 2020), when test positivity ranged up to 26%. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were determined 2-4 times per week in three Swiss wastewater treatment plants (Lugano, Lausanne and Zurich). Wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection-to-case confirmation delay distribution, respectively, to estimate infection incidence dynamics. Finally, the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model. Incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases. In contrast, case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections. Under a regime of high-test positivity rates, WBE thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory.","Fernandez-Cassi, Xavier; Scheidegger, Andreas; Bänziger, Carola; Cariti, Federica; Tuñas Corzon, Alex; Ganesanandamoorthy, Pravin; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Ort, Christoph; Julian, Timothy R; Kohn, Tamar",Water Res,128,16

Moreover, social distancing adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic may predict weight gain due to decreased physical activity, increased emotional eating, and social isolation. While early studies suggest that many individuals struggled with weight management during the pandemic, less is known about healthy eating and weight control behaviors among those enrolled in weight loss programs. METHODS: The present study evaluated weight management efforts among weight loss program participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants' (N = 55, 90.9% female, 36% white, Mage = 49.8) demographics and body mass index were collected two months prior to the COVID-19 statewide shutdown. During the lockdown, an online survey assessed health behaviors, coping, COVID-19 experiences (e.g., social distancing, loneliness), and weight gain. Logistic regressions examined demographics, health behaviors, and COVID-19 factors as predictors of weight gain. RESULTS: Most participants (58%) reported gaining weight during COVID-19. Weight gain was predicted by challenges with the following health behaviors: physical activity, monitoring food intake, choosing healthy foods, and emotional eating. Loneliness and working remotely significantly related to emotional eating, physical activity, and choosing healthy foods. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness and working remotely increased the difficulty of weight management behaviors during COVID-19 among weight loss program participants. However, staying active, planning and tracking food consumption, choosing healthy foods, and reducing emotional eating protected against weight gain. Thus, these factors may be key areas for weight management efforts during the pandemic.","Borgatti, Alena C; Schneider-Worthington, Camille R; Stager, Lindsay M; Krantz, Olivia M; Davis, Andrea L; Blevins, Magdalene; Howell, Carrie R; Dutton, Gareth R",Obesity research &amp; clinical practice (Online),128,20

Due to a continuing organ shortage and ever-growing patient waiting lists, donation after cardiac death (DCD) is becoming more frequently utilized in order to close the gap between &#8220;supply and demand&#8221;. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of DCD and subsequent liver transplantations was performed. RESULTS: From May 2016 to September 2019, a total of 9 DCD liver transplantations were performed in our institution. All cases except one were primary liver transplantations. The recipients comprised 5 (56%) males and 4 (44%) females. The mean DCD donor age was 41±12 (22-57) years, with ventilation duration of 7±1 days and warm ischemia time 19±3 minutes. The average recipient age was 51±22 (4-73) years, with an average cold ischemia 3h:59m±27m and manipulation time of 23±5 minutes. Periprocedural mortality was 1 (11%). Hepatitis C recurrence was documented in 1 (11%) patient. The mean follow-up time was 19±13 (7-37) months. Until now, we have not observed any signs of ischemic cholangiopathy. CONCLUSION: DCD liver transplantation allows us to enlarge the pool of potential liver grafts, thus decreasing the time spent on the liver recipient waiting list.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association between chlorpromazine use and mortality among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational, multicenter, retrospective study at Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of first prescription of chlorpromazine during hospitalization for COVID-19. The primary endpoint was death. Among patients who had not been hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), we compared this endpoint between those who received chlorpromazine and those who did not, in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, clinical markers of disease severity, and other psychotropic medications. The primary analysis used a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 14,340 adult inpatients hospitalized outside ICUs for COVID-19, 55 patients (0.4%) received chlorpromazine. Over a mean follow-up of 14.3 days (standard deviation [SD] 18.2), death occurred in 13 patients (23.6%) who received chlorpromazine and 1289 patients (9.0%) who did not. In the primary analysis, there was no significant association between chlorpromazine use and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-5.40; p = 0.163). Sensitivity analyses included a Cox regression in a 1:5 ratio matched analytic sample that showed a similar result (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.91-3.06; p = 0.100) and a multivariable Cox regression that indicated a significant positive association (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.31-7.34; p = 0.010).

No specific treatments exist for COVID-19 at this time. New evidence suggests that therapeutic options focusing on antiviral agents may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms as well as those that lead to the decrease in the inflammatory responses. Flavonoids, as phenolic compounds, have attracted considerable attention due to their various biological properties. In this review, the promising effects and possible mechanisms of action of naringenin, a citrus-derived flavonoid, against COVID-19 were discussed. We searched PubMed/Medline, Science direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases up to March 2020 using the definitive keywords. The evidence reviewed here indicates that naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 through the inhibition of COVID-19 main protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), and reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme receptors activity. One of the other mechanisms by which naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 is, at least partly, by attenuating inflammatory responses. The antiviral activity of the flavanone naringenin against some viruses has also been reported. On the whole, the favorable effects of naringenin lead to a conclusion that naringenin may be a promising treatment strategy against COVID-19.","Tutunchi, Helda; Naeini, Fatemeh; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Hosseinzadeh-Attar, Mohammad Javad",Phytother. res,128,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. The OE-MRI was based on a respiratory-gated three-dimensional (3D) radial UTE sequence. For each patient, the percent signal enhancement (PSE) map was calculated using the expression PSE = (S100% - S21%)/S21%, where S21% and S100% are signals acquired during room air and 100% oxygen inhalation, respectively. Agreement of lesion detectability between UTE-MRI and computed tomography (CT) was performed using the kappa test. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in the mean PSE between mild-type COVID-19 and common-type COVID-19. Spearman's test was used to assess the relationship between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. Furthermore, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in region of interest (ROI) mean PSE between normal pulmonary parenchyma and lesions. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to test the difference in the mean PSE between different lesion types. RESULTS: CT and UTE-MRI reached good agreement in lesion detectability. Ventilation measures in mild-type patients (5.3 ± 5.5%) were significantly different from those in common-type patients (3 ± 3.9%). Besides, there was no significant correlation between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. The mean PSE of COVID-19 lesions (3.2 ± 4.9%) was significantly lower than that of the pulmonary parenchyma (5.4 ± 3.9%). No significant difference was found among different lesion types. CONCLUSION: OE-UTE-MRI could serve as a promising method for the assessment of lung function or treatment management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, F; Zheng, L; Shan, F; Dai, Y; Shen, J; Yang, S; Shi, Y; Xue, K; Zhang, Z",Clin Radiol,128,20

However, current computational methods have not studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver gene identification and combinatorial drug discovery for individual patients. Here, we developed a novel structural network controllability-based personalized driver genes and combinatorial drug identification algorithm (CPGD), aiming to identify combinatorial drugs for an individual patient by targeting personalized driver genes from network controllability perspective. On two benchmark disease datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs. Furthermore, CPGD enhanced cancer subtyping by computationally providing personalized side effect signatures for individual patients. In addition, CPGD identified 90 drug combinations candidates from SARS-COV2 dataset as potential drug repurposing candidates for recently spreading COVID-19.","Guo, Wei-Feng; Zhang, Shao-Wu; Feng, Yue-Hua; Liang, Jing; Zeng, Tao; Chen, Luonan",Nucleic acids res,128,24

Modeling ST data can be a challenge due to the plethora of independent and interacting processes which may or may not contribute to the measurements. Characterization can be considered the complement to modeling by helping guide assumptions about generative processes and their representation in the data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a frequently implemented type of characterization designed to mitigate the""curse of dimensionality""on high-D signals. For decades, Principal Component (PC) and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been used as a linear, invertible approach to DR and ST analysis. Recent years have seen the additional development of a suite of nonlinear DR algorithms, frequently categorized as""manifold learning"". Here, we explore the idea of joint characterization of ST data manifolds using PCs/EOFs alongside two nonlinear DR approaches: Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Starting with a synthetic example and progressing to global, regional, and field scale ST datasets spanning roughly 5 orders of magnitude in space and 2 in time, we show these three DR approaches can yield complementary information about ST manifold topology. Compared to the relatively diffuse TFS produced by PCs/EOFs, the nonlinear approaches yield more compact manifolds with decreased ambiguity in temporal endmembers (LE) and/or in spatiotemporal clustering (t-SNE). These properties are compensated by the greater interpretability, significantly lower computational demand and diminished sensitivity to spatial aliasing for PCs/EOFs than LE or t-SNE. Taken together, we find joint characterization using the three complementary DR approaches capable of greater insight into generative ST processes than possible using any single approach alone.","Sousa, Daniel; Small, Christopher",,128,26

In the context of hospitalization, the pandemic is expected to have a strong influence on affective reactions and preventive behaviors. Research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies for coping with the challenges of the pandemic. Therefore, this survey study investigates the effects that personality traits, risk-taking behaviors, and anxiety have on medical service-related affective reactions and anticipated behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify key factors that are associated with individuals' concerns about hygiene in hospitals and the postponement of surgeries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 929 residents in Germany (women: 792/929, 85.3%; age: mean 35.2 years, SD 12.9 years). Hypotheses were tested by conducting a saturated path analysis. RESULTS: We found that anxiety had a direct effect on people's concerns about safety (ß=-.12, 95% CI -.20 to -.05) and hygiene in hospitals (ß=.16, 95% CI .08 to .23). Risk-taking behaviors and personality traits were not associated with concerns about safety and hygiene in hospitals or anticipated behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that distinct interventions and information campaigns are not necessary for individuals with different personality traits or different levels of risk-taking behavior. However, we recommend that health care workers should carefully address anxiety when interacting with patients.","Ostermann, Thomas; Gampe, Julia; Röer, Jan Philipp; Radtke, Theda",J Med Internet Res,128,20

No effective treatment exists today. Fat grafting has shown promise in alleviating neuropathic pain, yet the exact mechanism of action, at a biological level, is not yet known. We report on the first human study using autologous fat grafting for treating PHN. Our hypothesis was that fat grafting can alleviate pain and improve the quality of life (QoL) in patients suffering from PHN. If successful, this could be a safe, cost-effective alternative to analgesics. This safety and feasibility study aimed to investigate the possible pain-relieving effect of autologous fat grafting on PHN. METHODS: Ten adult patients suffering from PHN underwent autologous fat grafting to a dermal area of neuralgia, with a 12-week follow up. The primary endpoint was patient-reported pain. Secondary endpoints were patient-reported changes in QoL, and the degree and quality of the neuropathic pain. RESULTS: The pain was measured by using a visual analog scale (range: 0-10). We observed improvements in both the average and maximum level of pain with a reduction of (-4.0 ± 3.1) and (-5.1 ± 3.9), respectively, (&#916; mean ± SD), P<0.05. All parameters investigating neuropathic pain were significantly reduced. No improvement was seen in the QoL. The average amount of fat grafted was 208 ml. We observed no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that autologous fat grafting can relieve chronic pain resulting from HZ. The next step toward routine clinical translation is to perform a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial with a more extended follow-up period.","Sollie, Martin; Thomsen, Jørn Bo; Sørensen, Jens Ahm",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,128,16

Besides traditional risk factors, dysregulation of lung immune defenses and microbiota may play an important role in ARDS patients. Prone positioning does not seem to be associated with a higher risk of pulmonary infection. Although bacteria associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ARDS patients are similar to those in patients without ARDS, atypical pathogens (Aspergillus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus) may also be responsible for infection in ARDS patients. Diagnosing pulmonary infection in ARDS patients is challenging, and requires a combination of clinical, biological and microbiological criteria. The role of modern tools (e.g., molecular methods, metagenomic sequencing, etc.) remains to be evaluated in this setting. One of the challenges of antimicrobial treatment is antibiotics diffusion into the lungs. Although targeted delivery of antibiotics using nebulization may be interesting, their place in ARDS patients remains to be explored. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the most severe patients is associated with a high rate of infection and raises several challenges, diagnostic issues and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics changes being at the top. Prevention of pulmonary infection is a key issue in ARDS patients, but there is no specific measure for these high-risk patients.

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions: Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results: Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

The study was conducted in a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Somerville (MA, USA), where traffic is the dominant source of air pollution. Measurements were made between March 27 and May 14, 2020, coinciding with a dramatic reduction in traffic (71% drop in car and 46% drop in truck traffic) due to business shutdowns and a statewide stay-at-home advisory. Indicators of fresh vehicular emissions (ultrafine particle number concentration [PNC] and black carbon [BC]) were measured with a mobile monitoring platform on an interstate highway and major and minor roadways. Our results show that depending on road class, median PNC and BC contributions from traffic were 60-68% and 22-46% lower, respectively, during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic conditions, and corresponding reductions in total on-road concentrations were 45-69% and 22-56%, respectively. A higher BC: PNC concentration ratio was observed during the lockdown period likely indicative of the higher fraction of diesel vehicles in the fleet during the lockdown. Overall, the scale of reductions in ultrafine particle and BC concentrations was commensurate with the reductions in traffic. This natural experiment allowed us to quantify the direct impacts of reductions in traffic emissions on neighborhood-scale air quality, which are not captured by the regional regulatory-monitoring network. These results underscore the importance of measurements of appropriate proxies for traffic emissions at relevant spatial scales. Our results are useful for exposure analysis as well as city and regional planners evaluating mitigation strategies for traffic-related air pollution.","Hudda, Neelakshi; Simon, Matthew C; Patton, Allison P; Durant, John L",Sci Total Environ,128,33

The subsequent social burden is a major concern. We aimed to assess the short-term HRQoL, physical function and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms of invasively mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated in our ICU. METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort study in a follow-up clinic. Patients completed a 6-min walking test (6MWT) to assess their cardio-pulmonary function around 2 months (early follow-up) from hospital discharge, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire for quality of life assessment around 2 months and at 6 months from hospital discharge and an anonymous web-based Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire for Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms at 2 months. RESULTS: 47 patients attended our follow-up program, mean age 59 ± 10 years, median pre-morbid Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) 2 [2-3]. The median distance walked in 6 min was 470 [406-516] m, 83 [67-99]% of the predicted value. Overall 1 out 3 patients and 4/18 (22%) among those with a good functional baseline prior to COVID-19 (CFS of 1 or 2) had lower (84%) than predicted 6MWT. EQ-5D-5L quality of life VAS was 80 [70-90] out of 100 at early follow-up with a slight improvement to 85 [77.5-90] at 6 months. Mobility, self-care and usual activities improved between the two timepoints, while pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety did not improve or got worse. The IES-R total score was greater than the threshold for concern of 1.6 in 27/41(66%) respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Patients recovering from severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation surviving hospital discharge present with early mild to moderate functional impairment, mildly reduced quality of life from hospital discharge with an overall improvement of mobility, self-care and the ability of performing usual activities, while a worsening of pain and depression/anxiety symptoms at 6 months and a large proportion of symptoms of post-traumatic distress soon after hospital discharge.","Carenzo, Luca; Protti, Alessandro; Dalla Corte, Francesca; Aceto, Romina; Iapichino, Giacomo; Milani, Angelo; Santini, Alessandro; Chiurazzi, Chiara; Ferrari, Michele; Heffler, Enrico; Angelini, Claudio; Aghemo, Alessio; Ciccarelli, Michele; Chiti, Arturo; Iwashyna, Theodore J; Herridge, Margaret S; Cecconi, Maurizio",Ann Intensive Care,128,16

These emerging therapeutics can modulate the immune response, reduce epithelial injury, target endothelial and vascular dysfunction, have anticoagulant effects, and enhance ARDS resolution. RECENT FINDINGS: Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy shows promise in earlier phase clinical testing, whereas a number of issues regarding clinical translation, such as donor and effect variability, are currently being optimized to enable larger scale clinical trials. Furthermore, a number of promising mesenchymal stromal cell therapy clinical studies for COVID-19-induced ARDS are underway. Recent studies provide support for several emerging ARDS pharmacotherapies, including steroids, statins, vitamins, anticoagulants, interferons, and carbon monoxide. The history of unsuccessful clinical trials of potential therapies highlights the challenges to successful translation for this heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Given this, attention has focused on the potential to identify biologically homogenous subtypes within ARDS, to enable us to target more specific therapies, i.e. 'precision medicines'. SUMMARY: Mesenchymal stromal cells, steroids, statins, vitamins, anticoagulants, interferons and carbon monoxide have therapeutic promise for ARDS.

This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection. The mucosal immunity and the production of IgA antibodies accompanying its development reduces the likelihood of developing an antibody-dependent infection enhancement, which is usually associated only with immunopathological IgG antibodies.","Zaichuk, T A; Nechipurenko, Y D; Adzhubey, A A; Onikienko, S B; Chereshnev, V A; Zainutdinov, S S; Kochneva, G V; Netesov, S V; Matveeva, O V",Mol Biol (Mosk),128,16

Swab samples were collected from infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available viral transport solution and the in-house DS. Samples were tested by RT-qPCR, and exposure to infective viruses was also accessed by ELISA. The DS used did not interfere with viral genome detection and was able to maintain RNA integrity for up to 16 days at room temperature. Furthermore, virus loaded onto DS were inactivated, as attested by attempts to grow SARS-CoV-2 in cell monolayers after DS desalt filtration to remove toxic residues. The DS described here provides a strategy to maintain diagnostic accuracy and protects diagnostic laboratory personnel from accidental infection, as it has helped to protect our lab crew.","Carvalho, Alex F; Rocha, Raissa P; Gonçalves, Andreza P; Silva, Thaís B S; Sato, Hugo I; Vuitika, Larissa; Bagno, Flavia F; Sérgio, Sarah A R; Figueiredo, Maria M; Martins, Ronaldo B; Souza, Juliano P; Arruda, Eurico; Fernandes, Ana P S M; Alves, Pedro A; Teixeira, Santuza M R; da Fonseca, Flavio G",Braz J Microbiol,128,16

Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome was deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies, such as Brazil. Additionally, RT-qPCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually performs testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-qPCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patient's samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-qPCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-qPCR show general accuracy of 96%, and 98% when only samples with CT values (gene N) lower than 30 are considered. We have also developed an online platform, termed VarsVID, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets generation, sample sheet for sequencing and results' display are all features provided by VarsVID. Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","de Mello Malta, Fernanda; Amgarten, Deyvid; Val, Felipe Camilo; Cervato, Murilo Castro; de Azevedo, Bruna Mascaro Cordeiro; de Souza Basqueira, Marcela; Dos Santos Alves, Camila Oliveira; Nobrega, Maria Soares; de Souza Reis, Rodrigo; Sebe, Pedro; Gretschischkin, Michel Chieregato; de Oliveira, Diego Delgado Colombo; Nakamura, Carolina Naomi Izo; Chazanas, Pedro Lui Nigro; Pinho, João Renato Rebello",Sci Rep,128,26

METHODS: During the peak of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, we set up a multicentre cancer network amongst 14 National Health Service institutions, performing urological, thoracic, gynaecological and general surgical urgent and cancer operations at a central COVID-19 cold site. This is a cohort study of 500 consecutive patients undergoing surgery in this network. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and post-operative complications at 30-days. RESULTS: 500 patients underwent surgery with median age 62.5 (IQR 51-71). 65% were male, 60% had a known diagnosis of cancer and 61% of surgeries were considered complex or major. No patient died from COVID-19 at 30-days. 30-day all-cause mortality was 3/500 (1%). 10 (2%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 4 (1%) with confirmed laboratory diagnosis and 6 (1%) with probable COVID-19. 33/500 (7%) of patients developed Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complications, with 1/33 (3%) occurring in a patient with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: It is safe to continue cancer and urgent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic with appropriate service reconfiguration.","Kasivisvanathan, Veeru; Lindsay, Jamie; Rakshani-Moghadam, Sara; Elhamshary, Ahmed; Kapriniotis, Konstantinos; Kazantzis, Georgios; Syed, Bilal; Hines, John; Bex, Axel; Ho, Daniel Heffernan; Hayward, Martin; Bhan, Chetan; MacDonald, Nicola; Clarke, Simon; Walker, David; Bellingan, Geoff; Moore, James; Rohn, Jennifer; Muneer, Asif; Roberts, Lois; Haddad, Fares; Kelly, John D",Int J Surg,128,1

Here, we argue that the hero narrative in itself need not be problematic, but highlight a number of wider factors that have led to the initial rise (and subsequent fall) in support for labelling frontline workers as heroes. Through our related work, we have gathered similar stories from frontline workers where they feel betrayed, let down or otherwise short-changed by the hero label, and we have sought to make sense of this through understanding more about how the hero label is used rather than what it means. In this article, we propose a way forward where there is greater discussion around the hero label in this context where individuals can be heroes but still struggle, still fail and still feel vulnerable, and where heroism is viewed as a state of interdependence between heroic actor and the wider group. It is true that heroes can inspire, lead, guide and build morale and camaraderie, but collective responsibility is held with us all. We can draw hope and energy from our heroes, but we must dig deep and be proactive, particularly in the face of adversity.

It considers: both detected and undetected infected populations, medical quarantine and social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus possible reinfection. The coefficients in the model are evaluated by fitting to empirical data for eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York State, and Texas. Together these states make up 43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their initial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact and recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are larger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate from sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may have been well underway in several states before first detected and that California might have seen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on the current situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than two years. Should states fully relax stay-at-home orders, most states may experience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the number of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most states that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current $\sim$ 15% to $\sim$ 30%) will eradicate infections in the state of Texas within a year. Extending our fits for all of the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed cases, and 630,000 cumulative deaths by November 1, 2020.","Khan, Zeina S.; Bussel, Frank Van; Hussain, Fazle",,128,22

At our institute, patient-facing paediatric ENT appointments were replaced with telemedical consultations. METHOD: We performed a prospective analysis of the outcomes following telephone consultations with parents and describe our experience of remote consulting during a pandemic, and the possibilities for future applications of telemedicine in paediatric ENT. RESULTS: 215 patients were appropriately referred to the paediatric ENT clinic, 65% of these patients were deemed suitable for remote telephone consultation. Following a telephone call, 50% did not need further ENT clinic management, most commonly due to being listed for surgery (20%) or discharged (18%). The treating consultant assessed 81% of phone consultations as being effective. When given the choice, patients reported that 29% would choose a telephone consultation whilst 43% preferred a face to face consultation. CONCLUSION: Our experience has shown that there are areas of paediatric ENT that can be streamlined effectively by substituting face to face consultations with telephone consultations. However, prospective evaluation of these remote contacts suggest that telephone consultations are not a panacea and cannot be indiscriminately applied to all. Instead, the strategies to take forwards into a post Covid19 practice are vetting of referrals, individualised treatment plans, and giving patients a choice.","Sharma, Shradha; Daniel, Mat",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,128,25

Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used. The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed. A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission. The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74). However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01). Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin. This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.","Luo, Pan; Qiu, Lin; Liu, Yi; Liu, Xiu-Lan; Zheng, Jian-Ling; Xue, Hui-Ying; Liu, Wen-Hua; Liu, Dong; Li, Juan",Am J Trop Med Hyg,128,1

This study investigated knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian migrant workers (IMWs) in Macao (SAR), Hong Kong (SAR), and Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey in February and March 2020 to gain information on (1) participants' sociodemographic characteristics, (2) experience and awareness regarding COVID-19 information, and (3) knowledge and understanding of COVID-19. A series of Chi-squared, t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 491 participants (92.1% female). Knowledge of COVID-19 was obtained from multiple sources, including a large proportion from online social media. However, participants who obtained information from their employer, local social networks, and migrant organisations answered a greater number of questions correctly. One-third of participants reported receiving hoax, fake news, and incorrect information and obtained information from unverified sources. Participants were most interested in information about how to cure COVID-19, and 57.8% knew that no specific drug or vaccine was currently available. Almost all participants correctly identified fever and wearing a facemask as the main COVID-19 symptom and prevention strategy, respectively. Participants with senior high school or higher education and who worked as domestic or care workers had a greater knowledge of COVID-19 than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Public health communication strategies using multiple channels, including employers and community organisations, would help to minimise COVID-19 knowledge gaps. In addition, it is recommended that digital literacy content is added to public health campaigns.","Liem, A; Wang, C; Dong, C; Lam, A I F; Latkin, C A; Hall, B J",Public Health,128,26

This study mainly aimed to (1) investigate behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination under various specific scenarios, and (2) associated factors of the afore-mentioned vaccination intentions. METHODS: A random anonymous telephone survey interviewed 450 Chinese adults from September 16-30, 2020 in Hong Kong, China. Nine scenarios of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccinations were measured combining effectiveness (80% versus 50%), safety (rare versus common mild side effect), and cost (free versus HK$ 500). RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination under the 9 specific scenarios was very low and varied greatly (4.2% to 38.0%). The prospective countries of manufacture also influenced vaccination intention (eg, Japan: 55.8% vs China: 31.1%). Only 13.1% intended to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest upon its availability. The attributes of effectiveness and side effect influenced vaccination intention most. Positively associated factors of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination included trust/satisfaction toward the government, exposure to positive social media information about COVID-19 vaccines, descriptive norms, perceived impact on the pandemic, perceived duration of protectiveness, and life satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Intention of COVID-19 vaccination was low in the Hong Kong general population, especially among younger people, females, and single people. Health promotion is warranted to enhance the intention. The significant factors identified in this study may be considered when designing such health promotion. Future research is required to confirm the findings in other countries. Such studies should pay attention to the specific context of cost, safety, and effectiveness, which would lead to different responses in the level of behavioral intention of COVID-19 vaccination (BICV).","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph T F; Lau, Mason M C; Wong, Martin C S; Chan, Paul K S",Int. j. health policy manag,128,16

The pandemic has also increased the use of hypofractionated treatment schedules where magnetic resonance-guided online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) can aid in dose escalation. This specialized technique requires increased staffing in close proximity, and thus the need for novel coverage practices to increase physical distancing while still providing specialty care. Methods and Materials: A remote-physician ART coverage practice was developed and described using commercially available software products. Our remote-physician coverage practice provided control to the physician to contour and review of the images and plans. The time from completion of image registration to the beginning of treatment was recorded for 20 fractions before remote-physician ART coverage and 14 fractions after implementation of remote-physician ART coverage. Visual quality was calculated using cross-correlation between the treatment delivery and remote-physician computer screens. Results: For the 14 fractions after implementation, the average time from image registration to the beginning of treatment was 24.9 ± 6.1 minutes. In comparison, the 20 fractions analyzed without remote coverage had an average time of 29.2 ± 9.8 minutes. The correlation between the console and remote-physician screens was R =.95. Conclusions: Our novel remote-physician ART coverage practice is secure, interactive, timely, and of high visual quality. When using remote physicians for ART, our department was able to increase physical distancing to lower the risk of virus transmission while providing specialty care to patients in need.","Price, Alex; Kim, Hyun; Henke, Lauren E.; Knutson, Nels C.; Spraker, Matthew B.; Michalski, Jeff; Hugo, Geoffrey D.; Robinson, Clifford G.; Green, Olga",Adv.

Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%). Patients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.","Arbelo, Nestor; López-Pelayo, Hugo; Sagué, María; Madero, Santiago; Pinzón-Espinosa, Justo; Gomes-da-Costa, Susana; Ilzarbe, Lidia; Anmella, Gerard; Llach, Cristian-Daniel; Imaz, María-Luisa; Cámara, María-Mercé; Pintor, Luis",Psychiatr. q,128,1

Here we report the results of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies blind retesting of blood samples collected in the prepandemic period in Italy, and in control samples collected one year before, by two independent centers. Results suggest the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in some samples collected in the prepandemic period, though the detection of IgM and/or IgG binding and neutralizing antibodies is strongly dependent on the different serological assays and thresholds employed, while being absent in control samples collected one year before. These findings highlight the importance of harmonizing serological assays for testing SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading and may contribute to a better understanding the future virus dynamics.

Our aim was to review the most current data on COVID-19 to provide essential suggestions on how to manage the acute abdomen during the pandemic. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of the most relevant English language articles on COVID-19 and surgery published between 15 December 2019 and 30 March 2020. FINDINGS: Access to the operating theatre is almost exclusively restricted to emergencies and oncological procedures. The use of laparoscopy in COVID-19 positive patients should be cautiously considered. The main risk lies in the presence of the virus in the pneumoperitoneum: the aerosol released in the operating theatre could contaminate both staff and the environment. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, all efforts should be deployed in order to evaluate the feasibility of postponing surgery until the patient is no longer considered potentially infectious or at risk of perioperative complications. If surgery is deemed necessary, the emergency surgeon must minimise the risk of exposure to the virus by involving a minimal number of healthcare staff and shortening the occupation of the operating theatre. In case of a lack of security measures to enable safe laparoscopy, open surgery should be considered.","De Simone, B; Chouillard, E; Di Saverio, S; Pagani, L; Sartelli, M; Biffl, W L; Coccolini, F; Pieri, A; Khan, M; Borzellino, G; Campanile, F C; Ansaloni, L; Catena, F",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,128,16

We describe subsequent temporal changes in adolescent TB disease notification rates for the decade 2005-2015. METHOD: We conducted an analysis of patient-level adolescent (age 10-19 years) TB disease data, obtained from an electronic TB register in the Breede Valley sub-district, Western Cape Province, South Africa, for 2005-2015. Numerators were annual TB notifications (HIV-related and HIV-unrelated); denominators were mid-year population estimates. Period averages of TB rates were obtained using time series modeling. Temporal trends in TB rates were explored using the Mann-Kendall test. FINDINGS: The average adolescent TB disease notification rate was 477 per 100,000 for all TB patients (all-TB) and 361 per 100,000 for microbiologically-confirmed patients. The adolescent all-TB rate declined by 45% from 662 to 361 per 100,000 and the microbiologically-confirmed TB rate by 38% from 492 to 305 per 100,000 between 2005-2015, driven mainly by rapid decreases for the period 2005-2009. There was a statistically significant negative temporal trend in both all-TB (per 100,000) (declined by 48%; from 662 to 343; p = 0·028) and microbiologically confirmed TB (per 100,000) (declined by 49%; from 492 to 252; p = 0·027) for 2005-2009, which was not observed for the period 2009-2015 (rose 5%; from 343 to 361; p = 0·764 and rose 21%; from 252 to 305; p = 1·000, respectively). INTERPRETATION: We observed an encouraging fall in adolescent TB disease rates between 2005-2009 with a subsequent plateau during 2010-2015, suggesting that additional interventions are needed to sustain initial advances in TB control.","Bunyasi, Erick Wekesa; Mulenga, Humphrey; Luabeya, Angelique K K; Shenje, Justin; Mendelsohn, Simon C; Nemes, Elisa; Tameris, Michele; Wood, Robin; Scriba, Thomas J; Hatherill, Mark",PLoS One,128,1

We analyzed the expression levels of ACE2 in the Oncomine and TIMER databases, the correlation between ACE2 and overall survival in the PrognoScan, GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases. The correlation between ACE2 and immune infiltration level and the type markers of immune cells was investigated in TIMER database. A prognosis analysis based on the expression levels of ACE2 was further performed in related immune cells subgroup. The ACE2 promoter methylation profile was tested in the UALCAN database. In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4+T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP. And the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced. What's more, we found that the expression of ACE2 decreased in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. In conclusion, ACE2 expression increased significantly in UCEC and KIRP, elevated ACE2 was positively correlated with immune infiltration and prognosis. Moreover, tumor tissues may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients with UCEC and KIRP, which may worsen the prognosis.","Yang, Jing; Li, Hongxia; Hu, Shengda; Zhou, Yafeng",Aging (Albany NY),128,33

This study analyzed plasma samples from 126 eligible convalescent blood donors in addition to 15 naive individuals, as well as an additional 20 convalescent individuals as a validation cohort. Multiplexed Fc Array binding assays and functional antibody response assays were utilized to evaluate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody composition and activity. Donor convalescent plasma samples contained a range of antibody cell- and complement-mediated effector functions, indicating the diverse antiviral activity of humoral responses observed among recovered individuals. In addition to viral neutralization, convalescent plasma samples contained antibodies capable of mediating such Fc-dependent functions as complement activation, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. Plasma samples from a fraction of eligible donors exhibited high activity across all activities evaluated. These polyfunctional plasma samples could be identified with high accuracy with even single Fc Array features, whose correlation with polyfunctional activity was confirmed in the validation cohort. Collectively, these results expand understanding of the diversity of antibody-mediated antiviral functions associated with convalescent plasma, and the polyfunctional antiviral functions suggest that it could retain activity even when its neutralizing capacity is reduced by mutations in variant SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Convalescent plasma has been deployed globally as a treatment for COVID-19, but efficacy has been mixed. Better understanding of the antibody characteristics that may contribute to its antiviral effects is important for this intervention as well as offer insights into correlates of vaccine-mediated protection. Here, a survey of convalescent plasma activities, including antibody neutralization and diverse effector functions, was used to define plasma samples with broad activity profiles.

Because of the complex pathogenesis, high infectivity, and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there are no effective treatments for this epidemic at present. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a long clinical history in the prevention and treatment of such acute infectious diseases. The therapeutic effect of Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) on this new coronary pneumonia has attracted the attention of all walks of life, and relevant research reports continue to appear. Here, we intend to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of LHQW in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We will search each database from the built-in until Dec 2020. The English literature mainly search the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature come from CNKI, VIP, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD), and Wan Fang database. Simultaneously, we will retrieve clinical registration tests. This study only screens the RCT of LHQW against COVID-19 and evaluates its efficacy and safety.

As opposed to what was believed at the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has not only spread but persevere causing secondary waves and challenging the concept of herd immunity against viral infections. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals may remain asymptomatic, a fraction of individuals may develop low to high-grade severity signs and symptoms of COVID-19. The disease is multifactorial and can progress quickly, leading to severe complications and even death in a few days. Therefore, understanding the pre-existing factors for disease development has never been so pressing. In this scenario, the insights on the mechanisms underlying disease allied to the immune response developed during the viral invasion could shed light on novel predictive factors and prognostic tools for COVID-19 management and interventions. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed several molecules that significantly impacted critically ill COVID-19 patients, leading to the core mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Considering these findings and the fact that ACE-2 polymorphisms alone cannot explain disease progress and severity, this review aims at summarizing the most important and recent findings of the research and expert consensus of possible cytokine-related polymorphisms existing in the differential expression of paramount immune molecules that could be crucial for providing guidelines for decision-making and appropriate clinical management of COVID-19.","Paim, Adriana Alves Oliveira; Lopes-Ribeiro, Ágata; Daian E Silva, Daniele S O; Andrade, Luis Adan F; Moraes, Thais F S; Barbosa-Stancioli, Edel F; da Fonseca, Flávio Guimarães; Coelho-Dos-Reis, Jordana G",Immunol Lett,128,22

Accordingly, in silico drug repurposing strategy, has been highly regarded as an accurate computational tool to achieve fast and reliable results. Considering SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins and their interaction the host's cell-specific receptors, this study investigated a drug repurposing strategy aiming to screen compatible inhibitors of FDA-approved drugs against viral entry receptors (ACE2 and CD147) and integral enzyme of the viral polymerase (RdRp). Methods: The study screened the FDA-approved drugs against ACE2, CD147, and RDRP by virtual screening and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results: The results of this study indicated that five drugs with ACE2, four drugs with RDRP , and seven drugs with CD147 achieved the most favorable free binding energy (&#916;G < -10). This study selected these drugs for MD simulation investigation whose results demonstrated that ledipasvir with ACE2, estradiol benzoate with CD147, and vancomycin with RDRP represented the most favorable &#916;G. Also, paritaprevir and vancomycin have good binding energy with both targets (ACE2 and RdRp).

An individual is test-positive or test-negative accordingly if they took a test for a disease but tested positive or tested negative. Adding a control group to a comparison of test-positives vs test-negatives is useful since additional comparison of test-positives vs controls can have potential biases different from the first comparison. Bonferroni correction ensures necessary type-I error control for these two comparisons done simultaneously. We propose two new methods for inference which have better interpretability and higher statistical power for these designs. These methods add a third comparison that is essentially independent of the first comparison, but our proposed second method often pays much less for these three comparisons than what a Bonferroni correction would pay for the two comparisons.","Karmakar, Bikram; Small, Dylan",,128,16

Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in >5% of sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages.","Dearlove, Bethany; Lewitus, Eric; Bai, Hongjun; Li, Yifan; Reeves, Daniel B; Joyce, M Gordon; Scott, Paul T; Amare, Mihret F; Vasan, Sandhya; Michael, Nelson L; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Rolland, Morgane",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,128,20

A previously healthy 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital 3 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms including dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath progressing to intubation and increased mechanical ventilator support. A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction result.

Sixty hours after initiating remdesivir, the patient was successfully extubated and able to transition to room air within 24 hours of extubation. Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, that are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) are the three major coronaviruses of present-day global human and animal health concern. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is identified as the newest disease, presumably of bat origin. Different theories on the evolution of viruses are in circulation, yet there is no denying the fact that the animal source is the skeleton. The whole world is witnessing the terror of the COVID-19 pandemic that is following the same path of SARS and MERS, and seems to be more severe. In addition to humans, several species of animals are reported to have been infected with these life-threatening viruses. The possible routes of transmission and their zoonotic potentialities are the subjects of intense research. This review article aims to overview the link of all these three deadly coronaviruses among animals along with their phylogenic evolution and cross-species transmission. This is essential since animals as pets or food are said to pose some risk, and their better understanding is a must in order to prepare a possible plan for future havoc in both human and animal health. Although COVID-19 is causing a human health hazard globally, its reporting in animals are limited compared to SARS and MERS. Non-human primates and carnivores are most susceptible to SARS-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, whereas the dromedary camel is susceptible to MERS-coronavirus. Phylogenetically, the trio viruses are reported to have originated from bats and have special capacity to undergo mutation and genomic recombination in order to infect humans through its reservoir or replication host. However, it is difficult to analyze how the genomic pattern of coronaviruses occurs. Thus, increased possibility of new virus-variants infecting humans and animals in the upcoming days seems to be the biggest challenge for the future of the world. One health approach is portrayed as our best way ahead, and understanding the animal dimension will go a long way in formulating such preparedness plans.","Gautam, Aasish; Kaphle, Krishna; Shrestha, Birendra; Phuyal, Samiksha",Open Vet J,128,16

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using an online survey disseminated during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. METHODS: Survey data from 572 direct service providers working in the homeless, supportive housing, and harm reduction service sectors were analyzed for this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of paid sick leave benefits. RESULTS: One hundred one (17.7%) participants did not have any paid sick leave benefits. In the univariate models, paid sick leave was associated with older age, greater family income, full-time work, specific employment settings (supportive housing and not emergency shelters or harm reduction programs), having a regular medical doctor, and fewer occupational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age, full-time work, and non-receipt of emergency financial benefits remained statistically significant predictors in the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of service providers working with people experiencing homelessness have some amount of paid sick leave benefits, there is a precariously employed subset of individuals who are younger and working part-time in the sector.

Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State. RESULTS: A total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3-23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2-7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%). CONCLUSION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic. Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups. These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.","Lokken, Erica M; Taylor, G Gray; Huebner, Emily M; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Hendrickson, Sarah; Coler, Brahm; Sheng, Jessica S; Walker, Christie L; McCartney, Stephen A; Kretzer, Nicole M; Resnick, Rebecca; Kachikis, Alisa; Barnhart, Nena; Schulte, Vera; Bergam, Brittany; Ma, Kimberly K; Albright, Catherine; Larios, Valerie; Kelley, Lori; Larios, Victoria; Emhoff, Sharilyn; Rah, Jasmine; Retzlaff, Kristin; Thomas, Chad; Paek, Bettina W; Hsu, Rita J; Erickson, Anne; Chang, Andrew; Mitchell, Timothy; Hwang, Joseph K; Gourley, Rebecca; Erickson, Stephen; Delaney, Shani; Kline, Carolyn R; Archabald, Karen; Blain, Michela; LaCourse, Sylvia M; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,128,10

Although many of these vaccines are undergoing pre-clinical trials, several large clinical trials investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have produced promising findings. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we provide a status update on COVID-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials and discuss issues of concern beyond vaccine efficacy and safety, including dosing regimens, the mixed vaccine strategy, prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, antibody levels, cellular immunity and protection, variants of concern, COVID-19 vaccine distribution, vaccination willingness, herd immunity, immunity passports, and vaccine indications. EXPERT OPINION: Four vaccines have obtained emergency use authorization, 87 are at the clinical development stage, and 186 are in pre-clinical development. While the knowledge and development of COVID-19 vaccines is rapidly expanding, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines must outweigh the potential risks of adverse events. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should consistently update COVID-19-associated information, and healthcare authorities and manufacturers should work together to provide adequate and appropriate vaccinations for the prevention of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, I-Tzu; Chao, Chien-Ming; Lee, Ping-Ing; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Expert Rev Vaccines,128,29

Recognition of the associated risks of morbidity and mortality becomes not only imperative but also fundamental to determine the prevention strategies as well as targeting the high-risk populations for appropriate therapies. METHODS: We reviewed, collated and analysed the online database i.e. Pubmed, Google scholar, Researchgate to highlight the demographic and mechanistic link between obesity and associated risks of severity in COVID-19. RESULTS: We observed a changing dynamic in the reporting from the time of initial pandemic in China to currently reported research. While, initially body mass index (BMI) did not find a mention in the data, it is now clearly emerging that obesity is one of the profound risk factors for complications of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our review will help clinicians and health policy makers in considering the importance of obesity in making the prevention and therapeutic strategies of COVID-19. An extra attention and precaution for patients with obesity in COVID-19 pandemic is recommended.","Yadav, Rakhee; Aggarwal, Sandeep; Singh, Archna",Diabetes Metab Syndr,128,25

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs exist two different conformational states (lying or standing) in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Then, the differences in the immune responses to RBDs from these coronaviruses were analyzed structurally and immunologically. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies (antibody titers: 1.28×105; 2.75×105) were induced by the S-trimer with the RBD in the ""standing"" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S-trimer with the RBD in the ""lying"" state (HCoV-229E, antibody titers: <500), and more S-trimer-specific antibodies were induced by the RBD in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (antibody titers: 6.72×105; 5×105) than HCoV-229E (antibody titers:1.125×103). Besides, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was lower than S-trimer, and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.Importance Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in ""lying"" and ""standing"" states in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Here, we evaluated the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that the S-trimer and RBD are both candidates for subunit vaccines in Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) with a RBD ""standing"" state. However, for Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) with a RBD ""lying"" state, the S-trimer may be more suitable for subunit vaccines than the RBD. Our results will provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein in the future.","Shi, Yuejun; Shi, Jiale; Sun, Limeng; Tan, Yubei; Wang, Gang; Guo, Fenglin; Hu, Guangli; Fu, Yanan; Fu, Zhen F; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing",J. virol,128,15

The critical focus in our case study is to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy on intubated COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A multicentric prospective observational study of 1890 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy across 120 hospitals was conducted over 7 weeks in Spain (March 28 to May 15, 2020). Data were collected with an innovative approach: instant messaging via WhatsApp. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: complications, achieved weaning and decannulation and survival. RESULTS: We performed 1,461 surgical (81.3%) and 429 percutaneous tracheostomies. Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (4-42 days) since orotracheal intubation. A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients, weaning was achieved, while 391 (24.2%) were still under mechanical ventilation and 383 (23.7%) patients had died from COVID-19. Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n = 842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy. The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks. Weaning could be achieved in over half of the patients with follow-up.

We conducted a survey-based human behavioral study in Laikipia County, Kenya, which is characterized by a dynamic human-wildlife-livestock interface. Questionnaires that assessed human-animal interactions, sanitation, and illnesses experienced within the past year were distributed to 327 participants among five communities in Laikipia. This study aimed to 1) describe variation in reported high-risk behaviors by community type and 2) assess the relationship between specific behaviors and self-reported illnesses. Behavioral trends were assessed in R via Fisher's exact tests. A generalized linear mixed model with Lasso penalization (GLMMLasso) was used to assess correlations between behaviors and participants' self-reported illness within the past year, with reported behaviors as independent variables and reported priority symptoms as the outcome. Reported behaviors varied significantly among the study communities. Participants from one community (Pastoralist-1) were significantly more likely to report eating a sick animal in the past year (p< 0.001), collecting an animal found dead to sell in the past year (p<0.0001), and not having a designated location for human waste (p<0.0001) when compared to participants from other communities. The GLMMLasso revealed that reports of an ill person in the household in the past year was significantly associated with self-reported illness. Sixty-eight percent of participants reported that bushmeat is available within the communities. Our study demonstrates community-level variation in behaviors that may influence zoonotic pathogen exposure. We further recommend development of targeted studies that explore behavioral variations among land use systems in animal production contexts.","Kamau, Joseph; Ashby, Elizabeth; Shields, Lindsey; Yu, Jennifer; Murray, Suzan; Vodzak, Megan; Kwallah, Allan Ole; Ambala, Peris; Zimmerman, Dawn",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,128,20

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the circTMBIM6/miR-27a/MMP13 axis in osteoarthritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in cartilage of osteoarthritis patients and normal human cartilage were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Osteoarthritis cell model was induced by IL-1ß and TNF-&#945;, and the expression changes of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in the in vitro model were detected. In addition, the in vitro regulation of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a in osteoarthritis was verified by transfection of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a plasmids, and the regulation of miR-27a on MMP13 was also verified. The dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) method was used to analyze the secretion and formation of soluble glycosaminoglycan sulfate (sGAG), and the effects of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a chondrocytes were evaluated. RESULTS: The expression levels of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis were higher than that of normal group, while the expression level of miR-195 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis was lower. After IL-1ß and TNF-&#945; treatment, the expression of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in chondrocytes increased, while the expression of miR-27a decreased. CircTMBIM6 overexpression reduced miR-27a expression but increased MMP13 expression. The circTMBIM6 gene knockout showed the opposite effect. CONCLUSIONS: CircTMBIM6 promotes osteoarthritis-induced chondrocyte extracellular matrix degradation via miR-27a/MMP13 axis.","Bai, Z-M; Kang, M-M; Zhou, X-F; Wang, D",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,128,16

Methods: The model was developed stepwise through applying theoretical models, interviewing older couples and community healthcare workers, as well as incorporating expert reviews. A 3-month pilot study was conducted to test the model's feasibility and its treatment effects by linear regression on 18 pairs of older couples aged 60 years+, who were equally divided into a couple-based intervention arm and a patient-only control arm. Results: The developed CCMM covered four theory-driven intervention modules: dyadic assessment, dyadic education, dyadic behavior-change training, and dyadic monitoring. Each module was delivered by community healthcare workers and targeted at older couples as the management units. Based on interviews with older couples and healthcare workers, 4 weekly education and training group sessions and 2-month weekly behavior change booster calls were designed to address older adults' main management barriers. These modules and session contents were evaluated as essential and relevant by the expert panel. Furthermore, the CCMM showed good feasibility and acceptability in the pilot, with non-significant yet more positive changes in physiological outcomes of diabetic participants and couples' well-being and exercise levels of these in the intervention arm than their controlled counterparts. Conclusion: We systematically developed a couple-based collaborative management model of diabetes, which was well-received by healthcare practitioners and highly feasible among older Chinese couples living in the community.

This is modelled by assuming an initial higher infections, keeping rise rate same. The sudden outbursts are captured using offset of values for these three states. Data from other states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are also analysed and they are found to be following the same constants as India is following. Worldwide, many attempts are made to predict outburst of COVID-19 and in the model, described in this paper, turning point is not predicted, as cases in India are still rising.

Objective: We aimed to determine if vaccination reduces hospital visits and severe disease in breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Design: Multicenter observational cohort analysis Setting: Eight-hospital acute care regional health system in Michigan, USA Participants: Consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care (EC)/hospitalization were eligible participants. Between December 15, 2020 and April 30, 2021, 11,834 EC encounters with COVID-19 infection were included. Exposures: COVID-19 vaccination Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary endpoint was rate of COVID-19 emergency care/hospitalization encounters comparing unvaccinated (UV), partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV) cases. Secondary outcome was severe disease represented as a composite outcome (ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death). Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from the electronic record. Vaccination data was obtained from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry and the Centers for Disease Control vaccine tracker. Results: 10,880 (91.9%) UV, 825 (7%) PV, and 129 (1.1%) FV were included. Average age was 53.0 +/- 18.2 and 52.8% were female. Accounting for the COVID-19 vaccination population groups in Michigan, the ED encounters/hospitalizations rate relevant to COVID-19 infection was 96% lower in FV versus UV (eB:0.04,95% CI 0.03 to 0.06, p <0.001) in negative binomial regression. COVID-19 EC visits rate peaked at 22.61, 12.88, and 1.29 visits per 100000 for the UV, PV, and FV groups, respectively. In the propensity-score matching weights analysis, FV had a lower risk of composite disease compared to UV but statistically insignificant (HR 0.84 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). Conclusions: The need for emergency care and/or hospitalization due to breakthrough COVID-19 is an exceedingly rare event in fully vaccinated patients. As vaccination has increased within our region, emergency visits amongst fully vaccinated individuals have remained low and occur much less frequently when compared to unvaccinated individuals. In cases of breakthrough COVID-19, if hospital-based treatment is required, elderly patients with significant comorbidities remain at high risk for severe outcomes regardless of vaccination status.","Bahl, A.; Johnson, S.; Maine, G.; Hernandez Garcia, M.; Nimmagadda, S.; Qu, L.; Chen, N.-W.",,128,32

METHODS: Single-center retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the hospital with acute ischemic stroke, between December 1(st), 2019 and June 30(th),2020. Outcomes were classified as none-to-minimal disability, moderate-to-severe disability, and death based on discharge disposition, and compared between two time periods: pre-COVID-19 era (December 1(st), 2019 to March 11(th), 2020) and COVID-19 era (March 12(th) to June 30(th), 2020). We also performed a comparative trend analysis for the equivalent period between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-five patients with a mean age (years±SD) of 68 ±16 were admitted from December 1(st), 2019 to June 30(th), 2020, with a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. Of these, 255 (44.3%) patients were admitted during the COVID-19 era. We observed a 22.1% and 39.5% decline in admission for acute ischemic stroke in April and May 2020, respectively. A significantly higher percentage of patients with acute ischemic stroke received intravenous thrombolysis during the COVID-19 era (p=0.020). In patients with confirmed COVID-19, we found a higher percentage of older men with preexisting comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus but a lower rate of atrial fibrillation. In addition, we found a treatment delay in both intravenous thrombolysis (median 94.5 min versus 38 min) and mechanical thrombectomy (median 244 min versus 86 min) in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were no differences in patients’ disposition including home, short-term, and long-term facility (p=0.60).

In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, complex psychosocial program to reduce metabolic syndrome. Members of both the intervention (n = 78) and control (n = 31) group were psychiatric outpatients with severe/persistent mental illness struggling with one or more symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Beyond the default elements of similar programs such as diet and exercise, the intervention covered medication use, sleep hygiene, stress management, as well as addressing spiritual needs, mindfulness, addictions, and self-care. Assessment of metabolic indicators were completed at baseline, at the end of the 11-week intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. The trajectory of change over time was significantly more favorable in the treatment than in the control group in terms of waist circumference (p = 0.013, η(2) = 0.093) and a positive trend emerged in relation to blood glucose level (p = 0.082, η(2) = 0.057). However, no statistically reliable difference was observed between the intervention and the control group regarding the other outcome variables (body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum triglyceride level, serum HDL cholesterol level, overall metabolic syndrome severity). These findings suggest that to produce more robust benefits, psychosocial interventions targeting the metabolic health of individuals with complex mental health needs should be either longer in duration if resources permit or narrower in focus (diet and exercise mainly) if resources are scarce.

It is important to investigate the transmission dynamic of COVID-19 to help understand the impact of the disease on public health and economy. While a number of epidemic models have been available to study infectious diseases, they are inadequate to describe the dynamic of COVID-19. In this paper, we develop a new epidemic model which utilizes a set of ordinary differential equations with unknown parameters to delineate the transmission process of COVID-19. Different from the traditional epidemic models, this model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well the lag between symptoms onset and the confirmation date of infection. We describe an estimation procedure for the unknown parameters in the proposed model by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm to the reported number of confirmed cases. To assess the performance of our proposed model, we examine COVID-19 data in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a variety of assumptions. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model. The estimated basic reproduction number suggests that the pandemic situation in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 is not under control.","Yi, G. Y.; Hu, P.; He, W.",,128,1

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome. Methods Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene. Results We identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Conclusion Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","Fadason, Tayaza; Gokuladhas, Sreemol; Golovina, Evgeniia; Ho, Daniel; Farrow, Sophie; Nyaga, Denis; Pan, Hong; Karnani, Neerja; Wong, Conroy; Cooper, Antony; Schierding, William; O’Sullivan, Justin M.",bioRxiv,128,1

Mycoplasma is an uncommon co-infected pathogen with SARS-CoV-2 and has not yet been reported. Computed tomography (CT), used as an accessory examination, may play a more significant role in this co-infection. CASE SUMMARY: A 49-year-old female presented with a cough, expectoration and chest congestion followed by elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. CT images showed ground-glass opacities in bilateral lower lobes and a patchy and striate shadow in the right upper lobe. Immunoglobulin M antibody of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was positive and real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of sputum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The diagnosis of CoVID-19 was made based on laboratory results, chest CT images, clinical manifestations and epidemiologic characteristics. She was treated with combination therapy for 17 d and showed a marked reCoVery. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycoplasma in CoVID-19 patients appears to be uncommon. CT is an acceptable method for the primary diagnosis and treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Combination therapy with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, traditional Chinese herbal medicine and interferon inhalation may be a reference for further progress in treating this co-infection.","Gao, Zi-Ang; Gao, Ling-Bao; Chen, Xin-Jie; Xu, Yu",World J Clin Cases,128,20

Figuring out the early event of immune dysregulation would provide a potential treatment for COVID-19. Recent evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the development of COVID-19 and may be responsible for the dysregulated immune response. Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, shows beneficial effects on various diseases through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that MitoQ could act as a potential treatment in COVID-19. MitoQ may alleviate cytokine storm and restore the function of exhausted T cells in COVID-19 patients through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In this article, we provide evidence to support the use of MitoQ as a potential treatment or adjunct therapy in the context of COVID-19.","Ouyang, Lichen; Gong, Jie",Med Hypotheses,128,0

In addition to multi-lineage differentiation capacity, MSCs play important roles in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. MSCs play a role in the outcome of the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases. A unique subset of MSCs accumulates in secondary lymphoid organs during malaria disease progression. These MSCs counteract the capacity of malaria parasites to subvert activating co-stimulatory molecules and to regulate expression of negative co-stimulatory molecules on T lymphocytes. Consequently, MSCs have the capacity to restore the functions of CD34(+) haematopoietic cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells during malaria infection. These observations suggest that cell-based therapeutics for intervention in malaria may be useful in achieving sterile clearance and preventing disease reactivation. In addition, MSCs provide host protection against malaria by reprogramming erythropoiesis through accelerated formation of colony-forming-units-erythroid (CFU-E) cells in the bone marrow. These findings suggest that MSCs are positive regulators of erythropoiesis, making them attractive targets for treatment of malarial anemia. MSC-based therapies, unlike anti-malarial drugs, display therapeutic effects by targeting a large variety of cellular processes rather than a single pathway. In the present review we focus on these recent research findings and discuss clinical applications of MSC-based therapies for malaria.

A condition of hypercoagulability has been frequently reported in COVID-19 patients, and this very fact may complicate KRT management. Sustained Low Efficiency Dialysis (SLED) is a hybrid dialysis modality increasingly used in critically ill patients since it allows to maintain acceptable hemodynamic stability and to overcome the increased clotting risk of the extracorporeal circuit, especially when Regional Citrate Anticoagulation (RCA) protocols are applied. Notably, given the mainly diffusive mechanism of solute transport, SLED is associated with lower stress on both hemofilter and blood cells as compared to convective KRT modalities. Finally, RCA, as compared with heparin-based protocols, does not further increase the already high hemorrhagic risk of patients with AKI. Based on these premises, we performed a pilot study on the clinical management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 associated AKI who underwent SLED with a simplified RCA protocol. Low circuit clotting rates were observed, as well as adequate KRT duration was achieved in most cases, without any relevant metabolic complication nor worsening of hemodynamic status.","Francesca, Di Mario; Giuseppe, Regolisti; Alessio, Di Maria; Alice, Parmigiani; Daniele, Benigno Giuseppe; Edoardo, Picetti; Maria, Barbagallo; Paolo, Greco; Caterina, Maccari; Enrico, Fiaccadori",J Crit Care,128,16

The acetaminophen absorption test (AAT) has been previously described as a direct method for assessment of GI function. Our study determines whether the AAT can be used to assess GI function in critically ill COVID‐19 patients, compared with traditional measures of GI function. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of critically ill patients with COVID‐19. SETTING: Three intensive care units at a tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty critically ill patients with COVID‐19. INTERVENTIONS: The results of AAT and traditional measures for assessing GI function were collected and compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the study cohort, 55% (11 of 20) of patients had evidence of malabsorption by AAT. Interestingly, all patients with evidence of malabsorption by AAT had clinical evidence of bowel function, as indicated by stool output and low gastric residuals during the prior 24 h. When comparing patients with a detectable acetaminophen level (positive AAT) with those who had undetectable acetaminophen levels (negative AAT), radiologic evidence of ileus was less frequent (20 vs 88%; P = .03), tolerated tube‐feed rates were higher (40 vs 10 ml/h; P =.01), and there was a trend toward lower gastric residual volumes (45 vs 830 ml; P =.11). CONCLUSION: Malabsorption can occur in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 despite commonly used clinical indicators of tube‐feeding tolerance. The AAT provides a simple, rapid, and cost‐effective mechanism by which enteral function can be efficiently assessed in COVID‐19 patients.","Southren, Daniel L.; Nardone, Alexa D.; Haastrup, Adeniran A.; Roberts, Russel J.; Chang, Marvin G.; Bittner, Edward A.",Nutr Clin Pract,128,21

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of severe or critical COVID-19 patients (≥18 years) admitted to one hospital in Kuwait. Fifty-one patients received intravenous tocilizumab, while 78 patients received the standard of care at the same hospital. Both groups were compared for clinical improvement and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The tocilizumab (TCZ) group had a significantly lower 28-day in-hospital mortality rate than the standard of care group (21.6% vs. 42.3%, respectively; p= 0.015). 55% of patients in the TCZ group clinically improved vs. 11.5% in the standard-of-care group (p< 0.001). Using Cox-proportional regression analysis, TCZ treatment was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.25; 95% CI: 0.11 - 0.61) and increased likelihood of clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio 4.94; 95% CI: 2.03 - 12.0), compared to the standard of care. The median C-reactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels in the tocilizumab group decreased significantly over the 14 days of follow-up. Secondary infections occurred in 19.6% of the TCZ group, and in 20.5% of the standard-of-care group, with no statistical significance (p =0.900).

There are no confirmed cases yet, but little is known about the infection possibility via contact with sewage or contaminated water as well as with aerosols generated during the pumping and treatment of these aqueous matrices. Therefore, this article presents a literature review on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human excreta and its pathways through the sewer system and wastewater treatment plants until it reaches the water bodies, highlighting their occurrence and infectivity in sewage and natural water. Research lines are still indicated, which we believe are important for improving the detection, quantification, and mainly the infectivity analyzes of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses in sewage and natural water. In fact, up till now, no case of transmission via contact with sewage or contaminated water has been reported and the few studies conducted with these aqueous matrices have not detected infectious viruses. On the other hand, studies are showing that SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable, i.e., infectious, for up to 4.3 and 6 days in sewage and water, respectively, and that other species of coronavirus may remain viable in these aqueous matrices for more than one year, depending on the sample conditions. These are strong pieces of evidence that the contamination mediated by contact with sewage or contaminated water cannot be ruled out, even because other more resistant and infectious mutations of SARS-CoV-2 may appear.","Giacobbo, Alexandre; Rodrigues, Marco Antônio Siqueira; Ferreira, Jane Zoppas; Bernardes, Andréa Moura; de Pinho, Maria Norberta",Sci Total Environ,128,2

Husbands’ knowledge, and wives’ attitudes and practices related to breast cancer screening are not well understood in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate husbands’ knowledge, and wives’ attitudes and practices related to breast cancer screening in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study collected data from 403 husbands in the holy city of Makkah through an online self-reported questionnaire over a period of 2 months, from May 6 to July 7, 2020. Tabulation, bivariate, and multiple regression analyses were the major tools used for data analysis. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the association between husbands’ knowledge and wives’ behavior regarding breast cancer screening methods. RESULTS: Husbands’ knowledge score (a 1-point increase) was significantly associated with the wives’ utilization of mammograms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.089, 95% CI 1.024-1.159) and breast self-examination (AOR 1.177, 95% CI 1.105-1.255). Husbands’ knowledge also influenced the wives’ attitudes toward learning about breast self-examination (AOR 1.138, 95% CI 1.084-1.195).

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, when one aims at evaluating the effects of interventions on disease spread. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamic of an epidemic when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution associated with the week and weekday of reporting and assumes a smooth epidemic curve. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the time-dependent case reproduction number R(t) based on predictions of the nowcast. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current epidemic, discuss limitations and alternative estimation strategies, and provide code for reproduction or adaption of the nowcasting to data from different regions. Results of the nowcasting approach are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis.","Guenther, F.; Bender, A.; Katz, K.; Kuechenhoff, H.; Hoehle, M.",,128,15

This led to the simulated patient (SP) program at the University of Bern being depleted of middle-aged and elderly SP. Meanwhile, an OSCE had to be delivered using adapted cases that minimized physical contact between candidates and SP. Short of suitable cases at such short notice, the case of an elderly patient with postural instability had to be added to the exam blueprint. With elderly SP off the roster, it was decided to use makeup effects to achieve visual authenticity. A combination of wigs (grey hair, hairdo), 3D Probondo transfers (forehead wrinkles), old age stipple (crow’s feet), and colouring (age spots) were used to achieve the old-age effects, while SPs wore scarves to cover their neckline. The lower face was covered with protective face masks in accordance with the exam’s Covid-19 hygiene protocol. Case-related feedback from candidates and examiners was analysed for any direct or indirect remark attributable to the ageing effects. As no comment touched upon the subject of the appearance of age, this was interpreted as success, as any distracting effect from the SPs’ appearance in this regard would surely have prompted remarks or even complaints. The SPs’ feedback revealed how applying the ageing effects helped them adopt the octogenarian’s role. This report explains how SP in their fifties were made fit for an octogenarian’s case in an OSCE using makeup effects. The effort required for the ageing simulation was considerable, but it is hoped that in future, with more planning time, the amount of effort required can be reduced. The feedback obtained from the candidates suggest the appearance of SPs was not experienced as a distraction, which was the primary objective of this exercise. Adapting our approach to their own contexts allows educators to include cases with elderly patients in their OSCE that cannot be re-written for younger SP, so long as Covid-19 prevents elderly SP from participating.","Bauer, Daniel; Germano, Miria; Stierlin, Johanna; Brem, Beate; Stöckli, Yvette; Schnabel, Kai P.",GMS J Med Educ,128,9

In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic 60% of patients had hepatic injury, due to phylogenetic similarities of the viruses it is assumed that COVID-19 is associated with acute liver injury. In this meta-analysis, we aim to study the occurrence and association of liver injury, comorbid liver disease and elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 confirmed hospitalizations with outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from observational studies describing comorbid chronic liver disease, acute liver injury, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020 was extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Adverse outcomes were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), severe disease and in-hospital mortality. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were obtained. RESULTS: 24 studies with 12882 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Overall prevalence of CM-CLD was 2.6%, COVID-19-ALI was 26.5%, elevated AST was 41.1% and elevated ALT was 29.1%. CM-CLD had no significant association with poor outcomes (pooledOR:0.96;95%CI:0.71–1.29; p = 0.78). COVID-19-ALI (1.68;1.04–2.70; p = 0.03), elevated AST (2.98;2.35–3.77; p < 0.00001) and elevated ALT (1.85;1.49–2.29; p < 0.00001) were significantly associated with higher odds of poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that acute liver injury and elevated liver enzymes were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Future studies should evaluate changing levels of biomarkers amongst liver disease patients to predict poor outcomes of COVID-19 and causes of liver injury during COVID-19 infection.","Sharma, Ashish; Jaiswal, Pragya; Kerakhan, Yasameen; Saravanan, Lakshmi; Murtaza, Zeba; Zergham, Azka; Honganur, Nagaraj-Sanchitha; Akbar, Aelia; Deol, Aran; Francis, Benedict; Patel, Shakumar; Mehta, Deep; Jaiswal, Richa; Singh, Jagmeet; Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti",Ann Hepatol,128,31

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progression of obesity in children and adolescents in Changshu, China. METHODS: Based on the Health Promotion Program for Children and Adolescents (HPPCA), which is a prospective cross-sectional and school-based study, BMI assessed in seven consecutive years (2014 to 2020) among children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in Changshu city was extracted. The standardized BMI z scores (zBMI) and prevalence of obesity between 2020 (after COVID-19 home confinement) and the previous 6 years were compared among age-specific subgroups and between sexes. RESULTS: The mean number of participants per year was 29,648. The overall mean zBMI drastically increased from 0.29 in 2019 to 0.45 in 2020, resulting in a rise of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.14-0.18); the prevalence of obesity substantially elevated to 12.77% in 2020 (versus 10.38% in 2017), with an acceleration of 2.39% (95% CI: 1.88%-2.90%).

We have reported that both the M(pro) C-terminal domain alone (M(pro)-C) and the N-finger deletion mutant of M(pro) (M(pro)-Δ7) exist as a stable dimer and a stable monomer (Zhong et al., J Virol 2008; 82:4227-4234). Here, we report structures of both M(pro)-C monomer and dimer. The structure of the M(pro)-C monomer is almost identical to that of the C-terminal domain in the crystal structure of M(pro). Interestingly, the M(pro)-C dimer structure is characterized by 3D domain-swapping, in which the first helices of the two protomers are interchanged and each is enwrapped by four other helices from the other protomer. Each folding subunit of the M(pro)-C domain-swapped dimer still has the same general fold as that of the M(pro)-C monomer. This special dimerization elucidates the structural basis for the observation that there is no exchange between monomeric and dimeric forms of M(pro)-C and M(pro)-Δ7.","Zhong, Nan; Zhang, Shengnan; Xue, Fei; Kang, Xue; Zou, Peng; Chen, Jiaxuan; Liang, Chao; Rao, Zihe; Jin, Changwen; Lou, Zhiyong; Xia, Bin",Protein Science,128,1

We aimed to understand the interaction between these diseases by profiling COVID-19 gene expression signatures on RNA-sequencing data from TB-infected individuals. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis by querying PubMed and pre-print servers to derive eligible COVID-19 gene expression signatures from human whole blood (WB), PBMCs or BALF studies. A WB influenza dataset served as a control respiratory disease signature. Three large TB RNA-seq datasets, comprising multiple cohorts from the UK and Africa and consisting of TB patients across the disease spectrum, were chosen to profile these signatures. Putative “COVID-19 risk scores” were generated for each sample in the TB datasets using the TBSignatureProfiler package. Risk was stratified by time to TB diagnosis in progressors and contacts of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. An integrative analysis between TB and COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data was performed and a population-level meta-analysis was conducted to identify shared gene ontologies between the diseases and their relative enrichment in COVID-19 disease severity states. RESULTS: 35 COVID-19 gene signatures from nine eligible studies comprising 98 samples were profiled on TB RNA-seq data from 1181 samples from 853 individuals. 25 signatures had significantly higher COVID-19 risk in active TB (ATB) compared with latent TB infection (p <0·005), 13 of which were validated in two independent datasets. FCN1- and SPP1-expressing macrophages enriched in BALF during severe COVID-19 were identified in circulation during ATB. Shared perturbed ontologies included antigen presentation, epigenetic regulation, platelet activation, and ROS/RNS production were enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity. Finally, we demonstrate that the overlapping transcriptional responses may complicate development of blood-based diagnostic signatures of co-infection. INTERPRETATION: Our results identify shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB as a dual risk posed by co-infection to COVID-19 severity and TB disease progression. These individuals should be followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Sheerin, Dylan; Abhimanyu,; Wang, Xutao; Johnson, W Evan; Coussens, Anna",medRxiv,128,10

It also computes the spread scenario and endpoints of disease. The proposed model also involves asymptomatic infectious individuals. To estimate the various parameters, we first collect the data and fit that using the Lavenberg-Marquardt model for death cases. Then we calculate infection rate, recovery rate, case fatality rate, and the basic reproduction number over time. We calculate two types of case fatality rates: one is the daily case fatality rate, and the other is the total case fatality rate. The proposed model includes the social distance parameter, various age classes, hospital beds for severe cases, and ICU beds or ventilators for critical cases.

Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey from August 8 to September 12, 2020, among adults ([≥]18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to STI&HIV testing and HIV care and sexual behaviours three months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes. Results We recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men, and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender; median age was 28y (IQR:23-37y), 531/957 (55.5%) were of mixed-ethnicity (mixed-Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181/470) cis-women, 58.4% (184/315) cis-men and 45.0% (27/60) non-binary participants; during COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230/800 [28.8%] of participants reported decreased casual sex compared to pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared to pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex were reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared to cis-women (39.2% versus 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.57-3.01); and by Afro-descendant compared to mixed-ethnicity participants (40.0% versus 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.07-2.94). Compared to no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increase in virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95%CI:1.10-2.88); and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95%CI:7.74-35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, STI&HIV testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58/100) participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8/15) HIV-positive participants.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of Kawasaki disease in acute stages in Taiwan, by linking the diagnosis code to medication and comparing the differences in epidemiological features with those of previous reports that used the diagnosis code alone. METHODS: We searched the National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010. For the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) set, all inpatients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1) were retrieved. For the ICD-9 + intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) set, Kawasaki disease in acute stages was defined as the disease stages requiring IVIG. The epidemiologic features were calculated and compared by both methods. RESULTS: The incidence rates for children under 5 years ranged from 21.5 to 68.5 per 100,000 person-years (average 49.1) for the ICD-9 + IVIG set and from 48.5 to 82.8 per 100,000 person-years (average 74.9) for the ICD-9 set. Significant discrepancy in peak season estimation occurred in summer. The 5-year recurrence rate was 1.1% for the ICD-9 + IVIG set and 4.5% for the ICD-9 set. The coronary complication rates were around 7.24% (ICD-9 + IVIG) and 6.48% (ICD-9). CONCLUSION: Discrepancies occurred when different case definitions were used in claims data analysis. Previous reports might have overestimated the incidence, recurrence rate, and complication rate in older children. The new method might slightly underestimate them.

CBT workbooks and teletherapy have been studied in FND, with preliminary studies suggesting efficacy; internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT have not but have been effectively used in patients with psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic disorders. As these disorders are often comorbid and share overlapping neurobiology with FND, internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT represent promising delivery options of CBT for FND. Although remotely-delivered CBT is unlikely to replace in-person CBT and there are technical and logistical challenges to overcome prior to widespread deployment, it holds promise as an adjunct treatment when in-person CBT is inaccessible. We propose a rational approach to future allocation of remote CBT treatment options and highlight important research gaps to bridge beforehand.","Lin, Amanda; Espay, Alberto J.",Epilepsy Behav Rep,128,1

To examine their response to the pandemic, we analyzed their perspective, and association with psychiatric symptoms and stress among HCW with psychiatric diagnosis. Using an online survey of HCW, we analyzed demographics, work information, health factors, open-ended question, sources of stress and standardized mental health scales (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)). Sixteen out of 129 HCWs reported a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis (median age 32 years, 8 were females, 8 work in the emergency department). Their perception of the impact severity on symptoms was significantly correlated with all the mental health scales and with stress from avoiding physical contact. In multivariate analysis, PSS score and PCL score were associated with self-rated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms (standardized beta = .51 for PCL and standardized beta = .55 for PSS). GAD-7 score was significantly related to both impact (standardized beta = .44) and stress from avoiding physical contact (standardized beta = .53). HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses reported a range of perception of the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms with increased severity associated with worse psychiatric outcomes and more stress from avoiding physical contact with others. There is a growing importance to protect HCWs mental health, including those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, and proactively counter psychosocial consequences of healthcare crises.","MacKenzie, Megan; Daviskiba, Sydney; Dow, Miriam; Johnston, Peyton; Balon, Richard; Javanbakht, Arash; Arfken, Cynthia L.",Psychiatr Q,128,14

Because the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic greatly affects older adults who have a preexisting health condition, they are generally susceptible to a high incidence of severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was completed in August 2020. Standardized and pretested General Anxiety Disorder–7 and Geriatric Depression Scale were used to screen the symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Data were entered into EpiData (version 4.3.2) and transferred to SPSS (version 24) for further analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the significantly associated variables with a 95% confidence interval at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Of the total older adults interviewed, 68.7% had developed symptoms of anxiety and 59.9% had symptoms of depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Female participants, having a chronic disease and poor knowledge of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Age category of 81 to 90 and above 90, lack of social support, and having a chronic disease were significantly associated with symptoms of depression. CONCLUSION: The symptoms of anxiety and depression among older adults in the North Shoa Zone during coronavirus disease 2019 were higher than before the coronavirus disease 2019 happened. The results were evidence points for developing a psychological intervention to tackle the older adults’ mental health needs in the community during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Jemal, Kemal; Geleta, Tinsae Abeya; Deriba, Berhanu Senbeta; Awol, Mukemil",SAGE Open Med,128,8

In total, 164 military personnel were affected, and two patients were admitted into the intensive care unit of the military regional central hospital. A HAdV-B [P14H11F14] virus was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of this acute outbreak of febrile respiratory illness based on clinical manifestations, epidemiological characteristics, specific molecular detection results, phylogenetic analysis, and serological assays. The virus was isolated by the rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture method, and the complete sequences of the E1A, penton base, hexon, and fiber genes were determined and deposited in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses indicated that the isolated strain is most closely related to some HAdV-55 strains from mainland China. However, this strain appeared to be less virulent than former HAdV-55 strains. According to the chest X-ray results of 31 affected patients, there was no radiological evidence of pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms in these patients were sore throat (95.12 %, 156/164) and tonsillitis (93.29 %, 153/164). During the course of the outbreak, incorrect response measures and some potential risk factors, such as fire training and marching training, may have exacerbated the spread of the infection. This outbreak illustrates the urgent need to improve the epidemiological and etiological surveillance of HAdV infections and to improve the ability of doctors and health officials in basic units of the Chinese army to respond effectively to febrile respiratory illness.","Dongliu, Yuan; Guoliang, Yang; Haocheng, Xu; Shuaijia, Qing; Li, Bing; Yanglei, Jia",Arch Virol,128,16

However, there are limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC(50)) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC(50) of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) & 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) & 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) & 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who were intubated, had cardiac injury, or acute kidney injury from COVID-19 infection had higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.","Tang, Mei San; Case, James Brett; Franks, Caroline E; Chen, Rita E; Anderson, Neil W; Henderson, Jeffrey P; Diamond, Michael S; Gronowski, Ann M; Farnsworth, Christopher W",Clin Chem,128,1

Limited reports describing EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 have been published. These articles reported nonspecific encephalopathic patterns, epileptiform discharges, and rarely seizures. Our primary aim was to assess EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate for epileptiform activity or seizures. METHODS: We identified five critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who underwent EEG monitoring. All patients had Ceribell™ rapid response EEG initially and two continued with conventional long-term video EEG. RESULTS: All 5 patients had encephalopathy and 3 also had seizure-like movements, thus prompting EEG monitoring. EEGs all showed nonspecific markers of encephalopathy including diffuse slowing and generalized rhythmic delta activity. Two also had epileptiform discharges reaching 2-3 Hz at times, with one patient in nonconvulsive status epilepticus and the other developing clinical status epilepticus with myoclonic movements. EEG and clinical symptoms improved with anti-seizure medications. CONCLUSION: Status epilepticus was present in 2 out of our cohort of 5 critically ill patients who underwent EEG monitoring. These findings highlight the importance of EEG monitoring in high-risk patients with COVID-19 and encephalopathy. EEG recordings in such patients can identify pathological patterns that will benefit from treatment with anti-seizure medications.","Chen, Wendy; Toprani, Sheela; Werbaneth, Katherine; Falco-Walter, Jessica",Seizure,128,12

Recently, we have demonstrated that caspase-6 plays a critical role in influenza A virus (IAV)-induced cell death and innate immune responses. During IAV infection, Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) initiates ZBP1-PANoptosome assembly to drive inflammasome activation and cell death, and we showed that caspase-6 interacts with RIPK3 to enhance the interaction between RIPK3 and ZBP1, thus promoting PANoptosome assembly. Moreover, the caspase activity of caspase-6 is not required for tins process, suggesting a caspase-independent function of caspase-6 during IAV infection. Additionally, we found that caspase-6 is required for the alternative activation of alveolar macrophages in response to IAV infection. Our findings provide an opportunity to reconsider the physiological role of caspase-6.","Zheng, Min; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",J Cell Immunol,128,1

Early parenting mediates infant experiences from birth, and early intervention can support sensitive and responsive parent practices that optimize infant outcomes via promoting developmental competencies. However, low-income and depressed mothers experience substantial challenges to participating in early intervention. They also have extremely limited access to interventions targeting depression. Interventions targeting maternal depression and parent practices can improve maternal and infant outcomes. Mobile internet-based interventions overcome numerous barriers that low-resource mothers face in accessing home-based interventions. Pandemic-related stressors likely reduce family resources and exacerbate distress of already heavily-burdened mother-infant dyads. During crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence-based remote coaching interventions are paramount. This article reports on a mobile intervention for improving maternal mood and increasing parent practices that promote infant development. An ongoing randomized controlled trial study provided a unique opportunity to monitor progression from referral to intervention initiation between two groups of depressed mothers: those prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic. The study also examines mother and infant characteristics at baseline. The sample consisted primarily of Black mothers experiencing extreme poverty who self-referred to the study in a large southern city, which is one of the most income disparate in the United States. Prior to the pandemic, 97% of study participants successfully progressed from consent to intervention, as compared to significantly fewer–86%–during the pandemic. Mother-infant dyads during COVID-19, as compared to those prior to COVID-19, displayed similar pre-intervention demographic characteristics and intrapersonal characteristics.","Baggett, Kathleen M.; Davis, Betsy; Mosley, Elizabeth A.; Miller, Katy; Leve, Craig; Feil, Edward G.",Front Psychol,128,20

Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the mouse, provides animal models for the study of central nervous system disease, including encephalitis and demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and for hepatitis. While there are many studies of the adaptive immune response to MHV, there has until recently been scant information on the type I interferon (IFN) response to MHV. The relationship between MHV and the IFN-α/β response is paradoxical. While the type I IFN response is a crucial aspect of host defense against MHV in its natural host, there is little if any induction of IFN following infection of mouse fibroblast cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, MHV is relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of IFN-α/β in mouse fibroblast cell lines and in human 293T cells. MHV can, under some circumstances, compromise the antiviral effects of IFN signaling. The nucleocapsid protein as well as the nsp1 and nsp3 proteins of MHV has been reported to have IFN antagonist activity. However, in primary cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and macrophages, IFN is induced by MHV infection and an antiviral state is established. Other primary cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and hepatocytes fail to produce IFN following infection and, in vivo, likely depend on IFN produced by pDCs and macrophages for protection from MHV. Thus MHV induction of IFN-α/β and the ability to induce an antiviral state in response to interferon is extremely cell type dependent. IFN induced protection from MHV pathogenesis likely requires the orchestrated activities of several cell types, however, the cell types involved in limiting MHV replication may be different in the liver and in the immune privileged CNS.","Rose, Kristine M.; Weiss, Susan R.",Viruses,128,16

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quality of perinatal care was compromised as the health care system grappled with adapting to an ever-changing, uncertain, and unprecedented public health crisis. METHODS: The aim of this study was to explore the quality of perinatal care received during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Data were collected via an online questionnaire completed by people who gave birth in the United States after March 15, 2020. The questionnaire included the Mothers on Respect Index and the Mothers Autonomy in Decision Making validated measures. Low-quality perinatal care was defined as decreased respect and/or autonomy in the perinatal care received. Responses were geocoded by zip code to determine COVID-19 case-load in the county on the date of birth. Multivariate regression analyses described associations between respect and autonomy in decision-making for perinatal care and levels of COVID-19 outbreak across the United States. RESULTS: Participants (N = 707) from 46 states and the District of Columbia completed the questionnaire. As COVID-19 cases increased, participants' experiences of autonomy in decision-making for perinatal care decreased significantly (P = .04). Participants who identified as Black, Indigenous, and people of color, those who had an obstetrician provider, and those who gave birth in a hospital were more likely to experience low-quality perinatal care. Those with a midwife provider or who had a home birth were more likely to experience high-quality perinatal care in adjusted models. DISCUSSION: Variability in experiences of high-quality perinatal care by sociodemographic characteristics, birth setting, and provider type may relate to implicit bias, structural racism, and inequities in maternal health and COVID-19 outcomes for birthing people from marginalized communities.","Basile Ibrahim, Bridget; Kennedy, Holly Powell; Combellick, Joan",J. midwifery womens health,128,16

Recently, we have generated replication-competent (E3 deleted) bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) recombinants expressing significant amounts of glycoprotein D (gD) of bovine herpesvirus-1 (a DNA virus). However, attempts to express the RNA virus genes using the same strategy were not successful. In an effort to optimize the expression, we have constructed several BAV-3 recombinants carrying the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in the E3 region with or without exogenous transcription control elements. The expression studies suggest that the introduction of a 137 bp chimeric intron upstream of the HE cDNA is able to increase the level of HE gene expression. The introduction of a SV40 early promoter or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early (IE) promoter into the expression cassette changed the kinetics of the HE expression. However, the recombinant BAV-3 containing HE under the HCMV IE promoter replicated less efficiently than the wild-type BAV-3.

This assay was conducted at 60 °C for 40 min. Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was confirmed using several equine intestinal and respiratory pathogens in addition to ECoV. The novel assay failed to cross-react with the other pathogens tested, suggesting it is highly specific for ECoV. Using artificially synthesized ECoV RNA, the 50% detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 10(1.8) copies/reaction. This is a 50-fold greater sensitivity than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, but a 4-fold lower sensitivity than quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Eighty-two fecal samples collected during ECoV outbreaks were analyzed. ECoV was detected in 59 samples using the RT-LAMP assay, and in 30 and 65 samples using RT-PCR or qRT-PCR assays, respectively. Although the RT-LAMP assay is less sensitive than qRT-PCR techniques, it can be performed without the need for expensive equipment.

To combat the pandemic, multiple types of vaccines are under development with unprecedented rapidity. Theoretically, the future vaccination against COVID‐19 may fall into long‐term costly guerrilla warfare between SARS‐CoV‐2 and humans. Elimination of SARS‐CoV‐2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long‐term costly guerrilla warfare, if possible, is highly desired and worth intensive consideration. Human influenza pandemics emerging in 1957, 1968, and 2009 established strong global herd immunity and led to elimination of three human influenza viruses which circulated worldwide for years before the pandemics. Moreover, both clade 7.2 of subtype H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and subtype H7N9 avian influenza virus circulated in poultry in China for years, and they have been virtually eliminated through mass vaccination in recent years. These facts suggested that rapid establishment of global herd immunity through mass vaccination using a proper vaccine could eliminate SARS‐CoV‐2. The coming two years is the golden time for the elimination through vaccination which requires tremendous national and international collaboration.

Participants 31,180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between March 12, and April 14, from 2015 to 2020 Main outcome measures The Main outcome measure was the odds ratio of premature birth, per preterm category, during the lockdown period compared with the calendar match period in the five previous years. Results A total of 31 180 newborns were included in the study period, of these 58 were born extremely premature (gestational age below 28 weeks). The distribution of gestational ages was significantly different (p = 0.004) during the lockdown period compared to the previous five years. The extremely premature birth rate during the lockdown was significantly lower than the corresponding mean rate for the same dates in the previous years (odds ratio 0.09 [95 % CI 0.01 - 0.04], p < 0.001). No significant difference between the lockdown and previous years was found for other gestational age categories. Conclusions The birth rate of extremely premature infants decreased significantly (~90 % reduction) during the Danish nationwide lockdown from a stable rate in the preceding five years. The reasons for this decrease are unclear. Identification of possible causal mechanisms might stimulate changes in clinical practice. Ideally, some cases of extreme prematurity are preventable which may decrease infant morbidity and mortality.","Hedermann, G.; Hedley, P.

We have comprehensively analyzed 25 different formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues/organs from autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases (n = 8), using histopathological assessment, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using polymerase chain reaction and RNA in situ hybridization, viral protein using immunohistochemistry, and virus particles using transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. These findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples (n = 9). Apart from the lung, correlation of viral detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 and its replication could be observed across all organ systems, which co-localizes with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells. Apart from the respiratory tract, no specific (histo-)morphologic alterations could be assigned to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wong, Dickson W.

METHODS: The Provincial Health Data Centre (Western Cape, South Africa) is a health information exchange collating patient-level routine health data for approximately 4 million public sector health care seekers. Data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed between March and July 2020, including PLWD, were analysed to describe risk factors, including dispensed diabetes medications and comorbidities, and their association with COVID-19 outcomes in this population. FINDINGS: There were 64476 COVID-19 patients diagnosed. Of 9305 PLWD, 44.9% were hospitalised, 4.0% admitted to ICU, 0.6% received ventilation and 15.4% died. In contrast, proportions of COVID-19 patients without diabetes were: 12.2% hospitalised, 1.0% admitted, 0.1% ventilated and 4.6% died. PLWD were significantly more likely to be admitted (OR:3.73, 95%CI: 3.53,3.94) and to die (OR:3.01, 95%CI: 2.76,3.28). Significant hospitalisation risk factors included HIV infection, chronic kidney disease, current TB, male sex and increasing age. Significant risk factors for mortality were CKD, male sex, HIV infection, previous TB and increasing age. Pre-infection use of insulin was associated with a significant increased risk for hospitalisation (OR:1·39, 95%CI:1·24,1·57) and mortality (OR1·49, 95%CI:1·27;1·74) and metformin was associated with a reduced risk for hospitalisation (OR:0·62,95%CI:0·55,0·71) and mortality (OR 0·77, 95%CI:0·64;0·92). INTERPRETATION: Using routine health data from this large virtual cohort, we have described the association of infectious and noncommunicable comorbidities as well as pre-infection diabetes medications with COVID-19 outcomes in PLWD in the Western Cape, South Africa.

To facilitate future research, we aimed to assess the set of key metrics currently used by researchers in these settings and to propose a set of standard metrics to facilitate future research. METHODS: Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs. Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded. All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified. RESULTS: We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs. There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported. Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown. The upper age boundary used for paediatric data varied widely, from 5 to 20 years of age. Emergency centre capacity was reported using a variety of metrics including annual patient volume (n = 175, 90%); bed count (n = 60, 31%), number of rooms (n = 48, 25%); frequently none of these metrics were reported (n = 16, 8%). Many characteristics essential to describe capabilities and performance of emergency care were not reported, including use and type of triage; level of provider training; admission rate; time to evaluation; and length of EC stay. CONCLUSION: We found considerable heterogeneity in reporting practices for studies of emergency care in LMICs. Standardised metrics could facilitate future analysis and interpretation of such studies, and expand the ability to generalise and compare findings across emergency care settings.","Abujaber, Samer; Chang, Cindy Y.; Reynolds, Teri A.; Mowafi, Hani; Obermeyer, Ziad",Afr J Emerg Med,128,24

What are the social, political, and psychological consequences of the confinement policies? The question of how legitimate a policy is among the public is at the core of democratic theory. Its relevance also stems from the expected consequences of public support on behavior: The more someone supports a policy, the more someone is likely to follow the policy even if the policy is not strictly enforced.

The characteristic, outcome, and risk factor of COVID-19 in patients with decompensated cirrhosis remain unclear. Methods: Medical records were collected from 23 Chinese hospitals. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis and age- and sex-matched non-liver disease patients were enrolled with 1:4 ratio using stratified sampling. Results: There were more comorbidities with higher Chalson Complication Index (p < 0.001), higher proportion of patients having gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, ascites, and diarrhea among those patients (p < 0.05) and in decompensated cirrhosis patients. Mortality (p < 0.05) and the proportion of severe ill (p < 0.001) were significantly high among those patients. Patients in severe ill subgroup had higher mortality (p < 0.001), MELD, and CRUB65 score but lower lymphocytes count. Besides, this subgroup had larger proportion of patients with abnormal (PT), activated partial thromboplatin time (APTT), D-Dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBL) and Creatinine (Cr) (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression for severity shown that MELD and CRUB65 score reached significance. Higher Child-Pugh and CRUB65 scores were found among non-survival cases and multivariate logistic regression further inferred risk factors for adverse outcome. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves also provided remarkable demonstrations for the predictive ability of Child-Pugh and CRUB65 scores. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis had larger proportion of more severely disease and higher mortality. MELD and CRUB65 score at hospital admission may predict COVID-19 severity while Child-Pugh and CRUB65 score were highly associated with non-survival among those patients.","Xiao, Yong; Wu, Dongwen; Shi, Xiao; Liu, Shuzhong; Hu, Xudong; Zhou, Chenliang; Tian, Xia; Liu, Huimin; Long, Hui; Li, Zhihong; Wang, Ji; Tan, Tao; Xu, Ying; Chen, Bitao; Liu, Ting; Zhang, Heng; Zheng, Shihua; Hu, Shunlin; Song, Jun; Tang, Jie; Song, Jichun; Cheng, Zhengwei; Xu, Weitian; Shen, Yongxiang; Yu, Wenhu; Xu, Yong; Li, Jiao; Zhou, Jing; Wang, Fen; Chen, Mingkai",Virulence,128,12

With the 100 or so habitable planets that are now known to exist in our galaxy alone transfers of cometary dust carrying life including fragments of icy planetoids/asteroids would be expected to occur on a routine basis. It is thus easy to view the galaxy as a single connected “biosphere” of which our planet Earth is a minor component. The Hoyle–Wickramasinghe Panspermia paradigm provides a cogent biological rationale for the actual widespread existence of Lamarckian modes of inheritance in terrestrial systems (which we review here). Thus the Panspermia paradigm provides the raison d'etre for Lamarckian Inheritance. Under a terrestrially confined neoDarwinian viewpoint such an association may have been thought spurious in the past. Our aim here is to outline the main evidence for rapid terrestrial-based Lamarckian-based evolutionary hypermutation processes dependent on reverse transcription-coupled mechanisms among others. Such rapid adaptation mechanisms would be consistent with the effective cosmic spread of living systems. For example, a viable, or cryo-preserved, living system traveling through space in a protective matrix will of necessity need to adapt rapidly and proliferate on landing in a new cosmic niche. Lamarckian mechanisms thus come to the fore and supersede the slow (blind and random) genetic processes expected under neoDarwinian Earth centred theories.","Steele, Edward J.; Gorczynski, Reginald M.; Lindley, Robyn A.; Liu, Yongsheng; Temple, Robert; Tokoro, Gensuke; Wickramasinghe, Dayal T.; Wickramasinghe, N.

An overwhelming majority of published literature on the pathologic findings associated with COVID-19 is either from living clinical cohorts or from autopsy findings of those who died in a medical care setting, which can confound pure disease pathology. A relatively low initial infection rate paired with a high biosafety level enabled the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator to conduct full autopsy examinations on suspected COVID-19–related deaths.

COVID-19 vaccines might increase confidence in the safety of living organ donation during the pandemic. We assessed informational preferences and perspectives about COVID-19 vaccines among US living organ donors and prospective donors. Methods We conducted a national survey study of organ donors and prospective donors on social media platforms between 12/28/2020-2/23/2021. Survey items included multiple choice, visual analog scale, and open-ended responses. We examined associations between information preferences, history of COVID-19 infection, influenza vaccination history and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance using multivariable logistic regression and performed a thematic analysis of open-ended responses. Results Among 342 respondents from 47 US states and the District of Columbia, 35% were between 51-70 years old, 90% were non-Hispanic white, 87% were women; 82% were living donors (94% kidney) and 18% in evaluation to donate (75% kidney).The majority planned to or had received COVID-19 vaccination (76%), whereas 11% did not plan to be receive a vaccine, and 12% were unsure. Adjusting for demographics and donor characteristics, respondents who receive yearly influenza vaccinations had higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than those who do not (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 5.06, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.68-9.53). Compared to respondents who prioritized medical information sources (e.g., personal physicians and transplant providers), those who prioritized news and social media had lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.73). Low perceived personal benefit from vaccination and uncertainty about long-term safety were common themes among those declining COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions Donor informational source preferences were strongly associated with the likelihood of accepting a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine guidance for organ donors who are unsure about COVID-19 vaccines could incorporate messaging about safety and benefits of vaccination for healthy people.","Harhay, Meera N; Klassen, Ann C; Zaidi, Hasan; Mittelman, Michael; Bertha, Rebecca; Mannon, Roslyn B; Lentine, Krista L",Kidney360,128,24

Prevalence of detected infections decreased by 58% (95% CI: 57-58%) within one week in the 45 counties that were subject to two rounds of mass testing. Adjusting for geographical clustering and differences in attendance rates and the epidemiological situation at the time of the first round, this changed to 61% (95% CI: 50-70%).

It is unclear if they can predict the clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We aim to assess if elevations in AST/ALT were associated with poor outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated hospitalized COVID-19 patients with clinically significant elevated aminotransferases (defined as >2 times upper limit of normal) and compared them with COVID-19 patients without an elevation in aminotransferases. RESULTS: The prevalence of elevation in AST/ALT was found to be 13.7% (20/145). The two groups were similar in baseline demographics, comorbidities, and the majority of laboratory tests. There was no difference in the mortality (50% vs. 36.8%, P=0.32) and median hospital stay (7 days vs. 7 days, P=0.78). However, there was a statistically significant increase in the rates of mechanical ventilation among elevated aminotransferases group compared to individuals without elevation (50% vs. 24%, P= 0.028). However, this difference was not observed after adjusting for inflammatory markers such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lactic acid levels. CONCLUSION: Elevated aminotransferases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with higher rates of mechanical ventilation, but did not achieve statistical significance after controlling for inflammatory markers. Also, patients with elevated aminotransferases did not have higher rates of mortality or prolonged length of stay.","Ramachandran, Preethi; Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Chakraborti, Abhishek; Narh, Joshua Tetteh; Goyal, Hemant",J Clin Exp Hepatol,128,20

This paper evaluates the underlying factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify the current digital health projects and studies being carried out in Pakistan, as well as the key stakeholders involved in these initiatives. We aim to follow a mixed-methods strategy and to evaluate these projects and studies through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal and external factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. METHODS: This study aims to evaluate digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan with mixed methods. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained from field surveys were categorized according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended building blocks for health systems research, and the data were analyzed using a SWOT analysis strategy. RESULTS: Of the digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan, 51 are studied. Of these projects, 46% (23/51) used technology for conducting research, 30% (15/51) used technology for implementation, and 12% (6/51) used technology for app development. The health domains targeted were general health (23/51, 46%), immunization (13/51, 26%), and diagnostics (5/51, 10%). Smartphones and devices were used in 55% (28/51) of the interventions, and 59% (30/51) of projects included plans for scaling up. Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations’ inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs. Hence, there is a need for active involvement by public and private organizations to regulate, mobilize, and expand the digital health sector for the improvement of health care systems in countries.","Kazi, Abdul Momin; Qazi, Saad Ahmed; Ahsan, Nazia; Khawaja, Sadori; Sameen, Fareeha; Saqib, Muhammad; Khan Mughal, Muhammad Ayub; Wajidali, Zabin; Ali, Sikander; Ahmed, Rao Moueed; Kalimuddin, Hussain; Rauf, Yasir; Mahmood, Fatima; Zafar, Saad; Abbasi, Tufail Ahmad; Khoumbati, Khalil-Ur-Rahmen; Abbasi, Munir A; Stergioulas, Lampros K",J Med Internet Res,128,1

Therefore, it has been heavily speculated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy may modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, exposure of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and primary endothelial cells (hECs) to SARS-CoV-2 identified significant differences in protein coding genes involved in immunity, viral response, and cardiomyocyte/endothelial structure. Specifically, transcriptome changes were identified in the TNF, Interferon α/β, and MAPK (hPSC-CMs) as well as NF-kappaB (hECs) signalling pathways. However, pre-treatment of hPSC-CMs or hECs with two widely prescribed antihypertensive medications, losartan and lisinopril, did not affect the susceptibility of either cell type to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings demonstrate the toxic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in hPSC-CMs/hECs and taken together with newly emerging multicenter trials, suggest that antihypertensive drug treatment alone does not alter SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Iwanski, Jessika; Kazmouz, Sobhi G.; Li, Shuaizhi; Stansfield, Ben; Salem, Tori T.; Perez-Miller, Samantha; Kazui, Toshinobu; Jena, Lipsa; Uhrlaub, Jennifer L.; Lick, Scott; Nikolich-Žugich, Janko; Konhilas, John P.; Gregorio, Carol C.; Khanna, May; Campos, Samuel K.; Churko, Jared M.",Stem Cell Reports,128,1

Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and its clinical features remain incompletely understood, complicating empirical selection of antibiotics. Methods. Using a multicenter, prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP, we calculated the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) among all CAP episodes. We compared the epidemiologic, radiographic, and clinical characteristics of S. aureus CAP (per respiratory or blood culture) with those of pneumococcal (per respiratory or blood culture or urine antigen) and all-cause non-S. aureus CAP using descriptive statistics. Results. Among 2259 adults hospitalized for CAP, 37 (1.6%) had S. aureus identified, including 15 (0.7%) with MRSA and 22 (1.0%) with MSSA; 115 (5.1%) had Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin or linezolid was administered to 674 (29.8%) patients within the first 3 days of hospitalization. Chronic hemodialysis use was more common among patients with MRSA (20.0%) than pneumococcal (2.6%) and all-cause non-S. aureus (3.7%) CAP. Otherwise, clinical features at admission were similar, including concurrent influenza infection, hemoptysis, multilobar infiltrates, and prehospital antibiotics. Patients with MRSA CAP had more severe clinical outcomes than those with pneumococcal CAP, including intensive care unit admission (86.7% vs 34.8%) and in-patient mortality (13.3% vs 4.4%). Conclusions. Despite very low prevalence of S. aureus and, specifically, MRSA, nearly one-third of adults hospitalized with CAP received anti-MRSA antibiotics. The clinical presentation of MRSA CAP overlapped substantially with pneumococcal CAP, highlighting the challenge of accurately targeting empirical anti-MRSA antibiotics with currently available clinical tools and the need for new diagnostic strategies.","Self, Wesley H.; Wunderink, Richard G.; Williams, Derek J.; Zhu, Yuwei; Anderson, Evan J.; Balk, Robert A.; Fakhran, Sherene S.; Chappell, James D.; Casimir, Geoffrey; Courtney, D.

Spread occurred despite standard outbreak controls at affected shelter and supportive housing sites. Among these 37 cases, drink sharing was frequently identified as a modifiable mode of possible transmission. We collaborated with emergency shelters, a supportive housing site, and street and encampment outreach groups, using mixed service delivery by health staff, non-profits, and peers with lived experience with homelessness. INTERVENTION: To empower individuals to decrease COVID-19 transmission using a harm reduction approach, we provided disposable paper cups to service providers for distribution to clients. Service providers tracked the number of cups distributed. To assess effectiveness, we interviewed staff and peers who distributed the cups. OUTCOMES: Cup distribution was highest among populations with higher rates of alcohol use, and the intervention was well received by people who drink alcohol regularly, providing unique opportunities to promote COVID-19 awareness and safer drinking practices. Providers to these populations reported enthusiastic client engagement and repeat requests for cups for safer drinking. Intervention usefulness was limited in contexts with low alcohol consumption and in the absence of paired COVID-19 education. Provider reports suggest appropriate disposal of these cups after use. IMPLICATIONS: Disposable cups are a novel, rapidly implementable, low-cost harm reduction tool to empower people experiencing homelessness to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission due to drink sharing, ideally as part of a larger harm reduction and community education strategy.","Steer, Kieran J.

The loss in the healthcare workforce due to sickness and absence will double the risk of a crisis. Identifying barriers of willingness to work during epidemics outbreak and preparedness of healthcare professionals is important to minimize the shortage of human power. METHODS: Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare professionals working in the selected hospitals of Southwest Ethiopia from June 1–30/2020. The data entry was done by Epi-Data Manager version 4.4.1.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a backward stepwise approach was done to identify independent predictors of poor preparedness and willingness of the healthcare professionals to work during COVID-19 and Variables with P-value <0.05 were considered as a statistically significant determinant. RESULTS: Of 407 healthcare professionals who participated in the study, 246 (60.4%) were male. The mean age of the respondents was 28.47±5.60 years. Forty-seven (11.55%) Physicians, 59 (14.50%) pharmacy personnel, 52 (12.78%) Laboratory personnel, 31 (7.62%) Midwives, and 195 (47.91%) Nurses were included in the study. The healthcare professionals who were not prepared for the provision of services during COVID-19 and not willing to work during COVID-19 were 165 (40.5%) and 86 (21.1%) respectively. Having 6 to10 years’ experience (AOR=4.046, CI: 1.05–15.58), and divorced marital status (AOR=7.855, CI: 1.781–34.65) were independent predictors of not willing to work during COVID-19. Similarly, lack of personal protective equipment (AOR=28.089, CI: 13.9–56.67) and shortage of infrastructure at the work place (AOR=28.1, CI: 13.9–56.67) were independent predictors of poor preparedness. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Healthcare professionals’ willingness and preparedness to work during COVID-19 was low. Use of Telemedicine, provision of personal protective equipment, increasing hospital’s safety with adequate infection control policy, and assigning staff who have experience of more than ten years in the risky wards of the hospitals may decrease staffs absentee and increase in the provision of continuous service.","Zewudie, Ameha; Regasa, Tolcha; Kebede, Oliyad; Abebe, Lemi; Feyissa, Desalegn; Ejata, Fikadu; Feyisa, Diriba; Mamo, Yitagesu",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,128,1

There is limited knowledge on the relative viral load in these samples: NPS, whole mouth fluid (WMF) and respiratory droplets (RD; another important source in transmission), on how the loads vary with disease severity and on how much virus is shed. Objective: To quantify and compare SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS, WMF and RD samples, and correlate with disease severity. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Tertiary care multispeciality hospital with limited resources in a low to middle income country. Participants: Eighty suspected COVID-19 patients were recruited from the COVID-19 out patient clinic and hospital isolation wards. Intervention: Concurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples were collected from all the recruited patients and tested for SARS-CoV2 copies by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome was COVID-19 measured by SARS-CoV2 quantitative RT PCR in NPS samples. COVID-19 disease severity was determined according to NIH criteria. Virus shedding was defined as the presence of SARS-CoV2 copies in the WMF and RD samples. Results: SARS-CoV2 was detected in 55/80 (69%) of the NPS samples. Of these 55, WMF and RD samples were positive in 44 (80%) and 17 (31%), respectively. The concordance of WMF with NPS was 84% (p=0.02). SARS-CoV2 copy numbers were comparable in the NPS (median: 8.74x10^5) and WMF (median: 3.07x10^4), but lower in RD samples (median: 3.60x10^2). Patients with mild disease had higher copies in the NPS (median: 3.46x10^6), while patients with severe disease had higher copies in the WMF (median: 1.34x10^6) and RD samples (median: 4.29x10^4). The 25-75% interquartile range of NPS SARS-CoV2 copies was significantly higher in the WMF (p=0.0001) and RD (p=0.01) positive patients. Conclusion and relevance: SARS-CoV2 copies are highest in NPS samples. WMF is a reliable surrogate sample for diagnosis. High copy numbers in the NPS imply initial virological phase and higher risk of virus shedding via WMF and RD.","Kannian, P.; Jayaraman, B.

The purpose of this review is to synthesize the available knowledge on the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women as well as the risk of maternal–fetal transmission. The study indicated that the course of COVID-19 is worse in pregnant women who are more often admitted to intensive care units or who require mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant women with COVID-19. Some symptoms, such as dyspnea and cough, were similar to those observed in nonpregnant women, but fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, and diarrhea were less frequent. A study revealed that premature delivery and cesarean section were more common in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, recent studies confirm the possibility of intrauterine maternal–fetal transmission by positive genetic tests and the presence of IgM in newborns just after delivery; at the moment, the probability of transmission through mother’s milk is inconclusive. Considering all the above, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is an important factor that threatens the health and life of both the mother and the fetus, but further studies are still needed.","Mazur-Bialy, Agnieszka Irena; Kołomańska-Bogucka, Daria; Tim, Sabina; Opławski, Marcin",J Clin Med,128,24

The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) was used to assess the mental well-being of physicians. Burnout was documented by using the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel. Eighty-seven physicians participated in the survey (mean age, 30.9 ± 7.3 years). The mean WEMWBS score of the study participants was 51.6 ± 10.8. Regarding the WEMWBS, emotional exhaustion was observed in 54% (N = 47) of participants, depersonalization in 77% (N = 67), and low personal accomplishment was reported in 31% (N = 27) of participants. The results of the survey further highlight that depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and low personal accomplishment were associated significantly with a history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 postings. Hence, immediate measures are required to reduce the burnout among physicians while battling the second wave of the pandemic.","Asghar, Muhammad Sohaib; Yasmin, Farah; Alvi, Haris; Shah, Syed Muhammad Ismail; Malhotra, Kashish; Farhan, Syed Ali; Ali Naqvi, Syed Anosh; Yaseen, Rabail; Anwar, Saira; Rasheed, Uzma",Am J Trop Med Hyg,128,20

Ang (1–7) is part of the angiotensin‐converting enzyme–Ang (1–7)–Mas pathway which is considered to antagonize the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). Since DPP3 inhibits the counteracting pathway of the RAAS, we hypothesize that DPP3 might be deleterious in the setting of heart failure. However, no data are available on DPP3 in chronic heart failure. We therefore investigated the clinical characteristics and outcome related to elevated DPP3 concentrations in patients with worsening heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 was measured in 2156 serum samples of patients with worsening heart failure using luminometric immunoassay (DPP3‐LIA) by 4TEEN4 Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany. Predictors of DPP3 levels were selected using multiple linear regression with stepwise backward selection. Median DPP3 concentration was 11.45 ng/mL with a range from 2.8 to 84.9 ng/mL. Patients with higher DPP3 concentrations had higher renin [78.3 (interquartile range, IQR 26.3–227.7) vs. 120.7 IU/mL (IQR 34.74–338.9), P < 0.001, for Q1–3 vs. Q4] and aldosterone [88 (IQR 44–179) vs. 116 IU/mL (IQR 46–241), P < 0.001, for Q1–3 vs. Q4] concentrations. The strongest independent predictors for higher concentration of DPP3 were log‐alanine aminotransferase, log‐total bilirubin, the absence of diabetes, higher osteopontin, fibroblast growth factor‐23 and N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide concentrations (all P < 0.001). In univariable survival analysis, DPP3 was associated with mortality and the combined endpoint of death or heart failure hospitalization (P < 0.001 for both). After adjustment for confounders, this association was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with worsening heart failure, DPP3 is a marker of more severe disease with higher RAAS activity. It may be deleterious in heart failure by counteracting the Mas receptor pathway. Procizumab, a specific antibody against DPP3, might be a potential future treatment option for patients with heart failure.","Boorsma, Eva M.; ter Maaten, Jozine M.; Damman, Kevin; van Veldhuisen, Dirk J.; Dickstein, Kenneth; Anker, Stefan D.; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Lang, Chim C.; Metra, Marco; Santos, Karine; Voors, Adriaan A.",Eur J Heart Fail,128,24

This paper is the second in what will be an ongoing series of analyses of a longitudinal travel and activity survey. In this paper we examine data collected over a period of late May to early June in Australia, following four-to-six weeks of relatively flat new cases in COVID-19 after the initial nationwide outbreak, as many state jurisdictions have begun to slowly ease restrictions designed to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We find that during this period, travel activity has started to slowly return, in particular by private car, and in particular for the purposes of shopping and social or recreational activities. Respondents indicate comfort with the idea of meeting friends or returning to shops, so authorities need to be aware of potential erosion of social distancing and appropriate COVID-safe behaviour in this regard. There is still a concern about using public transport, though it has diminished noticeably since the first wave of data collection. We see that working from home continues to be an important strategy in reducing travel and pressure on constrained transport networks, and a policy measure that if carried over to a post-pandemic world, will be an important step towards a more sustainable transport future. We find that work from home has been a generally positive experience with a significant number of respondents liking to work from home moving forward, with varying degrees of employer support, at a level above those seen before COVID-19. Thus, any investment to capitalise on current levels of work from home should be viewed as an investment in transport.","Beck, Matthew J.; Hensher, David A.",Transp Policy (Oxf),128,24

In this paper, we analyze the public reactions to the pandemic using search engine data and mobility data from Baidu Search and Baidu Maps respectively, where we particularly pay attentions to the early stage of pandemics and find early signals from the collective response to COVID-19. First, we correlate the number of confirmed cases per day to daily search queries of a large number of keywords through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA), where the keywords top in the most critical days are believed the most relevant to the pandemic. We then categorize the ranking lists of keywords according to the specific regions of the search, such as Wuhan, Mainland China, the USA, and the whole world. Through the analysis on search, we succeed in identifying COVID-19 related collective response would not be earlier than the end of 2019 in Mainland China. Finally, we confirm this observation again using human mobility data, where we specifically compare the massive mobility traces, including the real-time population densities inside key hospitals and inter-city travels departing from/arriving in Wuhan, from 2018 to 2020. No significant changes have been witnessed before December, 2019.","Liu, J.; Huang, T.; Xiong, H.; Huang, J.; Zhou, J.; Jiang, H.; Yang, G.; Wang, H.; Dou, D.",,128,29

In addition to morphological identification of bat species, we also did molecular confirmation of species identities, contributing to the known genetic database available for African bat species. We detected a novel Betacoronavirus in two Geoffroy’s horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus clivosus) bats. We also detected several different paramyxoviral species from various insectivorous bats. One of these viral species was found to be homologous to the genomes of viruses belonging to the Jeilongvirus genus.

In this study, we developed a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system for a rapid and highly sensitive detection of enterovirus including PV to identify stool samples positive for enterovirus including PV. METHODS: A primer set was designed for RT-LAMP to detect enterovirus preferably those with PV-like 5'NTRs of the viral genome. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP system was evaluated with prototype strains of enterovirus. Detection of enterovirus from stool extracts was examined by using RT-LAMP system. RESULTS: We detected at least 400 copies of the viral genomes of PV(Sabin) strains within 90 min by RT-LAMP with the primer set. This RT-LAMP system showed a preference for Human enterovirus species C (HEV-C) strains including PV, but exhibited less sensitivity to the prototype strains of HEV-A and HEV-B (detection limits of 7,400 to 28,000 copies). Stool extracts, from which PV, HEV-C, or HEV-A was isolated in the cell culture system, were mostly positive by RT-LAMP method (positive rates of 15/16 (= 94%), 13/14 (= 93%), and 4/4 (= 100%), respectively). The positive rate of this RT-LAMP system for stool extracts from which HEV-B was isolated was lower than that of HEV-C (positive rate of 11/21 (= 52%)). In the stool samples, which were negative for enterovirus isolation by the cell culture system, we found that two samples were positive for RT-LAMP (positive rates of 2/38 (= 5.3%)). In these samples, enterovirus 96 was identified by sequence analysis utilizing a seminested PCR system. CONCLUSIONS: RT-LAMP system developed in this study showed a high sensitivity comparable to that of the cell culture system for the detection of PV, HEV-A, and HEV-C, but less sensitivity to HEV-B. This RT-LAMP system would be useful for the direct detection of enterovirus from the stool extracts.","Arita, Minetaro; Ling, Hua; Yan, Dongmei; Nishimura, Yorihiro; Yoshida, Hiromu; Wakita, Takaji; Shimizu, Hiroyuki",BMC Infect Dis,128,24

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is limited by the accumulation of non-specific products, but nucleic acid circuitry can be used to probe and distinguish specific amplicons. By combining this high temperature isothermal amplification method with a thermostable invertase, we can directly transduce Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Zaire Ebolavirus templates into glucose signals, with a sensitivity as low as 20–100 copies/μl, equating to atto-molar (or low zepto-mole). Virus from cell lysates and synthetic templates could be readily amplified and detected even in sputum or saliva. An OR gate that coordinately triggered on viral amplicons further guaranteed fail-safe virus detection. The method describes has potential for accelerating point-of-care applications, in that biological samples could be applied to a transducer that would then directly interface with an off-the-shelf, approved medical device.","Du, Yan; Hughes, Randall A.; Bhadra, Sanchita; Jiang, Yu Sherry; Ellington, Andrew D.; Li, Bingling",Sci Rep,128,29

But many challenges and knowledge gaps are still confronted nowadays. On one hand, long-term health impacts of fine air particles have to be closely probed through both epidemiological and laboratory studies, and the toxic effects owing to the interactions between particles and associated chemical pollutants should be differentially teased out. On the other hand, due to sole mass control, there are significant changes of overall pollutant fingerprint, such as the increase of ground-level ozone concentration, which should be taken into account for altered health effects relative to the past. Moreover, the interplays with air pollutants and air-borne pathogens should be scrutinized in more details. In other words, it is worth investigating likely spread of pathogens (even for SARS-CoV-2) with aid of aerosols. Here, we recapitulate the current knowledge gaps between air pollution controls and health impacts including pathogen epidemic, and we also propose future research directions to support policy making in balance mass control and health impacts.","Ma, Qingxin; Qi, Yu; Shan, Qiuli; Liu, Sijin; He, Hong",Environ Res,128,16

This study aimed to analyze its influence on patient care and healthcare management in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nationwide survey of the German Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was performed. Individual questionnaires containing 10 questions for university as well as non-university hospitals and 15 questions for private practices (PPs) for OMFS were created to collect data for patient numbers and surgical procedures conducted, usage of personal protection equipment (PPE), SARS-CoV-2 tests, and economic aspects. RESULTS: Fifty-four hospitals and 240 PPs participated in the study. The reduction in ward capacities and number of surgical procedures ranged from 17 to 78%. PPE consisted of standard surgical masks (58% hospitals, 64% PPs) and FFP2/N95/KN95 respirators (45% hospitals, 48% PPs). Preoperative SARS-CoV-2 tests were more frequently performed in hospitals (34% vs 2%). At PPs, turnover for medical and dental procedures billed to the public insurance had reduced to 58.81% and 62.43%, respectively, of the corresponding values for 2019, and 58.75% of the PPs had applied for short-time allowances. CONCLUSION: With the exception of some elective procedures, primary patient care in OMFS has been assured during the pandemic. However, the immense economic burden on hospitals and PPs cannot be conclusively assessed at this point. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: For OMFS, the German healthcare system has shown the ability to adapt to emergency situations such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Adequate surgical capacities in OMFS are necessary even during pandemics.","Pabst, Andreas; Zeller, Alexander–N.; Sader, Robert; Wiegner, Jörg-Ulf; Schneider, Matthias; Ehrenfeld, Michael; Hoffmann, Jürgen",Clin Oral Investig,128,19

Introdução: O SARS-CoV-2 é um vírus pertencente à família dos Coronaviridae, tendo o RNA como seu material genético, que leva ao desenvolvimento da doença COVID-19. O novo coronavírus foi detectado pela primeira vez em dezembro de 2019 na cidade de Wuhan, China, tornando-se uma pandemia acometendo até agosto de 2020, 215 países. Neste sentido, a busca por entender os mecanismos e/ou suscetibilidade frente a infecção por este vírus, se tornou prioridade entre os pesquisadores do mundo, sugerindo então uma correlação entre o sistema ABO frente a infecção por SARS-CoV-2. Metodologia: Foi realizada uma revisão da literatura com base em artigos indexados nas plataformas: Pubmed e medRxiv, no ano de 2020. Ao final da aplicação dos critérios de exclusão para seleção dos artigos, foram selecionados 17 estudos. Resultados e discussões: Mesmo com a escassez de estudos, o que é justificável por se tratar de um novo vírus, as pesquisas apontam que o tipo A é o mais susceptível e o grupo O menos susceptível, todavia, a gravidade quanto ao risco de óbito está associado ao tipo AB. Até o presente momento não se sabe ao certo o porquê o SARS-CoV-2 é menos susceptível ao grupo O. Hipotetiza-se que o anti-A desse grupo é capaz de interferir na ligação entre a proteína Spike com o receptor da enzima conversora angiotensina 2 (ACE2), mecanismo este visto na infecção por SARS-CoV-1. Outro fato que pode ser considerado é em relação a neutralização que os anticorpos anti-A e/ou anti-B podem exercer em infecções virais semelhantemente visto nas infecções por HIV, que poderia neutralizar também o SARS-CoV-2. Conclusão: Em suma, nota-se que o tipo sanguíneo O apresenta uma menor suscetibilidade diante a infecção pelo novo coronavírus, porém, não há nenhum estudo que elucide de qual forma o SARS-CoV-2 se porta diante o grupo ABO, fazendo então a necessidade de pesquisas para esclarecer este processo.","Amorim, C.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact on the health and disease process according to the COVID-19 evolution in the Brazilian Indigenous population. METHODS: Data was collected from press releases by the Health Ministry and a descriptive analysis of the numbers of Indigenous individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil was carried out. RESULTS: In February 2021, there were 41,855 confirmed cases of Indigenous individuals infected by the SARS-CoV-2, including 4,387 active cases, 36,809 recovered cases, and 549 deaths. The Brazilian Indigenous population is distributed in over 300 ethnic groups and, due to the high number of deaths by the COVID-19, many of these groups are endangered. The elderly are the most affected age group, and they play a fundamental role among the Indigenous population for transmitting their customs mainly orally. Indigenous populations do not have proper access to transport to specialized health centers, since many areas are inaccessible and other cases require air or river transportation, which many times results in late assistance. When managing the COVID-19, it is important to emphasize the need for social isolation to prevent the virus from spreading among the Indigenous groups, mainly due to their contact with other ethnic groups represented by missionaries, hunters, and wood explorers, among others. CONCLUSION: The adoption of practices that can reduce the virus transmission among the Indigenous population and provide them with better access to treatment, mainly for the elderly, must be prioritized in Brazil.","Mendes, Matheus Ferreira; Pereira, Letícia Rogini; Lima, Tainá Momesso; Melani, Vitória Franchini; Palamim, Camila Vantini Capasso; Boschiero, Matheus Negri; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,128,24

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is heightened awareness of the importance of self-care for fostering mental health at work. However, evidence regarding the applications of self-compassion interventions in work-related contexts has not been systematically reviewed to date. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize and evaluate the utility of self-compassion interventions targeting work-related well-being, as well as assess the methodological quality of relevant studies. Eligible articles were identified from research databases including ProQuest, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The quality of non-randomized trials and randomized controlled trials was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality Assessment Table, respectively. The literature search yielded 3,387 titles from which ten studies met the inclusion criteria. All ten studies reported promising effects of self-compassion training for work-related well-being. The methodological quality of these studies was medium. All ten studies recruited workers in a caring field and were mostly conducted in Western countries. The Self-Compassion Scale or its short-form was used in almost all instances. Findings indicate that self-compassion training can improve self-compassion and other work-related well-being outcomes in working populations. However, in general, there is need for greater methodological quality in work-related self-compassion intervention studies to advance understanding regarding the applications and limitations of this technique in work contexts.

The effects of these measures, necessary to prevent the virus from spreading, must be studied. In particular, quarantines are known to have an impact on quality of life and well-being (for example, associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other psychosocial consequences). Furthermore, these effects are expected to be more pronounced in previously disadvantaged populations, such as LGBT people. This paper describes the main measures taken by LGBT population during quarantine to avoid COVID-19 and its psychosocial consequences on an individual and social basis. Method Non-probability sampling was used. An online self-administered survey including 1181 participants was used. These were lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender residents over 18 years old from Chile. Results Almost eight out of ten participants were in a total quarantine situation. From them, 18.2% were in partial isolation and only 4.6% were not in quarantine. COVID-19 has affected almost all the LGBT participants to a certain extent. COVID-19 has emotionally affected the vast majority of the LGBT participants to a certain extent. In other words, the pandemic has affected their lives. This psychosocial impact of COVID has been greater for people who define themselves as *sexual (include queer, asexual, pansexual, demisexual). Discussion The measures taken to prevent the virus transmission significantly affect LGBT people's life. In particular, these measures affect *sexual people. *sexual people must manage discrimination and misunderstanding of their identity in many contexts including their family.","Barrientos, J.; Guzmán-González, M.; Urzúa, A.; Ulloa, F.",,128,26

The study aimed to assess the influence of abortion law on the number of performed terminations with particular attention paid to pregnancy terminations due to fetal defects. The retrospective comparative analysis of statistical data included on the governmental websites of Poland and the UK was performed. The average of 190,733.1 terminations were performed in the United Kingdom in the years 2009–2018 with the average of 2820.9 due to fetal defects. At the same time the average of 858.6 terminations were performed in Poland with 820.7 due to fetal defects. Population size is the only significant predictor of the number of terminations in the United Kingdom. The increase in the number of deliveries and population in Poland was not linked to the increase in the overall number of terminations or terminations due to fetal defects. It might be due to the unavailability of pregnancy terminations in many places. The radicalization of abortion law exerts no influence on the decrease in the number of terminations due to fetal indications. The liberalization of abortion law promotes the increase in the number of terminations due to social indications.","Zaręba, Kornelia; Wójtowicz, Stanisław; Banasiewicz, Jolanta; Herman, Krzysztof; Jakiel, Grzegorz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,128,1

The lack of assays to easily detect the different steps of entry severely hampers the analysis of this key process in virus infection. Here we describe novel, highly adaptable viral entry assays making use of minimal complementation of the E. coli β-galactosidase in mammalian cells. Enzyme activity is reconstituted when a small intravirion peptide (α-peptide) is complementing the inactive mutant form ΔM15 of β-galactosidase. The method allows to dissect and to independently detect binding, internalization, and fusion of viruses during host cell entry. Here we use it to confirm and extend current knowledge on the entry process of two enveloped viruses: vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV).","Burkard, Christine; Bloyet, Louis-Marie; Wicht, Oliver; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.; Rottier, Peter J.

Nigella sativa L. (Ranunculaceae) is an annual flowering plant used traditionally as a natural food supplement and multipurpose medicinal agent. OBJECTIVE: The possible beneficial effects of N. sativa, and its constituent, thymoquinone (TQ) on COVID-19 were reviewed. METHODS: The key words including, COVID-19, N. sativa, thymoquinone, antiviral effects, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in different databases such as Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from 1990 up to February 2021. RESULTS: The current literature review showed that N. sativa and TQ reduced the level of pro-inflammatory mediators including, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12, while enhancing IFN-γ. Nigella sativa and TQ increased the serum levels of IgG1 and IgG2a, and improved pulmonary function tests in restrictive respiratory disorders. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data of molecular docking, animal, and clinical studies propose N. sativa and TQ might have beneficial effects on the treatment or control of COVID-19 due to antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties as well as bronchodilatory effects. The efficacy of N. sativa and TQ on infected patients with COVID-19 in randomize clinical trials will be suggested.","Khazdair, Mohammad Reza; Ghafari, Shoukouh; Sadeghi, Mahmood",Pharmaceutical biology,128,6

As an indispensable trace element, Selenium (Se) plays important roles in antioxidant defence and redox state regulation along with a variety of specific metabolic pathways. In recent decades, with the development of novel nanotechnology, Selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) emerged as a promising agent for biomedical uses due to their low toxicity, degradability and high bioavailability. Taking the advantages of the strong ability to trigger apoptosis or autophagy by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), Se NPs have been widely used for direct anticancer treatments and pathogen killing/clearance in host cells. With excellent stability and drug encapsulation capacity, Se NPs are now serving as a kind of powerful nano-carriers for anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and anti-infection treatments. Notably, Se NPs are also found to play critical roles in immunity regulations, such as macrophage and T effector cell activation, which thus provides new possibilities to achieve novel nano-immune synergetic strategy for anti-cancer and anti-infection therapies. In this review, we summarized the progress of preparation methods for Se NPs, followed by the advances of their biological functions and mechanisms for biomedical uses, especially in the field of anti-infection treatments. Moreover, we further provide some prospects of Se NPs in anti-infectious diseases, which would be helpful for facilitating their future research progress for anti-infection therapy.","Lin, Wensen; Zhang, Junai; Xu, Jun-Fa; Pi, Jiang",Front Pharmacol,128,23

We set out to establish what barriers might exist and to assess the viability of teleclinics within the province KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), as perceived by doctors. METHODS: This was a quantitative, observational, survey-based study targeted at medical doctors working in both the public as well as the private healthcare sector in University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven (147) responses were included. The majority (86%) of respondents felt that telemedicine could provide a useful means to continuing hospital workflow, however, only 47% believed that it was a viable option for their unit. The major barrier identified was a feeling that doctors would-be at-increased medico-legal risk. Only 38.4% of doctors were familiar with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) guidelines on telemedicine usage. Other major barriers included: doctors feeling uncomfortable with not seeing a patient in person or not being able to perform a thorough physical examination. Other reasons identified as potential barriers were doctors foreseeing difficulty in accessing patient medical records and the absence of available systems to order investigations without the patient being physically present. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is currently not widely utilised in KZN; although most doctors were of the opinion that it could be a useful tool in order to continue the workflow during the pandemic.

Current data demonstrate an acute immune dysregulation in severe forms of the disease. The above is concluded by clinical evolution and laboratory findings, indicating a severe inflammatory response of the innate immune system, initiating predominately with the involvement of the respiratory tract epithelial cells, occasionally progressing to thrombotic diathesis and related complications. Besides the clinical manifestations, the immune response expresses an extremely high acute phase reactants repertoire including hyperferritinemia, hyper-fibrinogenaemia, and a storm of cytokines that require an alternative view and collaboration with rheumatologists. Thrombotic diathesis in some cases may not attribute only to a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation, but also to an additional activation of adaptive immunity and the development of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Unifying speciality evaluation and treatment may improve patient outcomes by recognizing early the evolving syndromes, treating properly, in a stratifying manner, with medications that alleviate the inflammatory reaction. Corticosteroids, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and possibly potent immunosuppressants are in the armamentarium. Additionally, biologics that interrupt the innate immune dysfunction, such as IL-1, IL-6 and selective JAK inhibitors, are also used. Convalescent plasma therapy and human immunoglobulin may be restricted for those whom the proposed treatments are found inadequate.

It can exist in the absence of any other outward signs of trauma, and further develop into acute lung injury (ALI) or a more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The pathogenesis of PBLI at the cellular and molecular level has not been clear. Damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) is a general term for endogenous danger signals released by the body after injury, including intracellular protein molecules (HMGB1, histones, s100s, heat shock proteins, eCIRP, etc.), secretory protein factors (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, VEGF, complements, etc.), purines and pyrimidines and their derived degradation products (nucleic acids, ATP, ADP, UDPG, uric acid, etc.), and extracellular matrix components (hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, heparin sulfate, biglycan, etc.). DAMPs can be detected by multiple receptors including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The study of DAMPs and their related signaling pathways, such as the mtDNA-triggered cGAS-YAP pathway, contributes to revealing the molecular mechanism of PBLI, and provides new therapeutic targets for controlling inflammatory diseases and alleviating their symptoms. In this review, we focus on the recent progress of research on DAMPs and their signaling pathways, as well as the potential therapeutic targets and future research directions in PBLI.","Li, Ning; Geng, Chenhao; Hou, Shike; Fan, Haojun; Gong, Yanhua",Int J Mol Sci,128,1

As the United Kingdom (UK) leaves the European Union, an understanding of the migration trends and possible influences are important to inform future planning. AIM: To examine trends in the profile of UK registered dentists in the context of key events and policy changes from 2000 to 2020. METHOD: Data were obtained from the General Dental Council via annual reports, and under ‘freedom of information’ communications; details of policy initiatives were obtained from the government and professional websites. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period (2000–2019), the number of registered dentists increased from 31,325 to 42,469, a net increase of 36% (11,144 dentists), the majority of whom were international graduates (58%; n = 6,416) such that by December 2019, 28% of all registered dentists had qualified outside of the UK. Similarly, regarding new registrants, there were increases of graduates from UK (18%), EEA countries (214%) and, via the Overseas Registration Examination route (621%); and a decrease from countries with bilateral agreements for recognition (43%), in line with changes in health and immigration policies. CONCLUSIONS: International dental graduates increasingly contribute to the UK dental workforce and there is an urgent need for research into dentist migration and retention in the UK in support of patient access to dental care. IMPACT: The United Kingdom (UK) dental workforce is increasingly reliant on international dental graduates representing 28% of current registrants compared with 18% in 2000. Health policies and immigration policies were the main drivers that influenced dental workforce migration to the UK along with wider events, such as EU expansions, global recession and Brexit. Pre-existing lack of research into dental workforce could add to the uncertainties of post COVID-19 oral health care access and delivery.","Davda, Latha S.; Radford, David R.; Scambler, Sasha; Gallagher, Jennifer E.",BDJ Open,128,24

They are at high risk for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for COVID-19 management among sheltered homeless adults. DESIGN: We developed a dynamic microsimulation model of COVID-19 in sheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts. We used cohort characteristics and costs from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and outcomes data were from published literature and national databases. We examined surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [R(e)] 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9). Costs were from a health care sector perspective; time horizon was 4 months, from April to August 2020. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohort of 2,258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston. INTERVENTIONS: We assessed daily symptom screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of screen-positives, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternate care sites [ACSs] for mild/moderate COVID-19, and temporary housing, each compared to no intervention. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative infections and hospital-days, costs to the health care sector (US dollars), and cost-effectiveness, as incremental cost per case prevented of COVID-19. RESULTS: We simulated a population of 2,258 sheltered homeless adults with mean age of 42.6 years. Compared to no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild/moderate disease led to 37% fewer infections and 46% lower costs (R(e)=2.6), 75% fewer infections and 72% lower costs (R(e)=1.3), and 51% fewer infections and 51% lower costs (R(e)=0.9). Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreased infections; incremental cost per case prevented was $1,000 (R(e)=2.6), $27,000 (R(e)=1.3), and $71,000 (R(e)=0.9). Temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was most effective but substantially more costly than other options. Results were sensitive to cost and sensitivity of PCR and ACS efficacy in preventing transmission. CONCLUSIONS & RELEVANCE: In this modeling study of simulated adults living in homeless shelters, daily symptom screening and ACSs were associated with fewer COVID-19 infections and decreased costs compared with no intervention. In a modeled surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with further decrease in COVID-19 infections at modest incremental cost and should be considered during future surges.","Baggett, Travis P.; Scott, Justine A.; Le, Mylinh H.; Shebl, Fatma M.; Panella, Christopher; Losina, Elena; Flanagan, Clare; Gaeta, Jessie M.; Neilan, Anne; Hyle, Emily P.; Mohareb, Amir; Reddy, Krishna P.; Siedner, Mark J.; Harling, Guy; Weinstein, Milton C.; Ciaranello, Andrea; Kazemian, Pooyan; Freedberg, Kenneth A.",medRxiv,128,1

Expression of one of these subgroup-specific genes, ORF7a, resulted in apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. Here, we observed that transient expression of ORF7a protein fused with myc or GFP tags at its N or C terminus inhibited cell growth and prevented BrdU incorporation in different cultural cells, suggesting that ORF7a expression may regulate cell cycle progression. Analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that ORF7a expression was associated with blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells after 24 to 60 h post-transfection. Similar results were observed in COS-7 and Vero cells. Mutation analysis of ORF7a revealed that the domain spanning aa 44–82 of 7a protein was essential for its cytoplasmic localization and for induction of the cell cycle arrest. After analyzing the cellular proteins involving in regulation of cell cycle progression, we demonstrated that ORF7a expression was correlated with a significant reduction of cyclin D3 level of mRNA transcription and expression, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at ser795 and ser809/811, not with the expression of cyclin D1, D2, cdk4 and cdk6 in HEK 293 cells. These results suggest that the insufficient expression of cyclin D3 may cause a decreased activity of cyclin D/cdk4/6, resulting in the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. Accumulation of hypo- or non-phosphorylated pRb thus prevents cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Wu, Jie; Shan, Yajun; Yao, Zhenyu; Dong, Bo; Chen, Bo; Zhao, Zhenhu; Wang, Shenqi; Chen, Jiapei; Cong, Yuwen",Virology,128,26

Thus, pregnancy may be a risk factor that could deepen the already negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect. It is important for institutions dedicated to perinatal health care to count on empirical information to optimize the provision of their services.","López-Morales, Hernán; del Valle, Macarena Verónica; Canet Juric, Lorena; Andrés, María Laura; Galli, Juan Ignacio; Poó, Fernando; Urquijo, Sebastián",Psychiatry Res,128,24

Significant progress towards malaria elimination has beenik made in the previous decades through intensified and improved malaria control measures such as indoor residual spraying (IRS), distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN), artemisinin-based combination therapy and administration of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy. However, the outbreak of pandemics like coronavirus disease (COVID-19), cyclones and tropical storms, lack of funding, porous political environment, dearth of resources for vector control, changes in vector behaviour, vector resistance to insecticides, community behavioural change and lack of feasible and sustainable digital technologies for managing malaria control interventions retards progress made towards malaria elimination. Also, arbitrary political environment and unstable economic situation often interfere with health programmes which subsequently lead to malaria outbreaks. Most recently, the country recorded a sharp increase in malaria incidences in malaria-endemic areas especially during the pandemic due to some factors such as movement restrictions, temporary cancellation of IRS activities, delayed delivery of IRS chemicals and recursive lockdown. Therefore, we propose ways to mitigate future malaria outbreaks and advocate for reconsidering malaria elimination strategies to addresses emerging challenges in eradicating malaria in Zimbabwe.","Mbunge, Elliot; Millham, Richard; Sibiya, Nokuthula; Takavarasha, Sam",Public Health Pract (Oxf),128,9

Early detection, treatment and prevention are key to reducing transmission. Post-exposure prophylaxis with single-dose rifampicin (SDR-PEP) reduces the risk of developing leprosy when administered to screened contacts of patients. This has been adopted in the WHO leprosy guidelines. The PEP4LEP study aims to determine the most effective and feasible method of screening people at risk of developing leprosy and administering chemoprophylaxis to contribute to interrupting transmission. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PEP4LEP is a cluster-randomised implementation trial comparing two interventions of integrated skin screening combined with SDR-PEP distribution to contacts of patients with leprosy in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Tanzania. One intervention is community-based, using skin camps to screen approximately 100 community contacts per leprosy patient, and to administer SDR-PEP when eligible. The other intervention is health centre-based, inviting household contacts of leprosy patients to be screened in a local health centre and subsequently receive SDR-PEP when eligible. The mobile health (mHealth) tool SkinApp will support health workers’ capacity in integrated skin screening. The effectiveness of both interventions will be compared by assessing the rate of patients with leprosy detected and case detection delay in months, as well as feasibility in terms of cost-effectiveness and acceptability. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the national ethical committees of Ethiopia (MoSHE), Mozambique (CNBS) and Tanzania (NIMR/MoHCDEC). Study results will be published open access in peer-reviewed journals, providing evidence for the implementation of innovative leprosy screening methods and chemoprophylaxis to policymakers.

This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84.9% had performed [≥]1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93.4% performed [≥]1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI 3-9.0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Interpretation: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","Seale, H.; Heywood, A.

At present, the COVID-19 has been prevalent worldwide for more than a year and caused more than four million deaths. Liver injury was frequently observed in patients with COVID-19. Recently, a new definition of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was proposed by a panel of international experts, and the relationship between MAFLD and COVID-19 has been actively investigated. Several previous studies indicated that the patients with MAFLD had a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and a tendency to develop severe type of respiratory infection, and others indicated that liver injury would be exacerbated in the patients with MAFLD once infected with COVID-19. The mechanism underlying the relationship between MAFLD and COVID-19 infection has not been thoroughly investigated, and recent studies indicated that multifactorial mechanisms, such as altered host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expression, direct viral attack, disruption of cholangiocyte function, systemic inflammatory reaction, drug-induced liver injury, hepatic ischemic and hypoxic injury, and MAFLD-related glucose and lipid metabolic disorders, might jointly contribute to both of the adverse hepatic and respiratory outcomes. In this review, we discussed the relationship between MAFLD and COVID-19 based on current available literature, and summarized the recommendations for clinical management of MAFLD patients during the pandemic of COVID-19.","Xu, Yanlan; Yang, Xinyu; Bian, Hua; Xia, Mingfeng",Lipids Health Dis,128,17

The aim of the present study was to develop a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay, based on the TaqMan technology, for the rapid and unambiguous characterisation of all bovine pestiviruses, including the emerging HoBi-like strains. The assay was found to be sensitive, specific and repeatable, ensuring detection of as few as 10(0)–10(1) viral RNA copies. No cross-reactions between different pestiviral species were observed even in samples artificially contaminated with more than one pestivirus. Analysis of field samples tested positive for BVDV-1, BVDV-2 or HoBi-like virus by a nested PCR protocol revealed that the developed TaqMan assay had equal or higher sensitivity and was able to discriminate correctly the viral species in all tested samples, whereas a real-time RT-PCR assay previously developed for HoBi-like pestivirus detection showed cross-reactivity with few high-titre BVDV-2 samples.","Mari, Viviana; Losurdo, Michele; Lucente, Maria Stella; Lorusso, Eleonora; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Patruno, Giovanni; Buonavoglia, Domenico; Decaro, Nicola",J Virol Methods,128,20

Preparedness of institutions during epidemic outbreak has a pivotal role in saving lives and preventing further spread. At the same time, these pandemics impact badly on professional and personal life of Health care workers. The objective of this study is to find the opinion of Health care workers regarding their level of preparedness, concerns and perceived impact related to this pandemic outbreak. Materials and Methods: in this study, random samples of doctors and nurses was provided with a self-administered questionnaire regarding their preparedness, work and non-work related concerns and impact on their lives during Covid-19 outbreak. Results: Most of the Health Care Workers believed that their institute preparation to fight Covid-19 pandemic is better than prior to onset of this crisis (p<0.001). Work related stress was seen more commonly in nurses whereas higher frequency of non-work related stress was observed among doctors. Nurses (75.55%) faith in their employer was more than doctors faith (46.66%) regarding their medical needs. There was more acceptance of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic drug for Covid-19 in doctors compared to nurses (p <0.01). Conclusions: Though this institute was more prepared at the time of pandemic spread, substantial opportunity of improvement remains.

This study aims to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, licensure, decision-making, and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population-level impact. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China. Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VEs) of ≥70% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with VEs <70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (<20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with VEs of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those ≥60 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with VEs ≥70%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact. Conclusions: Even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high cost-effectiveness. In addition to the primary endpoint on infection acquisition, developers should assess natural history and disease progression outcomes and/or proxy biomarkers, since such secondary endpoints may prove critical in licensure, decision-making, and vaccine impact.","Makhoul, Monia; Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Al-Omari, Sarah; Abu-Raddad, Laith J",,128,12

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) has become the primary respiratory support, replacing invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Our objective was to evaluate the economic and clinical consequences following implementation of this respiratory strategy in our unit. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 525 infants with bronchiolitis requiring respiratory support and successively treated during two distinct periods with invasive MV between 1996 and 2000, P1 (n = 193) and nCPAP between 2006 and 2010, P2 (n = 332). Costs were estimated using the hospital cost billing reports. RESULTS: Patients’ baseline characteristics were similar between the two periods. P2 is associated with a significant decrease in the length of ventilation (LOV) (4.1 ± 3.5 versus 6.9 ± 4.6 days, p < 0.001), PICU length of stay (LOS) (6.2 ± 4.6 versus 9.7 ± 5.5 days, p < 0.001) and hospital LOS. nCPAP was independently associated with a shorter duration of ventilatory support than MV (hazard ratio 1.8, 95 % CI 1.5–2.2, p < 0.001). nCPAP was also associated with a significant decrease in ventilation-associated complications, and less invasive management. The mean cost of acute viral bronchiolitis-related PICU hospitalizations was significantly decreased, from 17,451 to 11,205 € (p < 0.001). Implementation of nCPAP led to a reduction of the total annual cost of acute viral bronchiolitis hospitalizations of 715,000 €.

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72℃ and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70℃ and 12.42℃ respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1℃ increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1℃ increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","Wang, Mao; Jiang, Aili; Gong, Lijuan; Luo, Lina; Guo, Wenbin; Li, Chuyi; Zheng, Jing; Li, Chaoyong; Yang, Bixing; Zeng, Jietong; Chen, Youping; Zheng, Ke; Li, Hongyan",,128,20

Due to the enormous number of people who have been unaware until now, the development of COVID-19’s second-wave infection has become a severe threat. The present investigation aimed to characterize the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out from all the other COVID-19 patients and confirmed by RT-PCR undergoing a specialized COVID-19 hospital. From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications. Then, from April 17 to May 03, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical assessment was performed based on interim guidelines from the WHO. The diagnosis was conducted through RT-PCR. Later, identifying the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient based on checking the Clinical Observation Form (COF). The patients filled the COF form. Finally, statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 20 statistical program. RESULTS: In this investigation, a total of 326 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Among them, approximately 19.02% (n = 62) were asymptomatic, and 80.98% (n = 264) were symptomatic. Here, the finding shows that the occurrence of this infection was varied depending on age, sex, residence, occupation, smoking habit, comorbidities, etc. However, Males (60.12%) were more affected than females (39.88%), and, surprisingly, this pandemic infected both urban and rural residents almost equally (urban = 50.92%; rural = 49.08%). Approximately 19% of the asymptomatic and 62% of symptomatic cases had at least one comorbid disorder. Interestingly, an unexpected result was exhibited in the case of smokers, where non-smokers were more affected than smokers. The study indicates community transmission of COVID 19, where people were highly infected at their occupations (35.58%), at houses (23.93%) and by traveling (12.88%). Noteworthy, according to this report, a large number (19.33%) of individuals did not know exactly how they were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were most commonly treated by an antibiotic 95.09%, followed in second by corticosteroid 46.01%. Anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, and oxygenation are also needed for other patients. Among those, who were being treated, approximately 69.33% were isolated at home, 27.91% were being treated at dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Finally, 96.63% were discharged without complications, and 0.03% has died. CONCLUSION: This investigation concludes that males became more infected than females. Interestingly, both urban and rural people became nearly equally infected. It noticed community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, where people were highly infected at their workplaces. A higher rate of silent transmission indicates that more caution is needed to identify asymptomatic patients. Most of the infected people were isolated at home whereas nearly one-fourth were treated at hospitals. Clinically, antibiotics were the most widely used treatment. However, the majority of the patients were discharged without complications. The current investigation would be helpful to understand the clinical manifestations and socio-demographic situations during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.","Ali, Md Roushan; Hasan, Md.

We hypothesized that elevated personal stress induced by COVID-19 may underlie pain exacerbation among individuals with chronic myofascial pain. Methods Comprehensive myofascial pain questionnaire among 319 patients registered in our pain clinic. In total, 78 patients with TMD-associated pain responded and 113 patients with pain in other orofacial regions responded. Results Patients with chronic TMD pain reported a higher self-rated stress level, which correlated with significantly increased pain intensity, and analgesic consumption. In contrast, patients experiencing non-TMD pain did not report of any increase pain, regardless of their stress levels. Conclusion Significant correlation between self-perceived psychosocial stress levels and chronic myofascial pain exacerbation. Patients may benefit from early education and conservative intervention, and avoid uncontrolled increases in consumption of pain relief medication.","Karayanni, Hala; Dror, Amiel A.; Oren, Daniel; Sela, Eyal; Granot, Igal; Srouji, Samer",Advances in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,128,19

The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Objectives: To independently evaluate the EDI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 overall and in disproportionately affected subgroups. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to units other than the intensive care unit at a large academic medical center from March 9 through May 20, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of intensive care unit–level care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. The median age of the cohort was 64 (interquartile range, 53–75) with 168 (43%) Black patients and 169 (43%) women. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the EDI was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a sensitivity of 39% and a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusions: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high-risk and low-risk patients with COVID-19 with good discrimination, although its clinical use as an early warning system is limited by low sensitivity. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among patients with COVID-19.","Singh, Karandeep; Valley, Thomas S.; Tang, Shengpu; Li, Benjamin Y.; Kamran, Fahad; Sjoding, Michael W.; Wiens, Jenna; Otles, Erkin; Donnelly, John P.; Wei, Melissa Y.; McBride, Jonathon P.; Cao, Jie; Penoza, Carleen; Ayanian, John Z.; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K.",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,128,24

Men are more affected than women by Covid-19, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these differences are largely unknown. One plausible explanation is that differences in sex hormones could partially account for this distinct prevalence in both sexes. Accordingly, several papers have reported a protective role of 17ß-estradiol during Covid-19, which might help explain why women appear less likely to die from Covid-19 than men. 17ß-estradiol is the predominant and most biologically active endogenous estrogen, which signals through estrogen receptor α, estrogen receptor ß, and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1. These receptors are expressed in mature cells from the innate and the adaptive immune system, particularly on dendritic cells (DCs), suggesting that estrogens could modulate their effector functions. DCs are the most specialized and proficient antigen-presenting cells, acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity with a powerful capacity to prime antigen-specific naive CD8+ T cells. DCs are richly abundant in the lung where they respond to viral infection. A relative increase of mature DCs in broncho-alveolar lavage fluids from Covid-19 patients has already been reported. Here we will describe how SARS-CoV-2 acts on DCs, the role of estrogen on DC immunobiology, summarise the impact of sex hormones on the immune response against Covid-19, and explore clinical trials regarding Covid-19.","Mateus, Daniela; Sebastião, Ana Isabel; Carrascal, Mylène A; Carmo, Anália do; Matos, Ana Miguel; Cruz, Maria Teresa",Rev Med Virol,128,1

It contains more than 25 herbs and goat milk as per the Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI). It strengthens the neck, shoulder, and chest muscles and improves the capacity of sense organs. It delays the aging process and reduces hair fall. Recent studies showed that it is also useful in COVID-19. In the current study, an attempt to develop quality control protocols and evaluate the standardization parameters like refractive index, iodine value, saponification value, peroxide value, acid value, rancidity, HPTLC fingerprint profile along with major bioactive compound and quantification of Berberine chloride, Negundoside, and Marmelosin by HPLC. Establishing quality protocol and standard parameters like physicochemical parameters and estimation of bioactive compounds of this preparation is significant for quality control. RESULTS: In this study, HPTLC identifies bioactive chemical compounds like Berberine chloride, Marmelosin, Negundoside, glycyrrhizin, and para hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), Lupeol, Embelin, and Solasodine, which were present in the Anu Taila formulation. HPLC was used to estimate the bioactive marker compounds Negundoside, Berberine chloride, and Marmelosin were present in the Anu Taila formulation. The quantitative evaluation of Berberine chloride (0.0013%), Marmelosin (0.0366%), Negundoside (0.0086%) is present in Anu Taila formulation. CONCLUSION: The study reveals that sufficient quality control parameters were followed during the preparation of the formulation. Physicochemical analysis was carried out as per the guidelines of Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia of India. HPTLC and HPLC profiles generated in this particular study can be considered as a preliminary tool ascertaining the authenticity of Anu Taila.","Meena, Ajay Kumar; Rekha, P.; Perumal, Ayyam; Ilavarasan, R.; Singh, Ravindra; Srikant, N.; Dhiman, K.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The observational study was based on data from ECDC and WHO databases collected from 27 January 2020 to 15 November 2020. In addition to the absolute number of DALYs, a weekly trend of DALYs/100,000 inhabitants was computed for each country to assess the evolution of the pandemic burden over time. A cluster analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test were performed to allow for a country-to-country comparison. RESULTS: The total DALYs amount to 4,354 per 100.000 inhabitants. YLLs were accountable for 98% of total DALYs. Italy, Czechia and Sweden had the highest values of DALYs/100,000 while Finland, Estonia and Slovakia had the lowest. The latter three countries differed significantly from the others - in terms of DALYs trend over time - as shown by KS test. The cluster analysis allowed for the identification of three clusters of countries sharing similar trends of DALYs during the assessed period of time. These results show that notable differences were observed among different countries, with most of the disease burden attributable to YLLs. CONCLUSIONS: DALYs have proven to be an effective measure of the burden of disease. Public health and policy actions, as well as demographic, epidemiological and cultural features of each country, may be responsible for the wide variations in the health impact that were observed among the countries analyzed.","Gianino, M M; Savatteri, A; Politano, G; Nurchis, M C; Pascucci, D; Damiani, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,128,16

We included 28 recovered COVID-19 patients and 27 healthy controls between April 2020 and June 2020. Demographic data, the mental health scores, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data, and plasma metabolomics were collected and compared between the two groups. Tract-based spatial statistics and graph theory approaches were used for DTI data analysis. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of the plasma was performed. Correlation analyses were performed between these characteristics. Recovered COVID-19 patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity values in widespread brain regions, and significantly lower global efficiency, longer shortest path length, and less nodal local efficiency in superior occipital gyrus (all, P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Our results also demonstrated significantly different plasma metabolic profiling in recovered COVID-19 patients even at 3 months after their hospital discharge, which was mainly related to purine pathways, amino acids, lipids, and amine metabolism. Certain regions with cerebral WM alterations in the recovered patients showed significant correlations with different metabolites and the mental health scores. We observed multiple alterations in both WM integrity and plasma metabolomics that may explain the deteriorated mental health of recovered COVID-19 patients. These findings may provide potential biomarkers for the mental health evaluation for the recovered COVID-19 patients and potential targets for novel therapeutics.","Yang, Lian; Zhou, Mei; Li, Lingli; Luo, Ping; Fan, Wenliang; Xu, Juanjuan; Chen, Qing; Pan, Feng; Lei, Ping; Zheng, Chuansheng; Jin, Yang",Transl Psychiatry,128,19

A total of 354 patients (mean age 65.2 ± 16.6, 52% female, 42% male) who had brain imaging were included in the study. Of this total sample, 218 had thorax CT scanning (65.5%). (Reviewer 3, Comment 2,3,4) Neuroimaging and thorax CT findings, clinical course, neurologic findings, and laboratory data were evaluated. White matter lesions (WML) and thorax CT scans were scored. Participants were divided according to whether or not they had an infarction. RESULTS The neuroimaging findings indicated infarcts, parenchymal hemorrhage, encephalitis, cortical signal abnormality, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and cranial nerve involvement. (Reviewer 3, Comment 5) WML significantly positively correlated with age (p < 0.01) but not with gender (p > 0.05). Thorax CT findings did not demonstrate significant correlations with infarcts, WML, or hemorrhages (p > 0.05). D-dimer and ferritin levels were significantly higher among patients with infarcts (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Immune-mediated prothrombic state and cytokine storm appear to be more responsible for etiopathogenesis than direct viral neurotropism.

A web-based survey was conducted to collect data on Internet use and outings in a retrospective manner. The period covered by our data is from mid-February to mid-May 2020. Multilevel analysis and binomial logistic regression analysis were performed to examine the relationship between Internet use and outings. The results clearly show that Internet use replaced outings. In particular, Internet use for socializing, exercise, and leisure/entertainment had a strong substitution relationship with outings. Internet use for socializing and leisure/entertainment was also associated with refraining from visiting restaurants. In contrast, there was a weak substitution relationship between Internet use for daily shopping and outings.

Further, it affects the financial and natural resource market simultaneously, as both are considered complementary goods. The volatility in the oil prices deteriorates the global financial market to substantiate the “financial resource (oil) curse” hypothesis primarily filled with earlier studies. In contrast, this study moved forward and extended the given relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in a panel of 81 different countries. The study’s main objective is to examine the volatility in the domestic credit provided to the private sector due to oil shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. The study is essential to assess the healthcare vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the damage of financial stability, causing deterioration in the oil rents to affect the global sustainability agenda. The study employed statistical techniques to get sound inferences of the parameter estimates, including robust least squares regression, seemingly unrelated regression, and innovation accounting matrix to get a variable estimate at the level and inter-temporal framework. The results confirmed the U-shaped relationship between oil rents and financial development during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it verifies the “financial resource (oil) curse” hypothesis at the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later down, it supports the capital market when economies are resuming their economic activities and maintaining the SOPs to restrain coronavirus at a global scale. The qualitative assessment confirmed the negative effect of financial development and oil shocks on environmental quality during the pandemic crisis. The innovation accounting matrix shows that the COVID-19 pandemic will primarily be the main factor that intervenes in the relationship between oil rents and financial development, which proceed towards the “resource curse” hypothesis during the following years’ time period. Therefore, the need for long-term economic policies is highly desirable to support the financial and resource market under the suggested guidelines of restraining coronavirus worldwide.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Zaman, Khalid; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Askar, Sameh E.; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Kabbani, Ahmad",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,128,24

However, successful IPE implementation at scale can be challenging because of complicated logistics and competing priorities. Implementing across multiple geographies adds further complexity. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the implementation of a full cohort IPE activity for medical and pharmacy students delivered at both the Australian and Malaysian campuses of Monash University. DESIGN: We designed a 150-minute, blended learning activity centred around asthma care for second-year medical and pharmacy students. Student perceptions were measured with a pre- and post-activity survey using the validated ten-item, three-factor, SPICE-R2 instrument. Analysis focused on differences between professions and countries. RESULTS: All second-year medicine (N = 301 in Australia and N = 107 in Malaysia) and pharmacy students (N = 168 in Australia and N = 117 in Malaysia) participated in the learning activity. A total of 326/693 (47%) students participated in the associated research by completing both the pre- and post-activity surveys. The pre-activity survey showed significant differences in four items between medicine and pharmacy students in Australia and two items in Malaysia. Post-activity, we observed significant changes in 8/10 items when the two professions were combined. Specifically, we noted changes across the countries in perceptions of roles and responsibilities for collaborative practice and patient outcomes from collaborative practice. CONCLUSIONS: IPE across different professions and countries is feasible. Positive outcomes in role understanding and perceived patient outcomes are achievable through a context-sensitive, locally driven approach to implementation.

This article provides clinicians with a distilled understanding of the diagnoses and their epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised. SUMMARY: Patients with primary headache disorders that are classified as ""other primary headache disorders"" have presentations with unique diagnostic and management considerations.

Therefore, it comes as no surprise that many HCP have become infected by COVID-19 globally. The infection of HCP has received great attention in social media and is frequently reported from different parts of the world. However, there are few scientific reports addressing this aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of COVID-19 infection among the HCP of our setting. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed in the National Heart Foundation Hospital & Research Institute of Bangladesh from April 29 to July 20, 2020. HCP employed in this hospital who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms or came in close contact with COVID-19 patients at home or their workplace were included in this study. The presence of COVID-19 disease was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 394 HCP were sampled and 139 had a positive corona test. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCP with confirmed COVID-19. Data analysis was performed in July 2020. Results Out of 1,409 HCP, 139 subjects tested positive for COVID-19. Among the HCP, infection rate was 9.86%. The mean age of the study population was 34.08±11.11 years (range: 20-69 yrs), of whom 82 (59%) were female. Most of this cohort were nurses (56 [40.3%]) and physicians (25 [18%]), and the remaining 58 (41.7%) were other staff. The mean duration of onset of symptoms to test was 2.89±2.07 days. The most common symptoms were fever (84.2%), fatigue (56.1%), cough (54%), body ache (39.6%), headache, and anosmia (38.8%). Most subjects had mild disease (125 [93%]), three (2.1%) of the HCP had moderate disease and one (0.7%) had severe disease. Ten of the HCP (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Most of them were treated either by ivermectin plus azithromycin or ivermectin plus doxycycline. Only 20 (14.4%) of the HCP were hospitalized, while others were treated either in home isolation (59.7%) or in institutional isolation (25.9%). Recovery was almost uneventful except one healthcare worker who died. Conclusion Most HCP had mild symptoms and a few of them were asymptomatic also. HCP with mild COVID-19 symptoms may be treated in home or institutional isolation. As they are a vulnerable group for infection, providing adequate protection to HCP is absolutely mandatory to safeguard them from this pandemic.","Malik, Fazila-Tun-Nesa; Ishraquzzaman, Mir; Kalimuddin, Md; Choudhury, Sohel; Ahmed, Nazir; Badiuzzaman, Mohammad; Ahmed, Mir N; Banik, Dhiman; Huq, Tawfiq S; Al Mamun, Mohammad Abdullah",Cureus,128,20

Evidences have indicated that the efficiency of emergency response was considered crucial to curb the spread of the emerging infectious disease. However, studies of COVID-19 on this topic are relatively few. Methods: A qualitative comparative study was conducted to compare the timeline of emergency responses to H1N1 (2009) and COVID-19, by using a set of six key time nodes selected from international literature. Besides, we also explored the spread speed and peak time of COVID-19 and H1N1 swine influenza by comparing the confirmed cases in the same time interval. Results: The government’s entire emergency responses to the epidemic, H1N1 swine influenza (2009) completed in 28 days, and COVID-19 (2019) completed in 46 days. Emergency responses speed for H1N1 was 18 days faster. As for the epidemic spread speed, the peak time of H1N1 came about 4 weeks later than that of COVID-19, and the H1N1 curve in America was flatter than COVID-19 in China within the first four months after the disease emerged. Conclusions: The speed of the emergency responses to H1N1 was faster than COVID-19, which might be an important influential factor for slowing down the arrival of the peak time at the beginning of the epidemic. Although COVID-19 in China is coming to an end, the government should improve the public health emergency system, in order to control the spread of the epidemic and lessen the adverse social effects in possible future outbreaks.","Wang, Qian; Zhang, Tiantian; Zhu, Huanhuan; Wang, Ying; Liu, Xin; Bai, Ge; Dai, Ruiming; Zhou, Ping; Luo, Li",Int J Environ Res Public Health,128,16

Myeloid cells phenotyping is well recognized to diagnose critical illness-induced immunodepression in sepsis and has not been well characterized in COVID-19. The aim of this study is to review phenotypic characteristics of myeloid cells and evaluate their relations with the occurrence of secondary infection and mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted in an intensive care unit. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the circulating myeloid cells phenotypes of adult COVID-19 critically ill patients. Phenotyping circulating immune cells was performed by flow cytometry daily for routine analysis and twice weekly for lymphocytes and monocytes subpopulations analysis, as well as monocyte human leukocyte antigen (mHLA)-DR expression. RESULTS: Out of the 29 critically ill adult patients with severe COVID-19 analyzed, 12 (41.4%) developed secondary infection and six patients died during their stay. Monocyte HLA-DR kinetics was significantly different between patients developing secondary infection and those without, respectively, at day 5–7 and 8–10 following admission. The monocytes myeloid-derived suppressor cells to total monocytes ratio was associated with 28- and 60-day mortality. Those myeloid characteristics suggest three phenotypes: hyperactivated monocyte/macrophage is significantly associated with mortality, whereas persistent immunodepression is associated with secondary infection occurrence compared to transient immunodepression. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid phenotypes of critically ill COVID-19 patients may be associated with development of secondary infection, 28- and 60-day mortality.

A wastewater surveillance program should provide rapid turn around for sample measurements (ideally within 24 hours), but storage of samples is necessary for a variety of reasons including biobanking. Here we investigate how storage of wastewater solids at 4 °C, −20 °C, and −80 °C affects measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We find that short term (7 or 8 d) storage of raw solids at 4 °C has little effect on measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas longer term storage at 4 °C (35–122 d) or freezing reduces measurements by 60%, on average. We show that normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations by concentrations of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, an endogenous wastewater virus, can correct for changes during storage as storage can have a similar effect on PMMoV RNA as on SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The reductions in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids during freeze thaws is less than those reported for the same target in liquid influent by several authors.","Simpson, Adrian; Topol, Aaron; White, Bradley J.; Wolfe, Marlene K.; Wigginton, Krista R.; Boehm, Alexandria B.",PeerJ,128,1

Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response. METHODS: We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions. RESULTS: There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings.","Chen, Yirong; Chu, Collins Wenhan; Chen, Mark I.C.; Cook, Alex R.",J Biomed Inform,128,9

Here, we have assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates BBV152A, BBV152B, and BBV152C in Syrian hamsters. Three dose vaccination regimes with vaccine candidates induced significant titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. BBV152A and BBV152B vaccine candidates remarkably generated a quick and robust immune response. Post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccinated hamsters did not show any histopathological changes in the lungs. The protection of the hamster was evident by the rapid clearance of the virus from lower respiratory tract, reduced virus load in upper respiratory tract, absence of lung pathology, and robust humoral immune response. These findings confirm the immunogenic potential of the vaccine candidates and further protection of hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Of the three candidates, BBV152A showed the better response.","Mohandas, Sreelekshmy; Yadav, Pragya D.; Shete-Aich, Anita; Abraham, Priya; Vadrevu, Krishna Mohan; Sapkal, Gajanan; Mote, Chandrashekhar; Nyayanit, Dimpal; Gupta, Nivedita; Srinivas, Vellimedu Kannappa; Kadam, Manoj; Kumar, Abhimanyu; Majumdar, Triparna; Jain, Rajlaxmi; Deshpande, Gururaj; Patil, Savita; Sarkale, Prasad; Patil, Deepak; Ella, Raches; Prasad, Sai D.; Sharma, Sharda; Ella, Krishna M.; Panda, Samiran; Bhargava, Balram",iScience,128,19

We review key characteristics of the residual transmission and recommend options for improvement. Transmission has declined by >10-fold since 2000 but remains heterogeneous over small distances. Following the crash of Anopheles gambiae, which coincided with ITN scale-up around 2005-2012, Anopheles funestus now dominates malaria transmission. While most infections still occur indoors, substantial biting happens outdoors and before bed-time. There is widespread resistance to pyrethroids and carbamates; An. funestus being particularly strongly-resistant. In short and medium-term, these challenges could be addressed using high-quality indoor residual spraying with nonpyrethroids, or ITNs incorporating synergists. Supplementary tools, eg, spatial-repellents may expand protection outdoors. However, sustainable control requires resilience-building approaches, particularly improved housing and larval-source management to suppress mosquitoes, stronger health systems guaranteeing case-detection and treatment, greater community-engagement and expanded health education.","Okumu, Fredros; Finda, Marceline",J Infect Dis,128,2

General guidelines have evolved, but to date, there are no explicit directives about whether and how to proceed. This paper reviews professional, ethical, and legal challenges that experts should consider before conducting such an evaluation remotely. Although the discussion is more widely applicable, remote forensic psychological assessment of adults alleging childhood abuse is used as an example throughout, due to the complexity of these cases, the ethical dilemmas they can present, and the need to carefully assess non-verbal trauma-related symptoms. The use of videoconferencing technology is considered in terms of potential benefits of this medium, as well as challenges this method could pose to aspects of interviewing and psychometric testing. The global pandemic is also considered with respect to its effects on functioning and mental health and the confounding impact such a crisis has on assessing the relationship between childhood abuse and current psychological functioning. Finally, for those evaluators who want to engage in remote assessment, practice considerations are discussed.","Goldenson, Julie; Josefowitz, Nina",Psychol Inj Law,128,20

The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV‑2, is highly variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV‑2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV‑2 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about SARS-CoV‑2, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that a remedy for this disease will soon be found.

Vaccination is the single most effective tool for preventing communicable disease, highlighted by the achievements of the smallpox and poliomyelitis eradication programs and the rise in infections for which no effective vaccine is available: human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, worms, and tuberculosis. World Health Organization initiatives target acute respiratory diseases in infancy and early childhood with novel immunization approaches. Effective vaccines are needed urgently for viral respiratory diseases, but progress has been disappointingly slow. Vaccine candidates often show reduced efficacy in infancy, in partially immune adults, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. However, several promising vaccines are in clinical trial, and it is likely that vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza will be licensed within the next 5–10 years. Mucosally delivered influenza vaccine is now available, and novel adjuvants offer the prospect of better immunogenicity.

To aid assessment, subjective scar assessment scales are available that use health-care professionals’ and patients’ opinions to score scar characteristics. The subjective scales are more widely used in clinical practice over objective scar measures. To date, there is no research that considers patients’ views on scar assessment and the role of subjective and objective assessment tools. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore patients’ perspectives on scar assessment and the utility of scar assessment tools during burns rehabilitation. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 adult burn patients who were being reviewed in clinic for scarring. Participants were recruited via their clinical care team and research nurses at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. Topics covered during interview included patient experience of scar assessment, the use of scar assessment tools and discussion surrounding important factors to be addressed when assessing scars. A thematic analysis using the Framework Method was conducted. RESULTS: Participants identified key subthemes that contribute towards the overarching theme of patient-centred scar assessment. These are: patient-led care; continuity in care; learning how to self-manage scarring; and psychological assessment. Links were demonstrated between these subthemes and the remaining themes that describe scar assessment strategies, indicating their potential patient-centred contributions. The subjective opinions of clinicians were found to be valued above the use of subjective or objective scar assessment tools. Scar assessment scales were perceived to be a beneficial method for self-reflection in relation to psychosocial functioning. However, minimal feedback and review of completed assessment scales led to uncertainty regarding their purpose. Patients perceived objective tools to be of primary use for health-care professionals, though the measures may aid patients’ understanding of scar properties. CONCLUSIONS: Scar assessment tools should be used to support, rather than replace, health-care professionals’ subjective judgements of scarring. Adapting the way in which clinicians introduce and use scar assessment tools, according to patient needs, can support a patient-centred approach to scar assessment.","Price, Kate; Moiemen, Naiem; Nice, Laura; Mathers, Jonathan",Burns Trauma,128,1

This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its impact on quality of life (QOL) in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: An online study was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Depression and QOL were assessed using standardized instruments. RESULTS: A total of 1,757 participants were recruited. The prevalence of depression was 33.75% (95% CI: 31.59%-35.97%). Results emerging from multiple logistic regression analysis showed that direct care of COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.441, 95% CI: 1.031–2.013, P = 0.032), and current smoking (OR: 2.880, 95% CI: 1.018–8.979, P = 0.048) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, ENT nurses with depression had a lower overall QOL compared to those without depression (F((1, 1757))= 536.80, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Depression was common among ENT nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Considering the negative impact of depression on QOL and care quality, regular screening for depression should be conducted in ENT nurses and treatment should be provided.","Tian, Zi-Rong; Xie, Xiaomeng; Li, Xiu-Ya; Li, Yue; Zhang, Qinge; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Cheung, Teris; Ungvari, Gabor S.; An, Feng-Rong; Xiang, Yu-Tao",PeerJ,128,1
