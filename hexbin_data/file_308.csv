669,Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infections: the effects of bacterial coinfection,2011-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infected patients. However, data on the effects of bacterial coinfection on these patients are very scarce. Therefore, this study explores the impact of bacterial coinfection on the clinical and laboratory parameters amongst H1N1 hospitalized patients. FINDINGS: This retrospective study involved hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections (September 2009 to May 2010). Relevant clinical data and the detection of bacterial coinfection from respiratory or sterile site samples were obtained. Multiplex PCR was used to determine the co-existence of other respiratory viruses. Comparison was made between patients with and without bacterial coinfection. The occurrence of coinfection was 34%; 14 (28%) bacterial and only 3 (6%) viral. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 5) was the commonest bacteria followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3). In univariate analysis, clinical factors associated with bacterial coinfection were age > 50 years (p = 0.02), presence of comorbidity (p = 0.04), liver impairment (p = 0.02), development of complications (p = 0.004) and supplemental oxygen requirement (p = 0.02). Leukocytosis (p = 0.02) and neutrophilia (p = 0.004) were higher in bacterial coinfected patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age > 50 years and combined complications were predictive of bacterial coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial coinfection is not uncommon in H1N1 infected patients and is more frequently noted in the older aged patients and is associated with higher rates of complications. Also, as adjunct to clinical findings, clinicians need to have a higher index of suspicion if neutrophilia was identified at admission as it may denote bacterial coinfection.","Dhanoa, Amreeta; Fang, Ngim C; Hassan, Sharifah S; Kaniappan, Priyatharisni; Rajasekaram, Ganeswrie",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217982/,308
1578,Life‐history traits predict perennial species response to fire in a desert ecosystem,2014-07-10,"The Mojave Desert of North America has become fire‐prone in recent decades due to invasive annual grasses that fuel wildfires following years of high rainfall. Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in this system, and post‐fire shifts in species composition have been substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life‐history traits could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of life‐history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a consistent fire‐response. Six life‐history traits varied significantly between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long‐term (up to 52 years) post‐fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan, seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were classified into three PFTs based on combinations of life‐history traits. Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were characterized by short lifespans, small, wind‐dispersed seeds, low height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves. Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by long lifespans, large non‐wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our results show that PFTs based on life‐history traits can reliably predict the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert. Dominant, long‐lived species of this region possess a combination of traits limiting their ability to recover, presenting a clear example of how a novel disturbance regime may shift selective environmental pressures to favor alternative life‐history strategies.","Shryock, Daniel F.; DeFalco, Lesley A.; Esque, Todd C.",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161178/,308
1987,Evaluating Subcriticality during the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa,2015-10-20,"The 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak is the largest and most widespread to date. In order to estimate ongoing transmission in the affected countries, we estimated the weekly average number of secondary cases caused by one individual infected with Ebola throughout the infectious period for each affected West African country using a stochastic hidden Markov model fitted to case data from the World Health Organization. If the average number of infections caused by one Ebola infection is less than 1.0, the epidemic is subcritical and cannot sustain itself. The epidemics in Liberia and Sierra Leone have approached subcriticality at some point during the epidemic; the epidemic in Guinea is ongoing with no evidence that it is subcritical. Response efforts to control the epidemic should continue in order to eliminate Ebola cases in West Africa.","Enanoria, Wayne T.

2993,LIVIVO – the Vertical Search Engine for Life Sciences,2017-01-18,"The explosive growth of literature and data in the life sciences challenges researchers to keep track of current advancements in their disciplines. Novel approaches in the life science like the One Health paradigm require integrated methodologies in order to link and connect heterogeneous information from databases and literature resources. Current publications in the life sciences are increasingly characterized by the employment of trans-disciplinary methodologies comprising molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional and proteomic high throughput technologies with data from humans, plants, and animals. The literature search engine LIVIVO empowers retrieval functionality by incorporating various literature resources from medicine, health, environment, agriculture and nutrition. LIVIVO is developed in-house by ZB MED – Information Centre for Life Sciences. It provides a user-friendly and usability-tested search interface with a corpus of 55 Million citations derived from 50 databases. Standardized application programming interfaces are available for data export and high throughput retrieval. The search functions allow for semantic retrieval with filtering options based on life science entities. The service oriented architecture of LIVIVO uses four different implementation layers to deliver search services. A Knowledge Environment is developed by ZB MED to deal with the heterogeneity of data as an integrative approach to model, store, and link semantic concepts within literature resources and databases. Future work will focus on the exploitation of life science ontologies and on the employment of NLP technologies in order to improve query expansion, filters in faceted search, and concept based relevancy rankings in LIVIVO.","Müller, Bernd; Poley, Christoph; Pössel, Jana; Hagelstein, Alexandra; Gübitz, Thomas",Datenbank Spektrum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750838/,308
4682,Amtilche Mitteilungen,2006,"The hnRNP A/B proteins are among the most abundant RNA-binding proteins, forming the core of the ribonucleoprotein complex that associates with nascent transcripts in eukaryotic cells. There are several paralogs in this subfamily, each of which is subject to alternative transcript splicing and post-translational modifications. The structural diversity of these proteins generates a multitude of functions that involve interactions with DNA or, more commonly, RNA. They also recruit regulatory proteins associated with pathways related to DNA and RNA metabolism, and appear to accompany transcripts throughout the life of the mRNA. We have highlighted here recent progress in elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of these hnRNPs in a wide range of nuclear processes, including DNA replication and repair, telomere maintenance, transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA nucleo-cytoplasmic export.","He, Yaowu; Smith, Ross",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079774/,308
4772,Studying the recovery procedure for the time-dependent transmission rate(s) in epidemic models,2012-06-20,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined by the association of bilateral infiltrates and hypoxaemia following an initial insult. Although a new definition has been recently proposed (Berlin definition), there are various forms of ARDS with potential differences regarding their management (ventilator settings, prone positioning use, corticosteroids). ARDS can be caused by various aetiologies, and the adequate treatment of the responsible cause is crucial to improve the outcome. It is of paramount importance to characterize the mechanisms causing lung injury to optimize both the aetiological treatment and the symptomatic treatment. If there is no obvious cause of ARDS or if a direct lung injury is suspected, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be strongly considered to identify microorganisms responsible for pneumonia. Blood samples can also help to identify microorganisms and to evaluate biomarkers of infection. If there is no infectious cause of ARDS or no other apparent aetiology is found, second-line examinations should include markers of immunologic diseases. In selected cases, open lung biopsy remains useful to identify the cause of ARDS when all other examinations remain inconclusive. CT scan is fundamental when there is a suspicion of intra-abdominal sepsis and in some cases of pneumonia. Ultrasonography is important not only in evaluating biventricular function but also in identifying pleural effusions and pneumothorax. The definition of ARDS remains clinical and the main objective of the diagnostic workup should be to be focused on identification of its aetiology, especially a treatable infection.

5167,Traveling Waves in Spatial SIRS Models,2014-01-28,"High-throughput microchip devices used for nucleic-acid amplification require sealed reactors. This is to prevent evaporative loss of the amplification mixture and cross-contamination, which may occur among fluidically connected reactors. In most high-throughput nucleic-acid amplification devices, reactor sealing is achieved by microvalves. Additionally, these devices require micropumps to distribute amplification mixture into an array of reactors, thereby increasing the device cost, and adding complexity to the chip fabrication and operation processes. To overcome these limitations, we report microfluidic devices harboring open (unsealed) reactors in conjunction with a single-step capillary based flow scheme for sequential distribution of amplification mixture into an array of reactors. Concern about evaporative loss in unsealed reactors have been addressed by optimized reactor design, smooth internal reactor surfaces, and incorporation of a localized heating scheme for the reactors, in which isothermal, real-time helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) was performed.","Ramalingam, Naveen; San, Tong Chee; Kai, Teo Jin; Mak, Matthew Yew Mun; Gong, Hai-Qing",Microfluid Nanofluidics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087983/,308

5275,News from the IAEH,2013-05-18,Microfluidic particle counters are important tools in biomedical diagnostic applications such as flow cytometry analysis. Major methods of counting particles in microfluidic devices are reviewed in this paper. The microfluidic resistive pulse sensor advances in sensitivity over the traditional Coulter counter by improving signal amplification and noise reduction techniques. Nanopore-based methods are used for single DNA molecule analysis and the capacitance counter is useful in liquids of low electrical conductivity and in sensing the changes of cell contents. Light-scattering and light-blocking counters are better for detecting larger particles or concentrated particles. Methods of using fluorescence detection have the capability for differentiating particles of similar sizes but different types that are labeled with different fluorescent dyes. The micro particle image velocimetry method has also been used for detecting and analyzing particles in a flow field. The general limitation of microfluidic particle counters is the low throughput which needs to be improved in the future. The integration of two or more existing microfluidic particle counting techniques is required for many practical on-chip applications.,"Zhang, Hongpeng; Chon, Chan Hee; Pan, Xinxiang; Li, Dongqing",Microfluid Nanofluidics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088397/,308

They will make a series of grand discoveries/breakthroughs and push the discipline into an ‘age of grand discoveries’. Mathematics, geography, physics and chemistry have all experienced their ages of grand discoveries; and in life sciences, the age of grand discoveries has appeared countless times since the 16th century. Thanks to the ever-changing development of molecular biology over the past 50 years, contemporary life science is once again approaching its breaking point and the trigger for this is most likely to be ‘lifeomics’. At the end of the 20th century, genomics wrote out the ‘script of life’; proteomics decoded the script; and RNAomics, glycomics and metabolomics came into bloom. These ‘omics’, with their unique epistemology and methodology, quickly became the thrust of life sciences, pushing the discipline to new high.

5338,"Newsletter from the ISSI President, August 2003.",2003,"RNA interference (RNAi) causes degradation of targeted endogenous RNA in many diverse organisms. To investigate the effect of dsRNA on silkworm cells, we transfected three kinds of synthetic dsRNAs of 435 bp(Ap(1)), 300 bp(Ap(2)) and 399 bp(A(H)) in length against the various regions of BmNPV’s DNA polymerase gene and DNA helicase gene, which are indispensable for viral replication in silkworm cells by TransMessenger(TM) transfection Reagent. Results indicated that in the experiment where silkworm cells were infected with wild-strain BmNPV of the three dsRNAs, Ap(2) and A(H) can effectively suppress the replication of virus, but Ap(1) had no effect on the inhibition of viral replication. Ap(2) and A(H) can reduce the infective titer of BmNPV with a peak change of approximately 3–4 logs on day 4 post-infection. The results of reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA dot blotting also indicated that the expression level of the two target genes and the quantity of viral DNA both distinctly decreased under the influence of Ap(2) or A(H). Furthermore, using fluorescence microscopy we analyzed the distribution patterns of dsRNA. Our studies revealed that a majority of dsRNA was localized in the nuclear periphery discontinuously after 24 h of transfection.","Ying, Xu; Chenggang, Zhu; Yongfeng, Jin; Yaozhou, Zhang",Chin Sci Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088768/,308

5416,Staged progression model for epidemic spread on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks,2011-06-11,"Canine distemper (CD) is a highly contagious, often fatal, multisystemic, and incurable disease in dogs and other carnivores, which is caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). Although vaccines have been used as the principal means of controlling the disease, CD has been reported in vaccinated animals. The hemoagglutinin (H) protein is one of the most important antigens for inducing protective immunity against CD, and antigenic variation of recent CDV strains may explain vaccination failure. In this study, a new CDV isolate (TM-CC) was obtained from a Tibetan Mastiff that died of distemper, and its genome was characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the H gene revealed that the CDV-TM-CC strain is unique among 20 other CDV strains and can be classified into the Asia-1 group with the Chinese strains, Hebei and HLJ1-06, and the Japanese strain, CYN07-hV. The H gene of CDV-TM-CC shows low identity (90.4 % nt and 88.9 % aa) with the H gene of the classical Onderstepoort vaccine strain, which may explain the inability of the Tibetan Mastiff to mount a protective immune response. We also performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the N, P, and F protein sequences, as well as potential N-glycosylation sites and cysteine residues. This analysis shows that an N-glycosylation site at aa 108-110 within the F protein of CDV-TM-CC is specific for the wild-type strains (5804P, A75/17, and 164071) and the Asia-1 group strains, and may be another important factor for the poor immune response. These results provide important information for the design of CD vaccines in the China region and elsewhere.","Li, Weike; Li, Tiansong; Liu, Yuxiu; Gao, Yuwei; Yang, Songtao; Feng, Na; Sun, Heting; Wang, Shengle; Wang, Lei; Bu, Zhigao; Xia, Xianzhu",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089258/,308

5746,Researchers get to grips with cause of pneumonia epidemic,2003,"Objective: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is a common reason for emergency pediatric intensive care. An objective assessment of disease severity from acute physiological parameters would be of value in clinical practice and in the design of clinical trials. We hypothesised that there was a difference in the best early respiratory indices in those who died compared with those who survived. Design: A prospective observational study of 118 consecutive AHRF admissions with data analysis incorporating all blood gases. Setting: A pediatric intensive care unit in a national children’s hospital. Interventions: None. Results: Mortality was 26/118,22% (95% confidence interval 18–26%). There were no significant differences in the best alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO(2), torr), oxygenation index (OI), ventilation index (VI), or PaO(2)/FIO(2) during the first 2 days of intensive care between the survivors and non-survivors. Only the mean airway pressure (MAP, cm H(2)O) used for supportive care was significantly different on days 0 and 1 (p≤0.05) with higher pressure being used in non-survivors. Multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify any gas exchange or ventilator parameter independently associated with mortality. Rather, all deaths were associated with coincident pathology or multi-organ system failure, or perceived treatment futility due to pre-existing diagnoses instead of unsupportable respiratory failure. When using previously published predictors of outcome (VI>40 and OI>40; A-aDO(2)>450 for 24 h; A-aDO(2)>470 or MAP>23; or A-aDO(2)>420) the risk of mortality was overestimated significantly in the current population. Conclusion: The original hypothesis was refuted. It appears that the outcome of AHRF in present day pediatric critical care is principally related to the severity of associated pathology and now no longer solely to the severity of respiratory failure. Further studies in larger series are needed to confirm these findings.","Peters, M. J.; Tasker, R. C.; Kiff, K. M.; Yates, R.; Hatch, D.

6442,Interstitielle Lungenerkrankungen,2006-03-03,"Carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous second messenger, arises in biological systems during the oxidative catabolism of heme by the heme oxygenase (HO) enzymes. HO exists as constitutive (HO-2, HO-3) and inducible isoforms (HO-1), the latter which responds to regulation by multiple stress-stimuli. HO-1 confers protection in vitro and in vivo against oxidative cellular stress. Although the redox active compounds that are generated from HO activity (i.e. iron, biliverdin-IXα, and bilirubin-IXα) potentially modulate oxidative stress resistance, increasing evidence points to cytoprotective roles for CO. Though not reactive, CO regulates vascular processes such as vessel tone, smooth muscle proliferation, and platelet aggregation, and possibly functions as a neurotransmitter. The latter effects of CO depend on the activation of guanylate cyclase activity by direct binding to the heme moiety of the enzyme, stimulating the production of cyclic 3′:5′-guanosine monophosphate. CO potentially interacts with other intracellular hemoprotein targets, though little is known about the functional significance of such interactions. Recent progress indicates that CO exerts novel anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects dependent on the modulation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. By virtue of these effects, CO confers protection in oxidative lung injury models, and likely plays a role in HO-1 mediated tissue protection.","Ryter, Stefan W.; Otterbein, Leo E.; Morse, Danielle; Choi, Augustine M.K.",Mol Cell Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101540/,308
7563,The impact of vaccine success and awareness on epidemic dynamics,2016-11-04,"Recently, some studies have revealed that non-Poissonian statistics of human behaviors stem from the hierarchical geographical network structure. On this view, we focus on epidemic spreading in the hierarchical geographical networks and study how two distinct contact patterns (i.e., homogeneous time delay (HOTD) and heterogeneous time delay (HETD) associated with geographical distance) influence the spreading speed and the variability of outbreaks. We find that, compared with HOTD and null model, correlations between time delay and network hierarchy in HETD remarkably slow down epidemic spreading and result in an upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. Proportionately, the variability of outbreaks in HETD has the lower value, but several comparable peaks for a long time, which makes the long-term prediction of epidemic spreading hard. When a seed (i.e., the initial infected node) is from the high layers of networks, epidemic spreading is remarkably promoted. Interestingly, distinct trends of variabilities in two contact patterns emerge: high-layer seeds in HOTD result in the lower variabilities, the case of HETD is opposite. More importantly, the variabilities of high-layer seeds in HETD are much greater than that in HOTD, which implies the unpredictability of epidemic spreading in hierarchical geographical networks.","Zhao, Zhi-Dan; Liu, Ying; Tang, Ming",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112452/,308

Respiratory tract infections by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) are widely implicated as common causes of the induction and exacerbation of asthma. These infections in early life are associated with the induction of wheeze that may progress to the development of asthma. Infections may also promote airway inflammation and enhance T helper type 2 lymphocyte (Th2 cell) responses that result in exacerbations of established asthma. The mechanisms of how RSV and RV induce and exacerbate asthma are currently being elucidated by clinical studies, in vitro work with human cells and animal models of disease. This research has led to many potential therapeutic strategies and, although none are yet part of clinical practise, they show much promise for the prevention and treatment of viral disease and subsequent asthma.","Hansbro, Nicole G.; Horvat, Jay C.; Wark, Peter A.; Hansbro, Philip M.",Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112677/,308

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe abdominal inflammation, characterized by parenchymal edema, necrosis with occasional presence of pseudocysts, abscess, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Its disease spectrum varies from mild edematous to severe disease with fatal complications. Pancreatic acinar cells are very susceptible to inflammation during an episode of AP attack. It is believed that some initiating factors can lead to the premature transformation of inactive pro-proteases into active proteases within the pancreas. The active proteases degrade a number of cellular proteins such as the structural protein F-actin, thus leading to the collapse and malfunction of acinar and pancreatic damage, a process known as autodigestion of the pancreas.","Leung, Po Sing",The Renin-Angiotensin System: Current Research Progress in The Pancreas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121708/,308

Micrographs revealed normal intestinal morphology with long, round, tapering villi when milk was fed. Casein feeding produced shorter, broader villi than did feeding whole milk. Abnormalities included absence of villi and short, blunted, convoluted villi on mucosal surfaces of calves fed soy proteins. Reduced surface area for intestinal absorption probably resulted from villous atrophy in calves with abnormal mucosae.

Viruses are important etiologic agents and infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI-3 virus) may result in extensive, and sometimes fatal, lung damage. Respiratory viral infections are frequently followed by mycoplasmal and secondary bacterial invasion of the lower respiratory tract, which increases the extent and severity oflung damage. Bad housing, particularly bad ventilation, will increase the severity of pneumonia outbreaks. Although the source of respiratory viral infections is not always obvious, it is likely that a proportion of calves acquire infection from their dams early in life. The possibility of cross-infections from other domestic animals and from humans must also be considered. Diagnosis of respiratory virus infections necessitates submission of suitable respiratory tract specimens that are taken at an early stage in the outbreak together with paired sera. Various therapeutic and prophylactic regimens for the control of calf pneumonia are described.","Bryson, D.G.",Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135460/,308

Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into ‘attribute groups’ based on the possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat use. 2.. Non‐hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature‐ and field‐derived information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life‐history traits. Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level acting as a covariable. 3.. Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, hydrocharids and lemnids). 4.. Some parallels existed with established theory on terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes. 5.. A principal components analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and (b) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of trade‐offs between resistance and resilience traits, ‘functional plasticity’ in traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are discussed. 6.. Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between traits and habitat use (P < 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free‐floating surface or free‐floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining half of this variation. 7.. Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade‐off between resistance‐type traits (related to stream lining, flexibility and anchorage) in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free‐floating growth forms) in spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in shallow fluctuating habitats.","Willby, Nigel J.; Abernethy, Vicky J.; Demars, Benoît O.

We often calculate the proportion of time spent eating different foods (e.g., fruits, leaves) to place species into dietary categories and contrast morphological or behavioral traits among categories. Yet we have little understanding of how flexible species can be in terms of the plant parts and species consumed. To address this issue, we analyzed data on the diets of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) from Kibale National Park, Uganda, to evaluate temporal and spatial variability in the plant parts and species eaten. After considering observer differences and sampling issues, we evaluated how different a group's diet could be if samples were taken in different years. We found that the diet of the same groups showed significant, consistent changes over a 4‐year period. For example, the time spent feeding on leaves increased from 56% in 1994 to 76% in 1998. The plant parts and species eaten by eight groups inhabiting different types of forest (e.g., pristine, logged, riverine) varied among groups. The largest interdemic difference was seen in the use of young leaves (38%). Dietary differences were also found between groups with overlapping home ranges (41–49% overlap). Different subspecies of Procolobus badius also varied in diet; however, this variation was often not of the magnitude documented within Kibale for the same population. The fact that diet can vary considerably over small spatial and short temporal scales within the same species raises the intriguing question as to what level of interspecific difference is biologically significant for addressing particular questions. We conclude that behavioral flexibility blurs our traditional stereotypic assessment of primates; a study of one group that occupies a specific habitat at one point in time may not adequately represent the species.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the fundamentals of EIT and demonstrate the principles of mechanical ventilation, lung recruitment, and EIT imaging on a comprehensive physiological model, which combines a model of respiratory mechanics, a model of the human lung absolute resistivity as a function of air content, and a 2-D finite-element mesh of the thorax to simulate EIT image reconstruction during mechanical ventilation. The overall model gives a good understanding of respiratory physiology and EIT monitoring techniques in mechanically ventilated patients. The model proposed here was able to reproduce consistent images of ventilation distribution in simulated acutely injured and collapsed lung conditions. A new advisory system architecture integrating a previously developed data-driven physiological model for continuous and noninvasive predictions of blood gas parameters with the regional lung function data/information generated from absolute EIT (aEIT) is proposed for monitoring and ventilator therapy management of critical care patients.","Denaï, Mouloud A.; Mahfouf, Mahdi; Mohamad-Samuri, Suzani; Panoutsos, George; Brown, Brian H.; Mills, Gary H.",IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176469/,308

Hypothesis: Treatment with rFeIFN‐ω in cats with fibrosarcoma is safe and feasible. Animals: Twenty domestic cats. Methods: In an open‐labeled uncontrolled clinical trial 12 injections of 1 × 10(6) U/kg rFeIFN‐ω were administered over a 5‐week period: the 1st through 4th injections were given intratumorally, and the 5th through 12th injections were administered subcutaneously at the tumor excision site. Wide surgical excision of the tumors was carried out after the 4th injection and before the 5th injection of rFeIFN‐ω. A Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) analysis was conducted. Flow cytometry of fibrosarcoma cells after incubation with rFeIFN‐ω and recombinant feline interferon‐γ was performed to assess the biological effect of rFeIFN‐ω. Results: Changes in blood cell count, increases in serum aspartate‐amino‐transferase activity, serum bilirubin concentration, serum creatinine and serum electrolyte concentrations, weight loss, anorexia, increased body temperature, and reduced general condition were observed but were mostly minor (grade 1 and 2) and self limiting. Eosinophilia (P= .025), neutropenia (P= .021), and weight loss (P < .001) were statistically correlated with rFeIFN‐ω‐treatment (analysis of parameters before treatment and after 3 injections of rFeIFN‐ω). Flow cytometry of 5 unrelated feline fibrosarcoma cell lines showed increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (P= .026) in response to in vitro incubation with rFeIFN‐ω, whereas expression of MHC class II molecules was not affected significantly. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: RFeIFN‐ω for the treatment of feline fibrosarcoma is safe, well tolerated, and can be easily performed in practice. To assess the efficacy of the treatment, it should be tested in a placebo‐controlled trial.","Hampel, Verena; Schwarz, Bianca; Kempf, Christine; Köstlin, Roberto; Schillinger, Ulrike; Küchenhoff, Helmut; Fenske, Nora; Brill, Thomas; Hirschberger, Johannes",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197455/,308

In this paper, starting from a percolation perspective, we develop two strategies, the relationship-related (RR) strategy and the prediction relationship (PR) strategy, to avoid a local optimum only through the investigation of interrelationships among nodes. Meanwhile, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation, and PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this manner our methods have a better capability to collapse or protect a network. The simulations performed on a number of networks also demonstrate their effectiveness, especially on large real-world networks where RR fragments each of them into the same size of the giant component; however, RR needs only less than [Formula: see text] of the number of nodes which are necessary for the most excellent existing methods.","Liu, Yang; Wang, Xi; Kurths, Jürgen",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217537/,308

Here we report that the modeled dynamics of the response to AXT050 revealed that receptor trafficking is sufficient to explain the effect of Met–integrin interactions on HGF signaling. Furthermore, the model predicted patient-specific synergy and antagonism of efficacy and potency for combination of AXT050 with sorafenib, cabozantinib, and rilotumumab.

13322,Optimal Management of Public Perceptions During A Flu Outbreak: A Game-Theoretic Perspective,2020-10-16,"Meta-analyses and several large cohort studies have demonstrated that antiseptic mouthwashes are associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. A clear pathogenic mechanism is lacking, leading to controversy and a reluctance to abandon or limit the use of antiseptic mouthwashes. Here, we generate the hypothesis that a disturbance in nitric oxide homeostasis by antiseptic mouthwashes may be responsible for the observed increase in mortality risk. Nitric oxide is essential in multiple physiological processes, and a reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability is associated with the occurrence or worsening of pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and sepsis. Oral facultative anaerobic bacteria are essential for the enterosalivary nitrate–nitrite–nitric oxide pathway due to their capacity to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Nitrate originates from dietary sources or from the active uptake by salivary glands of circulating nitrate, which is then excreted in the saliva. Because antiseptic mouthwashes eradicate the oral bacterial flora, this nitric oxide-generating pathway is abolished, which may result in nitric oxide-deficient conditions potentially leading to life-threatening complications such as ischaemic heart events or sepsis.","Blot, Stijn",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567004/,308

Col is found to be an excellent provisional bioscaffold for the current treatment in GR. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to scrutinize an overview of the reported Col effect focusing on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials in GR application. A comprehensive literature search was performed using EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Medline & Ovid databases to identify the potential articles on particular topics. The search query was accomplished based on the Boolean operators involving keywords such as (1) collagen OR scaffold OR hybrid scaffold OR biomaterial AND (2) gingiva recession OR tissue regeneration OR dental tissue OR healing mechanism OR gingiva. Only articles published from 2015 onwards were selected for further analysis. This review includes the physicochemical properties of Col scaffold and the outcome for GR. The comprehensive literature search retrieved a total of 3077 articles using the appropriate keywords. However, on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 articles were chosen for further review. The results from these articles indicated that Col promoted gingival tissue regeneration for GR healing. Therefore, this systematic review recapitulated that Col enhances regeneration of gingival tissue either through a slow or rapid process with no sign of cytotoxicity or adverse effect.","Naomi, Ruth; Ardhani, Retno; Hafiyyah, Osa Amila; Fauzi, Mh Busra",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7570157/,308

In the present study, we investigated the interaction of BANK1 with two key mediators in interferon and inflammatory cytokine production, TRAF6 and MyD88. We revealed by coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) analyses the binding of BANK1 with TRAF6 and MyD88, which were mediated by the BANK1 Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. In addition, the natural BANK1–40C variant showed increased binding to MyD88. Next, we demonstrated in mouse splenic B cells that BANK1 colocalized with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 and that after stimulation with TLR7 and TLR9 agonists, the number of double-positive BANK1–TLR7, –TLR9, –TRAF6, and –MyD88 cells increased. Furthermore, we identified five TRAF6-binding motifs (BMs) in BANK1 and confirmed by point mutations and decoy peptide experiments that the C-terminal domain of BANK1-full-length (-FL) and the N-terminal domain of BANK1–Delta2 (-D2) are necessary for this binding. Functionally, we determined that the absence of the TIR domain in BANK1–D2 is important for its lysine (K)63-linked polyubiquitination and its ability to produce interleukin (IL)-8. Overall, our study describes a specific function of BANK1 in MyD88–TRAF6 innate immune signaling in B cells, clarifies functional differences between the two BANK1 isoforms and explains for the first time a functional link between autoimmune phenotypes including SLE and the naturally occurring BANK1–40C variant.","Georg, Ina; Díaz-Barreiro, Alejandro; Morell, Maria; Pey, Angel L.; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta E.",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608278/,308

Malaysia Energy Commission recommends crystalline PV modules for net energy metering (NEM), but the climate regime is a concern for output power and efficiency. Based on rainfall and irradiance data, this study aims to categorize the climate of peninsular Malaysia into rainy and dry seasons; and then the performance of the two modules are evaluated under the dry season. A new mathematical model is developed to predict energy yield and the results are validated through experimental and systematic error analysis. The parameters are collected using a self-developed ZigBeePRO-based wireless system with the rate of 3 samples/min over a period of five days. The results unveil that efficiency is inversely proportional to the irradiance due to negative temperature coefficient for crystalline modules. For this phenomenon, efficiency of c-Si (9.8%) is found always higher than a-Si (3.5%). However, a-Si shows better shadow tolerance compared to c-Si, observed from a lesser decrease rate in efficiency of the former with the increase in irradiance. Due to better spectrum response and temperature coefficient, a-Si shows greater performance on output power efficiency (OPE), performance ratio (PR), and yield factor. From the regression analysis, it is found that the coefficient of determination (R(2)) is between 0.7179 and 0.9611. The energy from the proposed model indicates that a-Si yields 15.07% higher kWh than c-Si when luminance for recorded days is 70% medium and 30% high. This study is important to determine the highest percentage of energy yield and to get faster NEM payback period, where as of now, there is no such model to indicate seasonal energy yield in Malaysia.","Islam, Syed Zahurul; Othman, Mohammad Lutfi; Saufi, Muhammad; Omar, Rosli; Toudeshki, Arash; Islam, Syed Zahidul",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7660538/,308

16516,Multiple probabilistic traveling salesman problem in the coordination of drug transportation—In the context of sustainability goals and Industry 4.0,2021-03-25,"Transmembrane transport of l-lactate by members of the monocarboxylate transporter family, MCT, is vital in human physiology and a malignancy factor in cancer. Interaction with an accessory protein, typically basigin, is required to deliver the MCT to the plasma membrane. It is unknown whether basigin additionally exerts direct effects on the transmembrane l-lactate transport of MCT1. Here, we show that the presence of basigin leads to an intracellular accumulation of l-lactate 4.5-fold above the substrate/proton concentrations provided by the external buffer. Using basigin truncations we localized the effect to arise from the extracellular Ig-I domain. Identification of surface patches of condensed opposite electrostatic potential, and experimental analysis of charge-affecting Ig-I mutants indicated a bivalent harvesting antenna functionality for both, protons and substrate anions. From these data, and determinations of the cytosolic pH with a fluorescent probe, we conclude that the basigin Ig-I domain drives lactate uptake by locally increasing the proton and substrate concentration at the extracellular MCT entry site. The biophysical properties are physiologically relevant as cell growth on lactate media was strongly promoted in the presence of the Ig-I domain. Lack of the domain due to shedding, or misfolding due to breakage of a stabilizing disulfide bridge reversed the effect. Tumor progression according to classical or reverse Warburg effects depends on the transmembrane l-lactate distribution, and this study shows that the basigin Ig-I domain is a pivotal determinant.","Köpnick, Anna-Lena; Jansen, Annika; Geistlinger, Katharina; Epalle, Nathan Hugo; Beitz, Eric",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996999/,308
17197,Bertalanffy-Pütter models for avian growth,2021-04-26,"Purines and their derivatives, most notably adenosine and ATP, are the key molecules controlling intracellular energy homoeostasis and nucleotide synthesis. Besides, these purines support, as chemical messengers, purinergic transmission throughout tissues and species. Purines act as endogenous ligands that bind to and activate plasmalemmal purinoceptors, which mediate extracellular communication referred to as “purinergic signalling”. Purinergic signalling is cross-linked with other transmitter networks to coordinate numerous aspects of cell behaviour such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis and other physiological processes critical for the proper function of organisms. Pathological deregulation of purinergic signalling contributes to various diseases including neurodegeneration, rheumatic immune diseases, inflammation, and cancer. Particularly, gout is one of the most prevalent purine-related disease caused by purine metabolism disorder and consequent hyperuricemia. Compelling evidence indicates that purinoceptors are potential therapeutic targets, with specific purinergic agonists and antagonists demonstrating prominent therapeutic potential. Furthermore, dietary and herbal interventions help to restore and balance purine metabolism, thus addressing the importance of a healthy lifestyle in the prevention and relief of human disorders. Profound understanding of molecular mechanisms of purinergic signalling provides new and exciting insights into the treatment of human diseases.","Huang, Zhao; Xie, Na; Illes, Peter; Di Virgilio, Francesco; Ulrich, Henning; Semyanov, Alexey; Verkhratsky, Alexei; Sperlagh, Beata; Yu, Shu-Guang; Huang, Canhua; Tang, Yong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079716/,308

In a meta-analysis of 19 population-based prospective cohort studies (including the current study) comprising 220,757 participants and 9199 fractures (including 1302 hip fractures), the fully adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval, CI) for incident fractures was 0.70 (0.61–0.80) comparing the top versus bottom thirds of handgrip strength. The association remained significant after trim-and-fill correction for publication bias. The corresponding RR (95% CI) for hip fractures (9 studies) was 0.61 (0.54–0.70). Handgrip was only modestly associated with fracture risk in the primary analysis, which may be driven by the low event rate. Pooled prospective cohort evidence suggests that elevated handgrip strength is associated with reduced future fracture risk.

17853,A hybrid modeling approach for assessing mechanistic models of small molecule partitioning in vivo using a machine learning-integrated modeling platform,2021-05-27,"Interspecies intimacy defines an inescapable reality of lab animal research. This essay is an effort to disentangle this reality’s consequences—both in and outside the lab—as framed by the quandaries of ethnographic engagement. Encounters with lab staff and, in turn, with audiences unfamiliar with laboratory life, together provide crucial entry points for considering how the “messiness of the moral” might facilitate an “unbounded” approach to lab animal worlds. Within the lab, one encounters specialized ethical principles—often codified as law—that delimit strict boundaries of in/appropriate human thought and action. Such principles determine quotidian practices of welfare and care that, in peculiar ways, privilege animal health (as key to reliable data) while obscuring, erasing, or denying human forms of self care. As such, they presuppose a regulatory ability to formulate, shape, and (re)direct human action. Yet attentiveness to the “messiness of the moral” of lab work exposes other realities: indeed, lab personnel regularly engage in a host of subversive responses that test or cross the boundaries of mandated behavior that (re)invigorate the meaning of moral acts of care as interspecies responsibility. The ethnographer’s ability to witness, record, and write about these actions within the lab rests comfortably on the relativist principle of suspended judgment. Once one moves outside the lab, however, I ask, wherein lies ethnographic responsibility, when one's accounts of the moral messiness of quotidian lab practices become unbounded and go public? I argue that a dialectical inter- and intraspecies framework—inspired by the existential anthropologist Michael Jackson—offers the ethnographer (and still other scholars) possibilities for forging a productively “unbounded” methodological analytic in and beyond domains of animal science.","Sharp, Lesley A.",Hist Philos Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8161705/,308

At the same time, chatbot technologies have become increasingly popular for use by the public and have been identified as having benefits for health care delivery. However, little is known about how chatbot technologies may benefit people with dementia and their caregivers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the types of current commercially available chatbots that are designed for use by people with dementia and their caregivers and to assess their quality in terms of features and content. METHODS: Chatbots were identified through a systematic search on Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Alexa Skills, and the internet. An evidence-based assessment tool was used to evaluate the features and content of the identified apps. The assessment was conducted through interrater agreement among 4 separate reviewers. RESULTS: Of the 505 initial chatbots identified, 6 were included in the review. The chatbots assessed varied significantly in terms of content and scope. Although the chatbots were generally found to be easy to use, some limitations were noted regarding their performance and programmed content for dialog. CONCLUSIONS: Although chatbot technologies are well established and commonly used by the public, their development for people with dementia and their caregivers is in its infancy. Given the successful use of chatbots in other health care settings and for other applications, there are opportunities to integrate this technology into dementia care. However, more evidence-based chatbots that have undergone end user evaluation are needed to evaluate their potential to adequately educate and support these populations.","Ruggiano, Nicole; Brown, Ellen L; Roberts, Lisa; Framil Suarez, C Victoria; Luo, Yan; Hao, Zhichao; Hristidis, Vagelis",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8212632/,308

Notably, patients with advanced GC have a poor prognosis and quality of life, prompting the need for further studies on its prognostic markers. Among these, albumin and D-dimer are often used as prognostic factors in the prediction of a variety of tumors. Moreover, the albumin to D-dimer ratio (ADR) may be an improved predictor of chemotherapy effect and survival compared to albumin and D-dimer alone, but few studies have investigated this issue. Thus, we explored the relationship between pretreatment ADR and prognosis in advanced GC treated with first-line chemotherapy. A total of 247 advanced unresectable GC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy were retrospectively included. The cut-off value for ADR was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ADR had a cut-off value of 41.64. Compared to albumin and D-dimer alone, ADR had the highest area under curve (AUC) value (AUC = 0.730), followed by albumin (AUC = 0.659) and D-dimer (AUC = 0.719). Additionally, we found that patients with a low ADR (<41.64) had a lower disease control rate (77.9% vs. 92.5%, P < 0.01), shorter overall survival (OS) (271 vs. 389 days), and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (118 vs. 192 days) than patients with a high ADR (≥41.64). Similar results were also found on subgroup analysis, and ADR was found to be an independent advanced GC prognostic factor on multivariate analysis (all P < 0.001). Low ADR was found to be correlated with poor therapeutic effects of chemotherapy and shortened OS and PFS. Therefore, pretreatment ADR may be a useful tool for predicting the effect of chemotherapy and prognosis in advanced GC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy.","Zhang, Liqun; Wang, Zhuo; Xiao, Jiawen; Zhang, Zhiyan; Li, Haijing; Li, Fang; Zhang, Lisha; Wang, Yuanhe",J Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241521/,308

19252,Effects of Pig Skin Collagen Supplementation on Broiler Breast Meat,2021-07-01,"ABSTRACT: Despite advancements in the areas of omics and chemoinformatics, potent novel biotherapeutic molecules with new modes of actions are needed for leishmaniasis. The socioeconomic burden of leishmaniasis remains alarming in endemic regions. Currently, reports from existing endemic areas such as Nepal, Iran, Brazil, India, Sudan and Afghanistan, as well as newly affected countries such as Peru, Bolivia and Somalia indicate concerns of chemoresistance to the classical antimonial treatment. As a result, effective antileishmanial agents which are safe and affordable are urgently needed. Natural products from both flora and fauna have contributed immensely to chemotherapeutics and serve as vital sources of new chemical agents. This review focuses on a systematic cross-sectional view of all characterized anti-leishmanial compounds from natural sources over the last decade. Furthermore, IC(50)/EC(50), cytotoxicity and suggested mechanisms of action of some of these natural products are provided. The natural product classification includes alkaloids, terpenes, terpenoids, and phenolics. The plethora of reported mechanisms involve calcium channel inhibition, immunomodulation and apoptosis. Making available enriched data pertaining to bioactivity and mechanisms of natural products complement current efforts geared towards unraveling potent leishmanicides of therapeutic relevance.

There is a need to adopt approaches underpinned with a theoretical basis. Accordingly, the aim here was to implement and evaluate a 12-week intervention designed using the concepts of the COM-B model to determine the effect this has on physical activity levels. One hundred and forty-seven school-age children (mean age 8.9 ± 1.3 years) took part in a 12-week program delivered in a school setting. Topics included physical activity, healthy eating, sleep quality and reducing screen time/sedentary activities when not in school. A sample of participants wore a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days pre-and post-intervention (N = 11). The physical activity frequency was unchanged (2.9 ± 1.0 AU) when compared with post-intervention values (3.1 ± 0.8 AU, mean increase 6.8 ± 3.7%, p > 0.05). Changes were observed in the daily consumption of fruit and vegetables (pre-intervention 44.6% vs. post-intervention 60.2%, p < 0.05). Sedentary time, light activity, moderate activity and vigorous activity were unchanged post-intervention (p > 0.05). There is a need to adopt a broader approach that incorporates a theoretical basis and considers the complex ways by which physical activity behaviours are influenced.","Faghy, Mark A.; Armstrong-Booth, Kirsty E.; Staples, Vicki; Duncan, Micheal J.; Roscoe, Clare M.

19656,Editors’ Note,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Data breaches are an inevitable risk to hospitals operating with information technology. The financial costs associated with data breaches are also growing. The costs associated with a data breach may divert resources away from patient care, thus negatively affecting hospital productivity. OBJECTIVE: After a data breach, the resulting regulatory enforcement and remediation are a shock to a hospital’s patient care delivery. Exploiting this shock, this study aimed to investigate the association between hospital data breaches and productivity by using a generalized difference-in-differences model with multiple prebreach and postbreach periods. METHODS: The study analyzed the hospital financial data of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2012 to 2016. The study sample was an unbalanced panel of hospitals with 2610 unique hospital-year observations, including general acute care hospitals. California hospital data were merged with breach data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The dependent variable was hospital productivity measured as value added. The difference-in-differences model was estimated using fixed effects regression. RESULTS: Hospital productivity did not significantly differ from the baseline for 3 years after a breach. Data breaches were not significantly associated with a reduction in hospital productivity. Before a breach, the productivity of hospitals that experienced a data breach maintained a parallel trend with control hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital productivity was resilient against the shocks from a data breach. Nonetheless, data breaches continue to threaten hospitals; therefore, health care workers should be trained in cybersecurity to mitigate disruptions.","Lee, Jinhyung; Choi, Sung J",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293158/,308

19730,A generalizable data assembly algorithm for infectious disease outbreaks,2021-08-02,"INTRODUCTION: Septic shock is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with organ failures. Earlier clinical diagnosis would be of benefit to a decrease in the mortality rate. However, there is currently a lack of predictive biomarkers. The secretome is the set of proteins secreted by a cell, tissue, or organism at a given time and under certain conditions. The plasma secretome is easily accessible from biological fluids and represents a good opportunity to discover new biomarkers that can be studied with nontargeted “omic” strategies. AIMS: To identify relevant deregulated proteins (DEP) in the secretome of a rat endotoxemic shock model. METHODS: Endotoxemic shock was induced in rats by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, S. enterica typhi, 0.5 mg/kg) and compared to controls (Ringer Lactate, iv). Under isoflurane anesthesia, carotid cannulation allowed mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) monitoring and blood sampling at different time points (T0 and T50 or T0 and T90, with EDTA and protease inhibitor). Samples were prepared for large-scale tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) based on a label-free quantification to allow identification of the proteins deregulated upon endotoxemic conditions. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis defined several clusters of biological processes (BP) in which the DEP are involved. RESULTS: Ninety minutes after shock induction, the LPS group presents a reduction in MAP (-45%, p < 0.05) and increased lactate levels (+27.5%, p < 0.05) compared to the control group. Proteomic analyses revealed 10 and 33 DEP in the LPS group, respectively, at 50 and 90 minutes after LPS injection. At these time points, GO-BP showed alterations in pathways involved in oxidative stress response and coagulation. CONCLUSION: This study proposes an approach to identify relevant DEP in septic shock and brings new insights into the understanding of the secretome adaptations upon sepsis.","Blangy-Letheule, A.; Persello, A.; Michelland, S.; Cunin, V.; Souab, F.; Aillerie, V.; Dhot, J.; Erraud, A.; Montnach, J.; Seve, M.; Bourgoin-Voillard, S.; Rozec, B.; De Waard, M.; Lauzier, B.",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328724/,308

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a chronic inflammatory disease accompanied by eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration. The role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP remains elusive. METHODS: Cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis in control sinonasal mucosa and CRSwNP, were analyzed by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for cleaved caspase 3, cleaved gasdermin D and p-MLKL, respectively. Correlations between necroptosis, inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration were assessed and a possible role of necroptosis in CRSwNP was evaluated. Primary nasal polyp cells (DNPCs) were stimulated with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including ATP or IL-1α and their expression of inflammatory cytokines was analyzed using RT-PCR. The expression of TNF-α and IFNs in nasal polyps was measured by ELISA; human monocyte THP-1 cells were treated with TNF-α or IFN-γ and cell death was measured by LDH release. RESULTS: Necroptosis, rather than apoptosis or pyroptosis, was overtly activated in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP as evidenced by the presence of prominent phosphorylation of MLKL compared to controls. The abundance of DAMPs (IL-1α, HMGB1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-1) were all increased especially in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP. The extent of necroptosis was positively correlated with the abundance of DAMPs and cytokines, and neutrophil infiltration in CRSwNP. In DNPCs, ATP and IL-1α induced the expression of IL-8 and CXCL-1. Macrophage was found to be the predominant cell type positive for p-MLKL in CRSwNP. Concomitant treatment with TNF-α and IFN-γ, which were abundantly present in CRSwNP, triggered marked necroptosis in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Necroptosis induced by TNF-α and IFN-γ may facilitate the production and release of a myriad of proinflammatory cytokines and entailed neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate inflammation in CRSwNP.","Xie, Yadong; Li, Min; Chen, Kun; Zhu, Haoxiang; Tang, Mengyao; Zhou, Chun; Zheng, Yaoming; Wen, Jing; Han, Miaomiao; Zhang, Jia; Zhao, Keqing; Xiao, Hui; Li, Huabin",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380290/,308
20283,The Influence of Key Facial Features on Recognition of Emotion in Cartoon Faces,2021-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Women 50–65 years of age have the lowest cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among ages recommended for screening. The primary aim of this work is to determine how cancer risk perceptions and provider communication behaviors, in addition to known demographic factors, influence the uptake of both cervical and CRC screening or a single screen among women in southeast Michigan. METHODS: Fourteen health services and communication behavior questions were adapted from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) and administered to a multiethnic sample of adults in southeast Michigan. The outcome variable was self-reported up-to-date cervical cancer and/or CRC screening as defined by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Demographic and cancer risk/communication behavior responses of the four screening populations (both tests, one test, no tests) were analyzed with multinomial regression for all comparisons. RESULTS: Of the 394 respondents, 54% were up to date for both cervical and CRC screening, 21% were up to date with only cervical cancer screening and 12% were up to date for only CRC screening. Of the 14 risk perception and communication behavior questions, only ‘Did your primary care physician (PCP) involve you in the decisions about your health care as much as you wanted?’ was significantly associated with women having both screens compared to only cervical cancer screening (aOR 1.67; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.57). The multivariate model showed age, and Middle East and North African (MENA) ethnicity and Black race, in addition to PCP-patient dyad decision-making to be associated with the cancer screenings women completed. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing PCP-patient decision-making in health care may increase opportunities for both cervical cancer and CRC screening either in the office or by self-sampling. Understanding the effects of age and the different interventional strategies needed for MENA women compared to Black women will inform future intervention trials aimed to increase both cancer screenings.

The course emphasizes biological research design, execution, and communication. We have coded and analyzed feedback from student evaluations and from the national CURE project database, both of which measure students’ perceptions and attitudes toward the course. The majority of the student feedback related to the course learning outcomes of fostering independent research and communication skills was positive. However, we also see areas for improvement, such as how we employ peer-to-peer mentoring and how we teach quantitative and computer-based skills.

22622,What’s New?,2004-10-06,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a zoonotic respiratory disease of global public health concern, and dromedary camels are the only proven source of this zoonotic infection. Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the continuous appearance of zoonotic MERS cases in humans is confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV from Africa has hitherto been poorly studied. Here, we report the genetic and phenotypic characterization of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in African countries. Phylogenetically, viruses from dromedaries in Africa formed a monophyletic clade, which we have provisionally designated as virus clade C. Molecular dating analyses of MERS-CoV, including clade C viruses, suggests that the ancestral MERS-CoV in dromedaries could have spread to the two continents within a short timeframe. Camel MERS-CoVs from west and north African countries form a subclade (C1) that shares genetic signatures of a major deletion in the accessory gene ORF4b. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung, and BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4-transduced mice. However, it is still inconclusive whether ORF4b deletions may lead to the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657.

The regulatory burden for animal vaccines is less than that for human use and this has attracted the attention of researchers and companies, and investment in plant-made vaccines for animal infectious disease control is increasing. The dosage cost of vaccines for animal infectious diseases must be kept to a minimum, especially for non-lethal diseases that diminish animal welfare and growth, so efficient and economic production, storage and delivery are critical for commercialization. It has become clear that transgenic plants are an economic and efficient alternative to fermentation for large-scale production of vaccine antigens. The oral delivery of plant-made vaccines is particularly attractive since the expensive purification step can be avoided further reducing the cost per dose.

23483,Advances in Transfusion Safety,2006,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Tang, Xiaolu; Wu, Changcheng; Li, Xiang; Song, Yuhe; Yao, Xinmin; Wu, Xinkai; Duan, Yuange; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Yirong; Qian, Zhaohui; Cui, Jie; Lu, Jian",Natl Sci Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107875/,308
23556,Infections diverses,2013-11-14,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine delta corona virus (PDCoV), and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) are major threats to swine production. Investigations of recent outbreaks confirmed that contaminated feed plays a role in virus transmission. This risk makes it necessary to evaluate the survival of such viruses in various feed ingredients. The objective of our experiment was to characterize the inactivation of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in various feed and ingredient matrices. To determine differences in virus survival, 5-g samples of complete feed, spray-dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and low, medium, and high oil dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed into separate scintillation vials. These samples were inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV and incubated at room temperature for up to 56 d. At each time point, surviving virus was eluted and the supernatant was inoculated into vero-81 cells for PEDV, or swine testicular cells for PDCoV and TGEV. Cells were observed daily for 10 d for cytopathic effects, and this information was used to calculate a median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) using the Karber method. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model. A delta value was estimated from the model, indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. This delta value was then compared across ingredients using the mixed procedure of SAS, and correlations between ingredient proximate analysis data and delta values were determined. Results showed that soybean meal had the greatest delta value (7.50 d) for PEDV compared with other ingredients (P < 0.06). Likewise, PDCoV (42.04 d) and TGEV (42.00 d) delta values were highest in soybean meal (P < 0.001). There was a moderate positive correlation between moisture and the delta value for PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) and TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). There was also a moderate negative correlation between lipid content and the delta value for TGEV (r = −0.51, P = 0.01), suggesting that TGEV is less stable in ingredients with greater lipid content compared with ingredients with less lipid content. In conclusion, these results indicate that the first log reduction of PDCoV and TGEV takes the greatest amount of time in soybean meal and it appears to be the result of greater moisture content.","Trudeau, M.

Both belonging to thrombus, acute arterial thrombus is white thrombus, while acute venous thrombus is red thrombus. What does the pathological difference mean? Venous thrombosis can autolyze, while arterial thrombosis cannot. For VTE patients, oral anticoagulants are usually recommended for 3, 6, or 12 months and occasionally lifelong, but the course cannot be determined. Furthermore, even with standard anticoagulation therapy and INR, some patients still develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Thus, the physicians are extremely puzzled about anticoagulant usage. Proposed risk factors for VTE include advanced age, infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy, long trip syndrome, family history, AMI, heart failure, and so on. Relevant risk factors are increasing over time. Risk factors are derived from the summary of evidence-based medicine.

A Re-exploration of the Localization of English,2013-11-06,"This chapter is devoted to the hierarchical QSAR technology (HiT QSAR) based on simplex representation of molecular structure (SiRMS) and its application to different QSAR/QSPR tasks. The essence of this technology is a sequential solution (with the use of the information obtained on the previous steps) of the QSAR paradigm by a series of enhanced models based on molecular structure description (in a specific order from 1D to 4D). Actually, it’s a system of permanently improved solutions. Different approaches for domain applicability estimation are implemented in HiT QSAR. In the SiRMS approach every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality, and symmetry). The level of simplex descriptors detailed increases consecutively from the 1D to 4D representation of the molecular structure. The advantages of the approach presented are an ability to solve QSAR/QSPR tasks for mixtures of compounds, the absence of the “molecular alignment” problem, consideration of different physical–chemical properties of atoms (e.g., charge, lipophilicity), and the high adequacy and good interpretability of obtained models and clear ways for molecular design. The efficiency of HiT QSAR was demonstrated by its comparison with the most popular modern QSAR approaches on two representative examination sets. The examples of successful application of the HiT QSAR for various QSAR/QSPR investigations on the different levels (1D–4D) of the molecular structure description are also highlighted. The reliability of developed QSAR models as the predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the basis of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic, biological, etc. experiments. The HiT QSAR is realized as the suite of computer programs termed the “HiT QSAR” software that so includes powerful statistical capabilities and a number of useful utilities.","Kuz’min, Victor E.; Artemenko, A.G.; Muratov, Eugene N.; Polischuk, P.G.; Ognichenko, L.N.; Liahovsky, A.V.; Hromov, A.I.; Varlamova, E.V.",Recent Advances in QSAR Studies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120998/,308

The nursing home setting places residents at high risk given the frequent contact among residents and by staff along with the possibility for continuous introduction of respiratory viruses from the community. Nursing home residents are among the most frail members of society. They have multiple comorbidities that can increase their risk of infection. Immunosenescence plays an important role in not only rendering these seniors susceptible in infection, particularly viral respiratory infection, but also interferes with protection. That is, the ability to mount a robust immune response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccine increase the risk. There have been a number of T cell deficits described in this population. CD4+ T cells, in particular T-regs and CMV-reactive CD4+ T cells, have been shown to be predictive of respiratory viral infection in this population. Although evidence exists that T cell subsets may correlate better with response to vaccine and protection, antibody responses to influenza vaccine remains an important correlate in this population. Large-scale epidemiologic studies are needed to establish better correlation between biomarkers for protection and respiratory and other pathogens that circulate in nursing homes.","Loeb, Mark",Handbook of Immunosenescence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121141/,308

Several of these genes have been found to play key roles in the process of autophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway. Although historically considered to be a relatively nonselective process of degradation of cytosolic contents, autophagy has recently been revealed to have several selective and immune-specific functions that are relevant to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, including xenophagy, mitophagy, antigen presentation, secretion, and inflammasome regulation. In this chapter, we review the evidence that links autophagy-related genes, their immune-specific functions, and possible mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis. We summarize the basic molecular events underlying general and selective autophagy and present evidence suggesting possible pathogenic mechanisms revealed by studies of IBD-associated risk alleles of ATG16L1 and IRGM.

Firstly, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern repertoire expressed at the microbial surface determines the interactions with specific receptors (Fig. 42.1). Secondly, each immune cell type possesses a specific set of pathogen-recognition receptors. Thirdly, changes in the cell-surface distribution of C-type lectins regulate carbohydrate binding by modulating receptor affinity for different ligands. Crosstalk between these receptors results in a network of multimolecular complexes, adding a further level of complexity in pathogen recognition (Cambi and Figdor 2005; Thiel et al. 2006) (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_23). MBL deficiency is genetically determined and predisposes to recurrent infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. MBL deficiency has been implicated in susceptibility and course of viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infection. More than 10% of the general population may, depending on definition, be classified as MBL deficient, underlining the redundancy of the immune system. MBL-disease association studies have been a fruitful area of research, which implicates a role for MBL in infective, inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes.

As a consequence of improved emergency medical treatment, early death rates (48 h post injury) have been significantly reduced. However, death rates resulting from trauma-related complications have not diminished. The most common and dangerous complication that can develop post surgery/trauma is infection caused by opportunistic pathogens, which pose a significant challenge to the healing process ([1]). In addition to interference with the healing process and direct damage to infected tissues caused by the infecting organism, systemic complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute renal failure (ARF) can develop. These complications significantly exacerbate a patient’s already deteriorating health and increase recovery times that correlate directly with increased mortality. Therefore, these infections are a major threat to trauma patients, early detection and control of respective infectious agents is essential in decreasing the rates of post trauma-associated morbidity and mortality.","Chen, Hongqi; Qin, Huanlong",Infectious Microecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122653/,308

Some negative regulators, such as RASA3 and JAM-A, act as gatekeepers that modulate key mediators of activation and provide barriers that must be deactivated to permit full activation and stable thrombus formation. Other negative regulators, such as PECAM-1 and other proteins that signal through ITIMs, come into play once platelets are activated and provide restraining, negative feedback for activatory pathways. Many platelet-derived inhibitors have been identified but not fully characterised and so questions remain regarding the mechanisms that underlie the effects on platelet activity following their activation, inhibition or genetic disruption. However, dysregulation of inhibitory signals is believed to contribute to enhanced risk of thrombosis in diseases such as diabetes and other pathological conditions. In this chapter we have described platelet-derived inhibitors of platelet function that are secreted by or expressed within platelets themselves to provide inhibition or negative regulation to the processes that underpin activation.","Unsworth, A.

The stress response is normally adaptive and time limited and improves the chances of the individual for survival. The stress response is mediated largely by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the release of cortisol. In general, there is a graded cortisol response to the degree of stress, such as the type of surgery. Cortisol levels also correlate with the severity of injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale and the APACHE score. Cortisol effects the transcription of thousands of genes in every cell of the body. In addition, the cortisol-glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function by non-transcriptional mechanisms. Cortisol has several important physiologic actions on metabolism, cardiovascular function and the immune system. Cortisol increase the synthesis of catecholamines and catecholamine receptors which is partially responsible for its positive inotropic effects. In addition, cortisol has potent anti-inflammatory actions including the reduction in number and function of various immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils at sites of inflammation. Cortisol is the most important inhibitor of the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators (inhibits NF-kB and AP-1 by multiple mechanisms) [1].","Marik, Paul Ellis",Evidence-Based Critical Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123184/,308

In order to assist in achieving compatibility with the regulations covering the transport of dangerous goods by other modes of transport, the provisions of this Annex are based on the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and the Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials of the International Atomic Energy Agency. More than half of the cargo carried by all modes of transport in the world is dangerous cargo—explosive, corrosive, flammable, toxic and even radioactive. These dangerous goods are essential for a wide variety of global industrial, commercial, medical and research requirements and processes. Because of the advantages of air transport, a great deal of this dangerous cargo is carried by aircraft.","Abeyratne, Ruwantissa",Air Navigation Law,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123837/,308

28887,The context of multiple in-text references and their signification,2017-07-21,"Computational argumentation has recently become a fast growing field of research. An argument consists of a claim, such as “We should abandon fossil fuels”, which is supported or attacked by at least one premise, for example “Burning fossil fuels is one cause for global warming”. From an information retrieval perspective, an interesting task within this setting is finding the best supporting and attacking premises for a given query claim from a large corpus of arguments. Since the same logical premise can be formulated differently, the system needs to avoid retrieving duplicate results and thus needs to use some form of clustering. In this paper we propose a principled probabilistic ranking framework for premises based on the idea of tf-idf that, given a query claim, first identifies highly similar claims in the corpus, and then clusters and ranks their premises, taking clusters of claims as well as the stances of query and premises into account. We compare our approach to a baseline system that uses BM25F which we outperform even with a primitive implementation of our framework utilising BERT.","Dumani, Lorik; Neumann, Patrick J.; Schenkel, Ralf",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148234/,308
28900,Stochastic cellular automata modeling of excitable systems,2007,"Exploiting users’ implicit feedback, such as clicks, to learn rankers is attractive as it does not require editorial labelling effort, and adapts to users’ changing preferences, among other benefits. However, directly learning a ranker from implicit data is challenging, as users’ implicit feedback usually contains bias (e.g., position bias, selection bias) and noise (e.g., clicking on irrelevant but attractive snippets, adversarial clicks). Two main methods have arisen for optimizing rankers based on implicit feedback: counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR), which learns a ranker from the historical click-through data collected from a deployed, logging ranker; and online learning to rank (OLTR), where a ranker is updated by recording user interaction with a result list produced by multiple rankers (usually via interleaving). In this paper, we propose a counterfactual online learning to rank algorithm (COLTR) that combines the key components of both CLTR and OLTR. It does so by replacing the online evaluation required by traditional OLTR methods with the counterfactual evaluation common in CLTR. Compared to traditional OLTR approaches based on interleaving, COLTR can evaluate a large number of candidate rankers in a more efficient manner. Our empirical results show that COLTR significantly outperforms traditional OLTR methods. Furthermore, COLTR can reach the same effectiveness of the current state-of-the-art, under noisy click settings, and has room for future extensions.","Zhuang, Shengyao; Zuccon, Guido",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148247/,308

In the current context of controversies over the public problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the veterinary profession is tending to promote a model of preventive medicine that is supposed to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock farming. However, veterinarians specializing in pig and poultry production (“industrial vets”) have in fact been adopting such approaches to animal health for several decades. Based on 28 interviews with pig and poultry veterinarians practicing or having practiced in western France between the 1970s and the 2010s, the article aims to understand how such a form of professional expertise has developed, and the business model that underpins it. Contrary to public discourses which promote preventive approaches as a way to diversify professional expertise and to disconnect veterinary incomes from drug sales, it is indeed this economic model that has allowed the development of such approaches within industrial livestock farming. Modern strategies for reducing antibiotic use should therefore seek less to renew the professional expertise of veterinarians than to find new ways to valorize it economically.","Fortané, Nicolas",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149086/,308

It addresses the most relevant health and welfare problems and reviews their potential hazards and associated risk factors. Regarding health, problems related to post weaning diarrhoea, cold stress, skin lesions, endoparasites and post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome are described. Reasons for distress and frustration in weaned piglets are identified as mainly separation from the mother, a new environment, mixing and fear of humans. Finally, hazards and risk factors for health and welfare in organic weaners are related to animal characteristics, housing systems, feed/nutrition and management. Generally, it is concluded that diseases around weaning are multifactorial in nature, with several factors contributing simultaneously as stressors at the time of weaning. In order to solve problems around weaning, the complexity and the individuality of farm systems need to be taken into account.","Leeb, Christine; Hegelund, Lene; Edwards, Sandra; Mejer, Helena; Roepstorff, Allan; Rousing, Tine; Sundrum, Albert; Bonde, Marianne",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149107/,308

29327,Laboratories,2007-09-02,"This chapter discusses the ways in which viral replication damages tissues and organs and the ways in which the body's own responses may cause damage. It presents examples illustrating the pathogenesis of four basic kinds of acute viral infection: respiratory, intestinal, generalized, and neurological. As the immune system plays a key role in protection against infections, viral damage to its components can exacerbate the severity of disease or predispose to superinfection with other viral or nonviral agents. Both specific acquired immunodeficiency and generalized immunosuppression can occur in viral infections. The immune response to viral infection may itself frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease. Inflammation with accompanying cellular infiltration is a regular feature of viral infection. Such common signs as erythema, edema, and enlargement of lymph nodes have an immunological basis. There are viral diseases in which the cardinal manifestations are caused by the body's immune response. Immunopathological (hypersensitivity) reactions are traditionally classified into types 1, 2, 3, and 4. For most viral infections, it is not known whether immunopathological effects make a significant contribution to disease and if so then as to which of the four classical hypersensitivity reactions is implicated. It is instructive to speculate about the possible involvement of different kinds of hypersensitivity reactions in viral diseases.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Experience and studies from the regions most affected in China and Italy give preliminary information on issues such as the course of infection and the risk to hospital staff. This suggests that surgically treated COVID-19 patients have a higher risk compared to noninfected patients. The surgical staff also appear to be at increased risk of infection. Furthermore, to prevent the health care system from collapse, resources must be saved elsewhere. Elective operations must be reduced. In order to develop criteria for which operations can be performed, the pandemic is divided into different phases. These are based on the development of the pandemic curve. Various aspects should be taken into account when deciding whether an operation is feasible (stage of pandemic, dysfunction in case of omission, conflict with resources for COVID-19 treatment, alternative: outpatient surgery). Thus, the recommendations for carrying out operations should always be adapted to the current, regional and epidemiological situation of the hospital. For this purpose, it is necessary to form a local committee in the hospital to carry out this assessment on a daily basis.

Viruses,2013-04-18,"DNA vaccine coding for the encephalitogenic peptide MOG(91‐108) protects LEW.1AV1 from subsequent development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Protection is associated with a type 1 immune response and is dependent on the presence of CpG DNA motifs. The mechanisms underlying the observed reduction of EAE development in protected rats have not been fully clarified. We investigated immunological characteristics of lymphocytes after DNA vaccinaton and subsequent EAE induction. We confirm that protection was not associated with suppression of T1 cells, as transcription of the novel molecule rat T‐cell immunoglobulin‐ and mucin‐domain‐containing molecule (TIM‐3), reported to be exclusively expressed on differentiated T1 cells, was not altered by DNA vaccination. We did not note any clonal deletion upon tolerization, but detected an antigen‐specific lymphocyte population upregulating IFNγ upon recall stimulation 3 weeks after protective DNA vaccination. In protected rats, we observed (1) no alterations in antigen‐specific Th2 or Th3 responses, (2) reduced MHC II expression on splenocytes early after EAE induction, (3) antigen‐specific upregulation of IFNβ upon recall stimulation and (4) reduced IL‐12Rβ2 on lymphocytes. We thus demonstrate an association of the protective effect of DNA vaccination with expression of IFNβ. We are currently investigating the cellular mechanisms behind this IFNβ‐mediated protection.","Wefer, J.; Harris, R.

The proposed TCN-ATT consists of three components: (1) a TCN module which processes sequence with convolutional structure, (2) an attention layer to select effective features and (3) a split-and-combine mechanism to fit inputs with various size. A formalized deduplication method is also proposed to reduce redundancy with less information loss. According to our experiments, the proposed model reaches an accuracy of 98.60% and reduces time cost by over 60% compared with existing RNN-based models.","Huang, Junyao; Lu, Chenhui; Ping, Guolou; Sun, Lin; Ye, Xiaojun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206248/,308

Frantic research is underway to find prevention and cure. Of late, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) has been speculated as a possible protection from COVID-19. We sought to investigate the evidence behind the claim. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected regarding the total number of COVID-19 cases per million and total number of COVID-19 deaths per million in various countries. The BCG vaccination policies of these countries were also obtained. RESULTS: It was seen that the countries with no universal BCG policy had a mean 1272.9 (median 795) cases per million and 80.7 deaths (median 18) per million population. On the contrary, the countries with a universal BCG vaccination policy had a mean 131.2 (median 40) cases per million and 4 deaths (median 1) per population. The difference is highly significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The data strongly support the hypothesis that BCG may offer protection from COVID-19. Heterologous protection offered by BCG through production of trained immunity, epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, non-specific activation of NK cells, and increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin 1 beta) production may be the mechanism behind its cross- protection against the novel coronavirus.","Roy, Soumya",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217267/,308

Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications. Almost all built-in behaviors are implicitly defined inside a concrete ASM language implementation and thus, the behavior is hidden from the language user. In this paper, we present a new ASM syntax extension based on traits, which allows the specifier (language user) to define new type abstractions in the form of structure and behavior definitions to reuse, maintain, structure, and extend the functionality in ASM specifications. We describe the proposed language construct by defining its syntax and semantics. The decision to use a trait-based syntax extension over other object-oriented language constructs like interfaces or mixins was motivated and driven by the results of previously conducted empirical studies. Moreover, we outline details about the implementation of the trait-based syntax extension in our Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language implementation.","Paulweber, Philipp; Pescosta, Emmanuel; Zdun, Uwe",Rigorous State-Based Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242048/,308

The new approaches are integrated within the FAMER framework for parallel and scalable entity clustering. A detailed evaluation of the new approaches for real-world workloads shows their high effectiveness.

Production research has focused on sophisticated mathematical models ranging from molecular materials modeling to efficient production control to inter-company supply network logistics. Often, these models have no closed-form solutions; this led to intense simulation research for individual modeling viewpoints, often labeled “Digital Twins”. However, the complexity of the overall system precludes Digital Twins covering more than just a few system perspectives, especially if near-realtime performance is required. Moreover, the wide variety of individual situations and behaviors is usually captured only as statistical uncertainty. In order to achieve better performance and more context adaptation, the interdisciplinary research cluster “Internet of Production” at RWTH Aachen University is exploring the concept of “Digital Shadows”. Digital Shadows can be understood as compact views on dynamic processes, usually combining condensed measurement data with highly efficient simplified mathematical models. In this exploratory paper, we argue based on a couple of initial case studies that Digital Shadows are not just valuable carriers of deep engineering knowledge but due to their small size also help in reducing network congestion and enabling edge computing. These properties could make Digital Shadows an interesting solution to address resilience in other information-intensive dynamic systems.","Liebenberg, Martin; Jarke, Matthias",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266452/,308
33755,Editor's Note,2020-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Person-to-person transmitted infectious diseases can cause occupational diseases (OD). These are subsumed as BK-No. 3101 in the German list of OD which applies for individuals with a considerably higher risk for infection as a consequence of their professional activity compared to the general population. OBJECTIVES: The special medical and insurance law aspects of a work-related MRSA colonization are presented using the example of an expert opinion case and an evaluation of the BK reports of suspected occupational disease (BK No. 3101) of the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The BK documentation of the DGUV from 2007–2012 and the patient cohort from the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Erlangen, presenting for expert assessment from 2007–2012 were retrospectively analysed for human-to-human transmitted infectious diseases of the skin (BK-No. 3101). RESULTS: Person-to-person transmission of infectious diseases of the skin is rare in the field of occupational dermatology. In the DGUV cohort, suspected BK-No. 3101cases amounted to 2.6% of all notified cases; recognized BK-No. 3101 cases accounted for 4.2% of all recognized cases, amongst which 9 were caused by MRSA. In contrast to a symptomatic infection, an asymptomatic MRSA colonization is not being recognized as BK-No. 3101. Bacterial superantigens can trigger atopic dermatitis (AD). In particular cases, occupationally acquired MRSA can elicit AD and may justify classification as an OD (BK-No. 3101). CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of MRSA colonization and eradication are necessary for rehabilitation. Management of skin diseases due to infectious diseases within the framework of OD is presented.","Erfurt-Berge, Cornelia; Schmidt, Anne; Angelovska, Irena; Mahler, Vera",Hautarzt,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7268186/,308
33843,Newsletter [Image: see text],2020-06-05,"This chapter discusses the functions of gastrointestinal tract. The principal functions of the gastrointestinal tract are assimilation of nutrients and excretion of the waste products of digestion. Within the gastrointestinal tract, these substances are solubilized and degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. The distribution of the different types of secretory cells in the salivary glands varies among species. The mandibular and sublingual glands are mixed salivary glands containing both mucous and serous types of cells, and produce a viscous secretion that contains large amounts of mucus. The cytoplasm of the secretory cells contains numerous zymogen granules that vary in size and number depending on the activity of the gland.

In this work, we focus on the study of a class of implication functions for typical hesitant fuzzy sets (THFS). The novelty of our proposal lies on the fact that it is the first time that an admissible order is used to define operators on hesitant fuzzy setting. Thus, we introduce typical hesitant fuzzy negations, typical hesitant t-norms and typical hesitant implication functions considering an admissible order, which allows the comparison of typical hesitant fuzzy elements with different cardinalities.","Matzenauer, Monica; Reiser, Renata; Santos, Helida; Pinheiro, Jocivania; Bedregal, Benjamin",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274708/,308

34620,Konto in Sekunden,2020-06-18,"The ever increasing demand for higher memory performance and—at the same time—larger memory capacity is leading the industry towards hybrid main memory designs, i.e., memory systems that consist of multiple different memory technologies. This trend, however, naturally leads to one important question: how can we efficiently utilize such hybrid memories? Our paper proposes a software-based approach to solve this challenge by deploying a pattern-aware staging technique. Our work is based on the following observations: (a) the high-bandwidth fast memory outperforms the large memory for memory intensive tasks; (b) but those tasks can run for much longer than a bulk data copy to/from the fast memory, especially when the access pattern is more irregular/sparse. We exploit these observations by applying the following staging technique if the accesses are irregular and sparse: (1) copying a chunk (few GB of sequential data) from large to fast memory; (2) performing a memory intensive task on the chunk; and (3) writing it back to the large memory. To check the regularity/sparseness of the accesses at runtime with negligible performance impact, we develop a lightweight pattern detection mechanism using a helper threading inspired approach with two different Bloom filters. Our case study using various scientific codes on a real system shows that our approach achieves significant speed-ups compared to executions with using only the large memory or hardware caching: 3[Formula: see text] or 41% speedups in the best, respectively.","Arima, Eishi; Schulz, Martin",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295340/,308

A specific challenge in these simulations arises due to the “open MD boundaries” at the molecular-continuum interface: particles close to these boundaries do not feel any forces from outside which results in unphysical behavior and incorrect thermodynamic pressures. In this contribution, we apply neural networks to generate approximate boundary forces that reduce these artefacts. We train our neural network with force-distance pair values from periodic MD simulations and use this network to later predict boundary force contributions in non-periodic MD systems. We study different training strategies in terms of MD sampling and training for various thermodynamic state points and report on accuracy of the arising MD system.

Projective integration is an explicit, asymptotic-preserving scheme that is tailored to problems with a large spectral gap between fast and slow eigenvalues of the model. A spectral analysis of the moment model shows a clear spectral gap and reveals the multi-scale nature of the model. The new scheme overcomes the severe time step constraint of standard explicit schemes like the forward Euler scheme by performing a number of inner iterations and then extrapolating the solution forward in time. The projective integration scheme is non-intrusive and yields fast and accurate solutions, as demonstrated using a 1D shock tube test case. These observations open up many possibilities for further use of the scheme for high-resolution discretizations and different collision models.","Koellermeier, Julian; Samaey, Giovanni",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304693/,308

Second, the reconstruction is shown to be robust with respect to noisy data, which means that the PI-ESN acts as a denoiser.

Unfortunately, in the presence of general concept inclusions (GCIs), which are supported by all modern DL systems, adding concrete domains may easily lead to undecidability. One contribution of this paper is to strengthen the existing undecidability results further by showing that concrete domains even weaker than the ones considered in the previous proofs may cause undecidability. To regain decidability in the presence of GCIs, quite strong restrictions, in sum called [Formula: see text]-admissibility, need to be imposed on the concrete domain. On the one hand, we generalize the notion of [Formula: see text]-admissibility from concrete domains with only binary predicates to concrete domains with predicates of arbitrary arity. On the other hand, we relate [Formula: see text]-admissibility to well-known notions from model theory. In particular, we show that finitely bounded, homogeneous structures yield [Formula: see text]-admissible concrete domains.

In this paper, we reported the results obtained in an empirical study to validate our ontology-based gamification of scripted CL sessions.

The learning outcomes were significantly better in scripted CL sessions gamified through our approach, with positive correlations to the intrinsic motivation and perceived choice.

Mechanical ventilation affects systemic inflammation in which lung-protective ventilation attenuates the inflammatory response. The aim was to study the effect of a lung protective ventilator regime on arterial and organ-specific venous blood as well as on trans-organ differences in cf-DNA levels in a porcine post-operative sepsis model. METHOD: One group of anaesthetised, domestic-breed, 9–12 weeks old, pigs were ventilated with protective ventilation (V(T) 6 mL x kg(− 1), PEEP 10 cmH(2)O) n = 20. Another group, ventilated with a medium high tidal volume and lower PEEP, served as a control group (V(T) 10 mL x kg(− 1), PEEP 5 cm H(2)O) n = 10. Blood samples were taken from four sources: artery, hepatic vein, portal vein and, jugular bulb. A continuous endotoxin infusion at 0.25 μg x kg(− 1) x h(− 1) for 5 h was started following 2 h of laparotomy, which simulated a surgical procedure. Inflammatory cytokines and cf-DNA in plasma were analysed and trans-organ differences calculated. RESULTS: The protective ventilation group had lower levels of cf-DNA in arterial (p = 0.02) and hepatic venous blood (p = 0.03) compared with the controls. Transhepatic differences in cf-DNA were lower in the protective group, compared with the controls (p = 0.03). No differences between the groups were noted as regards the transcerebral, transsplanchnic or the transpulmonary cf-DNA differences. CONCLUSIONS: Protective ventilation suppresses arterial levels of cf-DNA. The liver seems to be a net contributor to the systemic cf-DNA levels, but this effect is attenuated by protective ventilation.","Nyberg, Axel; Larsson, Alexander; Jylhävä, Juulia; Hurme, Mikko; Sperber, Jesper; Lipcsey, Miklós; Castegren, Markus",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7393331/,308

In the 13 years from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2015, this prospective cohort study included consecutive pediatric patients under 12 years old, who presented either emergently or electively with any variety of CLM. The lesions encompassed in this assortment were congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchogenic cysts (BC), and bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS). RESULTS: Sixty-eight pediatric patients with CLM were operated at our institution; 18 CPAMs, 22 CLEs, 19 BPSs (17 intralobar and 2 extralobar), and 9 patients with BCs. The patients’ age ranged from 1 to 54 months (mean age of 10.73 ± 9.73 months), with overall male gender predominance (61.76%). Both CLE and CPAM had a male predominance, while BC and BPS had equivocal gender distribution. CLE patients had the earliest presentation at 2.89 ± 1.5 months and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM) had the latest presentation at 21.78 ± 15.6 months (F = 15.27, p < 0.0001). Lobectomy was the commonest procedure performed. Fifty-nine lobectomies were performed (21 LUL, 15 RLL, 14 LLL, 8 RUL, and 1 middle lobectomy). Six cystectomies were performed for BC. Twenty-three cases (33.8%) had postoperative complications that were mainly significant or prolonged air leak (13.24%), pneumonia (5.88%), 3 cases of hemothorax (4.4%), pulmonary atelectasis in 2 patients (2.94%), 1 patient developed effusion (1.47%), and there were 2 mortalities.

38310,AUTHOR REPLY,2020-08-28,"The astounding capacity of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to differentiate and self-organize has revolutionized the development of 3D cell culture models. The major advantage is its ability to mimic in-vivo microenvironments and cellular interactions as compared to the classical 2D cell culture models. Recent innovations in generating embryo-like structures (including blastoids and gastruloids) from PSCs have advanced the experimental accessibility to understand embryogenesis with immense potential to model human development. Taking cues on how embryonic development leads to organogenesis, PSCs can also be directly differentiated to form mini-organs or organoids of a particular lineage. Organoids have opened new avenues to augment our understanding of stem cell and regenerative biology, tissue homeostasis, and disease mechanisms. In this review, we provide insights from developmental biology with a comprehensive resource of signaling pathways that in a coordinated manner form embryo-like structures and organoids. Moreover, the advent of assembloids and multilineage organoids from PSCs opens a new dimension to study paracrine function and multi-tissue interactions in vitro. While this led to an avalanche of enthusiasm to utilize organoids for organ-transplantation studies, we examine the current limitations and provide perspectives to improve reproducibility, scalability, functional complexity, and cell-type characterization. Taken together, these 3D in vitro organ-specific and patient-specific models hold great promise for drug discovery, clinical management, and personalized medicine.","Sahu, Sounak; Sharan, Shyam.K.",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7441954/,308

38468,CSLR - EU Update,2020-08-28,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for a variety of nonmalignant disorders including osteopetrosis, bone marrow failures, and immune deficiencies. Haploidentical HSCT is a readily available option in the absence of a matched donor, but engraftment failure and other post-transplant complications are a concern. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) regimens are gaining popularity and recent reports show promising results. We report our experience with nine pediatric patients with nonmalignant diseases who were transplanted from a haploidentical donor with PT-Cy. From 2015 to 2019, nine children with nonmalignant diseases underwent haploidentical HSCT with PT-Cy, two as a second transplant and seven as primary grafts after upfront serotherapy and busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning. Patient’s diseases included osteopetrosis (n = 5), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (n = 2), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 1), and Wiskott Aldrich syndrome (n = 1). Two patients failed to engraft following upfront PT-Cy transplants, one was salvaged with a second PT-Cy transplant, and the other with a CD34+ selected graft. None of the patients suffered from graft-versus-host disease. Three patients died from early posttransplant infectious complications and six patients are alive and well. In conclusion, haploidentical HSCT with PT-Cy is a feasible option for pediatric patients with nonmalignant diseases lacking a matched donor.","Even-Or, Ehud; NaserEddin, Adeeb; Dinur Schejter, Yael; Shadur, Bella; Zaidman, Irina; Stepensky, Polina",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7450679/,308

Electrocardiography showed new T-wave inversion and QT prolongation that subsequently resolved. Cardiac enzymes were elevated but invasive coronary angiography showed unobstructed epicardial coronary arteries. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance showed not only normal biventricular size and systolic function but also a striking pattern of patchy myocardial oedema involving the basal-to-mid anterior, septal and inferior walls and some associated hypertrophy in the anteroseptum (representing focal myocardial swelling from the oedema) but no focal or diffuse myocardial fibrosis. All these abnormalities resolved on subsequent convalescent imaging. A diagnosis of multifactorial acquired long QT syndrome secondary to atypical variant stress-induced cardiomyopathy was made with the likely provoking factors in this case having been the female sex, understandable pre-operative anxiety, anaesthetic drugs, supraglottic airway placement and thyroid dysfunction. An implantable loop recorder during follow-up detected no further significant arrhythmias and she remains well and asymptomatic to date on a low dose of beta-blocker.","Alfarih, Mashael; Moon, James C; Fontana, Marianna; Knight, Dan; Captur, Gabriella",SAGE Open Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7457639/,308

Saving energy is important for our living environment and to save cost in data centers. Yet, researchers compare the efficiency of algorithms still in terms of consumption of CPU time (or even wall time). Perhaps one reason for this is that measuring energy consumption of computational processes is not as convenient as measuring the consumed time and there is no sufficient tool support. To close this gap, we contribute CPU Energy Meter, a small tool that takes care of reading the energy values that Intel CPUs track inside the chip. In order to make energy measurements as easy as possible, we integrated CPU Energy Meter into BenchExec, a benchmarking tool that is already used by many researchers and competitions in the domain of formal methods. As evidence for usefulness, we explored the energy consumption of some state-of-the-art verifiers and report some interesting insights, for example, that energy consumption is not necessarily correlated with CPU time.","Beyer, Dirk; Wendler, Philipp",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480680/,308

For this purpose, it became necessary to represent molecules in a syntax that would be readable by computers and understandable by scientists of various fields. A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. We present here some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in drug discovery, many of which are based on graph representations. Furthermore, we describe applications of these representations in AI-driven drug discovery. Our aim is to provide a brief guide on structural representations that are essential to the practice of AI in drug discovery. This review serves as a guide for researchers who have little experience with the handling of chemical representations and plan to work on applications at the interface of these fields.

At the core of these analysis components is the automated process of detecting aberration or data anomalies in the public health surveillance data, which often have prominent temporal and spatial data elements, by statistical analysis or data mining techniques. These methods are also capable of dealing with various common problems in epidemiological data such as bias, delay, lack of accuracy, and seasonality. These techniques are the focus of this chapter. When processing public health surveillance data streams, it is often necessary to map the collected syndromic data into a small set of syndrome categories to facilitate follow-up analysis and outbreak detection. Section 4.1 discusses related syndrome classification approaches. In Sect. 4.2, we provide a taxonomy of anomaly analysis and outbreak detection methods used for biosurveillance.

Paraffin sections were made to compare the developmental differences in testis tissue between mulard and Pekin ducks. Comparative transcriptome sequencing of testis tissues was performed, and the expression of candidate genes was verified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In mulard ducks, spermatogonia and spermatocytes were arranged in a disordered manner, and no mature sperm were observed in the testis tissue. However, different stages of development of sperm were observed in seminiferous tubules in the testis tissue of Pekin ducks. A total of 43.84 Gb of clean reads were assembled into 193 535 UniGenes. Of these, 2131 transcripts exhibited differential expression (false discover rate [Formula: see text] and fold change [Formula: see text]), including 997 upregulated and 1134 downregulated transcripts in mulard ducks as compared to those in Pekin duck testis tissues. Several upregulated genes were related to reproductive functions, including ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), calmodulin (CALM), argininosuccinate synthase and delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase ALDH18A1 (P5CS). Downregulated transcripts included the testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 3, aquaporin-7 (AQP7) and glycerol kinase GlpK (GK). The 10 related transcripts involved in the developmental biological process were identified by GO (Gene Ontology) annotation. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways indicated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and calcium signaling pathways were significantly ([Formula: see text]) associated with normal testis physiology. The differential expression of select genes implicated in reproductive processes was verified by qRT-PCR, which was consistent with the expression trend of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed candidate genes RYR2, CALM, P5CS, AQP7 and GK were identified by transcriptional analysis in mulard and Pekin duck testes. These were important for the normal development of the male duck reproductive system. These data provide a framework for the further exploration of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of sterility in mulard ducks. Highlights. The mulard duck is an intergeneric sterile hybrid offspring resulting from mating between Muscovy and Pekin ducks. The transcriptomes of testis tissue from mulard and Pekin ducks were systematically characterized, and differentially expressed genes were screened, in order to gain insights into potential gonad gene expression mechanisms contributing to genetic sterility in mulard ducks.","Li, Li; Zhang, Linli; Zhang, Zhenghong; Keyhani, Nemat O.; Xin, Qingwu; Miao, Zhongwei; Zhu, Zhiming; Wang, Zhengchao; Qiu, Junzhi; Zheng, Nenzhu",Arch Anim Breed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500171/,308

Methods: The Health App Review Tool has been designed to assess smart phone health apps according to their compatibility to individuals within the Alzheimer’s disease community. Specifically, app features and functions are characterized according to their appropriateness to the needs, abilities, and preferences of potential users. The Health App Review Tool is comprised of two components, the App and User Assessment; each component includes four complementary domains. Items in these domains can be compared between App and User assessments using a scoring key that will produce a match score. The score indicates the level of appropriateness in reference to the app’s ability to meet the user’s needs. Discussion: The Health App Review Tool was designed using available evidence and stakeholder preference data to ensure a user-centered design. The result was the development of a tool built on evidence and informed by the perceptions and preferences of those within and working with the Alzheimer’s disease population. App and User domains include usefulness, complexity, accessibility, and external variables. This unique matching approach is anticipated to significantly impact individualized, client-centered care. We anticipate that this study will serve as a model for future development of technology matching tools for other diagnostic populations.

The resulting Country Health Profiles, published every two years (current editions: November 2019) are the joint work of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the OECD, in cooperation with the European Commission. They are designed to support the efforts of Member States in their evidence-based policy making and to contribute to health care systems' strengthening. In addition to short syntheses of population health status, determinants of health and the organisation of the health system, the Country Profiles provide an assessment of the health system, looking at its effectiveness, accessibility and resilience. The idea of resilient health systems has been gaining traction among policy makers. The framework developed for the Country Profiles template sets out three dimensions and associated policy strategies and indicators as building blocks for assessing resilience. The framework adopts a broader definition of resilience, covering the ability to respond to extreme shocks as well as measures to address more predictable and chronic health system strains, such as population ageing or multimorbidity. However, the current framework predates the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic as well as new work on resilience being done by the SoHEU project partners. This workshop aims to present resilience-enhancing strategies and challenges to a wide audience and to explore how using the evidence from the Country Profiles can contribute to strengthening health systems and improving their performance. A brief introduction on the SoHEU initiative will be followed by the main presentation on the analytical framework on resilience used for the Country Profiles. Along with country examples, we will present the wider results of an audit of the most common health system resilience strategies and challenges emerging from the 30 Country Profiles in 2019. A roundtable discussion will follow, incorporating audience contributions online. The Panel will discuss the results on resilience actions from the 2019 Country Profiles evidence, including: Why is resilience important as a practical objective and how is it related to health system strengthening and performance? How can countries use their resilience-related findings to steer national reform efforts? In addition, panellists will outline how lessons learned from country responses to the Covid-19 pandemic and new work on resilience by the Observatory (resilience policy briefs), OECD (2020 Health at a Glance) and the EC (Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment (HSPA) Report on Resilience) can feed in and improve the resilience framework that will be used in the 2021 Country Profiles.

Here we review studies on coronavirus in water environments. METHODS: A review was carried out of papers writen in English on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Papers were identified using the keywords: coronavirus, SARS, MERS, Covid-19 associated with water, surface water, drinking water, wastewater, sewage, slurry, sludge, biosolid. Papers were screened using their title and abstract to confirm their relevance. They were then reviewed to identify: coronavirus type and strain, type of water sample, type of study, detection methods, monitoring data, survival data, effect of disinfection and treatments. RESULTS: Since 1978, only 18 papers met the selection criteria. Of these, 11 reported experimental studies, 6 field studies, and one included both field and experimental work. Experimental studies were carried out using samples spiked with SARS-CoV or surrogates: 4 addressed the recovery efficiency of detection methods; 3 reported studies on virus removal from waters by different treatments; 7 were focussed on survival in water samples with results ranging from 2 to > 100 days, depending on virus, type of water, temperature, and detection method. Field studies monitored the presence of coronavirus in waters, sewage, slurry or biosolid. The included in total no more than 200 samples and used different detection methods. Some samples tested positive in 5 studies. CONCLUSIONS: While knowledge of coronavirus in waters appears very scarce and fragmentary, the recent SARS-CoV2 emergency demands new attention be focussed on its survival in natural conditions and following treatment in order to assess the risk of waterborne and food borne transmission as well as developing monitoring within sewage treatment facilities.

40677,Panorama,2020-10-12,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the first modern public health crisis with the potential to overwhelm the public health care system. When rationing of services, drugs, and equipment must occur, health care providers have a responsibility to make rationing decisions fairly, both procedurally and substantively. In addition, health care providers, like all professionals, are accountable for their decisions. The legal standard of care requires providers to exercise the skill and knowledge normally possessed by providers in good standing in the same field or class of practice acting in the same or similar circumstances. But making rationing decisions in crisis conditions, like those created by COVID-19, is not the same as or similar to decision making in non-crisis conditions. Thus, the standard of care, properly applied, expects less of providers practicing under the stress of COVID-19’s triage conditions. Because many health care providers do not perceive this is true, and for pragmatic and normative reasons, policymakers should articulate rules limiting providers’ liability for rationing decisions—as well as other acts and omissions—occurring in and attendant to crisis conditions. These rules should not, however, create absolute immunities. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, more states are embracing this approach.","Jerry II, Robert H",J Law Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543496/,308

In (Illig and Schindler, BioPhys Econ Resour Qual 2(1):1, 2017) the price of oil was expressed as a function of the size of the economy, the cost share of oil, and the quantity of oil extracted. We clarify assumptions needed to use this explicit price equation to study prices. Using the current extraction rate, the previous year’s extraction rate, and interest rates of the Federal Reserve we use linear regression to give a model for oil prices from 1966 to 2018. The model verifies that deductions made from the explicit price equation are consistent with empirical data over the given time period. Our analysis indicates that the contraction phase of world oil extraction began in 2020 and that it will be characterized by relatively low oil prices.

To cope with those different challenges, especially in shop floors, warehouses, and increasingly in logistics, automation and collaborative robotics increasingly gain relevance to increase agility and productivity in these domains. Robotic automation is being held back by the complexity and effort of custom system integration, which is time-consuming and expensive. Today only 20–30% of manufacturing or logistics operations are automated. We believe that the current Industrie 4.0 initiatives at SAP and Cloud Robotics have the potential to make automation drastically faster and cheaper. While SAP’s engagement in the German Industrie 4.0 Platform is being realized through the Asset Administration Shell implementation to provide an easy way to integrate assets to business processes, Cloud Robotics complements this with a new form of integrating autonomous robots into logistics processes. In May 2019, Google released Google’s Cloud Robotics Core, an open, cloud-based automation platform for robotics hardware manufacturers, integrators, and software developers. SAP’s focus is the orchestration of robots from different vendors as a fleet for a variety of logistics processes and SAP also released the necessary extensions to work with Google’s Cloud Robotics as open source packages. Cloud Robotics enables users of SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) to quickly deploy and integrate autonomous warehouse robots into their operations and scale ad-hoc. This article justifies why autonomous robots require a different integration with business applications and describes a new technological foundation for Cloud-Edge-Integration. Subsequently it introduces Cloud Robotics as a solution, compares this with other robotic platforms and describes an implementation.","Ricken, Karl-Albrecht; Verzano, Nemrude",HMD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7569099/,308

By applying the Kindleberger–Minsky model to football, we show that developments in recent years do not meet the criteria of a classic bubble. Although transfer fee spending in recent years does meet the typical pattern seen in historical bubbles, the case of football rather resembles an atypical bubble. This is because the rise in transfer fees for most clubs is largely backed by cash inflows, prompting an elevator effect for transfer fees. Typical bubbles, on the other hand, contain heavy debt-financing in the absence of respective and sustainable cash inflows. Nevertheless, despite the absence of a speculative bubble on the aggregated league level, some individual clubs seem to “live in a bubble”. Furthermore, the French and especially Italian leagues should be cautious about overspending. We further discuss the main risk factors that can lead to a turning point in European football’s constant revenue growth, including potential implications of a financial downturn.","Richau, Lukas; Follert, Florian; Frenger, Monika; Emrich, Eike",J Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7584485/,308

We appraised the validity of stroke, acute coronary syndrome and heart failure diagnoses in studies conducted using European electronic health records. METHODS: Using a prespecified strategy, we systematically searched seven databases from dates of inception to April 2019. Two reviewers independently completed study selection, followed by partial parallel data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value estimates were narratively synthesized and heterogeneity between sensitivity and PPV estimates were assessed using I(2). RESULTS: We identified 81 studies, of which 20 validated heart failure diagnoses, 31 validated acute coronary syndrome diagnoses with 29 specifically recording estimates for myocardial infarction, and 41 validated stroke diagnoses. Few studies reported specificity or negative predictive value estimates. Sensitivity was ≤66% in all but one heart failure study, ≥80% for 91% of myocardial infarction studies, and ≥70% for 73% of stroke studies. PPV was ≥80% in 74% of heart failure, 88% of myocardial infarction, and 70% of stroke studies. PPV by stroke subtype was variable, at ≥80% for 80% of ischaemic stroke but only 44% of haemorrhagic stroke. There was considerable heterogeneity (I(2) >75%) between sensitivity and PPV estimates for all diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Overall, European electronic health record stroke, acute coronary syndrome and heart failure diagnoses are accurate for use in research, although validity estimates for heart failure and individual stroke subtypes were lower. Where possible, researchers should validate data before use or carefully interpret the results of previous validation studies for their own study purposes.","Davidson, Jennifer; Banerjee, Amitava; Muzambi, Rutendo; Smeeth, Liam; Warren-Gash, Charlotte",Clin Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7569174/,308

As creativity is a trait of art students and is important for those acting as entrepreneurs and innovators in an economy, arts majors have the potential to play an important role in these areas. Using American Community Survey data, we look to identify arts, STEM, and other creative majors who are working in entrepreneurial occupations, those where self-employment is common, and innovative industries, those that are copyright intensive. As it is possible that the nature of arts occupations may be inherently more entrepreneurial and innovative, we compare arts majors to STEM and other creative majors also likely to work in such occupations. Using logistic regression, we find that majoring in a core arts field more than doubles an individual’s likelihood of working in an entrepreneurial occupation or an innovative industry relative to non-creative majors. Other creative majors, like communications and STEM majors, are also associated with an increased likelihood of working as entrepreneurs or innovators. Relative to STEM and other creative majors, majoring in a core arts field is associated with the greatest increase in the likelihood of working in an entrepreneurial occupation and third greatest increase in the likelihood of working in an innovative industry. While arts graduates play an important role in artistic creation, this paper highlights a role for these graduates as entrepreneurs and innovators in the US economy.

41684,Kommentar,2020-08-25,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is a severe complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that affects various organs leading to a reduced quality of life. The condition often requires enduring immunosuppressive therapy, which can also lead to the development of severe side effects. Several approaches including small molecule inhibitors, antibodies, cytokines, and cellular therapies are now being developed for the treatment of cGvHD, and some of these therapies have been or are currently tested in clinical trials. In this review, we discuss these emerging therapies with particular emphasis on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). TKIs are a class of compounds that inhibits tyrosine kinases, thereby preventing the dissemination of growth signals and activation of key cellular proteins that are involved in cell growth and division. Because they have been shown to inhibit key kinases in both B cells and T cells that are involved in the pathophysiology of cGvHD, TKIs present new promising therapeutic approaches. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor, has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with cGvHD after failure of first-line of systemic therapy. Also, Janus Associated Kinases (JAK1 and JAK2) inhibitors, such as itacitinib (JAK1) and ruxolitinib (JAK1 and 2), are promising in the treatment of cGvHD. Herein, we present the current status and future directions of the use of these new drugs with particular spotlight on their targeting of specific intracellular signal transduction cascades important for cGvHD, in order to shed some light on their possible mode of actions.","Saidu, Nathaniel Edward Bennett; Bonini, Chiara; Dickinson, Anne; Grce, Magdalena; Inngjerdingen, Marit; Koehl, Ulrike; Toubert, Antoine; Zeiser, Robert; Galimberti, Sara",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7583636/,308
41965,E-Pal,2020-11-20,"Nigeria is currently the worst COVID-19 affected country in West Africa in terms of morbidity and mortality amid ECOWAS’s recent proclamation of the country as the region’s COVID-19 Response Champion. It is against this background that this paper analysed the geographical distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities in West Africa, with a view to understanding why Nigeria is at the heart of the pandemic in the sub-continent. The research relied on COVID-19 data and other health, demographic, transport, economic indicators from published sources. Pearson correlation technique and simple linear regressions were useful in discerning associations between COVID-19 and explanatory factors in West Africa. In order of importance, Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal were the top three on the morbidity list while Nigeria, Mali and Niger had the largest number of fatalities as at June 11, 2020. Results show that the population size and air traffic had significant impact on both COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in West Africa. In addition, Nigeria’s large population size and high air traffic volume did not only increase its susceptibility to the viral infection but also accounted for its being an outlier in the sub-continent. The study recommends that a cautious and gradual reopening of the borders should be considered by member states of the sub-region while behavioural avoidance measures are being enforced till a vaccine is found.

42479,Ein Zyklus ohne Ende,2020-11-24,"Parasitic infections can cause many respiratory, digestive and other diseases and contribute to some performance conditions in equids. However, knowledge on the biodiversity of parasites of equids in Iran is still limited. The present review covers all the information about parasitic diseases of horses, donkeys, mules and wild asses in Iran published as articles in Iranian and international journals, dissertations and congress papers from 1931 to July 2020. Parasites so far described in Iranian equids include species of 9 genera of the Protozoa (Trypanosoma, Giardia, Eimeria, Klossiella, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Neospora, Theileria and Babesia), 50 helminth species from the digestive system (i.e., 2 trematodes, 3 cestodes and 37 nematodes) and from other organs (i.e., Schistosoma turkestanica, Echinococcus granulosus, Dictyocaulus arnfieldi, Parafilaria multipapillosa, Setaria equina and 3 Onchocerca spp.). Furthermore, 16 species of hard ticks, 3 mite species causing mange, 2 lice species, and larvae of 4 Gastrophilus species and Hippobosca equina have been reported from equids in Iran. Archeoparasitological findings in coprolites of equids include Fasciola hepatica, Oxyuris equi, Anoplocephala spp. and intestinal strongyles. Parasitic diseases are important issues in terms of animal welfare, economics and public health; however, parasites and parasitic diseases of equines have not received adequate attention compared with ruminants and camels in Iran. The present review highlights the knowledge gaps related to equines about the presence, species, genotypes and subtypes of Neospora hughesi, Sarcocystis spp., Trichinella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, Blastocystis and microsporidia. Identification of ticks vectoring pathogenic parasites, bacteria and viruses has received little attention, too. The efficacy of common horse wormers also needs to be evaluated systematically.

Thorough understanding of CT imaging features of COVID-19 is essential for effective patient management; rationalizing the need for relevant research. The aim of this study was to analyze the chest CT findings of patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) proved COVID-19 admitted to four Egyptian hospitals. The recently published RSNA expert consensus statement on reporting COVID-19 chest CT findings was taken into consideration. RESULTS: Normal CT “negative for COVID-19” was reported in 26.1% of our RT-PCR proved COVID-19 cases. In descending order of prevalence, imaging findings of the positive CT studies (73.9%) included GGO (69%), consolidation (49.7%), crazy paving (15.4%), and peri-lobular fibrosis (40.6%). These showed a dominantly bilateral (68.2%), peripheral (72.4%), and patchy (64.7%) distribution. Remarkably, thymic hyperplasia was identified in 14.3% of studies. According to the RSNA consensus, CT findings were classified as typical in 68.9%, indeterminate in 3.6%, and atypical in 1.4% of the evaluated CT studies. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 cannot be entirely excluded by chest CT, it can be distinguished in more than two-thirds of cases; making CT a widely available, non-invasive, and rapid diagnostic tool.","Sabri, Youssriah Yahia; Fawzi, Mohamed Mohsen Tolba; Nossair, Eman Zaki; El-Mandooh, Safaa Mohamed; Hegazy, Amira Aly; Tadros, Sally Fouad",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7691697/,308

43457,"The Murderous Coronavirus: Data and Statistics to Die or to Adapt, But Together – That is the Question",2020-12-18,"This presentation reviews best practices for using data resources from the NACDA Program on Aging, its projects, and its collaborating partners for measuring the impact of epidemics. The report summarizes resources to identify measures of well-being, social connectedness, and other constructs to measure the social and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on population health outcomes. The report suggests data resources to identify pre-crisis measures of social distancing, social networks, consumer confidence, unemployment, and the use of social media. The COVID-19 pandemic presents research challenges for how we measure governmental, community, and population responses to a crisis. COVID-19 represents a unique case because it is a new virus with a novel impact profile and a long latency period. We offer examples of variables and concepts found across multiple studies and multiple years that can provide baseline information on pre-COVID-19 social behaviors using studies managed and distributed by NACDA and ICPSR. This report also provides guidance on how to search for specific topics using the ICPSR generated search tools. Finally, we offer information on how to obtain these data for research purposes. Our hope is this information will be valuable in identifying key baseline measures of social behavior, health, and employment before the COVID-19 epidemic, and this information can allow us to evaluate challenges and recovery once the crisis has passed. Both NACDA and ICPSR remain available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to assist researchers in locating and obtaining data related to their research.","McNally, James; Lavender, Kathryn",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740190/,308
43478,Branche,2020-12-22,"The emergence of COVID-19 and the measures implemented to curb its spread are anticipated to have long-term implications for mental health. Older adults may be at increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes as opportunities to remain socially connected have diminished. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of pandemic-related stress on mental health. Utilizing the stress and coping framework, the purpose of this study is three-fold: 1) to examine the influences of COVID-19-related stress on depression, anxiety, and loneliness, 2) to assess the mediating role of coping style and social support, and 3) to investigate whether these relationships vary across age. Participants (N = 1,318) between the ages of 18-92 years completed an online survey, assessing pandemic-related stress, mental health, social support, coping, and their experiences with social distancing, during the initial implementation of social distancing measures in the United States. Stress, social support, and coping style were related to psychosocial outcomes. Results suggested that avoidant coping mediated the relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychosocial outcomes, particularly depression. Avoidant coping more strongly mediated the relationship between stress and depression in younger adults compared to older adults. Results were consistent with the stress and coping framework and recent work highlighting the older adults’ resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the associations between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Minahan, Jillian; Falzarano, Francesca; Yazdani, Neshat; Siedlecki, Karen",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740626/,308

Initial research suggests that older adults are experiencing negative emotions and stress during social distancing and self-quarantining. Consistently, literature shows that pet ownership can mitigate some negative emotions, including stress and loneliness. Our goal was to explore the impact of pets on older adults who were restricting their social interactions during the first three to five weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was based on web-based survey data from 833 persons aged 60 and older in the United States. The sample age of respondents ranged from 60-85, with a majority (80.2%) female and White (95%). About 56% of the sample reported that they owned at least one pet. Respondents with pets did not significantly differ in stress or loneliness measures compared to those without pets. A majority of respondents reported engaging in more distance communication compared to before the pandemic. However, respondents with pets were less likely to report an increase in the following technology-mediated forms of communication: emails, texts, computers, and telephone (all p-values < .05) compared to those without pets. There was no significant difference in other coping mechanisms (e.g. exercise, alcohol intake) by pet ownership. These results suggest that respondents did not rely on pets to reduce stress or loneliness. However, pets may fill other communication/connection needs, and older adults may then rely less on communication with other people. Research on coping with the impact of Covid-19 has implications for interventions, including specific interventions for pet ownership.","Emerson, Kerstin; Kim, Deborah; Mois, George; Beer, Jenay",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741331/,308

For example, artificial intelligence influences the behavior of tourists and tourism enterprises. The analysis of the impact of artificial intelligence on the tourism industry as a system is still insufficient. Therefore, this research proposes a multi-dimensional framework from an industry perspective based on the existing definition of artificial intelligence. The framework involves three aspects: the level of intelligence, task types, and whether artificial intelligence is embedded in robots.

Roughly, 129 billion face masks and 65 billion plastic gloves every month are used and disposed of on the globe. The study aims to identify the polymer type of face masks and gloves and sustainable plastic waste management options. RESULTS: The identification of polymers, which can help for fuel conversion alternatives, was confirmed by FTIR and TGA/DTA analysis and confirms that the polymeric categories fit for the intended purpose. Moreover, the handling technique for upcycling and the environmental impacts of the medical face mask and glove were discussed. The FTIR result revealed that face masks and gloves are polypropylene and PVC thermoplastic polymer, respectively and they can be easily transformed to fuel energy via pyrolysis. The endothermic peaks around 431 ℃ for medical glove and 175 ℃ for surgical is observed tells that the melting point of the PVC and polypropylene of plastic polymers, respectively. The pyrolysis of the face mask and glove was carried out in a closed reactor at 400 ℃ for 1 h. Conferring to lab-scale processes, liquid, and wax fuel rate of 75%, char of 10%, and the rest non-condensable gases were estimated at the end. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the medical plastics can be recycled into oil due to their thermoplastics nature having high oil content and the waste to energy conversion can potentially reduce the volume of PPE plastic wastes.

This study explored the knowledge and attitudes inhibiting vaccine acceptancy during pregnancy. METHODS: Key informant and semi-structured interviews were conducted with pregnant women receiving antenatal care at community clinics, antenatal care staff, women enrolled in maternal immunization trials, community leaders and non-pregnant women residing in Soweto. Focus Group Discussions were also held with the mothers and husbands/partners of the pregnant women (n = 55). RESULTS: The study established good knowledge, a positive attitude and high acceptability of maternal immunization among pregnant women, non-pregnant women, antenatal staff as well as church and community leaders. Men were the least positive about maternal immunization. Aside from antenatal staff, there was poor knowledge regarding the types of vaccinations administered and the health benefits of immunization across all the study groups. Reasons adduced for poor knowledge about the types of vaccinations include lack of communication on maternal immunization during antenatal sessions or clinic visits and power dynamics that tend to exist between healthcare workers and patients. CONCLUSION: Ensuring that healthcare workers provide useful information on immunization during antenatal visits as well as include men in education sessions regarding the benefit of vaccination may increase patients’ confidence and immunization uptake.","Godongwana, Motlatso; Myburgh, Nellie; Adedini, Sunday A.; Cutland, Clare; Radebe, Nomasonto",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7851332/,308

Plants deploy a large number of resistance (R) proteins to detect invading pathogens. The R proteins are encoded by resistance genes that contain cell surface-localized receptors and intracellular receptors. In this study, a new plant R protein predictor called prPred was developed based on a support vector machine (SVM), which can accurately distinguish plant R proteins from other proteins. Experimental results showed that the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, MCC, and AUC of prPred were 0.935, 1.000, 0.806, 1.000, 0.893, 0.857, and 0.948, respectively, on an independent test set. Moreover, the predictor integrated the HMMscan search tool and Phobius to identify protein domain families and transmembrane protein regions to differentiate subclasses of R proteins. prPred is available at https://github.com/Wangys-prog/prPred.

In turn, AI ethics is a part of the broader field of digital ethics, which addresses similar concerns generated by the development and deployment of new digital technologies. Here, we tackle the important worry that digital ethics in general, and AI ethics in particular, lack adequate philosophical foundations. In direct response to that worry, we formulate and rationally justify some basic concepts and principles for digital ethics/AI ethics, all drawn from a broadly Kantian theory of human dignity. Our argument, which is designed to be relatively compact and easily accessible, is presented in ten distinct steps: (1) what “digital ethics” and “AI ethics” mean, (2) refuting the dignity-skeptic, (3) the metaphysics of human dignity, (4) human happiness or flourishing, true human needs, and human dignity, (5) our moral obligations with respect to all human real persons, (6) what a natural automaton or natural machine is, (7) why human real persons are not natural automata/natural machines: because consciousness is a form of life, (8) our moral obligations with respect to the design and use of artificial automata or artificial machines, aka computers, and digital technology more generally, (9) what privacy is, why invasions of digital privacy are morally impermissible, whereas consensual entrances into digital privacy are either morally permissible or even obligatory, and finally (10) dignitarian morality versus legality, and digital ethics/AI ethics. We conclude by asserting our strongly-held belief that a well-founded and generally-accepted dignitarian digital ethics/AI ethics is of global existential importance for humanity.","Hanna, Robert; Kazim, Emre",AI Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909376/,308

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a major impact on the diagnostics and treatment of coronary heart disease in many ways. In addition, the results of the ISCHEMIA study have at least in part questioned the previous practice of the treatment of stable chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). In this study, myocardial revascularization was not associated with improvement in the prognosis of patients with stable ischemia but resulted in an improvement in the quality of life and angina pectoris symptoms compared to optimal medical therapy. In the field of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), publications from 2020 enhanced the concepts of the new European guidelines on non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). For the first time, the benefit of early invasive treatment in NSTE-ACS could be demonstrated for patients ≥ 80 years of age. Recent analyses also confirmed the concept of complete revascularization for multivessel disease in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction without shock. This concept is now being applied to NSTE-ACS. In antiplatelet therapy, recent studies challenged antiplatelet pretreatment as part of the early invasive strategy with unknown coronary artery status. Several studies showed the potential benefit of de-escalation of antiplatelet therapy after NSTE-ACS, especially in older patients.","Werner, Nikos; Neumann, Franz-Josef",Kardiologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7944250/,308

Public transportation, energy, health, education, and waste management are only a few of the many sectors in which digital innovation has shown its potential to improve residents’ quality of life and make the city more attractive to foreign capitals, companies, and tourists. Nevertheless, no city (nor nation) can fully implement such transition alone. Besides domestic coordination with other cities and the central government, such a process requires direct involvement of city diplomats. As the chapter will show, there are numerous opportunities to match smart city and city diplomacy, including peer learning between friend cities and within city networks, partnership with foreign firms, and participation in programs and funding mechanisms implemented by international organizations. Moreover, a series of challenges arise from the international dimension of smart city diplomacy, namely in terms of foreign technologies’ impact on residents’ rights and the job market. The chapter will end with some considerations on the role of smart technologies in supporting cities’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kihlgren Grandi, Lorenzo",City Diplomacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971665/,308

This chapter presents public engagement with research activities: two water-related walks. First, a waterways walk through Birmingham, UK, that stopped at various places and discussed drought and water scarcity issues with participants. Second, a drought walk through St James’s Park in London used to disseminate a primer document and highlight issues of public water supply and its function in public spaces. This chapter presents these activities to frame a necessary discussion about the need for better communication of drought and water scarcity in the UK against the background that the issue is often neglected in public debates about water. At the same time water resources managers at the UK’s water companies report difficulties in communicating the issue despite having supporting data from monitoring and modelling. Hence, a public drought and water scarcity discussion is overdue and, as the examples show, can come in various shapes.","Grecksch, Kevin",Drought and Water Scarcity in the UK,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971683/,308

Hence, the IoT concept plays a vital role in managing and controlling the wireless devices over the Internet. Therefore, IoT is considered to be the third wave of information and communication technology (ICT) after eras of the Internet and cellular networks. Besides, the post-COVID-19 world is expected to more sensor-centric to ensure lesser human interactions. Since a humongous number of sensors are intended to be deployed in IoT, efficient data communication requires the network to be clustered physically or logically. Consequently, the selection of the appropriate sensor(s) for data processing and gathering is vital in IoT. Several sensor selection techniques in IoT have been proposed recently, still, sensor searching remains quite a new research field. Therefore, several sensor searching methods for IoT are studied and presented in this paper. Moreover, the strengths and limitations of the existing sensor searching techniques are also outlined in the paper. Hence, the new performance metrics are presented in the paper, where the existing techniques for searching are analyzed.","Choudhury, Farzana Noshin; Rahman, Fahrin; Jamil, Md.

Although it is not the case, the distribution of prices in the contemporary city is a big deal for policy-makers and urban planners as well. Especially in metropolitan areas, where polarization of services is needed, the high complexity of urban scenarios makes the prediction of price variation due to change in the morphology or in the offer of services (for example in transportation and accessibility) very unreliable, despite of the success of policy and planning actions is strictly related to its control. This paper, moving in this perspective, points out some evidences on the relationships between the quali-quantitative structure of the city and the fluctuation of real estate prices with reference to house market, under the idea of investigating what is the role of urban railway stations. As a matter of fact, railway stations are nodes of the transport network as well places of the urban environment whose big impact on accessibility in the city and the corresponding contribution in the definition of property values is very intuitive. The findings on the effects of railway stations on property values are mixed, since they vary on magnitude and direction. This paper focuses on the comparison of the impact of urban railway stations on the residential estate property values as well on the structure of the city in itself, grasped in terms of configurational state. To this aim, the paper proposes a case study, evaluating how the correlation among configurational indexes and residential values distribution varies with and without the presence of the railway system. The main findings of the work make to arise a marginal or negative impact of the railway system, so as to promote the idea that other factors dominates the change in local property values around railway stations. Finally, the authors proposes the integration of ontologies and configurational analysis to define a methodological framework able to explain the state of residential estate market.","Di Pinto, Valerio; Rinaldi, Antonio M.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974920/,308

This paper (Project repository available at http://github.com/karpovilia/botdetection) focuses on the classification of human and fake accounts on the social network, by employing several graph neural networks, to efficiently encode attributes and network graph features of the account. Our work uses both network structure and attributes to distinguish human and artificial accounts and compares attributed and traditional graph embeddings. Separating complex, human-like artificial accounts into a standalone task demonstrates significant limitations of profile-based algorithms for bot detection and shows efficiency of network structure based methods for detecting sophisticated bot accounts. Experiments show that our approach can achieve competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art bot detection systems with only network-driven features.","Karpov, Ilia; Glazkova, Ekaterina","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988408/,308

Adhesion inhibitors are promising new preventive agents that may be less prone to induce resistance, as they do not interfere with the viability of S. aureus and therefore exert less selection pressure. We identified promising adhesion inhibitors by screening a library of 4208 compounds for their capacity to inhibit S. aureus adhesion to A-549 epithelial cells in vitro in a novel automated, imaging-based assay. The assay quantified DAPI-stained nuclei of the host cell; attached bacteria were stained with an anti-teichoic acid antibody. The most promising candidate, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), was evaluated in a novel persistent S. aureus nasal colonization model using a mouse-adapted S. aureus strain. Colonized mice were treated intranasally over 7 days with ATA using a wide dose range (0.5–10%). Mupirocin completely eliminated the bacteria from the nose within three days of treatment. In contrast, even high concentrations of ATA failed to eradicate the bacteria. To conclude, our imaging-based assay and the persistent colonization model provide excellent tools to identify and validate new drug candidates against S. aureus nasal colonization.

This period of rapid policy change unfolded broadly in three phases, starting with minor adjustments to existing policy instruments, followed by larger amendments to a wider range of programs, and finally ending with the creation of new and quite generous benefits. The pathway of policy change is best described as incremental, but it resulted in a more radical shift to “trust but verify” to administer benefits rather than the pre–COVID-19 practice of verifying eligibility before paying benefits. The reasons and precedents for this decision are discussed. I conclude with some observations on the applicability and limitations of trust but verify for income security policy in the post–COVID-19 period.","Robson, Jennifer",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7976853/,308

An online questionnaire consisting of two sections provided a variety of potential framings for explaining the phenomenon. The first section invited the participants to explain the spread of the coronavirus in terms of their school majors in general, with no specific reference to mathematics. The second section asked explicitly to explain the mathematical context underlying the phenomenon. In this section, the participants were asked to discuss the Prime Minister’s speech given in the media a few weeks earlier, in which he described the spread of the coronavirus as a geometric series. Data analysis of 87 participants’ responses to the questionnaire revealed 11 different mathematical ideas used to explain the spread of the coronavirus. These ideas included are as follows: doubling, sequence, exponential growth, using powers, tree diagram, recursion, fast-growing rate with covariation, probability, parabola and quadratic function, acceleration, and factorial. It was also found that the second section of the questionnaire elicited a wider range of mathematical ideas than the first one. We suggest possible explanations for the emergence of the mathematical ideas, which seem to reflect the graduates’ intuitive knowledge, influenced not only by their mathematics track level but also by their chosen high school majors. Possible implications are discussed.","Rotem, Sigal-Hava; Ayalon, Michal",Educ Stud Math,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047548/,308

51897,Girocard wächst dank Apple,2020-09-30,"Vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) is a secosteroid and prohormone which is metabolized in various tissues to the biologically most active vitamin D hormone 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (calcitriol). 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) has multiple pleiotropic effects, particularly within the immune system, and is increasingly utilized not only within prophylaxis, but also within therapy of various diseases. In this context, the latest research has revealed clinical benefits of high dose vitamin D(3) therapy in autoimmune diseases. The necessity of high doses of vitamin D(3) for treatment success can be explained by the concept of an acquired form of vitamin D resistance. Its etiology is based on the one hand on polymorphisms within genes affecting the vitamin D system, causing susceptibility towards developing low vitamin D responsiveness and autoimmune diseases; on the other hand it is based on a blockade of vitamin D receptor signaling, e.g. through pathogen infections. In this paper, we review observational and mechanistic evidence for the acquired vitamin D resistance hypothesis. We particularly focus on its clinical confirmation from our experience of treating multiple sclerosis patients with the so-called Coimbra protocol, in which daily doses up to 1000 I.U. vitamin D(3) per kg body weight can be administered safely. Parathyroid hormone levels in serum thereby provide the key information for finding the right dose. We argue that acquired vitamin D resistance provides a plausible pathomechanism for the development of autoimmune diseases, which could be treated using high-dose vitamin D(3) therapy.","Lemke, Dirk; Klement, Rainer Johannes; Schweiger, Felix; Schweiger, Beatrix; Spitz, Jörg",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8058406/,308

This ignites reluctance in students to use LMS to their maximum potential in institutions of higher education (IHE). Through two contrasting qualitative case studies in two IHEs, ways in which LMS can be used for non-formal learning are proposed. Data were generated using reflective activities, Zoom group meetings and one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 31 students who were purposively and conveniently sampled from teacher education programmes at a South African and an American university. The theoretical framework of connectivism was used as a lens to make meaning of data that were thematically analysed. Findings suggest that students did not have a love of using LMS but used the Moodle and Canvas LMS primarily for downloading readings and participating in discussion forums. The study therefore, proposes a non-formal learning framework for self-direction, and concludes that ignoring students’ personal (non-formal) experiences which stimulate a love of using LMS may result in IHE to needing to change from one LMS to another.","Mpungose, Cedric Bheki; Khoza, Simon Bheki",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7524034/,308

This international qualitative study captured the global impact on vascular patient care during the first pandemic ‘wave’. METHODS: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale. RESULTS: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all ‘elective’ repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on vascular services worldwide. There will be a significant vascular disease burden awaiting screening and intervention after the pandemic.","Hitchman, Louise",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030168/,308

Both fractal fractional techniques are equally good, but the Atangana–Baleanu Caputo method has an edge over Caputo method. For illustrations and clarity of our main results, we provided the numerical simulations of the approximate solutions and their physical interpretations.

However, the evidence has become somewhat fragmented, making it challenging to understand driver education's effec-tiveness for improving road safety. The current study aimed to provide the efficacy of pre-LDE and post-LDE interventions aimed at improving the safety of drivers (includes crashes, injuries, or secondary outcomes). METHODS: The following online databases were searched up to the 21st of February 2020: Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane library, and other relevant databases. Systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses were selected to investigate the efficacy of driving education in reducing crashes, injuries, or secondary outcomes. Two investigators independently conducted the data extraction and used the assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) tool to conduct a quality assessment of each SR identified. RESULTS: Out of the 229 potential articles, seven SRs were eligible for the current overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This overview showed that pre-and post-license education by people of all ages led to improvements in secondary outcomes, such as performance, self-perceived driving abilities, behind-the-wheel driving performance, and even a small decrease in traffic offenses. However, education was not effective in reducing crashes or injuries, either at the individual or community level. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that driver education is an effective approach to reducing crashes or injuries. This negative result might be due to ineffective teaching methods. To improve road safety, it appears necessary to change the method or content of driving education since the current approaches to driving education do not reduce traffic crashes or injuries.","Akbari, Maryam; B.

Although its genetic basis is unquestionable, the involvement of environmental factors such as exposure to pesticides has also been proposed. Despite the systematic analyses of this relationship in humans, there are no specific reviews including both human and preclinical models. The present systematic review summarizes, analyzes, and discusses recent advances in preclinical and epidemiological studies. We included 45 human and 16 preclinical studies. These studies focused on Organophosphates (OP), Organochlorine (OC), Pyrethroid (PT), Neonicotinoid (NN), Carbamate (CM), and mixed exposures. Preclinical studies, where the OP Chlorpyrifos (CPF) compound is the one most studied, pointed to an association between gestational exposure and increased ASD-like behaviors, although the data are inconclusive with regard to other ages or pesticides. Studies in humans focused on prenatal exposure to OP and OC agents, and report cognitive and behavioral alterations related to ASD symptomatology. The results of both suggest that gestational exposure to certain OP agents could be linked to the clinical signs of ASD. Future experimental studies should focus on extending the analysis of ASD-like behaviors in preclinical models and include exposure patterns similar to those observed in human studies.","Biosca-Brull, Judit; Pérez-Fernández, Cristian; Mora, Santiago; Carrillo, Beatriz; Pinos, Helena; Conejo, Nelida Maria; Collado, Paloma; Arias, Jorge L.; Martín-Sánchez, Fernando; Sánchez-Santed, Fernando; Colomina, Maria Teresa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8153127/,308
54163,Smart Bionic Surfaces with Switchable Wettability and Applications,2021-06-11,"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. retailers have reported few major, sustained disruptions in food availability (FA); the risk of contracting COVID-19 from eating or handling food is low. Some consumer food behaviors related to FA and food safety (FS), such as panic buying, stockpiling, bleaching food have occurred. During emergencies, assessing consumer nutrition beliefs and developing intervention can prevent unintended negative behaviors. We examined self-reported worry about FA and FS during the pandemic. METHODS: Survey data was collected online in June 2020 from a representative panel of US adults (n = 4,053). Outcome variables (worry about FA and FS) were assessed using collapsed response options (‘Worried at any level’ and ‘Not at all worried) to the question, “How worried are you and your household about each of the following as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic?” Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the associations between sociodemographic variables and worry about FA and FS. RESULTS: Over half of respondents reported worry about FA (58.3%) or FS (57.5%). The highest reported worry about FA were among those not employed (74%), those with household income ≤$34,999 (70%), Black adults (68%), adults aged 35–49 years (64%), those with a high school education or less (62%), and those in the South (61%). The highest reported worry about FS was among those not employed (78%), Black adults (73%), household income ≤$34,999 (74%), aged 35–49 years (61%), and those in the Northeast (61%). Compared with their respective referent groups, significantly higher worry for FA and FS respectively were found among lower income households (aOR [CI] = 1.76 [1.30–2.39]; 1.84 [1.35–2.51]), those who were unemployed (1.54 [1.05–2.28]; 1.90 [1.26–2.81]), non-Hispanic Black (1.55 [1.14–2.12]; 2.25 [1.65–3.07]), and Hispanic (1.39 [1.06–1.82]; 1.94 [1.46–2.56]).

METHODS: U-ACCOMPLISH was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03653026) that enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe UC (defined as adapted Mayo score 5–9 with centrally read endoscopic score 2–3) who had inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids and/or biologics. Patients were randomized 2:1 to UPA 45 mg QD or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks. At week 8, responders entered the maintenance phase and non-responders entered the extended treatment period to receive open-label UPA 45 mg QD for additional 8 weeks.The primary endpoint (clinical remission per adapted Mayo Score) and ranked secondary endpoints including symptomatic, endoscopic– histologic evaluations from the 8-week PBO-controlled period are reported here. Non-responder imputation incorporating multiple imputation for missing data due to COVID-19 are reported. RESULTS: 522 patients were randomized (UPA, n=345; PBO, n=177); the intent-to-treat population included 341 patients in UPA and 174 patients in PBO group. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between groups; 50.7% and 51.1% were biologic inadequate responders in UPA and PBO groups, respectively (Table 1). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving UPA 45 mg QD (33.5%) versus PBO (4.1%) achieved the primary endpoint (adjusted treatment difference: 29.0% [23.2, 34.(7)]; P<0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving UPA versus PBO also achieved all ranked secondary endpoints (all P<0.001; Figure 1).Serious adverse events were reported by 3.2% and 4.5% of patients in UPA and PBO groups, respectively (Table 2). Similar rates of serious infection were observed in both groups (0.6%); 2 events each of herpes zoster and opportunistic infection were reported in UPA group.

We investigated patient’s experience with telemedicine (TM) during the pandemic, their interest in future TM use, and their preference regarding a qualified IBD Nurse-led or a Medical Doctor-led (MD-led) teleconsultation at a large German IBD center. METHODS: Pediatric and adult patients who attended the IBD unit at least once between 7/2018 and 6/2020) were invited to a prospective survey (KoCo19-CED-1). Questions included items on IBD (phenotype, treatment and disease activity), comorbidities, healthcare utilization, demographic and socioeconomic factors, psychological burden and IBD-related quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. This sub-analysis presents patient’s experience with TM and their preference for a contact with an IBD Nurse. RESULTS: Of 820 identified IBD cases, 504 (62%) patients and/or their parents completed the survey between mid-July to mid-October 2020; 86 were children (aged 6 to 18 years) and 418 were adults (up to 85 years); 58.7% had Crohn’s disease and 35.7% Ulcerative Colitis. Current treatment with any immunosuppressive medication (mono- or combo-therapy with immunomodulators, biologics, JAK-inhibitors and/or corticosteroids) were reported by 79.6% (401/504) of patients. During the pandemic, an in-person visit was substituted with TM by an IBD Nurse or a medical doctor (MD) in 58 (11.6%) and 29 (5.8%) of the patients, with high satisfaction (88.5% vs 92.1 %, respectively, n.s.). Half of the patients (n=246) showed interest in future TM, thereof 60.2% preferred consultation with a MD, 1,6% with an IBD Nurse and 38.2% expressed no preference. Of patients with prior experience with an IBD Nurse-led TM (n=38), 96% are interested to use TM in the future. Rejection of future TM was related to no TM experience (p=0.001), having Crohn’s disease (p=0.032), receiving biologics (p=0.004), and self- or non-employment status (p=0.003), but not to gender, age, self-reported disease activity or disease duration. CONCLUSION: Patient acceptance of TM is high, particular in those with previous TM experience, regardless of performed by MD or IBD Nurse.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) on respiration and hemodynamics in post cardiac surgery patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A single-center randomized control trial was performed. In total, 138 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively screened. Ultimately 39 patients met the inclusion criteria and were randomized into two groups: 19 patients were managed with pressure control ventilation (PCV) and 20 patients were managed with APRV. Respiratory mechanics after 4 h, hemodynamics within the first day, and Chest radiograph score (CRS) and blood gasses within the first three days were recorded and compared. RESULTS: A higher cardiac index (3.1 ± 0.7 vs. 2.8 ± 0.8 L⋅min(–1)⋅m(2); p < 0.05), and shock volume index (35.4 ± 9.2 vs. 33.1 ± 9.7 ml m(–2); p < 0.05) were also observed in the APRV group after 4 h as well as within the first day (p < 0.05).

55234,The Second Digital Revolution,2021-07-01,"Examination of the shape of the maximum expiratory flow‐volume curve represents a method to noninvasively describe lung and airway function in health and disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can result in pulmonary dysfunction and may result in changes to the shape of the maximum expiratory flow‐volume curve during the recovery period following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to quantitatively examine the shape and the area of the maximum expiratory flow volume curve in otherwise healthy, young adults during the three months following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. METHODS: Otherwise healthy, young adults (4M/3F, age: 21 ± 1 y, height: 174.9 ± 11.2 cm, body mass index: 23.6 ± 1.6 kgᐧm(‐2)) who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 completed spirometry testing on three occasions. The first visit (BL) took place three‐to‐four weeks after positive test confirmation. Approximately four weeks separated each subsequent visit (1M and 2M, respectively). Following each spirometry test, the flow‐volume loop with the greatest sum of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second was chosen for analysis. The angle beta (β°) and flow ratio were calculated using standard pulmonary function parameters. Slope ratios at increments of 5% of FVC were determined from 80% to 20% FVC. Additionally, the area under the maximum expiratory flow‐volume curve was calculated. Data were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. RESULTS: FVC remained similar over the study period (p > 0.05). The β° was significantly reduced at 2M compared with BL (BL: 188.8 ± 15.7°, 1M: 180.9 ± 6.9°; 2M: 176.8 ± 5.0°, p = 0.012). Flow ratios were similar between visits (BL: 20.3 ± 11.7%, 1M: 13.0 ± 6.4%, 2M: 18.1 ± 5.9%; p = 0.53). Additionally, the slope ratios at each lung volume were similar between visits. However, while not statistically different, the slope ratio at 80% FVC approached significance (BL: 1.22 ± 0.98, 1M: 2.37 ± 1.00, 2M: 2.13 ± 0.86; p = 0.07). The total area under the maximum flow‐volume curve was not different between visits (BL: 21.0 ± 5.1 L(2)∙s(‐1), 1M: 21.5 ± 4.5 L(2)∙s(‐1); 2M: 21.9 ± 4.7 L(2)∙s(‐1); p = 0.49). The percentages of the total area under the curve that were contained between peak expiratory flow (PEF) and 75% FVC and between 50% FVC and 25% FVC were altered at 1M and 2M compared with BL (p < 0.05). PEF tended to be greater during 2M compared with BL (BL: 8.49 ± 1.34 L(2)∙s(‐1), 1M: 9.34 ± 1.92 L(2)∙s(‐1), 2M: 9.44 ± 1.53 L(2)∙s(‐1); p = 0.056) and the changes in PEF from BL to 2M were significantly correlated with the changes in β° and area under the curve subdivisions over the same time period (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the shape of the maximum expiratory flow‐volume curve changes marginally during the initial three months following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Yet, the changes appear to be largely driven by increases in peak expiratory flow and suggests that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is acutely involved in large airway dysfunction.","Stickford, Jonathon; Augenreich, Marc; Province, Valesha; Stute, Nina; Stickford, Abigail; Ratchford, Stephen",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239682/,308
55242,Robots Used Today that we Did Not Expect 20 Years Ago (from the Editorial Board Members),2021-07-01,"Active learning is a student‐centered teaching technique that uses interactive, multimodal strategies to create a more engaging classroom setting compared to the traditional didactic lecture. Previous work by our research group showed that active learning in a first‐year dental school physiology course improved student confidence with the material, unit exam performance, long‐term retention of content, and perception of teaching effectiveness(1). While there are many forms of active learning, this particular study utilized engaging lectures, in which students are given short periods of lecture, followed by “breaks” that can consist of minute papers, problem sets, brainstorming sessions, or open discussion. As the COVID‐19 pandemic forced faculty to suddenly shift to online teaching, there were concerns about how to actively engage students via distance learning. This was further complicated by an administrative decision at our School of Dentistry to present the course material in an asynchronous format using pre‐recorded lectures. Since the original study completed in 2013, the Dental Physiology course has increased the amount of active learning components with 48% of the contact hours containing a high degree of active learning, 23% moderate amounts of active learning, and 29% traditional didactic lectures. It was desired to assess the effectiveness of active learning strategies in an online, asynchronous environment on student performance, attentiveness, and satisfaction levels. This study was determined to be exempt by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Louisville (#20.0655). Results indicated that pre‐recorded sessions that incorporated active learning improved student performance compared to the pre‐recorded traditional lectures. Similarly, active learning improved student perceptions of the course and teaching faculty. However, compared to earlier sections of the course that were presented face‐to‐face, the online, asynchronous format significantly lowered overall student performance and satisfaction. These results suggest that online physiology teaching, when presented in an asynchronous format, may pose significant challenges. While this study demonstrated the continued effectiveness of active learning strategies, further research is needed to optimize these methods and effectively engage students in online, asynchronous coursework. 1.

55427,Book Review: Successful Aging: A Neuroscientist Explores the Power and Potential of Our Lives,2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND: With the digital transformation and the increase in digital health information, the opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention are also increasing. At the same time, the demands on dealing with health information and thus for (digital) health literacy are also increasing. However, existing studies show that a large part of the population in Germany is not adequately health literate, which points to a great need for political action. OBJECTIVES: This article therefore examines the extent to which health literacy has been successfully established as an issue and as a potential new policy area in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following the discussion on policy analysis, the paper considers five criteria ((1.) problem perception and agenda-setting, (2.) consensus on definition and objectives, (3.) empirical evidence, (4.) willingness to act and change, (5.) level of resources) against which it attempts to assess the development of health literacy as a new policy area. RESULTS: Overall, it can be shown that health literacy has undergone a rapid career as a topic in Germany and is becoming increasingly relevant both socially and politically. In recent years, important steps have been taken in establishing health literacy as a policy area, which have also attracted international attention. However, too little attention has been paid to digitalization and to linking the two discussions and developments, which have been conducted separately so far. To anchor health literacy sustainably as a policy field, several challenges have to be addressed. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of health literacy in the digital age is greater than ever. Meeting these challenges will therefore be an important task in the future.","Schaeffer, Doris; Gille, Svea",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8247623/,308

55952,Diabetes Update 2021,2021-07-21,"Heart failure (HF) is the typical terminal stage of cardiac diseases involving inflammatory states. The function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the progress of HF remains poorly understood. In this study, real-time PCR results showed a decreased expression of miRNA-181b (miR-181b) in HF patients compared with healthy individuals. Besides, miR-181b expressions were negatively correlated with hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in the serum of HF patients. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that miR-181b was a diagnostic predictor of HF, and the area under the curve was 0.970 (DCM-induced HF group) and 0.962 (ICM-induced HF group). Strikingly, in HF rats induced by isoproterenol (ISO), the expression of miR-181b of heart tissue was suppressed before tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase, as revealed by western blot and real-time PCR. Besides, the overexpression of miR-181b also decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced neonatal cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our results revealed that miR-181b might be a potential biomarker for HF and provided a novel target for anti-inflammatory therapy.","Yang, Hongxiao; Shan, Lina; Gao, Yunan; Li, Lin; Xu, Guifen; Wang, Bin; Yin, Xiaoxue; Gao, Chengfang; Liu, Jiaren; Yang, Wei",Dis Markers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8270725/,308

In the present study, the core pathogens causing VAP in Beni-Suef University's Hospital, Egypt, was investigated over a study period of 2 years (2017–2019). RESULTS: Of a total of 213 patients subjected to mechanical ventilation, 60 have developed VAP during their stay in the ICU. The mortality rate reached 41.7% among VAP patients. Sixty bacteria were isolated from an endotracheal aspirate of hospitalized patients. The different isolates were cultured followed by running biochemical tests, sensitivity assays, and automated VITEK®2 System analysis. Unexpectedly, all the isolates were Gram-negative bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae were the main pathogen encountered (27/60 isolates) followed by Acientobacter baumannnii (7/60) and other microorganisms belonging to the genera Moraxella, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas (11/60). Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed via the VITEK®2 System using up to 16 different antibiotics representing 8 different antibiotic classes and subclasses (aminoglycosides, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminopenicillins, aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitor, folic acid synthesis inhibitor). Majority of the isolates (28/60) showed a remarkable extensive drug resistance (XDR) pattern, while 15 isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR) and only 6 were pan-drug resistant (PDR) with regard to antibiotics under evaluation. CONCLUSION: The association of VAP with multi-drug-resistant bacteria is alarming, and rapid management is crucial. Identification of core pathogens is essential for identifying the most appropriate technique for infection control.","Maebed, Al Zahraa M.; Gaber, Yasser; Bakeer, Walid; Dishisha, Tarek",Beni Suef Univ J Basic Appl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319904/,308

56699,Neue Möglichkeiten,2021-08-12,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Falls and frailty are main causes of morbidity and frequenty associated with functional performance, balance and physical activity. The restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic force the elderly to spend most of their time at home which may cause further functional problems. Therefore, identifying the risk factors during the pandemic can help to prevent the elderly from frailty and falls. Aim: Our aims are to investigate the clinical frailty profile and falls in relation to functional performance, balance, fear of falling and physical activity and to compare these parameters of the elderly with and without falling history during the COVID-19 pandemics. Method: Thirty-three participants aged 65-85 (mean = 71.33 ± 5.35/years, 20 women, 13 men) who have never had COVID-19 were included in the study. The participants were invited to an online video-conference based assessment. The number of falls during the last year were asked. Clinical frailty severity was assessed with Clinical Frailty Scale. The fear of falling were assessed using Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). The functional performance of the participants were tested with 30 seconds Sit-to-Stand test. The balance and mobility was evaluated with Timed-Up and Go test in a 3 meter corridor. The physical activity level of the participants were questioned using International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and vigorous level of physical activity (VPA), moderate level of physical activity (MPA) and walking were also calculated. Results: The mean scores of the outcomes among participants were shown in Table 1. Clinical frailty was significantly higher in women compared to men (p = 0.08). Clinical frailty score, fear of falling and sit to stand performance were significantly worse in fallers. There were negative weak to moderate correlations between frailty and sit to stand performance (p = 0.001) and MPA (p = 0,016). The clinical frailty was also positively correlated with FES (p < 0.001). FES showed positive correlation with Time-Up and Go performance (p = 0.001) and negative correlation with sit to stand performance (p < 0.001) and MPA (p = 0,036). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that; clinical frailty, fear of falling and sit to stand performance were associated with the fall history in elderly. In addition, clinical frailty score were higher in women. Our results indicate that, people who have fall history may tend to be frailer and may have lower functional performance, balance and physical activity. The encouragement of the elderly to increased physical activity and exercise program may decrease the frailty score and falling risk especially in elderly women during COVID-19 pandemics.","Utku, G; Akinci, B; Yilmaz, E; Erdinc, E; Atmaca, I; Gurlek, E; Ozdincler, A",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344732/,308

We trace this evolution of the concept during the last three decades focusing on the intersection of economic, social, and environmental responsibility. Based on discourse analysis of news articles and opinion pieces in the largest public newspaper in Norway from 1990 until 2018, the study confirms that discussions on CSR, sustainability and the social model often approach the same challenges. We argue that sustainability has become the dominating term in popular usage for describing the relationship between business and society. Based on our analysis of the public debate, CSR has become a more comprehensive term, transformed from being a term mainly related to internal business affairs to part of a broader societal discussion about sustainability.","Aslaksen, Hildegunn Mellesmo; Hildebrandt, Clare; Johnsen, Hans Chr.

In turn, genomes from ancient human archaeological remains are now easier than ever to obtain, and provide a direct window into changes in frequencies of trait-associated alleles in the past. This has generated a new wave of studies aiming to analyse the genetic component of traits in historic and prehistoric times using ancient DNA, and to determine whether any such traits were subject to natural selection. In humans, however, issues about the portability and robustness of complex trait inference across different populations are particularly concerning when predictions are extended to individuals that died thousands of years ago, and for which little, if any, phenotypic validation is possible. In this review, we discuss the advantages of incorporating ancient genomes into studies of trait-associated variants, the need for models that can better accommodate ancient genomes into quantitative genetic frameworks, and the existing limits to inferences about complex trait evolution, particularly with respect to past populations.","Irving-Pease, Evan K.; Muktupavela, Rasa; Dannemann, Michael; Racimo, Fernando",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371751/,308

This study proposes a hybrid approach where the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used for feature extraction while the long short-term memory (LSTM) is trained and tested on those features. For performance analysis, several machine learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector classifier, extra tree classifier and decision tree are used. The performance of both the proposed model and machine learning algorithms is analyzed using the term frequency-inverse document frequency, bag of words approach, and global vectors for word representations. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model surpasses the performance of the traditional machine learning algorithms with an accuracy of 91.60%.

Specifically, this article aimed to study the level of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by young people studying in higher education institutions in India. The study also attempted to identify various coping strategies students adopted to overcome this difficult time. Following a descriptive research design, this study used surveys to collect primary data from 235 students in graduate and undergraduate programs in India. The DASS-21 scale was used to check the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress students experienced. Furthermore, a four-point COPE scale was used to identify coping strategies students adopted. The results showed that students experienced high levels of stress and anxiety during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although depression levels were not alarming, most students were worried about several aspects of their lives and careers. However, because the data were collected from a relatively small sample, the study is likely not generalisable. Furthermore, most of the data were collected online, which has its limitations. This research likely has significant implications for various stakeholders, such as students, parents, institutions, counsellors, and government and non-government bodies, because it may help them take appropriate actions.

59227,Global Stability of a Mumps Transmission Model with Quarantine Measure,2021-10-08,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered the most common type of liver cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Since the disease is usually diagnosed at advanced stages, it has poor prognosis. Therefore, reliable biomarkers are urgently needed for early diagnosis and prognostic assessment. Methods: We used genome-wide gene expression profiling datasets from human and rat early HCC (eHCC) samples to perform integrated genomic and network-based analyses, and discovered gene markers that are expressed in blood and conserved in both species. We then used independent gene expression profiling datasets for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for eHCC patients and from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to estimate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of the identified gene signature. Furthermore, we performed functional enrichment, interaction networks and pathway analyses. Results: We identified 41 significant genes that are expressed in blood and conserved across species in eHCC. We used comprehensive clinical data from over 600 patients with HCC to verify the diagnostic and prognostic value of 41-gene-signature. We developed a prognostic model and a risk score using the 41-geneset that showed that a high prognostic index is linked to a worse disease outcome. Furthermore, our 41-gene signature predicted disease outcome independently of other clinical factors in multivariate regression analysis. Our data reveals a number of cancer-related pathways and hub genes, including EIF4E, H2AFX, CREB1, GSK3B, TGFBR1, and CCNA2, that may be essential for eHCC progression and confirm our gene signature’s ability to detect the disease in its early stages in patients’ biological fluids instead of invasive procedures and its prognostic potential. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that integrated cross-species genomic and network analysis may provide reliable markers that are associated with eHCC that may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options.","Al-Harazi, Olfat; Kaya, Ibrahim H.; Al-Eid, Maha; Alfantoukh, Lina; Al Zahrani, Ali Saeed; Al Sebayel, Mohammed; Kaya, Namik; Colak, Dilek",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511318/,308

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically important CoV distributed worldwide that causes diarrhea in pigs. nsp14 is a nonstructural protein of PEDV that is involved in regulation of innate immunity and viral replication. However, the function and mechanism by which nsp14 modulates and manipulates host immune responses remain largely unknown. Here, we report that PEDV nsp14 is an NF-κB pathway antagonist. Overexpression PEDV nsp14 protein remarkably decreases SeV-, poly (I:C)- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Meanwhile, expression of proinflammatory cytokines is suppressed by nsp14. nsp14 inhibits the phosphorylation of IKKs by interacting with IKKs and p65. Furthermore, nsp14 suppresses TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and nuclear import of p65. Overexpression nsp14 considerably increases PEDV replication. These results suggest a novel mechanism employed by PEDV to suppress the host antiviral response, providing insights that can guide the development of antivirals against CoVs.","Li, Shasha; Yang, Fan; Ma, Caina; Cao, Weijun; Yang, Jinping; Zhao, Zhenxiang; Tian, Hong; Zhu, Zixiang; Zheng, Haixue",Animal Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514322/,308

General recommendations for the inclusion criteria concerning fast-track programs are not available. METHODS The present study determined the factors influencing the time to extubation in patients undergoing a newly implemented fast-track protocol. Seventy-nine patients were retrospectively studied. Successful fast track was defined as time to extubation within 75 min after admission to ICU. RESULTS Sixty patients fulfilled the successful fast-track criteria with a mean time to extubation of 43.9 min (range 15-75 min). Nineteen patients needed more than 75 min to be weaned from the respirator with a mean time to extubation of 135 min (range 90-320 min). Analysis of pre- and intraoperative factors revealed that these groups differed only with respect to preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation levels: 67.7 ± 5.2 versus 60.8 ± 7.4%.

METHODS An experimental, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study on 32 male Wistar rats was carried out. We examined the effect of diclofenac 4 mg/kg/day on the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme in the anastomotic tissue and on the breaking strength of anastomotic and incisional wounds. The operation was performed with colonic resection and hand-sewn anastomosis. After 3 days, the rats were sacrificed and the breaking strength and the COX-2 content of the anastomosis were measured. RESULTS There was a significantly reduced level of COX-2 in the rats treated with diclofenac (p = 0.001); no significant differences in any of the breaking strength measurements and no significant correlation between COX-2 levels and breaking strength of the anastomotic or incisional wounds could be found (p = 0.073 and p = 0.727). CONCLUSION This study for the first time showed that a diclofenac dose of 4 mg/kg/24 h was sufficient to reduce the level of COX-2 enzymes in the anastomotic tissue in rats. This inhibition of the inflammatory response did not lead to reduced breaking strength of either anastomotic or incisional wounds. Whether there is a detrimental effect of COX inhibition on colorectal anastomoses in the clinical setting remains controversial.","Klein, M; Krarup, P-M; Burcharth, J; Ågren, M S; Gögenur, I; Jorgensen, L N; Rosenberg, J",European surgical research.

Whether this benefit is exclusive to stent retrievers is unclear. METHODS THERAPY (The Randomized, Concurrent Controlled Trial to Assess the Penumbra System's Safety and Effectiveness in the Treatment of Acute Stroke; NCT01429350) was an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized (1:1), open label, blinded end point evaluation, concurrent controlled clinical trial of aspiration thrombectomy after intravenous alteplase (IAT) administration compared with intravenous-alteplase alone in patients with large vessel ischemic stroke because of a thrombus length of ≥8 mm. The primary efficacy end point was the percent of patients achieving independence at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2; intention-to-treat analysis). The primary safety end point was the rate of severe adverse events (SAEs) by 90 days (as treated analysis). Patients were randomized 1:1 across 36 centers in 2 countries (United States and Germany). RESULTS Enrollment was halted after 108 (55 IAT and 53 intravenous) patients (of 692 planned) because of external evidence of the added benefit of endovascular therapy to intravenous-alteplase alone. Functional independence was achieved in 38% IAT and 30% intravenous intention-to-treat groups (P=0.52). Intention-to-treat ordinal modified Rankin Scale odds ratio was 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-3.59; P=0.12) in favor of IAT. Secondary efficacy analyses all demonstrated a consistent direction of effect toward benefit of IAT. No differences in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates (9.3% IAT versus 9.7% intravenous, P=1.0) or 90-day mortality (IAT: 12% versus intravenous: 23.9%, P=0.18) were observed. CONCLUSIONS THERAPY did not achieve its primary end point in this underpowered sample. Directions of effect for all prespecified outcomes were both internally and externally consistent toward benefit. It is possible that an alternate method of thrombectomy, primary aspiration, will benefit selected patients harboring large vessel occlusions. Further study on this topic is indicated.

61377,"Abstracts of Papers Presented at the 2021 Virtual Annual Meeting of the Society for Technology in Anesthesia (STA) January 15, 2021.",2021-03-01,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an important swine pathogen that causes significant economic losses to the pig industry. PCV2 interacts with host cellular factors to regulate its replication. High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a major non-histone protein in the nuclei, was recently discovered to participate in viral infections. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear HMGB1 negatively regulated PCV2 replication as shown by over-expression of HMGB1 or blockage of its nucleocytoplasmic translocation with ethyl pyruvate. The B box domain was essential in restricting PCV2 replication. Nuclear HMGB1 restricted PCV2 replication by sequestering the viral genome via binding to the Ori region. However, PCV2 infection could induce translocation of HMGB1 from cell nuclei to the cytoplasmic compartment. Elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PCV2 infection was closely associated with cytosolic translocation of nuclear HMGB1. Treatment of PCV2-infected cells with ethyl pyruvate or N-acetylcysteine down-regulated PCV2-induced ROS production, suppressed nucleocytoplasmic HMGB1 translocation, and decreased PCV2 replication. Collectively, these findings offer new insight into the mechanism of PCV2 evasion strategy: PCV2 could manage to escape restriction of its replication by nuclear HMGB1 through inducing ROS to trigger the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1.IMPORTANCE PCV2 is a small DNA virus that depends heavily on host cells for its infection. This study reports the close relationship between subcellular localization of host HMGB1 protein and viral replication during PCV2 infection. Restriction of PCV2 replication by nuclear HMGB1 is the early step of host defense at the host-pathogen interface. PCV2 then upregulates the host ROS to prevent sequestration of its genome by expelling nuclear HMGB1 into the cytosol. It will be interesting to study if similar evasion strategy is employed by other circoviruses such as beak and feather disease virus, recently discovered PCV3, and geminiviruses in plants. This study also provides insight into justification and pharmacological basis of antioxidants as an adjunct therapy in PCV2 infection, or possibly other diseases caused by the viruses that deploy the ROS-HMGB1 interaction favoring their replication.","Sun, Renjie; Sun, Siqi; Zhang, Yikai; Zhou, Yingshan; Shan, Ying; Li, Xiaoliang; Fang, Weihuan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00238-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321806/,308
61849,Arthroscopically Assisted Transosseous Foveal Repair of Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex.,2017,"The irradiation of non-malignant diseases, essentially for anti-inflammatory purpose, have been largely proposed and performed worldwide until the 1970-80s. At that time, the better assessment of the radio-induced malignancies, essentially in children and young patients, as well as the efficacy of the new anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and non-steroids), led to the almost disappearance of those techniques, at least in France. In contrast, our German colleagues are still going on treating about 50,000 patients per year for non-malignant (more or less severe) diseases. After a short historical overview, the present article suggests that we were possibly going too far in the rejection of those low-dose irradiations for benign lesions. The recent emergence of new preclinical data, the better understanding of the risk of radio-induced secondary tumours (almost nil in the elderly), and the severity of some situations, such as the cytokine storm of the COVID-19, should probably lead us to reconsider those low - and sometimes very low (less than 1Gy) - irradiations for well-selected indications in the elderly.","Cosset, J-M; Deutsch, E",Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451911/,308
61852,"Electronic waste generation, recycling and resource recovery: Technological perspectives and trends.",2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND Incisional hernia after abdominal surgery is a well-known complication. Controversy still exists with respect to the choice of hernia repair technique. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term recurrence rate as well as surgical complications in a consecutive group of patients undergoing open repair using an onlay mesh technique. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing open incisional hernia repair with onlay-technique between 01/05/1995 and 01/09/2007 at a single institution were included in the study. For follow-up patients were contacted by telephone, and answered a questionnaire containing questions related to the primary operation, the hernia and general risk factors. Patients were examined by a consultant surgeon in the outpatient clinic or in the patient's home if there was suspicion of an incisional hernia recurrence. RESULTS The study included 56 patients with 100% follow-up. The median follow-up was 35 months (range 4-151). Recurrent incisional hernia was found in 8 of 56 patients (15%, 95% CI: 6-24). The overall complication rate was 13% (95% CI, 4-22). All complications were minor and needed no hospital admission. CONCLUSION This study with a long follow-up showed low recurrence and complication rates in patients undergoing incisional hernia repair with the open onlay technique.","Andersen, Lars Peter Holst; Klein, Mads; Gögenur, Ismail; Rosenberg, Jacob",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-9-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19400934/,308

62324,Daily briefing: What we know about COVID-19 immunity.,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) cases post-SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, but the frequency is unknown. We aimed to determine the frequency and diagnostic features of COVID-19 related AE. METHODS Residual sera from 556 consecutive Mayo Clinic Rochester patients (laboratory cohort) who underwent autoimmune encephalopathy neural IgG evaluation were tested for total antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein using an FDA-authorized chemiluminescence assay (October 2019-December 2020). Clinical records from patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result and available research consent were reviewed. This laboratory cohort was cross-referenced with the Department of Neurology's COVID-related consultative experience (encephalopathy cohort, n=31). RESULTS Eighteen of the laboratory cohort (3%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive (April-December 2020). Diagnoses were: AE, 2; post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection [PASC], 3; toxic-metabolic encephalopathy during COVID-19 pneumonia, 2; diverse non-COVID-19 relatable neurological diagnoses, 9; unavailable, 2. Five of the encephalopathy cohort had AE (16%, including the 2 laboratory cohort cases which overlapped) representing 0.05% of 10,384 patients diagnosed and cared for with any COVID-19 illness at Mayo Clinic Rochester in 2020. The 5 patients met definite (n=1), probable (n=1), or possible (n=3) AE diagnostic criteria; median symptom onset age was 61 years (range, 46-63), 3 were women. All 5 were neural IgG negative and 4 tested were SARS-CoV-2 PCR/IgG index negative in CSF. Phenotypes (and accompanying MRI and EEG findings) were diverse (delirium [n=5], seizures [n=2], rhombencephalitis [n=1], aphasia [n=1], and ataxia [n=1]). No ADEM cases were encountered. The 3 patients with possible AE had spontaneously resolving syndromes. One with definite limbic encephalitis was immune therapy responsive but had residual mood and memory problems. One patient with probable autoimmune rhombencephalitis died despite immune therapy. The remaining 26 encephalopathy cohort patients had toxic-metabolic diagnoses. DISCUSSION We encountered occasional cases of AE in our 2020 COVID-19 experience. Consistent with sporadic reports and small case series during the COVID-19 pandemic, and prior experience of postinfectious AE, our cases had diverse clinical presentations and were neural IgG and CSF viral particle negative. Application of diagnostic criteria assists in differentiation of AE from toxic-metabolic causes arising in the setting of systemic infection.","Sanchez, Cristina Valencia; Theel, Elitza; Binnicker, Matthew; Toledano, Michel; McKeon, Andrew",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635560/,308
62921,First comprehensive ecological checklist of Brachyura in Korea: 1879-2020.,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND Individuals with pulmonary hypertension (PH) have reduced exercise capacity and quality of life. Despite initial concerns that exercise training may worsen symptoms in this group, several studies have reported improvements in functional capacity and well-being following exercise-based rehabilitation in PH. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of exercise-based rehabilitation for people with PH. Primary outcomes were exercise capacity, adverse events during the intervention period and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Secondary outcomes included cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, functional class, clinical worsening during follow-up, mortality and changes in B-type natriuretic peptide. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register of Trials up to August 2016, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of clinical trials. In addition we searched CENTRAL and the PEDro database up to August 2016 and handsearched relevant journals. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on exercise-based rehabilitation programmes for PH. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included six RCTs and were able to extract data from five studies. The majority of participants were Group I pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Study duration ranged from three to 15 weeks. Exercise programmes included both inpatient- and outpatient-based rehabilitation that incorporated both upper and lower limb exercise. The mean six-minute walk distance following exercise training was 60.12 metres higher than control (30.17 to 90.07 metres, n = 165, 5 RCTs, low-quality evidence; minimal important difference was 30 metres), the mean peak oxygen uptake was 2.4 ml/kg/minute higher (1.4 to 3.4 ml/kg/min, n = 145, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence) and the mean peak power in the intervention groups was 16.4 W higher (10.9 to 22.0 higher, n = 145, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence). The mean change in HRQoL for the SF-36 physical component score was 4.63 points higher (0.80 to 8.47 points, n = 33, 2 RCTs, low-quality evidence) and for the SF-36 mental component score was 4.17 points higher (0.01 to 8.34 points; n = 33; 2 RCTs, low-quality evidence). One study reported a single adverse event, where a participant stopped exercise training due to lightheadedness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In people with PH, exercise-based rehabilitation results in clinically relevant improvements in exercise capacity. Exercise training was not associated with any serious adverse events. Whilst most studies reported improvements in HRQoL, these may not be clinically important. Overall, we assessed the quality of the evidence to be low. The small number of studies and lack of information on participant selection makes it difficult to generalise these results across the spectrum of people with PH.","Morris, Norman R; Kermeen, Fiona D; Holland, Anne E",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011285.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28099988/,308

62978,Measurement Basics.,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND Infection in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE To estimate the frequency of infection during NOTES peritoneoscopy with different routes of access and to compare with laparoscopy. DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled study (Canadian Classification type I). METHODS Forty female pigs were randomly assigned to 3 NOTES (transgastric, transrectal, and transvaginal) and laparoscopic groups. Antiseptic technique was used for NOTES, whereas laparoscopy was performed in a sterile environment. Preoperative and postoperative intravenous antibiotics were administered. Closure of the transluminal access site was performed in all animals. Peritoneal fluid was collected for culture at the end of surgery and at necropsy at day 14. RESULTS Thirty-nine peritoneoscopies were successfully completed. Necropsy confirmed complete healing of NOTES incisions, but 2 animals in the laparoscopy group had small abscesses in the abdominal incisions. There were no statistical differences in the presence of peritoneal adhesions. Positive culture results were seen in all groups at the end of the procedure and in all animals at necropsy, but this did not lead to clinical signs of gross infection. The most common organisms that colonized the peritoneum were gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from the normal swine gastrointestinal flora. LIMITATIONS Animal model and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS In these small series of animals and with the careful lavage and preparation used, NOTES appeared to be comparable to laparoscopy in terms of peritoneal contamination and clinical infection. Despite the adherence to a strict antiseptic protocol, peritoneal contamination occurs but does not lead to septic complications in the swine.","Guarner-Argente, Carlos; Beltrán, Mireia; Martínez-Pallí, Graciela; Navarro-Ripoll, Ricard; Martínez-Zamora, M Àngels; Córdova, Henry; Comas, Jaume; de Miguel, Cristina Rodríguez; Rodríguez-D'Jesús, Antonio; Almela, Manel; Hernández-Cera, Clara; Lacy, Antonio M; Fernández-Esparrach, Gloria",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2011.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22024260/,308
63058,White House demands to know how UK approved vaccine before FDA.,2020-12-03,"Purpose Zirconia is one of the most promising implant materials due to its favorable physical, mechanical and biological properties. However, until now, we know little about the mechanism of osseointegration on zirconia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Syndecan (Sdc) on osteoblastic cell (MC3T3-E1) adhesion and proliferation onto zirconia materials. Materials and Methods The mirror-polished disks 15 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thick of commercial pure titanium (CpTi), 3mol% yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (3Y-TZP) and nano-zirconia (NanoZr) are used in this study. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded onto specimen surfaces and subjected to RNA interference (RNAi) for Syndecan-1, Syndecan-2, Syndecan-3, and Syndecan-4. At 48h post-transfection, the cell morphology, actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion were observed using scanning electron microscopy or laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. At 24h and 48h post-transfection, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to investigate cell proliferation. Results The cell morphology of MC3T3-E1 cells on CpTi, 3Y-TZP, and NanoZr changed into abnormal shape after gene silencing of Syndecan. Among the Syndecan family, Sdc-2 is responsible for NanoZr-specific morphology regulation, via maintenance of cytoskeletal conformation without affecting cellular attachment. According to CCK-8 assay, Sdc-2 affects the osteoblastic cell proliferation onto NanoZr. Conclusion Within the limitation of this study, we suggest that Syndecan affects osteoblastic cell adhesion on CpTi, 3Y-TZP, and NanoZr. Sdc-2 might be an important heparin-sensitive cell membrane regulator in osteoblastic cell adhesion, specifically on NanoZr, through the organization of actin cytoskeleton and affects osteoblastic cell proliferation.","Sun, Lu; Hong, Guang; Matsui, Hiroyuki; Song, Yun-Jia; Sasaki, Keiichi",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s263053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764936/,308
63292,Transparency is key to ethical vaccine research.,2020-12-18,"Coronavirus infection of the murine central nervous system (CNS) provides a model for studies of viral encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) neurotropism varies by strain: MHV-A59 causes mild encephalomyelitis and demyelination, while the highly neurovirulent strain JHM.SD (MHV-4) causes fatal encephalitis with extensive neuronal spread of virus. In addition, while neurons are the predominant CNS cell type infected in vivo, the canonical receptor for MHV, the carcinoembryonic antigen family member CEACAM1a, has been demonstrated only on endothelial cells and microglia. In order to investigate whether CEACAM1a is also expressed in other cell types, ceacam1a mRNA expression was quantified in murine tissues and primary cells. As expected, among CNS cell types, microglia expressed the highest levels of ceacam1a, but lower levels were also detected in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Given the low levels of neuronal expression of ceacam1a, primary neurons from wild-type and ceacam1a knockout mice were inoculated with MHV to determine the extent to which CEACAM1a-independent infection might contribute to CNS infection. While both A59 and JHM.SD infected small numbers of ceacam1a knockout neurons, only JHM.SD spread efficiently to adjacent cells in the absence of CEACAM1a. Quantification of mRNA for the ceacam1a-related genes ceacam2 and psg16 (bCEA), which encode proposed alternative MHV receptors, revealed low ceacam2 expression in microglia and oligodendrocytes and psg16 expression exclusively in neurons; however, only CEACAM2 mediated infection in human 293T cells. Therefore, neither CEACAM2 nor PSG16 is likely to be an MHV receptor on neurons, and the mechanism for CEACAM1a-independent neuronal spread of JHM.SD remains unknown.","Bender, Susan J; Phillips, Judith M; Scott, Erin P; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02688-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739537/,308
63327,India's neighbours race to sequence genomes as COVID surges.,2021-05-14,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted graduate medical education. Family medicine residents are now doing substantial clinical work and learning from home. We continued to offer academic half-day didactics virtually, but sensed a need for daily resident education and social support, so we implemented a virtual daily noon conference to address these needs. Methods The virtual noon conferences used web-based technology and had weekly organ system themes with consistent daily learning activities like cases and review questions. Four key components made the conferences collaborative and inclusive; they were led by residents, required minimal preparation by using available materials, were interactive, and promoted social connection with wellness activities. We evaluated the impact on resident-perceived knowledge and wellness over 6 weeks with weekly surveys for residents attending at least one conference that week and a postintervention survey. Results Of 66 responses to the weekly surveys, 98% agreed that noon conferences helped to increase knowledge and social connection. Of 46 total residents, 35 (76%) answered the postintervention survey, and all agreed that noon conferences helped to increase knowledge, were interactive, and increased social connection. Ninety-one percent favored continuing the noon conferences. More than three-quarters of postintervention survey respondents agreed that virtual noon conferences were equally or more beneficial compared to academic half days for both their education and well-being during the pandemic. Conclusions Virtual noon conferences have provided regular interactive learning and fostered resident well-being during the pandemic. They can supplement resident curriculum and wellness and can be easily adopted by other programs.","Hahn, Thomas W",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2020.364166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111044/,308

64236,Local immunization strategy based on the scores of nodes.,2016,"OBJECTIVE The utilization of the Pipeline embolization device (PED) has increased significantly since its inception and original approval for use in large, broad-necked aneurysms of the internal carotid artery. While microsurgical clipping and advances in endovascular techniques have improved overall efficacy in achieving complete occlusion, recurrences still occur, and the best modality for retreatment remains controversial. Despite its efficacy in this setting, the role of PED utilization in the setting of recurrent aneurysms has not yet been well defined. This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PED in the recurrence of previously treated aneurysms. METHODS The authors reviewed a total of 13 cases in which patients underwent secondary placement of a PED for aneurysm recurrence following prior treatment with another modality. The PEDs were used to treat aneurysm recurrence or residual following endovascular coiling in 7 cases, flow diversion in 2, and microsurgical clipping in 4. The mean time between initial treatment and retreatment with a PED was 28.1 months, 12 months, and 88.7 months, respectively. Clinical outcomes, including complications and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and angiographic evidence of complete occlusion were tabulated for each treatment group. RESULTS All PEDs were successfully placed without periprocedural complications. The rate of complete occlusion was 80% at 6 months after PED placement and 100% at 12 months in these patients who underwent PED placement following failed endovascular coiling; there were no adverse clinical sequelae at a mean follow-up of 26.1 months. In the 2 cases in which PEDs were placed for treatment of residual aneurysms following prior flow diversion, 1 patient demonstrated asymptomatic vessel occlusion at 6 months, and the other exhibited complete aneurysm occlusion at 12 months. In patients with aneurysm recurrence following prior microsurgical clipping, the rate of complete occlusion was 100% at 6 and 12 months, with no adverse sequelae noted at a mean clinical follow-up of 27.7 months. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of recurrent aneurysms with the PED following previous endovascular coiling, flow diversion, or microsurgical clipping is associated with a high rate of complete occlusion and minimal morbidity.","Dornbos, David; Karras, Constantine L; Wenger, Nicole; Priddy, Blake; Youssef, Patrick; Nimjee, Shahid M; Powers, Ciarán J",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.3.focus1744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28565989/,308

MS prevalence and severity decrease with increasing sunlight exposure and vitamin D(3) supplies, supporting our hypothesis that the sunlight-dependent hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) ), inhibits autoimmune T-cell responses in MS. Moreover, 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) inhibits and reverses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. Here, we investigated whether 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) inhibits EAE via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in T lymphocytes. Using bone marrow chimeric mice with a disrupted VDR only in radio-sensitive hematopoietic cells or radio-resistant non-hematopoietic cells, we found that hematopoietic cell VDR function was necessary for 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) to inhibit EAE. Furthermore, conditional targeting experiments showed that VDR function in T cells was necessary. Neither 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) nor T-cell-specific VDR targeting influenced CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T-cell proportions in the periphery or the CNS in these studies. These data support a model wherein 1,25-(OH)(2) D(3) acts directly on pathogenic CD4(+) T cells to inhibit EAE.","Mayne, Christopher G; Spanier, Justin A; Relland, Lance M; Williams, Calvin B; Hayes, Colleen E",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201040632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21287548/,308

Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified.

However, the influence of complicated cholecystitis (CC) on LCBDE has rarely been addressed. In the present study we aimed to verify whether severe gallbladder inflammation would adversely affect the outcome of LCBDE. MATERIAL AND METHODS From 2008 to 2011, all patients undergoing LC and LCBDE at China Medical University Hospital were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on the severity of cholecystitis. Those with unstable hemodynamics and co-morbidities who were deemed unfit for general anesthesia were excluded. Patient demographics, surgical results, and outcome were compared between the groups. RESULTS During the study period, 117 patients diagnosed with cholecystitis were found to have common bile duct (CBD) stones and underwent LC + LCBDE. Of these 117 patients, 87 had uncomplicated cholecystitis (UC) and the remaining 30 patients had CC. There was no demographic difference between the groups, but for patients with CC there were marginally longer operative times (190 vs. 223 min, p = 0.141), more blood loss (10 vs. 150 ml, p < 0.05), and longer postoperative hospital stays (6 vs. 7 days, p < 0.05). The risk of developing major intraoperative complications was not greater for those with CC. Conversion to open cholecystectomy was necessary in a total of 12 cases (10 %) with an overall 1 % mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS Complicated cholecystitis was not a contraindication for LCBDE. Complete stone clearance can be achieved in a substantial number of cases with an acceptable complication rate. Further prospective randomized studies are required to validate its long-term safety.","Lo, Hung-Chieh; Wang, Yu-Chun; Huang, Jui-Chien; Hsu, Cheng-Hsiung; Wu, Shih-Chi; Hsieh, Chi-Hsun",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1696-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22729830/,308

Increasing disease risks and the emergence of novel pathogens result from increased contact among wildlife, domesticated animals, and humans. We investigated the relationship between human alteration of the environment and the occurrence of generalist and synanthropic rodent species in relation to the diversity and prevalence of rodent-borne pathogens in Southeast Asia, a hotspot of threatened and endangered species, and a foci of emerging infectious diseases. We used data from an extensive pathogen survey of rodents from seven sites in mainland Southeast Asia in conjunction with past and present land cover analyses. At low spatial resolutions, we found that rodent-borne pathogen richness is negatively associated with increasing urbanization, characterized by increased habitat fragmentation, agriculture cover and deforestation. However, at a finer spatial resolution, we found that some major pathogens are favored by environmental characteristics associated with human alteration including irrigation, habitat fragmentation, and increased agricultural land cover. In addition, synanthropic rodents, many of which are important pathogen reservoirs, were associated with fragmented and human-dominated landscapes, which may ultimately enhance the opportunities for zoonotic transmission and human infection by some pathogens.","Morand, Serge; Blasdell, Kim; Bordes, Frédéric; Buchy, Philippe; Carcy, Bernard; Chaisiri, Kittipong; Chaval, Yannick; Claude, Julien; Cosson, Jean-François; Desquesnes, Marc; Jittapalapong, Sathaporn; Jiyipong, Tawisa; Karnchanabanthoen, Anamika; Pornpan, Pumhom; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Tran, Annelise",Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986339/,308

This phenomenon may have a neurological as well as a mechanical basis. Despite previous studies, the neuromechanics of finger movements are not fully understood. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the activation and coactivation patterns of finger specific flexor and extensor muscle regions during instructed single finger flexion and (2) to determine the relationship between enslaved finger movements and respective finger muscle activation. In 9 healthy subjects (age 22-29), muscle activation was assessed during single finger flexion using a 90 surface electromyography electrode grid placed over the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and the extensor digitorum (ED). We found (1) no significant differences in muscle activation timing between fingers, (2) considerable muscle activity in flexor and extensor regions associated with the non-instructed fingers and (3) no correlation between the muscle activations and corresponding movement of non-instructed fingers. A clear disparity was found between the movement pattern of the non-instructed fingers and the activity pattern of the corresponding muscle regions. This suggests that mechanical factors, such as intertendinous and myofascial connections, may also affect finger movement independency and need to be taken into consideration when studying finger movement.","van Beek, Nathalie; Stegeman, Dick F; van den Noort, Josien C; H E J Veeger, DirkJan; Maas, Huub",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2017.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279574/,308

We explored ways to deal with the coronavirus stressor and psychological outcomes among physicians and nurses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS 124 healthcare workers in General Hospital Nasice (Croatia) were invited to participate in a study by performing within the period of March 26 to April 6 2020 questionnaire collected information on socio-demographic characteristics and living conditions that may be risk factors for covid-19 concern, Short form health survey-36, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC; consisting of 8 subscales: Confrontive Coping, Distancing, Self-Controlling, Seeking Social Support, Accepting Responsibility, Escape-Avoidance, Planful Problem Solving, Positive Reappraisal). RESULTS 11% healthworkers reports moderate to very-severe depression, 17% moderate to extremely-severe anxiety and 10% for moderate to extremely-severe stress. 67% of medical staff are worried. No statistically significant differences in the scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were found between nurses and physicians, but differences were found on Escape-Avoidance and Positive Reappraisal subscales. Nurses use significantly more avoiding coping style and positive reappraisal than doctors. Seeking social support is more pronounced in those over 40 years old, while those under 40 use more avoidable stress management techniques. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring and ensuring the mental health of coronavirus care staff is crucial for global health. The education of medical staff in the field of stress management is a conditio sine qua non of the issue of an adequate relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Salopek-Žiha, Darija; Hlavati, Marina; Gvozdanović, Zvjezdana; Gašić, Mario; Placento, Harolt; Jakić, Hrvoje; Klapan, Denis; Šimić, Hrvoje",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796800/,308

This unique protease is not only responsible for processing the viral polyprotein into its functional units but is also capable of cleaving ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugates and plays a significant role in helping SARS-CoV evade the human immune system. We screened a structurally diverse library of 50,080 compounds for inhibitors of PLpro and discovered a noncovalent lead inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 20 microM, which was improved to 600 nM via synthetic optimization. The resulting compound, GRL0617, inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC(50) of 15 microM and had no associated cytotoxicity. The X-ray structure of PLpro in complex with GRL0617 indicates that the compound has a unique mode of inhibition whereby it binds within the S4-S3 subsites of the enzyme and induces a loop closure that shuts down catalysis at the active site. These findings provide proof-of-principle that PLpro is a viable target for development of antivirals directed against SARS-CoV, and that potent noncovalent cysteine protease inhibitors can be developed with specificity directed toward pathogenic deubiquitinating enzymes without inhibiting host DUBs.","Ratia, Kiira; Pegan, Scott; Takayama, Jun; Sleeman, Katrina; Coughlin, Melissa; Baliji, Surendranath; Chaudhuri, Rima; Fu, Wentao; Prabhakar, Bellur S; Johnson, Michael E; Baker, Susan C; Ghosh, Arun K; Mesecar, Andrew D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805240105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18852458/,308

Mask wearing, whether it be cloth, surgical, or N95, has quickly become the new norm in the ongoing struggle against this pandemic and has been proven to be effective in curbing its high infection rate. There has, however, been growing opposition to these policies by a substantial part of the general population who claims that masks are ineffective and can worsen breathing. To some, the choice to use or not use a mask has morphed into a point of political contention, rather than a choice rooted in concerns for public health.

67545,The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments.,2020-08-13,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SCZ) have overlapping symptomatology related to difficulties with social cognition. Yet, few studies have directly compared social cognition in ASD, SCZ, and typical development (TD). The current study examined individual differences in face recognition and its relation to affective theory of mind (ToM) in each diagnostic group. Adults with ASD (n = 31), SCZ (n = 43), and TD (n = 47) between the ages of 18 and 48 years-old with full scale IQ above 80 participated in this study. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) measured affective ToM, and the Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT) measured face perception. Adults with ASD and SCZ did not differ in their affective ToM abilities, and both groups showed affective ToM difficulties compared with TD. However, better face recognition ability uniquely predicted better affective ToM ability in ASD. Results suggest that affective ToM difficulties may relate to face processing in ASD but not SCZ. By clarifying the complex nature of individual differences in affective ToM and face recognition difficulties in these disorders, the present study suggests there may be divergent mechanisms underlying pathways to social dysfunction in ASD compared with SCZ.

We report an autoinduction methodology that provides soluble cruzain in high yields (>30 mg/L in minimal medium). These increased yields provide sufficient quantities of active enzyme for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based ligand mapping. Using circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy, we also examined the solution-state structural dynamics of the enzyme in complex with a covalently bound vinyl sulfone inhibitor (K777). We report the backbone amide and side chain carbon chemical shift assignments of cruzain in complex with K777. These resonance assignments were used to identify and map residues located in the substrate binding pocket, including the catalytic Cys25 and His162. Selective [(15)N]Cys, [(15)N]His, and [(13)C]Met labeling was performed to quickly assess cruzain-ligand interactions for a set of eight low-molecular weight compounds exhibiting micromolar binding or inhibition. Chemical shift perturbation mapping verified that six of the eight compounds bind to cruzain at the active site. Three different binding modes were delineated for the compounds, namely, covalent, noncovalent, and noninteracting. These results provide examples of how NMR spectroscopy can be used to screen compounds for fast evaluation of enzyme-inhibitor interactions to facilitate lead compound identification and subsequent structural studies.","Lee, Gregory M; Balouch, Eaman; Goetz, David H; Lazic, Ana; McKerrow, James H; Craik, Charles S",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi301305k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23181936/,308

71612,Ease restrictions on U.S. blood donations.,2020-05-29,"Antagonistic muscular co-activation can compensate for movement variability induced by motor noise at the expense of increased energetic costs. Greater antagonistic co-activation is commonly observed in older adults, which could be an adaptation to increased motor noise. The present study tested this hypothesis by manipulating motor noise in 12 young subjects while they practiced a goal-directed task using a myoelectric virtual arm, which was controlled by their biceps and triceps muscle activity. Motor noise was increased by increasing the coefficient of variation (CV) of the myoelectric signals. As hypothesized, subjects adapted by increasing antagonistic co-activation, and this was associated with reduced noise-induced performance decrements. A second hypothesis was that a virtual decrease in motor noise, achieved by smoothing the myoelectric signals, would have the opposite effect: co-activation would decrease and motor performance would improve. However, the results showed that a decrease in noise made performance worse instead of better, with no change in co-activation. Overall, these findings suggest that the nervous system adapts to virtual increases in motor noise by increasing antagonistic co-activation, and this preserves motor performance. Reducing noise may have failed to benefit performance due to characteristics of the filtering process itself, e.g., delays are introduced and muscle activity bursts are attenuated. The observed adaptations to increased noise may explain in part why older adults and many patient populations have greater antagonistic co-activation, which could represent an adaptation to increased motor noise, along with a desire for increased joint stability.","Hasson, Christopher J; Gelina, Olga; Woo, Garrett",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26973487/,308

The current study aims to investigate the parallel mediation role of hope and self-efficacy in the relationship between insecurity and stress among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We employed a cross-sectional research design in a university by distributing questionnaires online. 5286 participants were recruited (mean age = 19.65; SD = 1.13). Items were from the Security Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, and the Positive Psychology Capital (Psycap) Questionnaire (PPQ). Parallel mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS macro in SPSS. RESULTS The results indicate that insecurity predicted students' stress positively and that students with high-level perceived insecurity are more likely to perceive stress. Moreover, hope and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between insecurity and stress, indicating that hope and self-efficacy could buffer the negative effects of insecurity on stress. LIMITATIONS This study examines the mediating model between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students. The generalizability of the findings in other regions remains to be explored. Additionally, the roles of other positive self-beliefs including optimism and resilience in relieving stress can be further explored in future research. CONCLUSIONS This research provides direct evidence of insecurity effects on stress among university students, enriching relevant theories in the field of stress. Moreover, this research suggests that enhancing positive self-beliefs such as hope, and self-efficacy helps to relieve students' stress during COVID-19.","Wen, Fang-Fang; Zhu, Jian-Li; Ye, Han-Xue; Li, Lin-Yi; Ma, Zhen; Wen, Xiao-Xue; Zuo, Bin",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360366/,308
72868,Incorporation of Dietary Arachidonic and Docosatetraenoic Acid into Mouse Brain.,2021-02-17,"UNLABELLED Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), named after the prototype strain Norwalk virus (NV), are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. Studies on the related murine norovirus (MNV) have demonstrated the importance of an interferon (IFN) response in host control of virus replication, but this remains unclear for HuNoVs. Despite the lack of an efficient cell culture infection system, transfection of stool-isolated NV RNA into mammalian cells leads to viral RNA replication and virus production. Using this system, we show here that NV RNA replication is sensitive to type I (α/β) and III (interleukin-29 [IL-29]) IFN treatment. However, in cells capable of a strong IFN response to Sendai virus (SeV) and poly(I·C), NV RNA replicates efficiently and generates double-stranded RNA without inducing a detectable IFN response. Replication of HuNoV genogroup GII.3 strain U201 RNA, generated from a reverse genetics system, also does not induce an IFN response. Consistent with a lack of IFN induction, NV RNA replication is enhanced neither by neutralization of type I/III IFNs through neutralizing antibodies or the soluble IFN decoy receptor B18R nor by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in the IFN induction pathways. In contrast to other positive-strand RNA viruses that block IFN induction by targeting MAVS for degradation, MAVS is not degraded in NV RNA-replicating cells, and an SeV-induced IFN response is not blocked. Together, these results indicate that HuNoV RNA replication in mammalian cells does not induce an IFN response, suggesting that the epithelial IFN response may play a limited role in host restriction of HuNoV replication. IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are a leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Due to lack of an efficient cell culture system and robust small-animal model, little is known about the innate host defense to these viruses. Studies on murine norovirus (MNV) have shown the importance of an interferon (IFN) response in host control of MNV replication, but this remains unclear for HuNoVs. Here, we investigated the IFN response to HuNoV RNA replication in mammalian cells using Norwalk virus stool RNA transfection, a reverse genetics system, IFN neutralization reagents, and shRNA knockdown methods. Our results show that HuNoV RNA replication in mammalian epithelial cells does not induce an IFN response, nor can it be enhanced by blocking the IFN response. These results suggest a limited role of the epithelial IFN response in host control of HuNoV RNA replication, providing important insights into our understanding of the host defense to HuNoVs that differs from that to MNV.","Qu, Lin; Murakami, Kosuke; Broughman, James R; Lay, Margarita K; Guix, Susana; Tenge, Victoria R; Atmar, Robert L; Estes, Mary K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01425-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27466422/,308

Here, we examined attachment dynamics in dyadic interactions, focusing specifically on the role of physiological coregulation in state attachment processes in couples oversampled for personality pathology. A total of 121 couples completed a 10-minute discussion about an area of disagreement in their relationship and a 5-minute discussion in which they planned an event together. We used a dynamical model of heart rate changes to estimate coregulation. We found that (a) increases in state attachment avoidance were associated with contrarian coregulation (heart rate becoming misaligned with the partner's physiology) and (b) conversely, increases in state attachment anxiety were associated with dependent coregulation (heart rate becoming aligned with the partners' physiology). Dispositional attachment insecurity moderated the effects of state attachment insecurity on physiological coregulation. Whereas dispositional anxiety predicted individuals exhibiting dependent coregulation in response to state insecurity, dispositional avoidance predicted contrarian coregulation in response to state insecurity. This work provides insight into the role of physiological coregulation in attachment dynamics among couples oversampled for personality pathology, suggesting that disruptions to coregulation contribute to impaired emotion regulation during romantic conflicts.

Tuberculosis, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is highly contagious and can be transmitted through inhalation of the bacteria. However, it has been assumed that the infectiousness of bacteria and viruses in dead bodies weakens as the time from death increases. In particular, there is little awareness of infection control measures concerning decomposed bodies or even the need for such measures. The deceased, in whom we discovered MTB 3 months following her death, was a woman in her 80s who died at home. We performed judicial autopsy, because police suspected homicide when her husband hanged himself. Obtained organs were used for microscopic examination by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In addition, real-time PCR and mycobacterial culture testing using Ogawa's medium were performed for the detection of MTB. We found that the MTB in the decomposed body remained viable and potentially infectious. To identify the bacterial strain further, we performed DNA-DNA hybridization and identified the strain as MTB complex. Potentially infectious live MTB survived in the dead body far longer than had been previously reported. Pathologists should consider microbial culture tests for all autopsied cases in which the decedent's medical history or macro-examination suggests possible infection, even when a long duration of time has passed since death. Pathologists and specialists who perform autopsies should recognize that all dead bodies are potentially infectious, including those in which long periods have elapsed since death.","Unuma, Kana; Watanabe, Ryo; Hirayama, Naho; Uemura, Koichi",Journal of forensic sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/1556-4029.14532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866302/,308

We further sought to determine the key focus and impact of these policies. METHODS We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19 healthcare policies published from 28 January to 31 May 2020. Key information including the focus of the policy, target population and impact on service delivery was extracted from included policies. During analysis, data was grouped under descriptive categories and narrative summaries were developed for each category. RESULTS We identified 61 healthcare policies relating to COVID-19. We developed six category headings to describe the focus and impact of these policies: infection prevention and control (n = 19), residential care settings (n = 12), maintaining non-COVID-19 healthcare services and supports (n = 12), testing and contact tracing (n = 7), guidance for healthcare workers concerning COVID-19 (n = 6), and treating COVID-19 (n = 5).

While pandemic conditions necessitate the speedy development of policies, effective communication and adequate resourcing is required to ensure policy implementation.","O'leary, Noreen; Kingston, Liz; Griffin, Anne; Morrissey, Ann-Marie; Noonan, Maria; Kelly, Dervla; Doody, Owen; Niranjan, Vikram; Gallagher, Aoife; O'riordan, Clíona; Lynch, Aoife",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211008371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011221/,308
74866,In Vitro Strategies to Vascularize 3D Physiologically Relevant Models.,2021-08-05,"Current measures for major depressive disorder focus primarily on the assessment of depressive symptoms, while often omitting other common features. However, the presence of comorbid features in the anxiety spectrum influences outcome and may effect treatment. More comprehensive measures of depression are needed that include the assessment of symptoms in the anxiety-depression spectrum. This study examines the reliability and validity of the Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ), which assesses irritability, anger attacks, and anxiety symptoms together with the commonly considered symptoms of depression. Analysis of the factor structure of the SDQ identified 5 subscales, including one in the anxiety-depression spectrum, with adequate internal consistency and concurrent validity. The SDQ may be a valuable new tool to better characterize depression and identify and administer more targeted interventions.","Pedrelli, Paola; Blais, Mark A; Alpert, Jonathan E; Shelton, Richard C; Walker, Rosemary S W; Fava, Maurizio",CNS spectrums,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1092852914000406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275853/,308
75468,Bayesian Gene Selection Based on Pathway Information and Network-Constrained Regularization.,2021,"INTRODUCTION Embolisation has long been used as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM). The most commonly used embolic material, n-butylcyanoacrylate glue, requires experience and skill to handle its quick and unpredictable flow and polymerisation. A new liquid embolic agent, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx), is less adhesive and polymerises slowly, which provides better control for radiologists performing embolisation. OBJECTIVE To report our experience in embolisation using Onyx alone or in combination with histoacryl for bAVM embolisation in our tertiary referral centre. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the anatomy, technical conditions, complications and clinical outcome of all bAVM patients embolised at our centre using Onyx alone or in combination with n-butylcyanoacrylate glue. RESULTS Between 2010 and 2013, 13 patients [6 (46.2%) male; 7 (53.8%) female; aged, 14-57 years] were included, and a total of 31 embolisations were performed. Clinical presentation included hemorrhage [9 (69.2%)], seizures [2 (15.4%)], and headache [2 (15.4%)]. Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres [12 (92.3%)] and measured <3 cm [7 (53.8%]. Complete occlusion of the AVM was obtained in 2 (15.4%) patients; 11 (84.6%) patients had partial occlusion [6 (54.5%) had <50% nidus occlusion]. Complications occurred in four procedures involving 3 patients (morbidity, 23.1%). This resulted in the death of 1 patient (mortality, 7.7%) and complete recovery with no disability in 2 patients. CONCLUSION The total nidal occlusion achieved herein is comparable to other similar studies. Our morbidity and mortality were higher compared to other studies which may be attributed to the small number of patients. More data is being collected which may better reflect on our experience.","Hashim, Hilwati; Muda, A Sobri; Abdul Aziz, Aida; Abdul Hamid, Zuhanis",The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,https://doi.org/10.21315/mjms2016.23.4.8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27660546/,308

Consequently, the protection of non-combatants and the provision of humanitarian services must continually adapt to this changing conflict environment. Complex political affiliations, the systematic use of explosive weapons and sexual violence, and the use of new communication technology, including social media, have created new challenges for humanitarian actors in negotiating access to affected populations and security for their own personnel. The nature of combatants has also evolved as armed, non-state actors might have varying motivations, use different forms of violence, and engage in a variety of criminal activities to generate requisite funds. New health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and new capabilities, such as modern trauma care, have also created new challenges and opportunities for humanitarian health provision. In response, humanitarian policies and practices must develop negotiation and safety capabilities, informed by political and security realities on the ground, and guidance from affected communities. More fundamentally, humanitarian policies will need to confront a changing geopolitical environment, in which traditional humanitarian norms and protections might encounter wavering support in the years to come.","Wise, Paul H; Shiel, Annie; Southard, Nicole; Bendavid, Eran; Welsh, Jennifer; Stedman, Stephen; Fazal, Tanisha; Felbab-Brown, Vanda; Polatty, David; Waldman, Ronald J; Spiegel, Paul B; Blanchet, Karl; Dayoub, Rita; Zakayo, Aliyu; Barry, Michele; Martinez Garcia, Daniel; Pagano, Heather; Black, Robert; Gaffey, Michelle F; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00130-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503458/,308

PURPOSE The aim of this study was to establish a drive-through clinic model to provide glaucoma care for patients while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS A drive-through clinic was created by adapting a 1-lane, 1-way driveway adjacent to the Kellogg Eye Center building entrance. Patients were physicianselected from the Glaucoma Clinic at Kellogg Eye Center as existing patients who required intraocular pressure (IOP) checks and therapeutic management and were chosen based on their ability to be managed with an IOP measurement primarily. The entrance was otherwise closed to the public, allowing staff to utilize an adjacent vestibule with glass walls and sliding doors as a staffroom. Patients were instructed to arrive within a 15-minute time window at which time they would drive through the lane and stop their cars under an awning over the driveway. Ophthalmic technicians wearing appropriate personal protective equipment then approached each car, confirmed patient information, and measured IOP. Once the data were recorded using a mobile workstation, the physician was able to complete each visit by discussing the findings and therapeutic plan with the patient, either in-person in real time or virtually by phone or video visit at a later time. RESULTS A total of 241 visits were completed over 14 half day clinic sessions, with number of drive-through visits ranging from 5 to 45 per session. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to institute a drive-through model of IOP checks for glaucoma patients which is efficient and minimizes the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for patients and staff.","Baughman, Brittanie D; Hansemann, Beth K; Shah, Manjool M; Weizer, Jennifer S",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273284/,308

This is in the context of a growing appreciation for the complexity of the neurobiology of neurofilaments, new recognition of specialized roles for neurofilaments in synapses and a developing understanding of mechanisms responsible for their turnover. Here we will review the neurobiology of neurofilament proteins, describing current understanding of their structure and function, including recently discovered evidence for their roles in synapses. We will explore emerging understanding of the mechanisms of neurofilament degradation and clearance and review new methods for future elucidation of the kinetics of their turnover in humans. Primary roles of neurofilaments in the pathogenesis of human diseases will be described. With this background, we then will review critically evidence supporting use of neurofilament concentration measures as biomarkers of neuronal injury or degeneration.

This longitudinal study investigated the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 846 specimens from 350 subjects: comparing BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals (19 previously diagnosed with COVID-19 [RecoVax]; 49 never been diagnosed [NaïveVax]) to 122 hospitalized unvaccinated (HospNoVax) and 160 outpatient unvaccinated (OutPtNoVax) COVID-19 patients.NaïveVax experienced a delay in generating SARS-CoV-2 total antibody levels (TAb) and neutralizing antibodies (SNAb) after the 1st vaccine dose (D1), but a rapid increase in antibody levels was observed after the 2nd dose (D2). However, these never reached the robust levels observed in RecoVax. In fact, NaïveVax TAb and SNAb levels decreased 4-weeks post-D2 (p=0.003;p<0.001). For the most part, RecoVax TAb persisted throughout this study, after reaching maximal levels 2-weeks post-D2; but SNAb decreased significantly ~6-months post-D1 (p=0.002). Although NaïveVax avidity lagged behind that of RecoVax for most of the follow-up periods, NaïveVax did reach similar avidity by ~6-months post-D1. These data suggest that one vaccine dose elicits maximal antibody response in RecoVax and may be sufficient. Also, despite decreasing levels in TAb and SNAb overtime, long-term avidity maybe a measure worth evaluating and possibly correlating to vaccine efficacy.","Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Yee, Jim K; Sukhu, Ashley; Qiu, Yuqing; Rand, Sophie; Barone, Paul D; Hao, Ying; Yang, He S; Meng, Qing H; Apple, Fred S; Shi, Yuanyuan; Chadburn, Amy; Golden, Encouse; Formenti, Silvia C; Cushing, Melissa M; Zhao, Zhen",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.151477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499052/,308

AIM To compare the efficacy and safety of TMF and TDF for 48 weeks in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). METHODS We performed a randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority study at 49 sites in China. Patients with CHB were assigned (2:1) to receive either 25 mg TMF or 300 mg TDF with matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA less than 20 IU/mL at week 48. We also assessed safety, particularly bone, renal and metabolic abnormalities. RESULTS We randomised 1002 eligible patients. The baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. After a median 48 weeks of treatment, the non-inferiority criterion was met in all analysis sets. In the HBeAg-positive population, 50.2% of patients receiving TMF and 53.7% receiving TDF achieved HBV DNA less than 20 IU/mL. In the HBeAg-negative population, 88.9% and 87.8%, respectively, achieved HBV DNA less than 20 IU/mL in the TMF and TDF groups. Patients receiving TMF had significantly less decrease in bone mineral density at both hip (P < 0.001) and spine (P < 0.001), and a smaller increase in serum creatinine at week 48 (P < 0.05). Other safety results were similar between groups. CONCLUSION TMF was non-inferior to TDF in terms of anti-HBV efficacy and showed better bone and renal safety.

Most patients traveled to endemic countries and presented with histories and findings consistent with brucellosis. CLs were not notified that specimens might yield a hazardous organism, as clinicians did not consider brucellosis until notified that bacteremia with Brucella was suspected.In 3 Brucella events, CLs did not suspect that slow-growing, small Gram-negative bacteria might be harmful. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), with limited capacity to identify biological threat agents (BTAs), was used during 4 Brucella events that accounted for 84% of exposures. In 3 of these incidents, initial staining of liquid media showed Gram-positive rods or cocci, including some cocci in chains, suggesting streptococci. Over 200 occupational exposures occurred when the unknown isolates were manipulated and/or tested on open benches, including procedures that could generate infectious aerosols. During 3 Brucella events, CLs examined and/or manipulated isolates in a biological safety cabinet (BSC); in each, CLs had isolated Brucella previously.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to prevent laboratory-acquired brucellosis (LAB) were followed; no seroconversions or LAB cases occurred.Laboratory assessments were conducted after Brucella events to identify facility-specific risks and mitigations. With increasing MALDI-TOF MS use, CLs are well-advised to adhere strictly to safe work practices, such as handling and manipulating all slow-growing organisms in BSCs and not using MALDI-TOF for identification until BTAs have been ruled out.","Ackelsberg, Joel; Liddicoat, Anna; Burke, Taryn; Szymczak, Wendy A; Levi, Michael H; Ostrowsky, Belinda; Hamula, Camille; Patel, Gopi; Kopetz, Virginia; Saverimuttu, Jessie; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; D'Souza, David; Mitchell, Elizabeth A; Lowe, William; Khare, Reeti; Tang, Yi-Wei; Bianchi, Anabella Lucca; Egan, Christina; Perry, Michael J; Hughes, Scott; Rakeman, Jennifer L; Adams, Eleanor; Kharod, Grishma A; Tiller, Rebekah; Saile, Elke; Lee, Stephen; Gonzalez, Edimarlyn; Hoppe, Brett; Leviton, Ira M; Hacker, Susan; Ni, Kuey Fen; Orsini, Reina L; Jhaveri, Sangam; Mazariegos, Irving; Dingle, Tanis; Koll, Brian; Stoddard, Robyn A; Galloway, Renee; Hoffmaster, Alex; Fine, Annie; Lee, Ellen; Dentinger, Catherine; Harrison, Emily; Layton, Marcelle",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01096-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694974/,308

79270,Editorial Dielectrophoresis 2021.,2021-03-01,"Postexposure treatment (PET) of wild-type rabies virus (RV)-infected mice with a live-attenuated triple-glycoprotein RV variant (TriGAS) promotes survival but does not prevent the pathogenic RV from invading and replicating in the brain. Successful PET is associated with the induction of a robust virus-neutralizing antibody response and clearance of the wild-type RV from brain tissues. Comparison of the transcriptomes of normal mouse brain with those of wild-type-RV-infected mice that had received either mock or TriGAS PET treatment revealed that many of the host genes activated in the mock-treated mice represent type I interferon (IFN) response genes. This indicates that RV infection induces an early type I IFN response that is unable to control the infection. In contrast, most of the activated genes in the brain of the RV-infected, TriGAS-treated mouse play a role in adaptive immunity, including the regulation of T cell activation, T cell differentiation, and the regulation of lymphocyte and mononuclear cell proliferation. These findings were confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) array studies, which showed that 3 genes in particular, encoding chemokine ligand 3 (Ccl3), natural killer cell activator 2 (interleukin 12B [IL-12B]), and granzyme A (GzmA), were activated earlier and to a greater extent in the brains of RV-infected mice treated with TriGAS than in the brains of mock-treated mice. The activation of these genes, known to play key roles in the regulation of lymphocyte and mononuclear cell proliferation, is likely an important part of the mechanism by which TriGAS mediates its PET activity.","Li, Jianwei; Ertel, Adam; Portocarrero, Carla; Barkhouse, Darryll A; Dietzschold, Bernhard; Hooper, D Craig; Faber, Milosz",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06699-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22238315/,308

80250,Wearable electrochemical biosensors in North America.,2020-10-26,"Class IIa bacteriocin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a compelling alternative to current antimicrobials because of potential specific activity towards antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Engineering of these molecules would be enhanced by a better understanding of AMP sequence-activity relationships to improve efficacy in vivo and limit effects of off-target activity. Towards this goal, we experimentally evaluated 210 natural and variant class IIa bacteriocins for antimicrobial activity against six strains of enterococci. Inhibitory activity was ridge regressed to AMP sequence to predict performance, achieving an area under the curve of 0.70 and demonstrating the potential of statistical models for identifying and designing AMPs. Active AMPs were individually produced and evaluated against eight enterococci strains and four Listeria strains to elucidate trends in susceptibility. It was determined that the mannose phosphotransferase system sequence is informative of susceptibility to class IIa bacteriocins, yet other factors, such as membrane composition, also contribute strongly to susceptibility. A broadly potent bacteriocin variant (lactocin DT1) from a Lactobacillus ruminis genome was identified as the only variant with inhibitory activity towards all tested strains, while a novel enterocin variant (DT2) from an E. faecium genome demonstrated specificity towards Listeria strains. Eight AMPs were evaluated for proteolytic stability to trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, and three C-terminal disulfide-containing variants, including divercin V41, were identified as compelling for future in vivo studies given high potency and proteolytic stability.Importance Class IIa bacteriocin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), an alternative to traditional small-molecule antibiotics, are capable of selective activity towards various Gram-positive bacteria, limiting negative side effects associated with broad-spectrum activity. This selective activity is achieved through targeting of the mannose phosphotransferase system (manPTS) of a subset of Gram-positive bacteria, although factors affecting this mechanism are not entirely understood. Peptides identified from genomic data, as well as variants of previously characterized AMPs, can offer insight into how peptide sequence affects activity and selectivity. The experimental methods presented here identify promising potent and selective bacteriocins for further evaluation, highlight the potential of simple computational modeling for prediction of AMP performance, and demonstrate that factors beyond manPTS sequence affect bacterial susceptibility to class IIa bacteriocins.","Tresnak, Daniel T; Hackel, Benjamin J",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01646-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917749/,308

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately. METHODS We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. RESULTS We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of investigational, lower-dose, indomethacin submicron particle capsules compared with placebo in a study of patients with postsurgical pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS This phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, and placebo-controlled study enrolled 203 patients (18 to 50 y old) following extraction of ≥ 2 third molars who experienced moderate-to-severe pain intensity ≤ 6 hours after surgery. Patients received indomethacin submicron particle capsules (20 or 40 mg), celecoxib 400 mg, or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of total pain relief over 0 to 8 hours (TOTPAR-8) determined from the area under the curve for pain relief over 0 to 8 hours following administration of the study drug, where pain relief was measured on a 0 to 4 scale. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. RESULTS Mean ± SE TOTPAR-8 scores were 10.8 ± 1.4 (indomethacin submicron particle capsules 20 mg), 12.6 ± 1.3 (indomethacin submicron particle capsules 40 mg), 14.8 ± 1.3 (celecoxib), and 3.0 ± 1.3 (placebo; P<0.001 for active treatments vs. placebo). Indomethacin submicron particle capsules treatment groups demonstrated better mean TOTPAR over 4 hours than placebo (P<0.001). Similar rates and profiles of treatment-emergent AEs were reported by patients across treatment groups. DISCUSSION Lower-dose, indomethacin submicron particle capsules provide good overall pain relief in patients with postsurgical pain and are generally well tolerated.

OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that goal-directed sevoflurane administration (guided by BIS monitoring) could reduce the sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) and intraoperative vasopressor doses during on-pump cardiac surgery. DESIGN A prospective, controlled, sequential two-arm clinical study. SETTING German university medical centre with more than 2500 cardiac surgery interventions per year. PATIENTS Sixty elective on-pump cardiac surgery patients. INTERVENTION In group Sevo1.8% (n = 29), the sedation depth was maintained with a sustained inspired concentration of sevoflurane 1.8% before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In group SevoBIS (n = 31), the inspired sevoflurane concentration was titrated to maintain a BIS target between 40 and 60. OUTCOME MEASURES SPC during CPB and the intraoperative administration of noradrenaline. Additional analyses were performed on intraoperative awareness, postoperative blood lactate concentration, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay and kidney injury. RESULTS Mean inspired sevoflurane concentration was 0.8% in group SevoBIS, representing a 57.1% reduction (P < 0.001) compared with group Sevo1.8%.

During CPB, the mean cumulative dose of noradrenaline administered was 13.48 μg kg(-1) (95% CI 10.52 to 17.19) in group Sevo1.8% and 4.06 μg kg(-1) (95% CI 2.67 to 5.97) in group SevoBIS (P < 0.001). Pearson's correlation coefficient (between the cumulative applied dosage of sevoflurane calculated from the area under the curve of the SPC over time and the administered cumulative noradrenaline dose) was 0.607 (P < 0.001). No intraoperative awareness signs were detected. CONCLUSION BIS-guided titration of sevoflurane reduces the SPC and decreases noradrenaline administration compared with routine care during on-pump cardiac surgery.","Nitzschke, Rainer; Wilgusch, Joana; Kersten, Jan F; Trepte, Constantin J; Haas, Sebastian A; Reuter, Daniel A; Goepfert, Matthias S",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000000106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927118/,308

Subsequently, a severe and novel pediatric disorder termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) emerged. We report on unique hematologic and immunologic parameters that distinguish between COVID-19 and MIS-C and provide insight into pathophysiology. METHODS We prospectively enrolled hospitalized patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and classified them as having MIS-C or COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were classified as having either minimal or severe disease. Cytokine profiles, viral cycle thresholds (Cts), blood smears, and soluble C5b-9 values were analyzed with clinical data. Twenty patients were enrolled (9 severe COVID-19, 5 minimal COVID-19, and 6 MIS-C). Five cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α) contributed to the analysis. TNF-α and IL-10 discriminated between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19. Cts and burr cells on blood smears also differentiated between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with MIS-C. CONCLUSION Pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for critical illness with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C. Cytokine profiling and examination of peripheral blood smears may distinguish between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19.","Diorio, Caroline; Henrickson, Sarah E; Vella, Laura A; McNerney, Kevin O; Chase, Julie M; Burudpakdee, Chakkapong; Lee, Jessica H; Jasen, Cristina; Balamuth, Fran; Barrett, David M; Banwell, Brenda; Bernt, Kathrin M; Blatz, Allison M; Chiotos, Kathleen; Fisher, Brian T; Fitzgerald, Julie C; Gerber, Jeffrey S; Gollomp, Kandace; Gray, Christopher; Grupp, Stephan A; Harris, Rebecca M; Kilbaugh, Todd J; Odom John, Audrey R; Lambert, Michele P; Liebling, Emily J; Paessler, Michele; Petrosa, Whitney; Phillips, Charles A; Reilly, Anne F; Romberg, Neil; Seif, Alix E; Sesok-Pizzini, Deborah; Sullivan, Kathleen; Vardaro, Julie; Behrens, Edward M; Teachey, David T; Bassiri, Hamid",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci140970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730233/,308

However, the phylogenetic and genomic recombination properties of this virus have not been completely elucidated. In this study, comparative analyses of all available genomic sequences of North American (NA) type PRRSVs (n = 355, including 138 PRRSV genomes sequenced in this study) in China and the United States during 2014-2018 revealed a high frequency of inter-lineage recombination hotspots in non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) and the GP2-GP3 regions. Lineage 1 (L1) PRRSV was found to be susceptible to recombination among PRRSVs both in China and the US. The recombinant major parent between the 1991-2013 data and the 2014-2018 data showed a trend from complex to simple. The major recombination pattern changed from an L8 to L1 backbone during 2014-2018 for Chinese PRRSVs, whereas L1 was always the major parent for US PRRSVs. Intra-lineage recombination hotspots were not as concentrated as inter-lineage recombination hotspots. In the two main clades with differential diversity in L1, NADC30-like PRRSVs is undergoing a decrease in population genetic diversity, NADC34-like PRRSVs has been relatively stable in population genetic diversity for years. Systematic analyses of insertion and deletion (indel) polymorphisms of NSP2 divided PRRSVs into 25 patterns, which could generate novel references for the classification of PRRSVs. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the recombination of PRRSVs and indicate the need for coordinated epidemiological investigations among countries.IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most significant swine diseases. However, the phylogenetic and genomic recombination properties of the PRRS virus (PRRSV) have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we systematically compared differences in the lineage distribution, recombination, NSP2 polymorphisms, and evolutionary dynamics between NA-type PRRSVs in China and in the US. Strikingly, we found high frequency of inter-lineage recombination hotspots in non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) and in the GP2-GP3 region. Also, intra-lineage recombination hotspots were scattered across the genome between Chinese and US strains. Furthermore, we proposed novel methods based on NSP2 indel patterns for the classification of PRRSVs. Evolutionary dynamics analysis revealed that NADC30-like PRRSV is undergoing a decrease in population genetic diversity, suggesting that a dominant population may occur and cause an outbreak. Our findings offer important insights into the recombination of PRRSVs, and suggest the need for coordinated international epidemiological investigations.","Yu, Fang; Yan, Yi; Shi, Mang; Liu, Hai-Zhou; Zhang, Hong-Liang; Yang, Yong-Bo; Huang, Xin-Yi; Gauger, Phillip C; Zhang, Jianqiang; Zhang, Yan-He; Tong, Guang-Zhi; Tian, Zhi-Jun; Chen, Jian-Jun; Cai, Xue-Hui; Liu, Di; Li, Ganwu; An, Tong-Qing",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01813-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31896589/,308

New gadgets and energy devices keep emerging to tackle benign prostatic obstruction, which was dealt with mainly by transurethral resection of prostate in the old days. Although this trend appears fascinating, it also means that urologists need quality training to attain surgical safety in performing these new surgeries. E-learning and simulation training may play an important role in modern urology training. RECENT FINDINGS In this review, we would describe, using up-to-date evidence, the key components of simulation training, the types of simulators currently in use and their respective advantages and limitations. SUMMARY Modern simulation technology enables surgical training in a realistic, reproducible and risk-free environment. Simulation training has been proven to improve both performers' confidence and objective scores in various transurethral prostate surgeries.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 342 consecutive patients with thoracic ESCC who underwent R0 subtotal esophagectomy. All patients underwent subcarinal lymph node dissection. The efficacy index (frequency of metastasis to a particular lymph node station multiplied by the 5-year disease-specific survival rate of patients with metastasis to the station) was calculated for the subcarinal lymph node station, and the prognostic impact of dissecting this station was estimated with reference to the main tumor location. Independent predictive factors for pathological subcarinal lymph node metastasis were analyzed using a proportional hazards model. RESULTS The overall frequency of metastasis to the subcarinal lymph nodes was 7.0 % (2.4, 8.9, and 5.8 % in patients with upper, middle, and lower thoracic ESCC, respectively). The efficacy index for the middle thoracic esophagus was 2.9, and that for the upper and lower thoracic esophagus was 0.0. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly lower in patients with pathological subcarinal lymph node metastasis than those without (23.1 vs. 67.5 %, respectively; log-rank p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, clinical T stage (T2-T4) was the independent predictive factor for pathological subcarinal lymph node metastasis (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS Subcarinal lymph node dissection might have little value in patients with upper and lower thoracic ESCC and could be omitted, especially for superficial carcinoma.","Niwa, Yukiko; Koike, Masahiko; Hattori, Masashi; Iwata, Naoki; Takami, Hideki; Hayashi, Masamichi; Tanaka, Chie; Kobayashi, Daisuke; Kanda, Mitsuro; Yamada, Suguru; Fujii, Tsutomu; Nakayama, Goro; Sugimoto, Hiroyuki; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-015-4819-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26289807/,308

A 12-year-old female spayed Borzoi dog was referred for heart failure. Emergency room thoracic and abdominal ultrasound showed a large volume of pleural effusion with mild peritoneal effusion and an abdominal mass. Pleural fluid analysis classified the effusion as exudative. A complete ultrasound revealed mild peritoneal effusion and decreased blood flow to the right liver lobe. Other causes of bicavitary effusion were ruled out based on blood work, ultrasound, echocardiogram, and computed tomography. The patient was taken to surgery and diagnosed with caudate liver lobe torsion and had a liver lobectomy. At the 2-week postoperative recheck, the patient was doing well and there was complete resolution of the pleural effusion. Liver lobe torsion is a rare occurrence in dogs and can be difficult to diagnose. Clinical signs are nonspecific for liver lobe torsion and patients may present in respiratory distress with significant pleural fluid accumulation. When assessing patients with pleural and peritoneal effusion, liver lobe torsion should be considered as a differential diagnosis.","Khan, Zaheda; Gates, Kathryn; Simpson, Stephen A",Veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/vmrr.s83608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050837/,308

Xenon has additive neuroprotective properties, but is expensive, and its application complicated. Argon gas is cheaper, easier to apply, and also has neuroprotective properties in experimental settings. The aim was to explore the safety of argon ventilation in newborn piglets. METHODS Eight newborn piglets (weight 1.4-3.0 kg) were used. Heart rate, blood pressure, regional cerebral saturation, and electrocortical brain activity were measured continuously. All experiments had a 30 min. baseline period, followed by three 60 min. periods of argon ventilation alternated with 30 min argon washout periods. Two animals were ventilated with increasing concentrations of argon (1h 30%, 1 h 50%, and 1 h 80%), two were subjected to 60 min. hypoxia (FiO2 0.08) before commencing 50% argon ventilation, and two animals received hypothermia following hypoxia as well as 50% argon ventilation. Two animals served as home cage controls and were terminated immediately. RESULTS Argon ventilation did not result in a significant change of heart rate (mean ± s.d. -3.5 ± 3.6 bpm), blood pressure (-0.60 ± 1.11 mmHg), cerebral oxygen saturation (0.3 ± 0.9%), electrocortical brain activity (-0.4 ± 0.7 µV), or blood gas values. Argon ventilation resulted in elevated argon concentrations compared to the home cage controls (34.5, 25.4, and 22.4 vs. 7.3 µl/ml). CONCLUSION Ventilation with up to 80% argon during normoxia, and 50% argon after hypoxia did not affect heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral saturation and electrocortical brain activity. Clinical safety studies of argon ventilation in humans seem justified.","Alderliesten, Thomas; Favie, Laurent M A; Neijzen, Robert W; Auwärter, Volker; Nijboer, Cora H A; Marges, Roland E J; Rademaker, Carin M A; Kempf, Jürgen; van Bel, Frank; Groenendaal, Floris",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460166/,308

91291,"COVID, 2020 and a year of lost research.",2021-03-03,"A major driver of the U.S. opioid crisis is limited access to effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that reduce overdose risks. Traditionally, jails and prisons in the U.S. have not initiated or maintained MOUD for incarcerated individuals with OUD prior to their return to the community, which places them at high risk for fatal overdose. A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone). Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative. The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate. The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release. The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208. We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism; (2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners; (3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls. MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming. MassJCOIN adapted research activities to this new reality in an effort to document and account for the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to each aim. The goal remains to produce findings with direct implications for policy and practice for OUD in criminal justice settings.","Evans, Elizabeth A; Stopka, Thomas J; Pivovarova, Ekaterina; Murphy, Sean M; Taxman, Faye S; Ferguson, Warren J; Bernson, Dana; Santelices, Claudia; McCollister, Kathryn E; Hoskinson, Randall; Lincoln, Thomas; Friedmann, Peter D",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483222/,308

The genomic RNA serves as the template for both translation and negative-strand RNA synthesis. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the genomic RNA contain elements that enhance translation, and the 3'-UTR also contains the elements necessary for the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. Recent studies using a cell-free viral RNA translation-replication system revealed that a 70-nucleotide region containing a part of the 5'-UTR is bound cotranslationally by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replication proteins translated from the genomic RNA and that the binding leads the genomic RNA to RNA replication pathway. This mechanism explains the cis-preferential replication of TMV by the replication proteins. The binding also inhibits further translation to avoid a fatal ribosome-RNA polymerase collision, which might arise if translation and negative-strand synthesis occur simultaneously on a single genomic RNA molecule. Therefore, the 5'- and 3'-UTRs play multiple important roles in the life cycle of tobamovirus.","Chujo, Tetsuya; Ishibashi, Kazuhiro; Miyashita, Shuhei; Ishikawa, Masayuki",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.01.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25683511/,308

OBJECTIVE For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the COVID 19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The organization of healthcare has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of Spinal Tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons and radiation oncologists was formed to analize the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during COVID 19 pandemics. RESULTS Spine Metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture and/or neurological symptoms. Primary Spine Tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, in order to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like enbloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like Chordoma or Chondrosarcomas, if Intensive Care Unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) and Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. When delaying surgery (chemotherapy completed or toxicity), is essential to avoid contact between immune depressed and Covid-19 patients, during the hospital stay for surgery. CONCLUSIONS Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy.

To help guide appropriate mesh selection, the investigators examined the postsurgical experiences of all patients undergoing ventral hernia repair at their facility from 2008 to 2011 with ≥12 months of follow-up. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted. All returns (surgical readmission, office or emergency visit) for complications or recurrences were examined. The impact of demographics (age, gender, and body mass index [BMI]), risk factors (hernia grade, hernia size, concurrent and past bariatric surgery, concurrent and past organ transplantation, any concurrent surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score), and prosthetic type (polypropylene, other synthetic, human acellular dermal matrix, non-cross-linked porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix, other biologic, or none) on the frequency of return was evaluated. RESULTS A total of 564 patients had 12 months of follow-up, and 417 patients had 18 months of follow-up. In a univariate regression analysis, study arm (biologic, synthetic, or primary repair), hernia grade, hernia size, past bariatric surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score were significant predictors of recurrence (P < .05). Multivariate analysis, stepwise regression, and interaction tests identified three variables with significant predictive power: hernia grade, hernia size, and BMI. The adjusted odds ratios vs hernia grade 2 for surgical readmission were 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 5.1) for grade 3 and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 6.4) for grade 4 at 12 months and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.6) for grade 3 and 4.2 (95% CI, 1.7 to 10.0) for grade 4 at 18 months. Large hernia size (adjusted odds ratio vs small size, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and higher BMI (adjusted odds ratio for BMI ≥50 vs 30 to 34.99 kg/m(2), 5.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 26.2) increased the likelihood of surgical readmission within 12 months. CONCLUSIONS The present data support the hypothesis that careful matching of patient characteristics to choice of prosthetic will minimize complications, readmissions, and the number of postoperative office visits.","Le, Dinh; Deveney, Clifford W; Reaven, Nancy L; Funk, Susan E; McGaughey, Karen J; Martindale, Robert G",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.01.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23592170/,308
93994,Levél a szerkesztőséghez.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES To investigate whether quantitative textural features, extracted from pretreatment MRI, can predict sustained complete response to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS In this IRB-approved study, patients were selected from a maintained six-year database of consecutive patients who underwent both pretreatment MRI imaging with a probable or definitive imaging diagnosis of HCC (LI-RADS 4 or 5) and loco-regional treatment with RFA. An experienced radiologist manually segmented the hepatic nodules in MRI arterial and equilibrium phases to obtain the volume of interest (VOI) for extraction of 107 quantitative textural features, including shape and first- and second-order features. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between textural features and complete response. RESULTS The study consisted of 34 patients with 51 treated hepatic nodules. Sustained complete response was achieved by 6 patients (4 with single nodule and 2 with multiple nodules). Of the 107 features from the arterial and equilibrium phases, 20 (18%) and 25 (23%) achieved AUC >0.7, respectively. The three best performing features were found in the equilibrium phase: Dependence Non-Uniformity Normalized and Dependence Variance (both GLDM class, with AUC of 0.78 and 0.76, respectively) and Maximum Probability (GLCM class, AUC of 0.76). CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrates that a radiomic analysis of pre-treatment MRI might be useful in identifying patients with HCC who are most likely to have a sustained complete response to RFA. Second-order features (GLDM and GLCM) extracted from equilibrium phase obtained highest discriminatory performance.","Horvat, Natally; Araujo-Filho, Jose de Arimateia B; Assuncao-Jr, Antonildes N; Machado, Felipe Augusto de M; Sims, John A; Rocha, Camila Carlos Tavares; Oliveira, Brunna Clemente; Horvat, Joao Vicente; Maccali, Claudia; Puga, Anna Luísa Boschiroli Lamanna; Chagas, Aline Lopes; Menezes, Marcos Roberto; Cerri, Giovanni Guido",Clinics,https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2021/e2888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287480/,308

94433,Why schools probably aren't COVID hotspots.,2020-10-29,"Until recently, human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as HCoV strain OC43 (HCoV-OC43), were mainly known to cause 15 to 30% of mild upper respiratory tract infections. In recent years, the identification of new HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, revealed that HCoVs can be highly pathogenic and can cause more severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. To date, no specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat HCoV infections are available. We demonstrate that chloroquine, a widely used drug with well-known antimalarial effects, inhibits HCoV-OC43 replication in HRT-18 cells, with a 50% effective concentration (+/- standard deviation) of 0.306 +/- 0.0091 microM and a 50% cytotoxic concentration (+/- standard deviation) of 419 +/- 192.5 microM, resulting in a selectivity index of 1,369. Further, we investigated whether chloroquine could prevent HCoV-OC43-induced death in newborn mice. Our results show that a lethal HCoV-OC43 infection in newborn C57BL/6 mice can be treated with chloroquine acquired transplacentally or via maternal milk. The highest survival rate (98.6%) of the pups was found when mother mice were treated daily with a concentration of 15 mg of chloroquine per kg of body weight. Survival rates declined in a dose-dependent manner, with 88% survival when treated with 5 mg/kg chloroquine and 13% survival when treated with 1 mg/kg chloroquine. Our results show that chloroquine can be highly effective against HCoV-OC43 infection in newborn mice and may be considered as a future drug against HCoVs.","Keyaerts, Els; Li, Sandra; Vijgen, Leen; Rysman, Evelien; Verbeeck, Jannick; Van Ranst, Marc; Maes, Piet",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01509-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506054/,308
94893,"Supplementation of sodium butyrate to postweaned heifer diets: Effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and health.",2019,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related death despite being highly preventable. Efforts to increase participation in CRC screening have not met national goals. We developed a novel approach: building a business case for philanthropic investment in CRC screening. METHODS A taskforce representing the public health community, professional societies, charitable foundations, academia, and industry was assembled to: (a) quantify the impact of improving CRC screening rates; (b) identify barriers to screening; (c) estimate the ""activation cost"" to overcome barriers and screen one additional person; (d) develop a holistic business case that is attractive to philanthropists; and (e) launch a demonstration project. RESULTS We estimated that of 50 600 CRC deaths annually in the US, 55% occur in 50- to 85-year-olds and are potentially addressable by improvements in CRC screening. Barriers to screening were identified in all patient journey phases, including lack of awareness or insurance and logistical challenges in the pre-physician phase. The cost to activate one person to undergo screening was $25-175. This translated into a cost of $6000-36 000 per CRC death averted by philanthropic investment. Based on this work, the Colorectal Cancer Alliance launched the effort ""March Forth"" to prevent 100 000 CRC deaths in the US over 10 years, with the first pilot in Philadelphia. CONCLUSIONS A holistic business plan can attract philanthropy to promote CRC screening. A simple message of ""You can save a life from CRC with a $25 000 donation"" can motivate demonstration projects in regions with high CRC rates and low screening participation.","Carmeli, Ariel; Dranikoff, Lee; Kundu, Arnab; Ladabaum, Uri",Cancer medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.2745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31808317/,308

In this personal view article, executive members of the University of Toronto medical student government and Faculty leads of pre-clerkship and clerkship education highlight five practical ways in which a student-Faculty partnership enabled the rapid and smooth adaptation of curricula during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included involving students as partners in decision making to contribute learner perspectives early, agile and collaborative meeting structures, frequent and consistent communication with the student body, providing learners with Faculty perspectives from the frontlines, and striking a balance in the level of feedback collected from students.

94954,Coronavirus: time to re-imagine academic publishing.,2020-08-01,"Hospital managers have to manage resources effectively, while maintaining a high quality of care. For hospitals where admissions from the emergency department to the wards represent a large proportion of admissions, the ability to forecast these admissions and the resultant ward occupancy is especially useful for resource planning purposes. Since emergency admissions often compete with planned elective admissions, modeling emergency demand may result in improved elective planning as well. We compare several models for forecasting daily emergency inpatient admissions and occupancy. The models are applied to three years of daily data. By measuring their mean square error in a cross-validation framework, we find that emergency admissions are largely random, and hence, unpredictable, whereas emergency occupancy can be forecasted using a model combining regression and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, or a seasonal ARIMA model, for up to one week ahead. Faced with variable admissions and occupancy, hospitals must prepare a reserve capacity of beds and staff. Our approach allows estimation of the required reserve capacity.","Abraham, Gad; Byrnes, Graham B; Bain, Christopher A",IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/titb.2009.2014565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19244023/,308

95801,Ensuring vaccine safety.,2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND Obesity has been steadily increasing in the United States. The effect of body mass index (BMI) on surgical outcomes in pancreatic surgery is still controversial. Currently, there is no report related to obesity and robotic pancreatic surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of BMI on the surgical outcomes of both nonobese and obese patients undergoing robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy (RADP). METHODS A prospectively collected database for RADP was retrieved for analysis. Patients were categorized as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)) and nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). Demographics, perioperative data, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, diagnosis, conversion rate, morbidity, surgical mortality, pancreatic fistula rate, and length of stay were compared. RESULTS A total for 85 RADP were included, with 57 (67%) in the nonobese group and 28 (33%) in the obese group. No differences were found between nonobese and obese patients regarding demographic, preoperative risk, and perioperative parameters and mortality. There was a trend in the obese group associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications, but it was statistically insignificant. Clinically significant pancreatic fistula (grade B) occurred in 28.5% of obese patients and in 7% of nonobese patients, but without statistical significance (P = .064). CONCLUSIONS Obesity does not have a significant impact on the perioperative outcomes and surgical risks for patients undergoing RADP, but high BMI may be a predictor for pancreatic fistula after RADP.","Wang, Shin-E; Daskalaki, Despoina; Masrur, Mario A; Patton, Kristin; Bianco, Franceso M; Giulianotti, Pier C",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

METHODS Two RBCs (Venus and Venus Pearl; Kulzer) that use different monomer and photo-initiator systems, but have a similar filler volume and shade, were exposed to either just blue light, or violet and blue light from two different LCUs (Translux Wave and Translux 2Wave; Kulzer). Distance and exposure times were adjusted so that both LCUs delivered 5 similar levels of radiant exposures (RE) between 1.5 J/cm² to 25 J/cm² in the blue wavelength range. Thus, the violet light was additional light. The top and bottom of 2-mm thick specimens were subjected to a depth-sensing indentation test (Martens hardness/HM, Vickers hardness/HV, indentation modulus/YHU, mechanical work/Wtotal, plastic deformation work/Wplas, creep/Cr) was performed at. The viability of human gingival fibroblasts was assessed after three days of exposure to RBC eluates. One and multiple-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests (α = 0.05), t-test and a Spearman correlation analysis were used. RESULTS As the RE increased, the mechanical properties increased at a greater rate at the top compared to the bottom of the RBCs. Values measured at the bottom of 2-mm increments approached the values measured at the top only when RE > 25 J/cm² of blue light was delivered. Toxicity decreased with RE and elution cycles and was lower for Venus Pearl. Within one RE level, addition of violet light resulted in significantly improved properties (in 131 out of 150 comparisons, p < 0.05). This effect was stronger for Venus Pearl. There was a good correlation between mechanical and biological parameters. This correlation decreased as the number of eluates increased. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The mechanical and biological response to variation in RE is interrelated. The addition of violet light has a positive effect, particularly at low RE.","Ilie, Nicoleta; Schmalz, Gottfried; Fujioka-Kobayashi, Masako; Lussi, Adrian; Price, Richard Bengt",Journal of dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385531/,308
96487,Research Highlights.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Surgical resection after embolization is the most accepted approach to treating arteriovenous malformations. The authors analyzed the outcome of surgically treated patients and how surgical resection was influenced by multiple embolizations. METHODS Thirty-one patients were included from January of 2000 to December of 2012. The mean patient age was 24.9 years. Anatomical involvement, definition of limits, functional impairment, number of embolizations, type of resection, reconstruction method, blood transfusion, and hospital stay were evaluated. Morbidity, mortality, and regrowth rates and need for additional procedures were evaluated. RESULTS Lesions were preferentially located at the orbits, cheeks, and lips. The number of embolizations per patient increased with lesion complexity. In 22 cases, total excision was accomplished, and in nine, subtotal resections were performed to favor function. After multiple embolizations, better lesion identification was observed. Primary closure was performed in 20 cases, local flaps were performed in seven cases, axial flaps were performed in two patients, and free flaps were performed in two cases. There were no deaths. Regrowth rates were influenced by limits between arteriovenous malformations and surrounding tissues (15.8 percent of cases with precise limits versus 58.3 percent of lesions with imprecise limits; p = 0.021) and by type of resection (18.2 percent of cases after total resection versus 66.7 percent after subtotal resections; p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS Multiple therapeutic embolizations seem to increase safety in the treatment of arteriovenous vascular malformations and suggest an additional positive effect besides bleeding control. Preoperative definition of limits and establishment of conditions for total resection are critical to determine management and risk of regrowth.

96591,From the Editor's Desk.,2012,"BACKGROUND Alvimopan is used in abdominal surgery to reduce postoperative ileus in patients undergoing small bowel resections with primary anastomosis. The role and efficacy of alvimopan in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is not well understood. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of alvimopan in the context of enhanced recovery pathways compared to enhanced recovery pathways alone for perioperative bowel dysfunction in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. SEARCH METHODS The terms alvimopan and cystectomy were used to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We also reviewed abstracts from the past four years (2013 to 2016) of the American Urologic Association, Society of Urologic Oncology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomized controlled trials that compared alvimopan to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS This study was based on a published protocol. We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases including CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and Biosis, which we last updated on 6 February 2017. We also searched abstract proceedings for major relevant meetings (2013 to 2016), databases of the grey literature, trial registries, citations of relevant reviews and contacted clinical experts and the drug manufacturer.Two independent reviewers screened the literature in two stages (title and abstract, full-text) using Covidence software. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias on a 'per outcome' basis using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias; tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. Results of the single eligible trial were reported in a 'Summary of findings' table based on an intention-to-treat analysis. MAIN RESULTS Based on a single trial and moderate-quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the time to reach a composite endpoint of tolerance of solid food and documented bowel movements (hazard ratio (HR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 2.23). This represents 165 more patients (109 more to 207 more) per 1000 meeting this endpoint within 10 days of surgery. Based on moderate-quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the time to hospital discharge (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.01). This represents 138 more patients (82 more to 198 more) per 1000 being discharged within 10 days of surgery. Also based on moderate-quality evidence, alvimopan was associated with a reduced risk of major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44) representing 355 fewer patients (404 fewer to 276 fewer) with major adverse events per 1000. We downgraded this outcome for indirectness as it included adverse events that we did not consider major.In terms of secondary outcomes, alvimopan did not appear to alter the rate of readmission (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33), change the rate of any cardiovascular event (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.05) or alter the mean narcotic pain medication use (mean difference 0, 95% CI 14.08 fewer to 14.08 more morphine equivalents). The quality of evidence was moderate for all three outcomes. Based on high-quality evidence, alvimopan reduced the rate of nasogastric tube replacement (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59). We did not find evidence for the drug's impact on rates of parenteral nutrition. All outcomes were short term and limited to a 30-day time horizon.Based on the existence of only one trial, we were unable to perform any subgroup or sensitivity analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion, the use of alvimopan administered as part of an enhanced recovery pathway for a limited duration (up to 15 doses for up to seven days) probably reduces the time to tolerance of solid food, time to hospital discharge and rates of major adverse events. Readmission rates, rates of cardiovascular events and narcotic pain requirements are probably similar. The need for reinsertion of nasogastric tubes is reduced. We found no evidence for the impact on rates of parenteral nutrition within 30 postoperative days.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Coles, Bernadette; Dahm, Philipp",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012111.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28462518/,308
96852,Advances in Mimivirus pathogenicity.,2010,"BACKGROUND Primary repair of large hiatal hernia is associated with a high recurrence rate. The use of mesh may reduce this recurrence rate. The indication for mesh use, the type of mesh to use, and the placement technique are controversial. A survey of surgeon practice was undertaken to obtain a better understanding of the controversies surrounding this clinical problem. METHODS A questionnaire on the technique and results of mesh hiatal herniorrhaphy was sent to 1,192 members of the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). RESULTS There were 275 responses; 261 of these were analyzed. A total of 5,486 hiatal hernia repairs with mesh were reported; 77% and 23% were performed laparoscopically vs open, respectively. The most common indication for mesh usage was an increased size hiatal defect (46% of respondents). The most common mesh types were biomaterial (28%), polytetrafluoroethylene (25%), and polypropylene (21%). Suture anchorage was the most common fixation technique (56% of respondents). The findings showed a failure rate of 3%, a stricture rate of 0.2%, and an erosion rate of 0.3%. Biomaterial tended to be associated with failure, whereas nonabsorbable mesh tended to be associated with stricture and erosion. CONCLUSIONS The use of mesh during hiatal hernia repair resulted in a reported recurrence rate which appeared to be lower than that obtained historically without mesh. No one mesh type was clearly superior in terms of avoiding failure and complication.","Frantzides, Constantine T; Carlson, Mark A; Loizides, Sofronis; Papafili, Anastasia; Luu, Mihn; Roberts, Jacob; Zeni, Tallal; Frantzides, Alexander",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0718-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19997755/,308

A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and 74 years of age from the general population of Hamburg, Germany, are taking part in an extensive baseline assessment at one dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system function and structures including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits, physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional life, psychosocial context and burden, quality of life, digital media use, occupational, medical and family history as well as healthcare utilization. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence and incidence, and to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging, biomarker, psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia are invited for a visit to conduct an additional MRI examination of either heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and surveys as well as related individual routine data from involved health and pension insurances.

Aiming to design novel compounds with improved biological properties, we describe herein the first class of fully characterized (99m)Tc(CO)₃-mannosylated dextran derivatives with adequate features for SLND. Dextran derivatives, containing the same number of pendant mannose units (13) and a variable number (n) of tridentate chelators (9, n = 1; 10, n = 4, 11, n= 12), have been synthesized and fully characterized. Radiolabeled polymers of the type fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)₃(k³-L)] (12, L = 9, 13, L = 10, 14, L = 11) have been obtained quantitatively in high radiochemical purity (≥ 98%) upon reaction of the dextran derivatives with fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)₃(H₂O)₃]+. The highly stable compounds 13 and 14 were identified by comparing their HPLC chromatograms with the ones obtained for the corresponding rhenium surrogates fac-[Re(CO)₃(k³-10)] (13a) and fac-[Re(CO)₃(k³-11)] (14a), which have been characterized both at the chemical (NMR and IR spectroscopy, and HPLC) and physical level (DLS, AFM and LDV). Compounds 13a and 14a present a positive zeta potential (+ 7.1 mV, pH 7.4) and a hydrodynamic diameter in the range 8.4-8.7 nm.

Humic acid urea (HAU) and polyaspartic acid urea (PAU) are two similar synergistic nitrogen fertilizers. METHODS Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance (13 CNMR) were used to determine the loading of urea-N into the humic acid (HA) and polyaspartic acid (PA). Thermal stability and physical adsorption properties of HAU and PAU were assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface measurement. The soil incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of HAU and PAU on nitrogen transformation and gaseous nitrogen loss compared with commercial urea. RESULTS Nitrogen transformation from FAU and PAU was slowed down compared with urea. After 90 days of incubation, HAU and PAU reduced the cumulative NH3 volatilization (by 9.70% and 6.30%, respectively) and N2 O emission (by 40.48% and 43.00%, respectively) from soil compared with the urea-alone treatment. CONCLUSION HAU and PAU could improve the nitrogen use efficiency. This article is protected by copyright.

99543,High-speed harvesting of random numbers.,2021-02-26,"The outbreak of the toxic capsule crisis during April 2012 aroused widespread public concern about the risk of chromium-contaminated capsules and drug safety in China. In this article, we develop a conceptual model to investigate risk perceptions of the pharmaceutical drug capsules and behavioral responses to the toxic capsule crisis and the relationship between associated factors and these two variables. An online survey was conducted to test the model, including questions on the measures of perceived efficacy of the countermeasures, trust in the State FDA (Food and Drug Administration), trust in the pharmaceutical companies, trust in the pharmaceutical capsule producers, risk perception, concern, need for information, information seeking, and risk avoidance. In general, participants reported higher levels of risk perception, concern, and risk avoidance, and lower levels of trust in the three different stakeholders. The results from the structural equation modeling procedure suggest that perceived efficacy of the countermeasures is a predictor of each of the three trust variables; however, only trust in the State FDA has a dampening impact on risk perception. Both risk perception and information seeking are significant determinants of risk avoidance. Risk perception is also positively related to concern. Information seeking is positively related to both concern and need for information. The theoretical and policy implications are also discussed.","Feng, Tianjun; Keller, L Robin; Wu, Ping; Xu, Yifan",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23859541/,308

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9,687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery.","Holingue, Calliope; Badillo-Goicoechea, Elena; Riehm, Kira E; Veldhuis, Cindy; Thrul, Johannes; Johnson, Renee M; Fallin, M Daniele; Kreuter, Frauke; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Kalb, Luther G",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758507/,308

However, the association between the length of red cell unit storage and postoperative delirium has not been explored. We hypothesized that the length of storage of transfused red cell units would be associated with delirium after cardiac surgery. METHODS We conducted a case-control study in which patients undergoing coronary artery bypass, valve, or ascending aorta surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at Johns Hopkins from 2005 to 2011 were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they did not receive red cell units, received >4 red cell units during hospitalization, received any transfusion after the first postoperative day, or received red cell units that were not exclusively stored for ≤14 days or >14 days. Eighty-seven patients met transfusion-related inclusion criteria and developed postoperative delirium. Controls who did not develop delirium were selected from the same source population of eligible patients and were matched 1:1 based on age (± 5 years), 2- to 2.5-year band of date of surgery, and surgical procedure. For each patient, we calculated the average storage duration of all transfused red cell units. The primary outcome was odds of delirium in patients who were transfused red cell units with exclusive storage duration >14 days compared with that of ≤14 days. Secondary outcomes were odds of delirium with each increasing day of average red cell unit storage duration. We used conditional multivariable regression to test our hypotheses. RESULTS In conditional multivariable analysis of 87 case-control pairs, there was no difference in the odds of patients developing delirium if they were transfused red cell units with an exclusive storage age >14 days compared with that ≤14 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-4.58, P = 0.20). Each additional day of average red cell unit storage beyond 14 days was associated with a 1.01- to 1.13-fold increase in the odds of postoperative delirium (OR, 1.07; P = 0.03). Each additional day of average storage beyond 21 days was associated with a 1.02- to 1.23-fold increase in the odds of postoperative delirium (OR, 1.12; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Transfusion of red cell units that have been stored for >14 days is not associated with increased odds of delirium. However, each additional day of storage >14 or 21 days may be associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. More research is needed to further characterize the association between delirium and storage duration of transfused red cell units.","Brown, Charles H; Grega, Maura; Selnes, Ola A; McKhann, Guy M; Shah, Ashish S; LaFlam, Andrew; Savage, William J; Frank, Steven M; Hogue, Charles W; Gottesman, Rebecca F",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859077/,308

METHODS In a 1-year period, 461 MS patients (261 women; mean age 45.4 years, range 21-79) with CCSVI underwent endovascular treatment of 1012 venous lesions during 495 procedures [34 (6.9%) reinterventions]. While balloon angioplasty was preferred, 98 stents were implanted in 76 patients for lesion recoil, restenosis, or suboptimal dilation. The procedures were analyzed for incidences of major adverse events (death, major bleeding, or clinical deterioration of MS), access site complications, procedure-related complications, and procedural safety-related variables (fluoroscopy and contrast times). The complication rates were compared to published data for similar endovascular methods. RESULTS There were no deaths, major bleeding events, or clinical deterioration of MS. Access site complications included limited groin hematoma (5, 1.0%); there were no arteriovenous fistulas or puncture site infections. Systemic complications included only rare cardiac arrhythmias (6, 1.2%). Procedure-related complications included vein rupture (2, 0.4%), vein dissection (15, 3.0%), acute in-stent/in-segment thrombosis (8, 1.6%), and acute recoil (1, 0.2%); there was no stent migration or fracture or distal embolization. Mean fluoroscopy time was 22.7 minutes, and mean contrast volume was 136.3 mL. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI. Innovations such as purpose-specific materials and devices are needed, as are case-controlled and randomized data to establish efficacy in ameliorating MS symptoms.","Petrov, Ivo; Grozdinski, Lachezar; Kaninski, Genadi; Iliev, Nikolai; Iloska, Marjana; Radev, Angel",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/11-3440.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21679067/,308

OBJECTIVES This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the scientific summary of initial Fio2 in preterm newborns (<35 weeks' gestation) who receive respiratory support at birth. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched between January 1, 1980 and August 10, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers in 2 stages with a Cohen's κ of 0.8 and 1.0. DATA EXTRACTION Pairs of independent reviewers extracted data, appraised the risk of bias (RoB), and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty. RESULTS Ten randomized controlled studies and 4 cohort studies included 5697 patients. There are no statistically significant benefits of or harms from starting with lower compared with higher Fio2 in short-term mortality (n = 968; risk ratio = 0.83 [95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.37]), long-term mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, or other key preterm morbidities. A sensitivity analysis in which 1 study with a high RoB was excluded failed to reveal a reduction in mortality with initial low Fio2 (n = 681; risk ratio = 0.63 [95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.03]). LIMITATIONS The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes due to RoB, inconsistency, and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS The ideal initial Fio2 for preterm newborns is still unknown, although the majority of newborns ≤32 weeks' gestation will require oxygen supplementation.","Welsford, Michelle; Nishiyama, Chika; Shortt, Colleen; Weiner, Gary; Roehr, Charles Christoph; Isayama, Tetsuya; Dawson, Jennifer Anne; Wyckoff, Myra H; Rabi, Yacov",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018-1828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578326/,308
101866,How to stop restaurants from driving COVID infections.,2020-11-10,"Alcohol addiction is a leading risk factor for personal death and disability. In 2016, alcohol use caused 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.3% in female and 8.9% in male. Individuals with alcohol use disorder are at high risk of anxiety, depression, impaired cognition performance, and illicit drug use and are comorbid with liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which is a major cause of personal death and disability worldwide. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing, as well as medical treatments, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, and nalmefene, are used for the treatment of alcohol addiction in Europe and the United States. However, the effect of current interventions is limited, and the need for additional interventions is substantial. Alcohol use impairs the intestinal barrier and causes changes to the intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition. Emerging studies have tried to reveal the role of the gut-brain axis among individuals with alcohol use disorder with or without alcohol liver disease. Bacterial products penetrate the impaired intestinal barrier and cause central inflammation; changes to the gut microbiota impair enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; alcohol abuse causes shortage of vital nutrients such as thiamine. Several studies have suggested that probiotics, through either oral administration or fecal microbiota transplantation, increased intestinal levels of potentially beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, improving the levels of liver-associated enzymes in patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrating beneficial psychotropic effects on anxiety and depression. In addition to medications for alcohol addiction, gene editing therapy such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) may be another potential research target. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are associated with ADH and ALDH genes, are major enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, and gene editing approaches may have the potential to directly modify specific genes to treat alcoholism caused by genetic defects. Further research is needed to study the effect of the combined treatment for alcohol addiction.","Wang, Shao-Cheng; Chen, Yuan-Chuan; Chen, Shaw-Ji; Lee, Chun-Hung; Cheng, Ching-Ming",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899236/,308

However, autopsy poses biosafety risks to workers within and outside the laboratory. The highest rates of laboratory acquired infections occur in autopsy workers. OBJECTIVE To design and construct an appropriately biosafe autopsy laboratory. DESIGN We conducted a biosafety risk assessment for autopsy workers using the process developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health and applied these findings as the basis of laboratory design and construction. RESULTS Autopsy workers are unpredictably exposed to a variety of infectious organisms including hepatitis C virus, HIV and M. tuberculosis. Hazardous autopsy procedures include using and encountering sharp objects, and the generation of aerosols from dissection, fluid aspiration, rinsing tissues, and dividing bone with an oscillating saw. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to bloodborne and airborne pathogens from procedures that can cause cutaneous inoculation and inhalation of aerosols indicates that human autopsies should be performed at Biosafety Level 3. We designed a large entirely Biosafety Level 3 medical examiner autopsy laboratory using design principles and characteristics that can be scaled to accommodate smaller academic or other hospital-based autopsy spaces. Containment was achieved through a concentric ring design, with access control at interface zones. As new autopsy laboratories are planned, we strongly recommend that they be designed to function uniformly at Biosafety Level 3.","Nolte, Kurt B; Muller, Timothy B; Denmark, Adam M; Burstein, Ron; Villalobos, Yvonne A",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0644-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307551/,308

OBJECTIVES To determine short- and medium-term biological variation, index of individuality (II), and reference change values for serum IS, pCS, and TMAO concentrations in healthy adult cats. To determine the effect of feeding on serum concentrations. ANIMALS Twelve healthy adult cats. METHODS Prospective, cohort study. Seven serum samples over a 12-hour period (short-term) and 5 serum samples over a 19-day period (medium-term) were collected. Serum concentrations of total IS, pCS, and TMAO were measured every 2 hours in a 12-hour period (hours 0-12) after a meal in 9 cats and compared to concentrations in a nonfed state. RESULTS For IS, the II was high using short-term (1.96) and low using medium-term (0.65) biological variation estimates. Individuality was intermediate for pCS (short-term, 0.98; medium-term, 1.17) and TMAO (short-term, 1.47; medium-term, 0.83). Serum IS, pCS, and TMAO concentrations were significantly lower in a fed state compared to a nonfed state at hours 4, 6, 8, and 12; at hours 4 and 6; and at hours 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, respectively. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Population-based reference intervals with reference to the subject-based interval can be used to monitor serum pCS and TMAO concentrations. For IS, a subject-based and a population-based reference interval is best for short-term and medium-term monitoring, respectively. To compare serial measurements, it would be prudent to collect samples at the same time of day and consistently in either a fed or nonfed state.","Summers, Stacie; Quimby, Jessica; Yao, Linxing; Hess, Ann; Broeckling, Corey; Lappin, Michael",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.16043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537991/,308

Mucositis may lead to dose reductions and unplanned interruptions of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (RT) and often affects patients' quality of life. Aim The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of the ayurvedic preparation in decreasing the severity of mucositis in head-and-neck cancer patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized study, the patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 patients received conventional mucositis treatment, whereas Group 2 patients received ayurvedic preparation Yashtimadhu in addition to conventional treatment. Group 3 patients received honey for local application in oral cavity as well as one tea spoon of honey twice daily orally in addition to routine conventional treatment. All the patients were assessed for mucositis at the end of every week during the RT for a period of 6 weeks. Results A significant difference was observed between the groups at each time point. Nearly 42.85% of patients in conventional treatment arm developed Grade 3 mucositis, 20% of patients developed Grade 3 mucositis in group where honey was given, and only 15.5% of patients developed Grade 3 mucositis in Yastimadhu group. Unplanned treatment breaks and hospitalization of patients were reduced with the use of yashtimadhu as compared to other two groups. Conclusion Yashtimadhu was observed to be effective and delayed the development of severe form of mucositis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 225 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to the North Hospital of First Hospital in Changsha, China, from 9th February 2020 to 7th March 2020 were enrolled. Their general data, laboratory test results and levels of SAA, CRP and FERR were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS Age was an important risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in the patients. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in the levels of total protein, albumin, ALT and AST in liver function, UA in renal function, myocardial enzyme CK-MB and LDH, and immunoglobulin IgG and IgM. The levels of SAA, CRP, and FERR were significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19. ROC curve analysis results showed that the AUC, from small to large, was as follows: SAA+CRP+FERR, CRP + FERR, SAA + CRP, SAA + FERR, SAA, FERR, and CRP, which indicated the benefit of the combination of the three indicators. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of the three indicators were higher than those of the detection of any single indicator or two combined indicators. A Spearman correlation analysis of the data showed that the initial CRP/SAA, SAA/FERR, and CRP/FERR were positively correlated. The continuous results of SAA, CRP and FERR throughout the study period showed that the values of the severe group on a given day were higher than those of the non-severe group; the values of the two groups peaked on the 5th or 7th day and then decreased, and the decreasing trend of the severe group was more evident. CONCLUSIONS SAA, CRP and FERR are sensitive serological indicators used to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. The combined detection of serum SAA, FERR, and CRP, which are positively related to COVID-19 infection, offers guiding significance for the occurrence of COVID-19 infection and the severity of the disease. Such detection provides effective detection indicators for the progress and prognosis of COVID-19; these indicators will enable effective intervention measures to be implemented in time and the rates of severe illness and mortality to be reduced.","Liu, S-L; Wang, S-Y; Sun, Y-F; Jia, Q-Y; Yang, C-L; Cai, P-J; Li, J-Y; Wang, L; Chen, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202011_23631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215460/,308

Heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) facilitate humidification and filtering of inspired air. The Shikani HME (S-HME) is a novel turbulent airflow HME that may be used in-line with the Shikani Speaking Valve (SSV), allowing for uniquely preserved phonation during humidification. The aims of this study were to (a) compare the airflow resistance (R airflow) and humidification efficiency of the S-HME and the Mallinckrodt Tracheolife II tracheostomy HME (M-HME) when dry (time zero) and wet (after 24 hr) and (b) determine if in-line application of the S-HME with a tracheostomy speaking valve significantly increases R airflow over a tracheostomy speaking valve alone (whether SSV or Passy Muir Valve [PMV]). Method A prospective observational ex vivo study was conducted using a pneumotachometer lung simulation unit to measure airflow (Q) amplitude and R airflow, as indicated by a pressure drop (P Drop) across the device (S-HME, M-HME, SSV + S-HME, and PMV). Additionally, P Drop was studied for the S-HME and M-HME when dry at time zero (T0) and after 24 hr of moisture testing (T24) at Q of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 L/s. Results R airflow was significantly less for the S-HME than M-HME (T0 and T24). R airflow of the SSV + S-HME in series did not significant increase R airflow over the SSV or PMV alone. Moisture loss efficiency trended toward greater efficiency for the S-HME; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions The turbulent flow S-HME provides heat and moisture exchange with similar or greater efficacy than the widely used laminar airflow M-HME, but with significantly lower resistance. The S-HME also allows the innovative advantage of in-line use with the SSV, hence allowing concurrent humidification and phonation during application, without having to manipulate either device.","Shikani, Alan H; Elamin, Elamin M; Miller, Andrew C","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_jslhr-19-00107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810415/,308

This paper reports on the influence of tumor presence on the in vivo circulation time and biodistribution of polybutadiene-polyethylene oxide (PBd-PEO) polymersomes. For this purpose, polymersomes were loaded with the gamma-emitter 111In and administered intravenously, followed by timed ex vivo biodistribution. A large reduction in circulation time was observed for tumor-bearing mice, with a circulation half-life of merely 5 min (R2 = 0.98) vs 117 min (R2 = 0.95) in healthy mice. To determine whether the rapid polymersome clearance observed in tumor-bearing mice was mediated by macrophages, chlodronate liposomes were administered to both healthy and tumor-bearing mice prior to the intravenous injection of radiolabeled polymersomes to deplete their macrophages. Pretreatment with chlodronate liposomes depleted macrophages in the spleen and liver and restored the circulation time of the polymersomes with no significant difference in circulation time between healthy mice and tumor-bearing mice pretreated with clodronate liposomes (15.2 ± 1.2% ID/g and 13.6 ± 2.7% ID/g, respectively, at 4 h p.i. with p = 0.3). This indicates that activation of macrophages due to tumor presence indeed affected polymersome clearance rate. Thus, next to particle design, the presence of a tumor can also greatly impact circulation times and should be taken into account when designing studies to evaluate the distribution of polymersomes.","de Kruijff, Robin M; Raavé, René; Kip, Annemarie; Molkenboer-Kuenen, Janneke; Roobol, Stefan J; Essers, Jeroen; Heskamp, Sandra; Denkova, Antonia G",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics11050241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137479/,308

However, the significance of rSO2 in PCAS patients remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between rSO2 and physiological parameters. Comatose survivors of out-of-hospital PCAS with targeted temperature management (TTM) at 34°C for 24 hours were included. All patients were monitored for their rSO2 and additional parameters (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2], hemoglobin [Hb], mean arterial pressure [MAP], arterial carbon dioxide pressure [PaCO2], and body temperature]) measured at the start of monitoring and 24 and 48 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Patients were divided into favorable and unfavorable groups, and the correlation between rSO2 and these physiological parameters was evaluated by multiple regression analysis. Forty-nine patients were included in the study, with 15 in the favorable group and 34 in the unfavorable group. There was no significant difference in the rSO2 value between the two groups at any time point. The multiple regression analysis of the favorable group revealed a moderate correlation between rSO2 and SaO2, Hb, and PaCO2 only at 24 hours (coefficients: 0.482, 0.422, and 0.531, respectively), whereas that of the unfavorable group revealed moderate correlations between rSO2 and Hb values at all time points, PaCO2 at 24 hours and MAP at 24 and 48 hours. rSO2 was moderately correlated to MAP in unfavorable patients. To optimize brain oxygen metabolic balance for PCAS patients with TTM measuring rSO2, we suggest total evaluation of each parameters of SaO2, Hb, MAP, and PaCO2.","Sakurai, Atsushi; Ihara, Shingo; Tagami, Rumi; Yamaguchi, Junko; Sugita, Atsunori; Kuwana, Tsukasa; Sawada, Nami; Hori, Satoshi; Taniguch, Tetsuya; Kinoshita, Kosaku",Therapeutic hypothermia and temperature management,https://doi.org/10.1089/ther.2019.0032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31825272/,308
109057,Universal Error Bound for Constrained Quantum Dynamics.,2020-05-29,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is capable of inducing a storm of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) accessory protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3)-mediated ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). SARS-CoV and its ORF3a protein were found to be potent activators of pro-IL-1β gene transcription and protein maturation, the 2 signals required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ORF3a induced pro-IL-1β transcription through activation of NF-κB, which was mediated by TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination and processing of p105. ORF3a-induced elevation of IL-1β secretion was independent of its ion channel activity or absent in melanoma 2 but required NLRP3, ASC, and TRAF3. ORF3a interacted with TRAF3 and ASC, colocalized with them in discrete punctate structures in the cytoplasm, and facilitated ASC speck formation. TRAF3-dependent K63-linked ubiquitination of ASC was more pronounced in SARS-CoV-infected cells or when ORF3a was expressed. Taken together, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV ORF3a protein activates NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination of p105 and ASC.-Siu, K.-L., Yuen, K.-S., Castaño-Rodriguez, C., Ye, Z.-W., Yeung, M.-L., Fung, S.-Y., Yuan, S., Chan, C.-P., Yuen, K.-Y., Enjuanes, L., Jin, D.-Y.

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 85 cats with tumors affecting the spinal cord. PROCEDURES Medical records of cats with histologically confirmed primary or metastatic tumors of the spinal cord or tumors causing spinal cord disease by local extension from adjacent tissues examined between 1980 and 2005 were reviewed. Data on signalment; clinical history; results of neurologic examination, diagnostic imaging, and clinical pathologic evaluation; and location of tumor within the spinal cord were obtained from medical records and analyzed by use of logistic regression models. RESULTS Lymphosarcoma was the most common tumor and affected the spinal cord in 33 (38.8%) cats, followed by osteosarcoma in 14 (16.5%) cats. Cats with lymphosarcoma were typically younger at initial examination, had a shorter duration of clinical signs, and had lesions in more regions of the CNS than did cats with other types of tumors. In 22 of 26 (84.6%) cats with lymphosarcoma, the tumor was also found in extraneural sites. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Data for spinal cord tumors in this population of cats were analyzed by logistic regression analysis, which effectively distinguished cats with lymphosarcoma from cats with other types of tumors. Additional clinical information reported here will help to increase the index of suspicion or definitive antemortem diagnosis of spinal cord tumors of cats.","Marioni-Henry, Katia; Van Winkle, Thomas J; Smith, Sionagh H; Vite, Charles H",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.232.2.237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18275391/,308

Chemotherapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment, but recent advances have demonstrated the benefit of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to chemotherapy regimens for patients with both early and advanced TNBC, particularly if PD-L1-positive. Despite these results, further improvements are needed.Areas covered: This review covers immunotherapy drugs which have recently completed, involved in ongoing or due to start phase II trials. This includes approaches to augment the response to existing ICIs, next-generation ICIs, combination treatments with targeted agents and drugs that target the tumor microenvironment. Potential development issues are also discussed.Expert opinion: The field of immunotherapy is developing rapidly and holds great promise for patients with TNBC. Promising avenues of research currently in phase II trials include targeting multiple immune checkpoints simultaneously and the addition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT inhibitors to ICI/chemotherapy regimens. A better understanding of the immunosuppressive role played by the tumor microenvironment has also been important. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding the need for more effective predictive biomarkers.","Hall, Peter E; Schmid, Peter",Expert opinion on emerging drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728214.2021.1916468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870839/,308

Folliculo-stellate cells do not produce anterior pituitary hormones but they are thought to play important roles as stem cells, phagocytes, or supporting cells of hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. S100β protein has been used as a folliculo-stellate cell marker in some animals, including rats. However, since no reliable molecular marker for folliculo-stellate cells has been reported in mice, genetic approaches for the investigation of folliculo-stellate cells in mice are not yet available. Aldolase C/Zebrin II is a brain-type isozyme and is a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. In the present study, we first used immunohistochemistry to verify that aldolase C was produced in the anterior pituitary of rats. Moreover, using transgenic rats expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the S100β gene promoter, we identified aldolase C-immunoreactive signals in folliculo-stellate cells and marginal cells located in the parenchyma of the anterior pituitary and around Rathke's cleft, respectively. We also identified aldolase C-expressing cells in the mouse pituitary using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Aldolase C was not produced in any pituitary hormone-producing cells, while aldolase C-immunopositive signal co-localized with E-cadherin- and SOX2-positive cells. Using post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy, aldolase C-immunoreactive products were observed in the cytoplasm of marginal cells and folliculo-stellate cells of the mouse pituitary. Taken together, aldolase C is a common folliculo-stellate cell marker in the anterior pituitary gland of rodents.","Fujiwara, Ken; Tsukada, Takehiro; Horiguchi, Kotaro; Fujiwara, Yoko; Takemoto, Konomi; Nio-Kobayashi, Junko; Ohno, Nobuhiko; Inoue, Kinji",Cell and tissue research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03200-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418131/,308

A number of newer nitinol stent designs have been developed with improved conformability, greater radial strength and lower rates of long-term stent fracture. These newer stent designs have demonstrated superior primary patency and decreased restenosis for the treatment of moderate-length femoropopliteal lesions relative to historical benchmarks.

METHODS Adults involved in studies prior to the pandemic were contacted during the COVID-19 lockdown. Seventeen young adults (age range: 18-35 years) and 21 older adults (age range: 65-90 years) agreed to participate. Participants were interviewed by phone (between 27th April and 4th May, 2020) to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep (DBAS) questionnaire they had been administered before the pandemic. RESULTS In terms of mean changes, the results showed null effect sizes for changes in self-reported sleep quality for both age groups. In young adults, a medium effect size emerged for changes in sleep latency, which increased during lockdown. No changes in any of the self-reported sleep quality dimensions emerged in older adults. In both age groups, the effect sizes for changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were negligible. In older adults, however, changes in self-reported sleep quality were largely associated with changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that self-reported sleep quality and dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs were not affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in young or older adults. They also suggest that it might be useful to consider changes in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs to better capture the impact of stressful events (such as a period of quarantine) on sleep quality, especially where older adults are concerned.","Sella, Enrico; Carbone, Elena; Toffalini, Enrico; Borella, Erika",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676283/,308

METHODS This study used cohort and cross sectional data from an academic primary care division in Southcentral Pennsylvania that serves approximately 17,500 patients across 4 practice sites. Early season (prior to November 1) vaccination rates in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were recorded for children, age 6 months to 17 years. To explore the impact of COVID-19 on vaccination, we fit a model with a logit link (estimated via generalized estimating equations to account for clustering by patient over time) on calendar year, adjusted for race, ethnicity, age, and insurance type. We examined interaction effects of demographic covariates with calendar year. RESULTS Early vaccination rates were lower in 2020 (29.7%) compared with 2018 and 2019 (34.2% and 33.3%). After adjusting for covariates and accounting for clustering over time, the odds of early vaccination in 2020 were 19% lower compared to 2018 (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.78-0.85). In 2020, children with private insurance were more likely to receive early vaccination than in 2018 (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15), whereas children with public insurance were less likely to receive early vaccination in 2020 than in 2018 (OR 0.62, 95% CI: 1.38-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Early influenza vaccination rates declined in a year with a concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Modeling that accounts for individual trends and demographic variables identified specific populations with lower odds of early vaccination in 2020.

Syphilis resurgence is observed mainly in men who have sex with men (MSM), yet other transmission groups are affected too. In this manuscript, we study the factors associated with syphilis incidence in the Swiss HIV cohort study in the era of highly effective antiretrovirals. Using parametric interval censored models with fixed and time-varying covariates, we studied the immunological, behavioral, and treatment-related elements associated with syphilis incidence in 3 transmission groups: MSM, heterosexuals, and intravenous drug users. Syphilis incidence has been increasing annually since 2005, with up to 74 incident cases per 1000 person-years in 2013, with MSM being the population with the highest burden (92% of cases). While antiretroviral treatment (ART) in general did not affect syphilis incidence, nevirapine (NVP) was associated with a lower hazard of syphilis incidence (multivariable hazard ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.0). We observed that condomless sex and younger age were associated with higher syphilis incidence. Moreover, time-updated CD4, nadir CD4, and CD8 cell counts were not associated with syphilis incidence. Finally, testing frequency higher than the recommended once a year routine testing was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of acquiring syphilis. Condomless sex is the main driver of syphilis resurgence in the Swiss HIV Cohort study; ART and immune reconstitution provide no protection against syphilis. This entails targeted interventions and frequent screening of high-risk populations. There is no known effect of NVP on syphilis; therefore, further clinical, epidemiological, and microbiological investigation is necessary to validate our observation.","Shilaih, Mohaned; Marzel, Alex; Braun, Dominique L; Scherrer, Alexandra U; Kovari, Helen; Young, Jim; Calmy, Alexandra; Darling, Katharine; Battegay, Manuel; Hoffmann, Matthias; Bernasconi, Enos; Thurnheer, Maria C; Günthard, Huldrych F; Kouyos, Roger D",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000005849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28079818/,308

Total endoscopic coronary bypass grafting is performed with the help of a telemanipulator (""robot""). A prospective proof-of-concept study was initiated to investigate a nonrobotic total endoscopic coronary bypass grafting approach. METHODS Twenty patients with significant left anterior descending artery or left main stem lesion were operated on via three or four left thoracic access ports. Under exclusive endoscopic vision, the left internal mammary artery was harvested and anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery manually. Cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest were planned in all cases. RESULTS In 10 patients, the operation was completed successfully as nonrobotic total endoscopic coronary bypass grafting. Reasons for conversions to minimal invasive direct coronary artery grafting or conventional sternotomy were dense pleural adhesions (3 patients), bleeding of the anastomosis (3), diffuse bleeding during left internal mammary artery harvesting (2), identification problems of the target artery (1), or left internal mammary artery failure (1). Postoperative angiography in five primarily successful nonrobotic total endoscopic coronary bypass grafting patients showed patent anastomoses in four cases. One patient was reoperated on for early anastomotic failure in a 1.0-mm target vessel. Until now, a percutaneous coronary intervention of remaining lesions as staged hybrid procedure was performed in three patients (2 nonrobotic total endoscopic coronary bypass grafting, 1 minimal invasive direct coronary artery grafting).

113144,Author Reply.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Breakthrough pain is common among patients with cancer and presents challenges to effective pain management. Breakthrough pain is characterized by rapid onset, severe intensity, and duration typically lasting <1 h. Thus, optimal relief from breakthrough pain is best attained by administering analgesics with dissolution times and bioavailabilities that closely match the onset and duration of breakthrough pain. The objective of this study was to assess complete disintegration time of three different doses of sublingual fentanyl tablets in opioid-tolerant patients. METHODS This was a single-center, non-randomized, open-label study. Opioid-tolerant adult patients (N = 30) with chronic pain were assigned to one of three dose groups and self-administered a single 100, 200, or 300 μg sublingual fentanyl tablet (Abstral(®), Galena Biopharma, Portland, OR, USA). Time to complete disintegration was measured by each patient with a stopwatch and independently verified by study personnel. RESULTS Disintegration time (mean ± SD) for sublingual fentanyl tablets (all doses) was 88.2 ± 55.1 s. Mean disintegration times tended to be slightly longer for the 200 μg (96.7 ± 57.9 s) and 300 μg doses (98.6 ± 64.8 s) compared to the 100 μg dose (69.5 ± 40.5 s). Differences were not statistically significant. Disintegration time was not significantly different between men and women and was not affected by age. CONCLUSION Sublingual fentanyl tablets dissolved rapidly (average time <2 min) in all patients, with the higher doses taking slightly more time to dissolve.","Nalamachu, Srinivas",Pain and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-013-0019-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135150/,308

Theories, models, and conceptual and theoretical frameworks (hereafter ""tools"") provide useful foundations for integrating new knowledge and skills into existing professional practice and education. We conducted this scoping review to identify tools used for teaching cybercivility in health professions education. METHODS Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, we searched six biomedical and educational databases and three grey literature databases for articles available in English published between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2020. Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), we screened and extracted relevant data, and reported the results of the search. RESULTS The search resulted in 2272 articles, with 8 articles included in this review after inclusion criteria were applied. Four articles (50%) were peer-reviewed journal papers while the other 4 (50%) were dissertations. Eleven unique tools were identified by this review: (1) Transpersonal Caring Theory, (2) Theory of Workplace Incivility, (3) Conceptualization of Incivility, (4) Media Ecology Theory, (5) Principlism, (6) Salmon's Five Stage Model of Online Learning, (7) Learner-Centered Educational Theory, (8) Gallant and Drinan's 4-Stage Model of Institutionalization of Academic Integrity, (9) Theory of Planned Behavior, (10) Communication Privacy Management Theory, and (11) Moral Development Theory. Based on the tools analyzed in our scoping review, we determined three features of cybercivility pedagogy to which the tools provided a guide: (1) behavioral manifestations, (2) academic integrity, and (3) digital professionalism.

The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering.

All patients who received a Zimmer Natural Nail (ZNN) or ELOS devices were included. RESULTS In 119 (66.48%) of the 179 fractures, a ZNN nail was used. Post-operatively, the TAD (tip-to-apex distance) was measured at an average value of 17.05 (4.42-41.85) mm and the CalTAD (calcar-referenced TAD) at an average of 20.76 (10.82-43.63) mm. The mean hospitalization time was 10.19 (4-22) days. In the other 60 trochanteric fractures, an ELOS nail was used. Post-operative imaging indicated a TAD of 19.65 (5.08-31.4) mm and a CalTAD of 22.86 mm (12.66-33.77). The average time of the operation was 45.82 (20-110) min. The average period of hospitalization was 10.45 (5-24) days. CONCLUSION Both devices give similar results in terms of short-term post-operative outcome and hospitalization. The price difference between the devices does not translate in different short-term results on the operated patients.","Gargano, Giuseppe; Poeta, Nicola; Oliva, Francesco; Migliorini, Filippo; Maffulli, Nicola",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02634-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407829/,308
115027,Is conventional radiography still relevant for evaluating the acromioclavicular joint?,2020-09-08,"In Japan, rotavirus (RV) vaccines have already been introduced but not used for universal vaccination as of 2018. Therefore, we identified cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in children younger than three years of age and investigated the occurrence of infection before and after the introduction of RV vaccines. An ecological study through prospective surveillance was conducted in four pediatric clinics in Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, during the 2011 to 2018 RVGE epidemic seasons. We divided the study period into three eras: pre-vaccine introduction era (2011), low-mid coverage transitional era (2012 to 2014, RV vaccine coverage rate: 32.9-56.5%), and high coverage plateau era (2015 to 2018, 67.7-81.7%). In this study, the incidence rate of severe RVGE was significantly lower in the plateau era than in the pre-vaccine introduction and transitional eras. Furthermore, the hospitalization rate due to RVGE in Shibata City was lower in the plateau era than in the pre-vaccination introduction and transitional eras. The number of hospitalizations due to RVGE in subjects who required or did not require intravenous rehydration at the pediatric clinics significantly decreased with the increase in vaccine coverage rates by more than 70% in the plateau era.","Oishi, Tomohiro; Matsunaga, Masamichi; Nakano, Tokushi; Sudo, Shoji; Kuwajima, Hiroaki; Tokuriki, Shuko; Study, Shibata Rvge",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1720435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609565/,308
115466,"Editorial (2021, Issue 3).",2021-05-01,"UNLABELLED Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins mediate receptor binding, membrane fusion, and virus entry and determine host range. Murine betacoronavirus (β-CoV) in group A uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein to bind to its receptor, whereas the β-CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV in group B and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV in group C and several α-CoVs use the downstream C domain in their S proteins to recognize their receptor proteins. To identify the receptor-binding domain in the spike of human β-CoV HKU1 in group A, we generated and mapped a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the ectodomain of HKU1 spike protein. They did not cross-react with S proteins of any other CoV tested. Most of the HKU1 spike MAbs recognized epitopes in the C domain between amino acids 535 and 673, indicating that this region is immunodominant. Two of the MAbs blocked HKU1 virus infection of primary human tracheal-bronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells. Preincubation of HTBE cells with a truncated HKU1 S protein that includes the C domain blocked infection with HKU1 virus, but preincubation of cells with truncated S protein containing only the NTD did not block infection. These data suggest that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HKU1 spike protein is located in the C domain, where the spike proteins of α-CoVs and β-CoVs in groups B and C bind to their specific receptor proteins. Thus, two β-CoVs in group A, HKU1 and murine CoV, have evolved to use different regions of their spike glycoproteins to recognize their respective receptor proteins. IMPORTANCE Mouse hepatitis virus, a β-CoV in group A, uses the galectin-like NTD in its spike protein to bind its receptor protein, while HCoV-OC43, another β-CoV in group A, uses the NTD to bind to its sialic-acid containing receptor. In marked contrast, the NTD of the spike glycoprotein of human respiratory β-CoV HKU1, which is also in group A, does not bind sugar. In this study, we showed that for the spike protein of HKU1, the purified C domain, downstream of the NTD, could block HKU1 virus infection of human respiratory epithelial cells, and that several monoclonal antibodies that mapped to the C domain neutralized virus infectivity. Thus, the receptor-binding domain of HKU1 spike glycoprotein is located in the C domain. Surprisingly, two β-CoVs in group A, mouse hepatitis virus and HKU1, have evolved to use different regions of their spike glycoproteins to recognize their respective receptors.","Qian, Zhaohui; Ou, Xiuyuan; Góes, Luiz Gustavo Bentim; Osborne, Christina; Castano, Anna; Holmes, Kathryn V; Dominguez, Samuel R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03737-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26085157/,308

The study aimed to analyze the demand for seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) among various groups of HCWs in a tertiary care hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify their motives for this season's SIV. Before this influenza season (2020/21), the hospital management offered free SIV to all HCWs and promoted it on the internal network. Out of 4,167 HCWs, 630 HCWs expressed interest in SIV and were vaccinated in the hospital. They filled in a total of 603 self-administered pen-and-paper questionnaires. The mean age of the respondents (374 females and 229 males) was 45 ± 12 years. Physicians accounted for 48% of the vaccinated persons but for only 24% (p < .001) of all HCWs to whom SIV was offered. Only 16% of respondents vaccinated this year also received SIV before the last season (2019/20), with the proportion of physicians (19%) being statistically significantly higher than that of non-physicians (13%, p = .045) and the proportion of chronically ill HCWs (22%) being higher than that of healthy individuals (13%, p = .004). Most frequently, respondents' motivation to get vaccinated this year was self-protection (61%), that is concerns about contracting influenza together with COVID-19 or alone, followed by family protection (58%) and patient protection (53%). In conclusion, COVID-19 contributed to an increased demand for SIV among HCWs and the threat of contracting it together with influenza was the most frequent motive.","Štěpánek, Ladislav; Nakládalová, Marie; Vildová, Helena; Boriková, Alena; Janošíková, Magdaléna; Ivanová, Kateřina",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1911212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857398/,308

Some of these new applications can benefit from the use of disposable inhalers. AREAS COVERED Current trends in pulmonary drug delivery are presented in this review as well as the possible contribution of disposable inhalers to the improvement of pulmonary administration therein. Arguments in favour of disposable inhalers and the starting points for development of devices and their formulations are discussed. Also, a brief review of the state of the art regarding current disposable inhaler development is given. EXPERT OPINION Prerequisites for the use of disposable inhalers, particularly dry powder inhalers, in applications such as childhood vaccination and for preventing or stopping pandemic outbreaks of highly infectious diseases (like influenza, bird flu, SARS) are that they are simple, cheap and effective. Not only do the devices have to be simple in design, but the drug formulations should also be cheap. This may require a different approach as the formulation may not need to be adapted to improve the inhaler must be designed to enhance formulation dispersion.","de Boer, Anne H; Hagedoorn, Paul",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2014.952626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25374325/,308

In both the United States and the international community, the proper method for trialing is ill defined. METHODS The Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference (PACC) is a group of well-published experienced practitioners who meet to update the state of care for intrathecal therapies on the basis of current knowledge in the literature and clinical experience. Anexhaustive search is performed to create a base of information that the panel considers when making recommendations for best clinical practices. This literature, coupled with clinical experience, is the basis for recommendations and for identification of gaps in the base of knowledge regarding trialing for intrathecal pump placement. RESULTS The panel has made recommendations for the proper methods of trialing for long-term intrathecal drug delivery. CONCLUSION The use of intrathecal drug delivery is an important part of the treatment algorithm for moderate to severe chronic pain. It has become common practice to perform a temporary neuroaxial infusion before permanent device implantation. On the basis of current knowledge, the PACC has developed recommendations to improve care. The need to update these recommendations will be very important as new literature is published.","Deer, Timothy R; Prager, Joshua; Levy, Robert; Burton, Allen; Buchser, Eric; Caraway, David; Cousins, Michael; De Andrés, José; Diwan, Sudhir; Erdek, Michael; Grigsby, Eric; Huntoon, Marc; Jacobs, Marilyn; Kim, Phillip; Kumar, Krishna; Leong, Michael; Liem, Liong; McDowell, Gladstone; Panchal, Sunil J; Rauck, Richard; Saulino, Michael; Staats, Peter; Stanton-Hicks, Michael; Stearns, Lisa; Sitzman, B Todd; Wallace, Mark; Willis, K Dean; Witt, William; Yaksh, Tony; Mekhail, Nagy",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-1403.2012.00450.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494357/,308
117604,Mode conversion of SH guided waves with symmetry inversion in plates.,2020-12-24,"Colistin is an important antibiotic currently used to manage infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens in both humans and livestock animals. A new mobile colistin-resistance (mcr-9) gene was recently discovered; this discovery highlighted the need for rigorous monitoring of bacterial resistance against colistin. Salmonella is one of the major pathogens responsible for foodborne illnesses; however, there is minimal information regarding the presence of mcr genes in foodborne Salmonella strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of mcr genes among 178 Salmonella strains isolated from chicken meat in Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured using the broth microdilution method. Bioinformatics characterization of colistin-resistant strains and genetic environment of the mcr-9 gene were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Transferability of the mcr-9 carrying colistin-resistant Salmonella strain was tested using broth-mating conjugation. Thirteen of the 178 Salmonella isolates showed colistin resistance, but only one strain, Salmonella Dessau ST14 (KUFSE-SAL043) from a traditional chicken market in Korea, carried an mcr family gene, mcr-9. This strain also carried other acquired antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaTEM-1B, qnrS1, and aac(6')-Iaa. Only the IncX1 plasmid replicon type was detected in this strain. In the strain KUFSE-SAL043, the mcr-9 gene was located between two insertion sequences, IS903B and IS26, followed by the downstream regulatory genes qseB-like and qseC-like, which were located between IS1R and ΔIS1R. Conjugation tests revealed that the mcr-9 gene was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli J53 at a mean frequency of 2.03 × 10-7. This is the first report of a transferable mcr-9 gene in Salmonella isolated from chicken meat in Korea, highlighting the possibility of transfer of colistin resistance. Therefore, the wide use of colistin should be reconsidered, and a One Health perspective should be adopted to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains in humans, livestock, and the environment.","Cha, Min-Hyeok; Woo, Gun-Jo; Lee, Woojung; Kim, Seok-Hwan; Woo, Jung-Ha; Kim, Junyoung; Ryu, Jae-Gee; Kwak, Hyo-Sun; Chi, Young-Min",Foodborne pathogens and disease,https://doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2020.2810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830987/,308

Three primary themes emerged from the literature: (a) decreased 1-year morbidity and mortality in Veterans with comorbid conditions who received pneumococcal vaccination, (b) significant barriers in outpatient vaccination processes, and (c) the spectrum of pneumococcal disease in Veterans. In general, themes from this review could be useful for stimulating quality improvement initiatives to increase pneumococcal vaccination in Veterans.

118517,A zebrafish model of tuberculosis comorbidity and the effects of HIF-activating intervention.,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, Central COVID-19 Coordination Centers (CCCC) have been established at several hospitals across Germany with the intention to assist local healthcare professionals in efficiently referring patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to regional hospitals, and therefore to prevent the collapse of local health system structures. In addition, they coordinate interhospital transfers of COVID-19 patients and provide or arrange specialized telemedical consultations. OBJECTIVE This study describes the establishment and management of a CCCC at a German university hospital. METHODS We perform economic analyses (cost, cost-effectiveness, use and utility) according to the CHEERS criteria. Additionally, a systematic review was conducted to identify publications on similar institutions worldwide. The two months with the highest local incidence (12/2020 and 01/2021) of COVID-19 cases were considered. RESULTS During this time, 17.3 requests per day were made to CCCC regarding admission or transfer of COVID-19 patients. The majority of requests was made by emergency medical services (56.3%), patients with an average age of 71.8 years were involved and 69.0% of cases had already positive PCR detection. In 59.8% of the concerning patients, further treatment by the general practitioner or outpatient presentation in a hospital could be initiated after appropriate advice, 27.2% of patients were admitted to normal wards and 12.9% were directly transmitted to an intensive care unit. The operating costs of the CCCC amounted to more than €52,000 per month. 90.4% of all patients presented to the hospital were triaged and announced in advance by the CCCC. No other published economic analysis of COVID-19 coordination or management institutions at hospitals could be found. CONCLUSIONS Despite the high cost of the CCCC, we were able to show that it is a beneficial concept to both the providing hospital and the public health system. However, the most important benefit of the CCCC is that it prevents hospitals from being overrun by patients and that it avoids situations in which doctors have to weigh up one patient's life against another´s.

MATERIAL/METHODS We recruited 704 ASAI-III female patients, 18-52 years old and scheduled for planned painless surgical abortion, and randomized them into a control group (n=359) receiving standard monitoring and an experimental group (n=341) receiving standard monitoring and additional capnography. Exclusion criteria were preexisting cardiovascular disease, preexisting hypotension, bradycardia or arrhythmia, and drug allergy. Anesthesia was induced in all patients with propofol using target-controlled infusion at a target propofol plasma concentration of 4 μg/ml. All patients received flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg and 0.5 μg/kg fentanyl 5 min before anesthesia. Bispectral index was used and maintained between 45 and 60. Main outcome measures were apnea or abnormal ventilation status, rate of oxygen desaturation, occurrence of hypoxia and severe hypoxia, and perioperative side effects. RESULTS The experimental group had significantly higher rate of apnea or abnormal ventilation, significantly lower rate of oxygen desaturation, and significant lower occurrence of hypoxia and severe hypoxia compared to the control group. We found no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of increased oxygen supplementation, assisted ventilation, bradycardia, hypotension, dosage of atropine, dosage of ephedrine or phenylephrine, and the amount of propofol consumed. CONCLUSIONS Sidestream capnographic monitoring improves early detection of alterations in ventilation parameters and reduces the incidence of oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia resulting from propofol anesthesia during surgical abortion.","Zongming, Jiang; Zhonghua, Chen; Xiangming, Fang",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.891023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403146/,308
118976,An international virtual hackathon to build tools for the analysis of structural variants within species ranging from coronaviruses to vertebrates.,2021,"The increase in the prevalence of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has paralleled one another. Laparoscopic fundoplication (LF) (Nissen or Toupet) is a minimally invasive form of anti-reflux surgery. The duodenal switch is a highly effective weight loss surgery with a proven record of long term weight loss success. However, fundoplication alone does not give satisfactory results when used for GERD in morbidly obese patients. Here we present a novel approach combining stomach intestinal pylorus sparing surgery (SIPS) with LF for morbidly obese patients with GERD. The data from patients who underwent the SIPS procedure along with LF in past year was retrospectively analyzed. The variables collected were age, sex, height, weight, intra-operative and post-operative complications, length of stay, operative time, and estimated blood loss. All revisions were excluded. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation were used to analyze the data. The total sample size of the study was 5 patients, with a mean age of 59.6 ± 16.4 years, a mean weight of 292.1 ± 73.6 lbs., and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 43.4 ± 6.3. Weight loss patterns were the same as those without LF. All the 5 patients had resolution or improvement in their GERD symptoms within 6 months. SIPS with LF provides substantial and sustained weight loss and GERD resolution. Long term follow ups and further study on this novel surgical technique is recommended.","Zaveri, Hinali; Surve, Amit; Cottam, Daniel; Richards, Christina; Medlin, Walter; Belnap, LeGrand; Cottam, Samuel; Cottam, Austin",SpringerPlus,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-015-1396-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26543731/,308

The HCC was located in the right lateral sector. Although segmentectomy of segment 7 would normally be considered minimal for a curative treatment of HCC, this was relatively complicated in this patient. Thus, we performed an extended right lateral sectionectomy using the LHM to achieve a simple transection. The hepatic hilum was dissected using the Glissonean pedicle transection method. The operation time and intraoperative blood loss were 6 h 45 min and 471 ml, respectively. No blood product transfusion was required.

The authors try to answer whether the use of the newest generation tools has an impact on achieving better results in single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique during the exercises in the surgical skills laboratory. MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 51 participants in the study: 44 'novices' and 7 'experts'. All subjects performed the 'advanced grasping' exercise according to the FLS programme manual using four types of laparoscopic approach including two SILS ports and SILS-dedicated instruments. The outcome measures involved task completion time and the number of errors. RESULTS Tasks using straight laparoscopic instruments set together with classic three-port access as well as SILS access ports were finished significantly faster when compared with SILS-dedicated instruments (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in performance times between the two setups with straight instruments (p < 0.05) and both setups with SILS-dedicated instruments, irrespective of the use of curved or dynamic articulated tools. Students with no previous laparoscopic experience had significantly worse task completion times in all tasks in comparison to students with laparoscopic laboratory training and the 'experts' group. CONCLUSIONS The use of the straight instruments in the SILS technique remain similar to its performance in full triangulation. SILS-dedicated instruments paradoxically increase the task completion time irrespective of possessed skills. The study showed the necessity of a SILS-dedicated tools training programme.","Laski, Dariusz; Stefaniak, Tomasz J; Makarewicz, Wojciech; Bobowicz, Maciej; Kobiela, Jarosław; Nateghi, Behzad; Proczko, Monika; Madejewska, Ilona; Gruca, Zbigniew; Sledzinski, Zbigniew",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.33811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130635/,308

Additional evaluation was conducted using thermal analysis, micromeritics, and tableting forces. In this study, binary ratios of neat MgSt polymorphs were employed as lubricants in powder blends containing acetaminophen (APAP), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), and lactose monohydrate (LAC-M). Powder rheometry was studied using permeability, basic flow energy (BFE), density, and porosity analysis. Thermal conductivity and differential scanning calorimetric analysis of MgSt polymorphs were employed to elucidate MgSt effect on powder blends. The impact of MgSt polymorphs on compaction characteristics were analyzed via tablet compression forces. Finally, the distribution of atomized magnesium (Mg) ions as a function of intensity was evaluated using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) on tablets. The results from LIBS analysis indicated the dependency of the MgSt polymorphic forms on the atomized Mg ion intensity, with higher Mg ion intensity suggesting higher lubricity index (i.e. greater propensity to over-lubricate). The results from lubricity index suggested the tendency of blends to over-lubricate based on the MgSt polymorphic forms. Finally, tableting forces suggested that MgSt-D and MgSt-A offered processing benefits such as lower ejection and compression forces, and that MgSt-M showed the most stable compression force in single or combined polymorphic ratios. These results suggested that the initial moisture content, crystal arrangement, intra- and inter-molecular packing of the polymorphs defined their effects on the rheology of lubricated powders.","Okoye, Patrick; Wu, Stephen H; Dave, Rutesh H",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.3109/03639045.2011.653812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22304483/,308

Although commonplace in pediatric otolaryngology, multidisciplinary clinics pose a unique challenge during this time due to increased infection risk from multiple patient-provider interactions. Guidance on the application of telemedicine for multidisciplinary clinics in pediatric otolaryngology is limited. METHODS We provide comprehensive guidance on best practices for conducting telemedicine visits for a number of multidisciplinary otolaryngology clinics using our experiences at a single tertiary care children's hospital. A review of literature to support the adoption of telemedicine in multidisciplinary pediatric otolaryngology is also incorporated. RESULTS Telemedicine was successfully adopted for 7 multidisciplinary pediatric clinics with a variety of specialists: aerodigestive disorders, congenital hearing loss, microtia/aural atresia, orofacial clefting, sleep disorders, tracheostomy care, and velopharyngeal dysfunction.

122217,"AstraZeneca vaccine: Blood clots are ""extremely rare"" and benefits outweigh risks, regulators conclude.",2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND The increasing menace of the COVID-19 epidemic led to an atmosphere of anxiety around the world, however the evidence among Chinese students aged 12 to 18 years has been limited. METHODS A total of 373216 junior and senior high school students were recruited using a cluster sampling method in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Xinyang city of Henan Province, China, during February 4-12, 2020. Presence of anxiety symptoms was determined by Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate the potential risk factors. RESULTS Among the participants, junior and senior high school students were found to have anxiety symptoms, producing an overall prevalence of 9.89%. The prevalence was lower in female than in male (9.66% vs. 10.11%) and the prevalence was higher for junior high school students than senior high school students (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest among rural students and lowest among urban students (11.33% vs. 8.77%). The cognitive level was negatively associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms. After adjusting for potential confounders, age, gender, residential location, worried level, fear level and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety symptoms. LIMITATIONS Prevalence may be skewed by assessing anxiety symptoms using self-reported scales rather than clinical interviews. CONCLUSIONS This large-scale study assesses the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and its potential influencing factors in junior and senior high school students. These findings suggest that governments need to pay more attention to the mental health of young people in combating COVID-19.","Xu, Qingqing; Mao, Zhenxing; Wei, Dandan; Liu, Pengling; Fan, Keliang; Wang, Juan; Wang, Xian; Lou, Xiaomin; Lin, Hualiang; Wang, Chongjian; Wu, Cuiping",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839554/,308

In this case, the removed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-adjacent (GBM-A), GBM-peritumor and GBM-central (GBM-C) tissues from a convalescent patient of COVID-19, who also suffered from glioblastoma meanwhile, together with GBM-A and GBM tissues from a patient without COVID-19 history as negative controls, were used for RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing and immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and the virus antigen (N protein). The results of RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects some cells within human GBM tissues and SARS-CoV-2 in GBM-C tissue still exists even when it is cleared elsewhere. Immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and N protein showed that the expressions of ACE2 are significantly higher in specimens, including GBM-C tissue from COVID-19 patient than other types of tissue. The unique phenomenon suggests that the surgical protection level should be upgraded even if the patient is in a convalescent period and the pharyngeal swab tests show negative results. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to confirm whether the shelter-like phenomenon happens in other malignancies due to the similar microenvironment and high expression of ACE2 in some malignancies.","Lei, Jie; Liu, Yueping; Xie, Tianhao; Yao, Guojie; Wang, Gang; Diao, Bo; Song, Jian",Neuroreport,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnr.0000000000001654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994523/,308

The purpose of this study was to review a consecutive series of SEDAVFs from a single institution and report on the clinical presentations, functional status, and treatment outcomes. METHODS The authors identified all SEDAVFs treated at their institution from 2005 to 2015. SEDAVFs were defined as spinal AVFs in which the fistulous connection occurred in the epidural venous plexus. The clinical presentation, functional status, immediate treatment outcomes, and long-term neurological outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-four patients with SEDAVFs were included in this study. The patients' mean age at presentation was 66.9 years. The most common presenting symptoms were pain and numbness (22 patients, 91.7%), followed by lower-extremity weakness (21 patients, 87.5%). The mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 11.8 months. Eighteen patients (75.0%) were treated with endovascular therapy alone, 4 (16.7) with surgery, and 2 (8.3%) with a combination of techniques. There was 1 major treatment-related complication (4.2%). Fifteen patients (62.5%) had improvement in disability, and 12 patients (54.5%) had improvement in sensory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS SEDAVFs often present with lower-extremity motor dysfunction and sensory symptoms. With the availability of newer liquid embolic agents, these lesions can be effectively treated with endovascular techniques. Surgery is also effective at treating these lesions, especially in situations where endovascular embolization fails or is not safe and in patients presenting with mass effect from compressive varices.","Nasr, Deena M; Brinjikji, Waleed; Clarke, Michelle J; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurosurgery.

122870,A comparative assessment of irrigation and drainage characteristics for commercially available urethral catheters.,2017,"BACKGROUND Patient user embracement involves behaviours of including and listening to the patient, appreciating their complaints, and identifying their needs, whether individual or collective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a user embracement protocol (SPIKES protocol) for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) immediately before intra-articular injection (IAI) relative to procedure tolerance and its effectiveness in the immediate, short and medium terms. METHODS This was a randomized controlled trial. Patients received IAIs with triamcinolone hexacetonide (40 mg) preceded or not by the SPIKES protocol. The outcomes measured were: visual analogue scale for pain at rest, pain on movement and joint swelling; morning stiffness; Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index Functional Questionnaire (WOMAC); pain catastrophizing scale; McGill pain questionnaire; SF-36 questionnaire on quality of life; Trace State Anxiety Inventory (IDATE); and a Timed Up and Go functional test. RESULTS One hundred patients were randomized in the user embracement group (n = 50) or the control group (n = 50); 89% were women and 60% white, mean age was 67.1 (±7.3) years, and mean disease time was 6.3 (±6.2) years. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for any variables at pre-procedure time, nor did the groups differ in their tolerance to the procedure or during the 12 weeks of follow up for any evaluated variables. CONCLUSIONS No benefit was identified by applying a user embracement protocol to patients with knee OA prior to IAI with corticosteroid, neither to tolerance at the time of the procedure nor to its effectiveness in the immediate, short, and medium terms.","Toffolo, Sandra Regina; Natour, Jamil; Boni, Reginaldo Carlos; Nunes-Tamashiro, Jose Carlos; Furtado, Rita Nely Vilar",The Knee,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knee.2021.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740751/,308

123708,Is current body temperature measurement practice fit-for-purpose?,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic appendectomy is a commonly performed surgical procedure, but few training models have been described for it. We examined a virtual reality module for practising a laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS A prospective cohort study with the following 3 groups of surgeons (n = 45): novices (0 procedures), intermediates (10-50 procedures), and experienced (>100 procedures). After being introduced to the simulator and 1 familiarization attempt on the procedural module, the participants practiced the module 20 times. Movements, task time, and procedure-specific parameters were compared over time. RESULTS The time and movement parameters were significantly different during the first attempt, and more experienced surgeons used fewer movements and less time than novices (p < 0.01), although only 2 parameters were significantly different between novices and intermediates. All 3 groups improved significantly over 20 attempts (p < 0.0001). The intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.55 and 0.68 and did not differ significantly between the 3 groups (p > 0.05). When comparing novices with experienced surgeons, novices had a higher risk of burn damage to cecum (odds ratio [OR] = 3.0 [95% CI: 1.3; 7.0] p = 0.03), pressure damage to appendix (OR = 3.1 [95% CI: 2.0; 4.9] p < 0.0001), and grasping of the appendix (OR = 2.9 [95% CI: 1.8; 4.7] p < 0.0001). The risk of causing a perforation was not significantly different among the different experience levels (OR = 1.9 [95% CI: 0.9; 3.8] p = 0.14). Only 3 out of 5 error parameters differed significantly when comparing novices and experienced surgeons. Similarly, when comparing intermediates and novices, it was only 2 of the parameters that differed. DISCUSSION The simulator module for practising laparoscopic appendectomy may be useful as a training tool, but further development is required before it can be used for assessment purposes. Procedural simulation may demonstrate more variation for movement parameters, and future research should focus on developing better procedure-specific parameters.","Bjerrum, Flemming; Strandbygaard, Jeanett; Rosthøj, Susanne; Grantcharov, Teodor; Ottesen, Bent; Sorensen, Jette Led",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717707/,308

In South Africa, there are conflicting reports on the estimates of maternal and neonatal mortality, derived from both direct and indirect estimation techniques. This study aims to systematically review the estimates made of maternal and neonatal mortality in the period from 1990 to 2015 in South Africa and determine trends over this period. METHODS For the purpose of this review, searches for eligible studies will be conducted in MEDLINE, Africa-Wide Information, African Index Medicus, African Journals Online, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL databases. Searches will be restricted to articles written in English and presenting data covering the period between 1990 and 2015. Reference lists of retrieved articles will also be screened for additional publications. Three independent reviewers will be involved in the study selection, data extractions and achieving consensus. Study quality and risk of bias will thereafter be assessed by two authors. The results will be presented as rates/ratio with their corresponding 95% confidence/uncertainty intervals. DISCUSSION Identifying trends in maternal and neonatal mortality will help to track progress in MDGs 4 and 5 and will serve in evaluating interventions focusing on reducing maternal and child mortality in the country.

METHODS All radioembolization procedures for hepatic malignancies using resin microspheres with MIRD model between November 2015 and February 2019 were included in this IRB-approved study (n = 60). Student's T test was used to compare prescribed activity based on MIRD and BSA models. Adverse events were assessed immediately, 30 days, and 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS Sixty radioembolizations were performed in 54 patients (age 68 ± 9 years, 48-87 years, 35% female). Mean prescribed activity calculated by the MIRD model (target absorbed dose 120-200 Gy for primary and 80-200 Gy for metastatic liver cancers) was 1.7 GBq (0.3-6.4) compared with 0.6 GBq (0.12-2.1) if BSA had been used (p < 0.0001). The prescribed activity was successfully delivered in 93% (56/60) treatments. Prophylactic embolization and anti-reflux catheters were used in 20% (12/60) and 5% (3/60) treatments, respectively. No immediate post-procedural complications occurred. Abdominal pain was the most common clinical Grade 3 CTCAE in 30 days (10%) and 6 months (12%). Radiation pneumonitis occurred in 3 (5%) patients but no radiation-induced gastric ulcer or radiation-induced liver disease occurred. CONCLUSION MIRD dosimetry results in higher prescribed activity compared with BSA dosimetry with resin microspheres. MIRD prescribed activity with target absorbed doses up to 200 Gy can be successfully administered without prophylactic embolization in selected patients. KEY POINTS •MIRD dosimetry results in higher prescribed activity compared with BSA dosimetry for radioembolization. •MIRD dosimetry can be used for yttrium-90 resin microsphere radioembolization with acceptable safety profile.","Sarwar, Ammar; Kudla, Alexei; Weinstein, Jeffrey L; Ali, Aamir; Malik, Raza; Bullock, Andrea; Khwaja, Khalid O; Curry, Michael; Faintuch, Salomao; Ahmed, Muneeb",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07231-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901301/,308

METHODS Synovial fluid and serum was collected from 88 patients who underwent revision arthroplasty surgery. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society definition was used to classify these patients into 2 groups: 36 PJIs and 52 aseptic failures. Synovial fluid and serum samples were tested for 9 biomarkers using a micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic polymorphisms were evaluated with polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease analysis. RESULTS Synovial fluid-derived IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-17, CRP, GCSF, TNFα, and serum-derived IL-6, IL-17, ferritin, CRP were found suitable to classify PJI and aseptic failure. In addition, IL-17 and CRP levels demonstrated a positive correlation between synovial fluid and serum. TNFα-238, IL6-174, GCSF3R, and IL1 RN-VNTR genetic polymorphisms occurred more frequently in individuals with septic failure. CONCLUSION Significant differences between the two groups were observed in the functional polymorphisms of the genes encoding the cytokines investigated. These differences could be interpreted as indicating that there is an association between PJI and genetic polymorphisms.

127549,"Flexible and capsule endoscopy for screening, diagnosis and treatment.",2014,"BACKGROUND Prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including closed chest compressions, has commonly been considered ineffective in traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest (TCPA) because traditional chest compressions do not produce substantial cardiac output. However, recent evidence suggests that chest compressions located over the left ventricle (LV) produce greater hemodynamics when compared to traditional compressions. We hypothesized that chest compressions located directly over the LV would improve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and hemodynamics when compared with traditional chest compressions, in a swine model of TCPA. METHODS Transthoracic echocardiography was used to mark the location of the aortic root (traditional compressions), and the center of the LV on animals (n = 26) which were randomized to receive chest compressions in one of the two locations. After hemorrhage, ventricular fibrillation was induced. After 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, basic life support (BLS) with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and performed for 10 minutes followed by advanced life support (ALS) for an additional 10 minutes. During BLS, the area of maximal compression was verified using transesophageal echocardiography. Hemodynamic variables were averaged over the final 2 minutes of the BLS and ALS periods. RESULTS Five (38%) of the LV group achieved ROSC compared with zero of the aortic root group (p = 0.04). Additionally, there was an increase in aortic systolic blood pressure (SBP), aortic diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) at the end of both the BLS (95% confidence interval, SBP, -49 to -21; DBP, -14 to -5.6; and CPP, -15 to -7.4) and ALS (95% confidence interval: SBP, -66 to -21; DBP, -49 to -6.8; and CPP, -51 to -7.5) resuscitation periods among the LV group. CONCLUSION In our swine model of TCPA, chest compressions performed directly over the LV improved ROSC and hemodynamics when compared with traditional chest compressions.","Anderson, Kenton L; Fiala, Kristin C; Castaneda, Maria G; Boudreau, Susan M; Araña, Allyson A; Bebarta, Vikhyat S",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000001901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29613954/,308

128014,Do positive memory characteristics relate to reckless behaviours? an exploratory study in a treatment-seeking traumatised sample.,2020-07-07,"INTRODUCTION Competence committees (CCs) are groups of educators tasked with reviewing resident progress throughout their training, making decisions regarding the achievement of Entrustable Professional Activities and recommendations regarding promotion and remediation. CCs have been mandated as part of competency-based medical education programs worldwide; however, there has yet to be a thorough examination of the implementation challenges they face and how this impacts their functioning and decision-making processes. This study examined CC implementation at a Canadian institution, documenting the shared and unique challenges that CCs faced and overcame over a three-year period. METHODS This study consisted of three phases, which were conceptually and analytically linked using Moran-Ellis and colleagues' notion of 'following a thread.' Phase 1 examined the early perceptions and experiences of 30 key informants using a survey and semi-structured interviews. Phase 2 provided insight into CCs' operations through a survey sent to 35 CC chairs one-year post-implementation. Phase 3 invited 20 CC members to participate in semi-structured interviews to follow up on initial themes two years post-implementation. Detailed observation notes from 16 CC meetings across nine disciplines were used to corroborate the findings from each phase. RESULTS Response rates in each phase were 83% (n=25), 43% (n=15), and 60% (n=12), respectively. Despite the high degree of support for CCs among faculty and resident members, several ongoing challenges were highlighted: adapting to program size, optimizing membership, engaging residents, maintaining capacity among members, sharing and aggregating data, and developing a clear mandate. DISCUSSION Findings of this study reinforce the importance of resident engagement and information sharing between disciplines. Challenges faced by CCs are discussed in relation to the existing literature to inform a better understanding of group decision-making processes in medical education.

130421,Science in the time of coronavirus.,2020-04-02,"Background India has reported more than 70,000 cases and 2000 deaths. Pune is the second city in the Maharashtra state after Mumbai to breach the 1000 cases. Total deaths reported from Pune were 158 with a mortality of 5.7%. To plan health services, it is important to learn lessons from early stage of the outbreak on course of the disease in a hospital setting. Objectives To describe the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak of COVID-19 in India from a tertiary care hospital. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study which included all admitted laboratory confirmed COVID19 cases from March 31, to April 24, 2020. The information was collected in a predesigned pro forma which included sociodemographic data, duration of stay, family background, outcome, etc., by trained staff after ethics approval. Epi Info7 was used for data analysis. Results Out of the total 197 cases, majority cases were between the ages of 31-60 years with slight male preponderance. Majority of these cases were from the slums. Breathlessness was the main presenting symptom followed by fever and cough. More than 1/5th of patients were asymptomatic from exposure to admission. The case fatality rate among the admitted cases was 29.4%. Comorbidity was one of the significant risk factors for the progression of disease and death (odds ratio [OR] = 16.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.0 - 40.1, P < 0.0001). Conclusion Mortality was higher than the national average of 3.2%; comorbidity was associated with bad prognosis.","Tambe, Muralidhar Parashuram; Parande, Malangori A; Tapare, Vinay S; Borle, Pradip S; Lakde, Rajesh N; Shelke, Sangita C",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_522_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32496252/,308

131221,Quality-by-Design II: Application of Quantitative Risk Analysis to the Formulation of Ciprofloxacin Tablets.,2016,"Ebola virus disease is a serious global health concern given its periodic occurrence, high lethality, and the lack of approved therapeutics. Certain drugs that alter intracellular calcium, particularly in endo-lysosomes, have been shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) infection is promoted in the presence of calcium as a result of the direct interaction of calcium with the EBOV fusion peptide (FP). We identify the glycoprotein residues D522 and E540 in the FP as functionally critical to EBOV's interaction with cal-cium. We show using spectroscopic and biophysical assays that interactions of the fusion peptide with Ca2+ ions lead to lipid ordering in the host membrane during membrane fusion, and these changes are promoted at low pH and can be correlated with infectivity. We further demonstrate using circular dichroism spectroscopy that calcium interaction with the fusion pep-tide promotes α helical structure of the fusion peptide-a conformational change that enhances membrane fusion, as vali-dated using functional assays of membrane fusion. This study shows that calcium directly targets the Ebola virus fusion peptide and influences its conformation. As these residues are highly conserved across the Filoviridae, calcium's impact on fusion, and subsequently infectivity, is a key interaction that can be leveraged for developing strategies to defend against Ebola infection. This mechanistic insight provides a rationale for the use of calcium-interfering drugs already approved by the FDA as therapeutics against Ebola and enables further development of novel drugs to combat the virus.","Nathan, Lakshmi; Lai, Alex; Millet, Jean; Straus, Marco; Whittaker, Gary R; Freed, Jack H; Daniel, Susan",ACS infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31746195/,308

131944,Methylmercury in caddisflies and mayflies: Influences of water and sediment chemistry.,2021-08-10,"BACKGROUND Multi-drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum betalactamase or carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae) are emerging in early-onset infections. So far, there is no report describing the eradication of these bacteria in a osseous infection of an open proximal tibial fracture in combination with the hexapod technology to address both osseous consolidation and closed drop foot correction. CASE PRESENTATION After sustaining a proximal tibial fracture (Gustilo 3B), a 41-year-old man was primarily treated with open reduction and internal fixation by a locking plate and split-thickness skin graft in the home country. At the time of admission to our hospital there was a significant anterolateral soft tissue defect covered with an already-necrotic split-thickness graft and suspicious secretion. CAT and MRI scans revealed no signs of osseous healing, intramedullary distinctive osteomyelitis, as well as a large abscess zone in the dorsal compartment. Multiple wound smears showed multi-drug-resistant bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem resistant) as well as Enterobacter cloacae complex (AmpC overexpression). After implant removal, excessive osseous and intramedullary debridements using the Reamer Irrigator Aspirator (RIA®) as well as initial negative pressure wound therapy were performed. Colistin hand-modelled chains and sticks were applied topically as well as an adjusted systemic antibiotic scheme was applied. After repetitive surgical interventions, the smears showed bacterial eradication and the patient underwent soft tissue reconstruction with a free vascularized latissimus dorsi muscle flap. External fixation was converted to a hexapod fixator (TSF®) to correct primary varus displacement, axial assignment and secure osseous healing. A second ring was mounted to address the fixed drop foot in a closed fashion without further intervention. At final follow-up, 12 months after trauma, the patient showed good functional recovery with osseous healing, intact soft tissue with satisfactory cosmetics and no signs of reinfection. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary approach with orthopaedic surgeons for debridement, planning and establishing osseous and joint correction and consolidation, plastic surgeons for microvascular muscle flaps for soft tissue defect coverage as well as clinical microbiologists for the optimized anti-infective treatment is essential in these challenging rare cases.

A previously healthy 16-month-old boy was referred to our hospital for difficulties in eye contact and progressive gait disturbance lasting 2 months. He was inoculated with BCG at 7 months of age. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hydrocephalus with widespread and disseminated enhancement lesions with thickening of the third ventricle floor, and brain tissue pathologically showed noncaseous granulomatous inflammation. Immunosuppressive therapies were initiated because of a provisional diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Three months later, a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was obtained. Eventually, M. bovis (BCG Tokyo 172 strain) was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and shunt tube culture. The prolonged use of antituberculosis drugs and multiple shunt replacement surgeries were needed for recovery. There was no evidence of immunodeficiency. Unfortunately, he had severe neurological sequelae such as bilateral blindness and neurodevelopmental delay. Our purpose of this report was to highlight the potential for intracranial manifestations of adverse reactions related to BCG vaccination. We propose that CSF PCR assay of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex should be applied repeatedly in children suspected intractable neurosarcoidosis, with a history of BCG vaccination.","Furuichi, Mihoko; Mori, Fumi; Uejima, Yoji; Sato, Satoshi; Kurihara, Jun; Kawano, Yutaka; Suganuma, Eisuke",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.1419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976992/,308

This study reviewed the measures implemented in China as an example to illustrate these two approaches. Since May 2009, China has deployed strict controlling mechanisms based on the strong prior Bayesian assumption that the origin of influenza A (H1N1) was from outside China and as such strict border control would keep the virus from entering China. After more than 4 months of hard work by Chinese health professionals and officials, the number of confirmed influenza A (H1N1) has increased steadily against the expectations of the general public. Taking into account the great financial burden in maintaining strict measures, Chinese health authorities have slowly adjusted their policies of controlling influenza A (H1N1) in China according to frequentist reasoning since July 2009.","Lai, Dejian; Hsu, Chiehwen Ed; Glasser, Jay H",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539510377653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685666/,308
132372,2020: the year of hard-won lessons.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Sevoflurane and desflurane are widely used in balanced anaesthesia in combination with opioid analgesics. The opioid remifentanil is frequently chosen because of its extremely rapid pharmacokinetics. However, intraoperative high-dose remifentanil is associated with increased postoperative pain and rescue analgesic use owing to acute tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. This study aimed to compare intraoperative remifentanil requirements during equi-minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) sevoflurane and desflurane anaesthesia via surgical pleth index-guided remifentanil administration. METHODS Eighty-two subjects undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to two groups receiving either sevoflurane (n=40) or desflurane (n=42). Anaesthesia was maintained with the assigned inhaled anaesthetics and remifentanil. End-tidal anaesthetic concentration was maintained at age-corrected 1.0 MAC, and remifentanil infusion was continuously adjusted to achieve a surgical pleth index of 20-50. Mean remifentanil infusion rate, which was the primary outcome of the study, was calculated as the total infused remifentanil dose per kg body weight per minute of total operative time. RESULTS Mean remifentanil infusion rate [mean (standard deviation)] was significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the desflurane group [0.192 (0.064) vs. 0.099 (0.033) μg kg-1 min-1; difference, 0.093 (95% confidence interval, 0.071-0.115); P<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS During equi-MAC anaesthesia of 1.0 MAC, sevoflurane and desflurane did not show similar intraoperative remifentanil consumption under surgical pleth index-guided opioid administration. Further studies using other monitors with different measuring mechanisms are warranted to determine the cause of this difference.

132770,Autonomous Energy Harvester Based on Textile-Based Enzymatic Biofuel Cell for On-Demand Usage.,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused mental stress in a number of ways: overstrain of the health care system, lockdown of the economy, restricted opportunities for interpersonal contact and excursions outside the home and workplace, and quarantine measures where necessary. In this article, we provide an overview of psychological distress in the current pandemic, identifying protective factors and risk factors. METHODS The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant publications (1 January 2019 - 16 April 2020). This study was registered in OSF Registries (osf.io/34j8g). Data on mental stress and resilience in Germany were obtained from three surveys carried out on more than 1000 participants each in the framework of the COSMO study (24 March, 31 March, and 21 April 2020). RESULTS 18 studies from China and India, with a total of 79 664 participants, revealed increased stress in the general population, with manifestations of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and sleep disturbances. Stress was more marked among persons working in the health care sector. Risk factors for stress included patient contact, female sex, impaired health status, worry about family members and significant others, and poor sleep quality. Protective factors included being informed about the increasing number of persons who have recovered from COVID, social support, and a lower perceived infectious risk. The COSMO study, though based on an insufficiently representative population sample because of a low questionnaire return rate (<20%), revealed increased rates of despondency, loneliness, and hopelessness in the German population as compared to norm data, with no change in estimated resilience. CONCLUSION Stress factors associated with the current pandemic probably increase stress by causing anxiety and depression. Once the protective factors and risk factors have been identified, these can be used to develop psychosocial interventions. The informativeness of the results reported here is limited by the wide variety of instruments used to acquire data and by the insufficiently representative nature of the population samples.","Gilan, Donya; Röthke, Nikolaus; Blessin, Manpreet; Kunzler, Angela; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Müssig, Markus; Yuen, Kenneth S L; Tüscher, Oliver; Thrul, Johannes; Kreuter, Frauke; Sprengholz, Philipp; Betsch, Cornelia; Stieglitz, Rolf Dieter; Lieb, Klaus",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200744/,308

134229,It Can Wait.,2021-04-03,"BACKGROUND Posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) was popularized by Walz and colleagues as an alternative approach to minimally invasive adrenalectomy, offering less postoperative pain and faster return to normal activity compared with laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy (LA). The authors have recently changed from LA to PRA in suitable patients and audited their outcomes. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for 10 patients who underwent PRA, and a chart review and telephone interviews were conducted with 13 consecutive patients who underwent LA by the same surgeon. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, analgesia use, operative and anesthetic time, length of stay, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Data were collected for 13 LAs and 10 PRAs. Patients' baseline characteristics, including age, BMI, and tumor size, were similar between the 2 groups. There were no conversions to open surgery, transfusions, or deaths. Operative time was similar between the 2 groups. PRA patients required less, inpatient postoperative opioid analgesia compared with LA patients (median 1.25 vs. 23 mg of intravenous morphine equivalent, P=0.003), and had a shorter length of stay (median 1 vs. 2 d, P<0.001). The median total days on opioids were lower for PRA patients compared with LA patients (0.5 vs. 9 d, P<0.001). CONCLUSION Our initial results supports previously published findings that PRA is a safe procedure, with a relatively short learning curve, resulting in reduced postoperative analgesia use, and reduced length of hospital stay when compared with the laparoscopic transperitoneal approach.","Cabalag, Miguel S; Mann, Gregory Bruce; Gorelik, Alexandra; Miller, Julie A","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31828fa71f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487160/,308

METHODS Participants with MS(N=15) were randomly assigned into intervention(n=8) or waitlist control(n=7) conditions. The physical activity intervention was delivered over a 16-week period and outcomes were assessed at baseline and immediately following the 16-week period in both conditions. RESULTS There was a significant, positive effect of the intervention on overall RLS severity (p=.01;ηρ2=.43), severity during the night(p=.03,ηρ2=.35), severity during the day while resting(p=.01,ηρ2=.44), and severity during the day while active(p<.01,ηρ2=.61), and non-significant improvements in RLS severity while falling asleep (p=.33,ηρ2=.09). There were significant positive effects on sleep satisfaction(p<.01,ηρ2=.49) and non-significant improvements in self-reported global sleep quality(p=.35,ηρ2=.08). There was a significant intervention effect on self-reported time in bed(p=.03,ηρ2=.37) and total sleep time(p=.03,ηρ2=.36), and non-significant improvements in self-reported sleep latency (p=.08,ηρ2=.25), sleep efficiency(p=.27,ηρ2=.11), and daytime sleepiness (p=.52,ηρ2=.04;p=.35,ηρ2=.08;p=.51,ηρ2=.04). There was no significant effect of the intervention on device-measured sleep quality.

Therefore, we examined differences in body composition by sex and obesity status in Finnish preschool-aged children and within-individual changes in body composition in normal and overweight children. SUBJECT/METHODS Body composition was measured using segmental multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in 476 children and in 781 children at age 3 and 5 years, respectively. Of those, 308 had repeated BIA measurements at both ages. BMI-SDS was used for classification of normal weight and overweight children. RESULTS Sex difference in the amount of lean mass (LM) was already seen at 3 years of age (boys 11.7 kg, girls 11.3 kg; p < 0.001). At 5 years of age, boys had lower fat mass (FM; 3.6 kg vs. 3.9 kg, p < 0.001), lower percent fat mass (%FM; 17.2% vs. 19.1%; p < 0.001), and higher LM (16.0 kg vs. 15.2 kg; p < 0.001) than girls. Overweight children had higher values in FM, %FM, and LM compared with normal weight peers at both ages. Among normal weight children, the increase of LM by age was associated with only minor changes in FM, whereas children who were or became overweight both LM and FM was substantially increased between 3 and 5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS BIA-assessed body composition differs by sex and obesity status already at age of 3 years. For children who are or become overweight at very young age, the patterns for the changes in LM and FM by age are different than for normal weight children.","Leskinen, Tuija; Eloranta, Aino-Maija; Tompuri, Tuomo; Saari, Antti; Ollila, Helena; Mäkelä, Johanna; Niinikoski, Harri; Lagström, Hanna",European journal of clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0678-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647366/,308

135178,Advances in nanomaterial vaccine strategies to address infectious diseases impacting global health.,2020-08-17,"PURPOSE TF12 is a trivalent bispecific antibody that consists of two anti-TROP-2 Fab fragments and one anti-histamine-succinyl-glycine (HSG) Fab fragment. The TROP-2 antigen is found in many epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer (PC), and therefore this bispecific antibody could be suitable for pretargeting in this cancer. In this study, the characteristics and the potential for pretargeted radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy with TF12 and the radiolabeled di-HSG peptide IMP288 in mice with human PC were investigated. METHODS The optimal TF12 protein dose, IMP288 peptide dose, and dose interval for PC targeting were assessed in nude mice with s.c. PC3 xenografts. Immuno-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT was performed using TF12/⁶⁸Ga-IMP288 at optimized conditions. The potential of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) using the TF12 pretargeted ¹⁷⁷Lu-IMP288 was determined. RESULTS TF12 and ¹¹¹In-IMP288 showed high and fast accumulation in the tumor [20.4 ± 0.6%ID/g at 1 h post-injection (p.i.)] at optimized conditions, despite the internalizing properties of TF12. The potential for PRIT was shown by retention of 50% of the ¹¹¹In-IMP288 in the tumor at 48 h p.i. One cycle of treatment with TF12 and ¹⁷⁷Lu-IMP288 showed significant improvement of survival compared to treatment with ¹⁷⁷Lu-IMP288 alone (90 vs. 67 days, p<0.0001) with no renal or hematological toxicity. CONCLUSION TROP-2-expressing PC can be pretargeted efficiently with TF12, with very rapid uptake of the radiolabeled hapten-peptide, IMP288, sensitive immuno-PET, and effective therapy.","van Rij, Catharina M; Lütje, Susanne; Frielink, Cathelijne; Sharkey, Robert M; Goldenberg, David M; Franssen, Gerben M; McBride, William J; Rossi, Edmund A; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-013-2434-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23674207/,308

135375,Too many children miss out on education - but better data can help.,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND For many abdominal surgical interventions, laparotomy has gradually been replaced by laparoscopy, with numerous benefits for the patient in terms of post-operative recovery. However, during laparoscopy, the endoscope only provides a single viewpoint to the surgeon, leaving numerous blind spots and opening the way to peri-operative adverse events. Alternative camera systems have been proposed, but many lack the requisite resolution/robustness for use during surgery or cannot provide real-time images. Here, we present the added value of the Enhanced Laparoscopic Vision System (ELViS) which overcomes these limitations and provides a broad view of the surgical field in addition to the usual high-resolution endoscope. METHODS Experienced laparoscopy surgeons performed several typical procedure steps on a live pig model. The time-to-completion for surgical exercises performed by conventional endoscopy and ELViS-assisted surgery was measured. A debriefing interview following each operating session was conducted by an ergonomist, and a System Usability Scale (SUS) score was determined. RESULTS Proof of concept of ELVIS was achieved in an animal model with seven expert surgeons without peroperative adverse events related to the surgical device. No differences were found in time-to-completion. Mean SUS score was 74.7, classifying the usability of the ELViS as ""good"". During the debriefing interview, surgeons highlighted several situations where the ELViS provided a real advantage (such as during instrument insertion, exploration of the abdominal cavity or for orientation during close work) and also suggested avenues for improvement of the system. CONCLUSIONS This first test of the ELViS prototype on a live animal model demonstrated its usability and provided promising and useful feedback for further development.","Trilling, Bertrand; Mancini, Adrian; Fiard, Gaëlle; Barraud, Pierre Alain; Decrouez, Marion; Vijayan, Sinara; Tummers, Mathias; Faucheron, Jean Luc; Silvent, Sophie; Schwartz, Christel; Voros, Sandrine",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08369-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650002/,308
135730,Magnetostrictively Induced Stationary Entanglement between Two Microwave Fields.,2020-05-29,"COVID-19 derives from infection with Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2] and is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thrombogenic agents resulting in destruction of the lungs. Many reports indicate that a considerable number of patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. However, increasing evidence suggests that many such patients who either recovered from or had mild symptoms after COVID-19 exhibit diffuse, multiorgan, symptoms months after the infection. These symptoms include malaise, myalgias, chest tightness, brain fog and other neuropsychiatric symptoms that were originally reported in children and named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Now the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced the recognition of a similar condition in adults, named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-A). The symptoms characterizing these conditions are very similar to those associated with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS, US ICD-110 code D89.42-idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome). Hence, the possibility of MCAS should be evaluated in any patient with MIS and/or multisystem inflammatory symptoms. In either case, these syndromes should be addressed with liposomal formulation (in olive pomace oil) of the flavone luteolin (e.g. PureLut® or FibroProtek®) together with the antihistamine rupatadine, which also has anti-platelet activating factor (PAF) activity and inhibits mast cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cytokine storms in COVID-19.","Theoharides, T C; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/20-edit3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023287/,308
135785,The moment to see the poor.,2020-04-17,"The degree of cross-linking within acellular dermal matrices (ADM) seems to correlate to neovascularization when used in ventral hernia repair (VHR). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) enhances wound healing through several mechanisms including neovascularization, but research regarding its effect on soft tissue healing in VHR is lacking. We sought to study the effect of cross-linking on PRP-induced neovascularization in a rodent model of bridging VHR. We hypothesized that ADM cross-linking would negatively affect PRP-induced neovessel formation. PRP was extracted and characterized from pooled whole blood. Porcine cross-linked (cADM) and non-cross-linked ADMs (ncADM) were implanted in a rat model of chronic VHR after treatment with saline (control) or PRP. Neovascularization of samples at 2, 4, and 6 weeks was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining of CD 31. Adhesion severity at necropsy was compared using a previously validated scale. Addition of PRP increased neovascularization in both cADM and ncADM at 2- and 4-week time points but appeared to do so in a dependent fashion, with significantly greater neovascularization in the PRP-treated ncADMs compared to cADMs. Omental adhesions were increased in all PRP-treated groups. Results indicate that, for 2-week measurements when compared with the cADM group without PRP therapy, the mean change in neovascularization due to ncADM was 3.27 (Z = 2.75, p = 0.006), PRP was 17.56 (Z = 14.77, p < 0.001), and the combined effect of ncADM and PRP was 9.41 (Z = 5.6, p < 0.001). The 4-week data indicate that the average neovascularization change due to ncADM was 0.676 (Z = 0.7, p = 0.484), PRP was 7.69 (Z = 7.95, p < 0.001), and combined effect of ncADM and PRP was 5.28 (Z = 3.86, p < 0.001). These findings validate PRP as a clinical adjunct to enhance the native tissue response to implantable biomaterials and suggest that ncADM is more amenable than cADM to induced neovascularization. PRP use could be advantageous in patients undergoing VHR where poor incorporation is anticipated and early-enhanced neovascularization is desired.","Fernandez-Moure, Joseph S; Van Eps, Jeffrey L; Peterson, Leif E; Shirkey, Beverly A; Menn, Zachary K; Cabrera, Fernando J; Karim, Azim; Tasciotti, Ennio; Weiner, Bradley K; Ellsworth, Warren A",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28076885/,308

Morbidities investigation includes a process of excluding other possible options until certain suspected cases are confirmed. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we formulated a model under the authorization of the Saudi Ministry of Health to accurately identify cases among admitted suspected cases depending on specific signs and symptoms. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for confirmation of the positive cases. RESULTS The results showed that the number of patients with combined symptoms of fever/sore throat and fever/cough/SOB was significantly higher in confirmed cases than in non-confirmed cases (p<0.05). Besides, the number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases was significantly higher among cases included in the study than excluded cases. It was also clearly demonstrated that fever combined with other symptoms represents 60% of the confirmed cases, which is significantly higher than for cases with other combined symptoms (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, there are no appropriate diagnostic models that can differentiate human MERS-CoV infection among other respiratory infections. Therefore, we recommend the adoption of this newly established model of MERS-CoV to short- list corona suspected cases in Saudi Arabia.","Mohamed, Rania Ali El Hadi; Aleanizy, Fadilah Sfouq; Alqahtani, Fulwah Yahya; Alanazi, Marzouqah Sfouq; Mohamed, Nahla",Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,https://doi.org/10.3923/pjbs.2020.119.125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31944070/,308

In this paper, we ask the question, ""What makes a data-GIF understandable?"" While other storytelling formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and principles for ""data-GIFs"". To close this gap, we provide results from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118 participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108 data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core message.

While its short-term effects are evident, its long-term consequences are a matter of analysis. In this work, the existence of long-lasting negative effects derived from exposure in utero to a great pandemic -1918 influenza pandemic- is analysed for the Argentine case. Outcomes of interest include educational achievement and unemployment status in adulthood -50 years after the pandemic. Based on a regression analysis, temporal differences in the spread of the pandemic and between close birth cohorts are exploited. The results indicate a significant reduction in educational achievement for people exposed in utero to the pandemic. In the region with the highest incidence of cases (Noroeste), this reduction is 0.5 years of education. There are no significant changes in the chances of being unemployed. In the context of climate change, these results constitute a call of attention for the implementation of child protection policies from gestation.","González, Fernando Antonio Ignacio; Dip, Juan Antonio; London, Silvia",Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2021.100409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980404/,308

METHODS During the COVID-19 epidemic, the medical staff divided the patients visiting the emergency department into suspected group, fever group and control group through interview of the patients at triage. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were distributed to each patient, and a trained medical staff was responsible for assisting the patient to complete the scales. RESULTS A total of 557 sets of scales were distributed, including 211 in suspected COVID-19 case group, 167 in fever group and 179 in the control group. A total of 516 scales were retrieved, including 197 in suspected case group, 151 in fever group and 168 in control group. In the 3 groups, the incidence rates of anxiety and depression were 57.87% and 58.88%, 48.34% and 43.71%, and 18.31% and 18.99%, respectively, and the rates were significantly higher in suspected group and fever group than in the control group (P < 0.01), and significantly higher in suspected group than in fever group (P < 0.05). The standardized anxiety and depression scale scores in suspected case group, fever group and control group were 57.38±16.25 and 42.58±14.27, 51.23±15.29 and 38.32±15.39, and 32.58±17.8 and 12.25±12.94, respectively. Compared with the control group, both suspected case group and fever group had significantly higher standard scores for anxiety and depression (P < 0.01), and suspected case group had significantly higher standardized scores than fever group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Among the patients visiting the emergency treatment, the patients with suspected COVID-19 and common fever are more likely to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms.","Wang, Qingxia; Cao, Xiaoxia; Wu, Xiuying; Liu, Jiangfeng; Xie, Jingwen; Hou, Deren",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.09.23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990239/,308

The aims of our study were to investigate: (1) the feasibility of recording plethysmograph indices; and (2) the relationship between pulse pressure variation (ΔPP), plethysmograph variation (ΔPOP) and plethysmograph variability index (PVI) in a diverse group of mechanically ventilated children. A prospective, observational study was performed. Mechanically ventilated children less than 11 years of age, with arterial catheters, were enrolled during the course of their clinical care in the operating room or in the pediatric intensive care unit. Real time monitor waveforms and trend data were recorded. ΔPP and ΔPOP were manually calculated and the relationships between ΔPP, ΔPOP and PVI were compared using Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson correlations. Forty-nine children were recruited; four (8%) subjects were excluded due to poor quality of the plethysmograph waveforms. ΔPP and ΔPOP demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.8439, P < 0.0001) and close agreement (Bias = 1.44 ± 6.4%). PVI was found to correlate strongly with ΔPP (r = 0.7049, P < 0.0001) and ΔPOP (r = 0.715, P < 0.0001).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the parenchymal damage caused by different surgical instruments: a new generation electrosurgical scalpel and two different-wavelength lasers. METHODS Six surgical procedures of pulmonary resection for nodules were performed using a new generation electrosurgical scalpel, a 1318 nm neodymium (Nd:YAG) laser or a 2010 nm thulium laser (two procedures for each instrument). Specimens were analyzed using optical microscopy and scansion electronic microscopy. RESULTS Severe cytostructural damage was found to be present in an average of 1.25 mm in depth from the cutting surface in the patients treated using electrosurgical cautery. The depth of this zone dropped to less than 1 mm in patients treated by laser, being as small as 0.2 mm using the laser with a 2010 nm-wavelength and 0.6 mm with the 1318 nm-wavelength laser. DISCUSSION These preliminary findings support the use of laser to perform conservative pulmonary resections (i.e., metastasectomies), since it is more likely to avoid damage to surrounding structures. Controlled randomized trials are needed to support the clinical usefulness and feasibility of new types of lasers for pulmonary resections.","Scanagatta, Paolo; Pelosi, Giuseppe; Leo, Francesco; Furia, Simone; Duranti, Leonardo; Fabbri, Alessandra; Manfrini, Aldo; Villa, Antonello; Vergani, Barbara; Pastorino, Ugo",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1700/1053.11505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495707/,308

We wished to explore this more formally. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess whether the auscultatory chest signs at presentation in infants with bronchiolitis were influenced by age or by the underlying pathogen. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective opportunistic cohort study, recruiting infants less than 12 months old who presented with bronchiolitis to the Emergency Department of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh. RESULTS Eighty-six infants were recruited. Infants who presented with wheeze were significantly older [26.6 (±1.9) weeks] than those without wheeze [17.3 (±2.1) weeks] (analysis of variance, P=0.002). Those who presented without any chest signs on auscultation were younger than those with chest signs [15.1 (±2.6) weeks compared with 24.4 (±1.7) weeks] (analysis of variance, P=0.006). We did not detect any difference in any of the auscultatory chest signs (crackles, wheeze or absence of signs) depending on the virus responsible for bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION Clinical signs associated with bronchiolitis vary according to age. Infants older than 6 months are more likely to present with wheeze and infants less than 4 months old are likely to present without chest signs on auscultation.","McLellan, Kirsty E; Schwarze, Jürgen; Beattie, Tom",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mej.0000000000000115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24407203/,308

METHODS Blood samples were drawn from patients who underwent a test meal challenge before and 1 year after IMM (n = 15) or RYGB (n = 15). RESULTS Mean HbA1c decreased from 9.7 to 6.4% after RYGB and from 9.1 to 6.1% in the IMM group. At 12 months, the number of diabetes medications used per subject in the RYGB group (2.5 ± 0.5) was less than in the IMM group (4.6 ± 0.3). After RYGB, FGF19 increased in the fasted (93 ± 15 to 152 ± 19 pg/ml; P = 0.008) and postprandial states (area under the curve (AUC), 10.8 ± 1.9 to 23.4 ± 4.1 pg × h/ml × 10(3); P = 0.006) but remained unchanged following IMM. BAs increased after RYGB (AUC ×10(3), 6.63 ± 1.3 to 15.16 ± 2.56 μM × h; P = 0.003) and decreased after IMM (AUC ×10(3), 8.22 ± 1.24 to 5.70 ± 0.70; P = 0.01). No changes were observed in the ratio of 12α-hydroxylated/non-12α-hyroxylated BAs. Following RYGB, FGF19 AUC correlated with BAs (r = 0.54, P = 0.04) and trended negatively with HbA1c (r = -0.44; P = 0.09); these associations were not observed after IMM. CONCLUSIONS BA and FGF19 levels increased after RYGB but not after IMM in subjects who achieved similar improvement in glycemic control. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these hormonal changes facilitate improved glucose homeostasis.","Sachdev, Saachi; Wang, Qi; Billington, Charles; Connett, John; Ahmed, Leaque; Inabnet, William; Chua, Streamson; Ikramuddin, Sayeed; Korner, Judith",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1834-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26259981/,308

Sixty-eight patients with breast cancer admitted in Ningde Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University from February 2014 to August 2015 were collected, and the expression level of KLF9 in cancerous tissue (n=68) and normal tissue (n=68) of the patients was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The relationship between the expression and clinical pathological features and prognosis of patients was analyzed. The expression level of KLF9 in cancerous tissue was significantly lower than that in normal tissue (P<0.05). The expression in breast cancer tissue was not significantly correlated with age, height, menstrual status, lymph node metastasis or pathological differentiation (P>0.05), but was significantly correlated with tumor size and clinical stage (P<0.05). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates in the high expression group were significantly higher than those in the low expression group (P<0.001). Univariate Cox regression analysis was carried out according to the 3-year survival of the patients, and the results showed that tumor size (P=0.009), lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), pathological differentiation (P=0.015), clinical stage (P=0.013), and KLF9 (P=0.018) were factors affecting the survival of breast cancer patients. Subsequently, multivariate Cox regression analysis of the indicators with differences showed that those indicators were independent predictors of survival of breast cancer patients. In conclusion, KLF9 expression is low in breast cancer tissue, and its expression level is related to tumor size and clinical stage. Moreover, tumor size >5 cm, lymph node metastasis, low pathological differentiation, high clinical stage and low expression of KLF9 are all important factors that cause death of patients.","Jiang, Zirong; Xu, Zhiping; Hu, Tinghui; Song, Bin; Li, Feng; Wang, Kaiyin",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724373/,308

Less attention has been paid to stigmatism, psychological well-being, hope, and religiosity, and how these may impact a patient's recovery. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to detect the difference in religiosity, hope, self-stigma, and psychological well-being (PWB) due to demographic variables (age, education level, social status, and level of income). Additionally, the research sought to test the mediation role of religiosity and hope in the relationship between self-stigma and psychological well-being among COVID-19 patients. METHOD A random sample of 426 COVID-19 patients answered an online questionnaire that contained four scales (Religiosity, Hope, stigma, and PWB). The data collected from the study participants were analyzed quantitatively by using One-way ANOVA, Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA, Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA, and Structural Equation Model (IBM SPSS statistics 21, and Amos v.25). RESULTS The current results showed statistically significant differences due to age in hope and well-being, in favor of the sample members belonging to the age group from 30 years old and over old, while there were no differences in religiosity and stigma due to age. There were no differences due to education level in religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being. Results showed statistically significant differences in well-being in favor of the married group, while there were no differences in religiosity, hope, and stigma due to social status. Regarding the effect of income level in the study variables, the results showed no differences due to religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being. Moreover, the findings found that both religiosity and hope play a mediating role. CONCLUSION Religiosity and hope play a mediating role in the relationship between stigma associated with COVID-19 and psychological well-being.

The clinical and immunologic spectrum of MIS-C and its relationship to other inflammatory conditions of childhood have not been studied in detail. METHODS We retrospectively studied confirmed cases of MIS-C at our institution from March to June 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory studies and treatment response were collected. Data were compared with historic cohorts of Kawasaki disease (KD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). RESULTS Twenty-eight patients fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C. Median age at presentation was 9 years (range 1 month to 17 years); 50% of patients had pre-existing conditions. All patients had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventeen patients (61%) required intensive care, including 7 patients (25%) requiring inotrope support. Seven patients (25%) met criteria for complete or incomplete KD and coronary abnormalities were found in 6 cases. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation in inflammatory markers, D-dimer, B-type natriuretic peptide, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were common but not ubiquitous. Cytopenias distinguished MIS-C from KD and the degree of hyperferritinemia and pattern of cytokine production differed between MIS-C and MAS. Immunomodulatory therapy given to MIS-C patients included IVIG (71%), corticosteroids (61%) and anakinra (18%). Clinical and laboratory improvement were observed in all cases, including 6 cases that did not require immunomodulatory therapy. No mortality was recorded in this cohort. CONCLUSION MIS-C encompasses a broad phenotypic spectrum with clinical and laboratory features distinct from Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome.

The aim of this study was to assess ethical issues of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related research proposals submitted during the early stages of pandemic in Nepal. METHODS Retrospective analysis of COVID-19 related research proposals and their informed consent document submitted to the ethical review board at Nepal Health Research Council was done for the study. The analysis was done as per the National Ethical Guidelines, Standard Operating Procedure for Health Research in Nepal and World Health Organization guidelines for infectious disease outbreak, 2016 under ethically relevant headings. Descriptive data were analyzed in SPSS v24. RESULTS The major issues were observed in the informed consent documents where 55% were lacking principal investigator's contact information, 68% not having participant selection criteria, 70% without clear informed consent taking process, 57% without explanation of possible risks. Similarly, 68% of the interventional studies' consent form didn't mention possible adverse events and mitigation mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS Most of the research proposals related to COVID-19 were devoid of major ethical elements which took longer time for receiving approval and eventually delayed the opportunity for evidence generation in critical time. More attention is needed to increase awareness and to develop capacity of researchers, reviewers, ethics committees and relevant stakeholders at the time of health emergencies.","Ghimire, Namita; Hamal, Pawan Kumar; Panthee, Asmita; Vaidya, Anju; Khadka, Mira; Mahato, Namra Kumar; Karn, Mukesh Kumar; Verma, Shashi; Dhimal, Meghnath; Ghimire, Prakash; Gyanwali, Pradip",Journal of Nepal Health Research Council,https://doi.org/10.33314/jnhrc.v19i1.3373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934150/,308

143768,Implantation of a Tissue-Engineered Tubular Heart Valve in Growing Lambs.,2017,"Inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is mostly due to activation of the innate immune system, in which Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key player. Anemia of CKD may also be due to erythropoietin (EPO) resistance, clinically associated with inflammation. IL-1 receptor antagonist knockout (RaKO) mice show arthritis and excessive inflammation. Inhibition of IL-1 was shown to be beneficial in many inflammatory conditions, but its role in CKD and anemia is unknown. Here, we report that enhanced inflammation in RaKO mice with CKD provoked both higher degrees of renal insufficiency and anemia in comparison to wild-type CKD, in association with a downregulation of renal hypoxia inducible factor-2 (HIF2) as well as decreased bone marrow EPO-receptor (EPOR) and transferrin receptor (TFR). In contrast, administration of P2D7KK, an anti-IL1b monoclonal antibody, to CKD mice results in a lower grade of systemic inflammation, better renal function and blunted anemia. The latter was associated with upregulation of renal HIF-2α, bone marrow EPO-R and TFR. Altogether, this supports the key role of inflammation, and IL-1 particularly, in CKD progression and anemia. Novel treatments to reduce inflammation through this and other pathways, may improve renal function, attenuate the anemic state or increase the response to exogenous EPO.","Bandach, Inbar; Segev, Yael; Landau, Daniel",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85778-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737665/,308
143848,HED: Trying to work our way back to normal.,2020-11-30,"Building capacity is synonymous with sustaining development. Both are required to fuel progress and propel efforts towards heightening health and security. The urgency to build capacity has been catalysed by an increasing number of sanitary crises, threats, and disease outbreaks that have spanned countries, regions and continents. Education has often bridged the gaps in learning, but it has also divided the ways in which learning is practised. Differing cultural, religious and political beliefs, together with alternate economic priorities, have meant that countries have been advocating for education to meet their own specific needs, and not necessarily those of the international community. The varying contents of veterinary curricula around the world do not always demonstrate that the initial education of veterinary students provides them with the necessary skill sets to fulfil their responsibilities as key actors in the private and public sectors of national Veterinary Services. This has resulted in discrepancies in the competencies acquired by veterinarians and their capacities to uphold good veterinary governance and practices. To address this educational imbalance, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has drafted recommendations and guidelines to assist Veterinary Education Establishments worldwide with improving the breadth and depth of their veterinary curricula in order to strengthen their national Veterinary Services. The OIE has, furthermore, developed a twinning programme for Veterinary Education Establishments, under which learning opportunities for teaching staff and students are created and shared. Twinning has, to date, proved to be an effective and powerful mechanism through which developments in veterinary education through mutual capacity and confidence-building can be sustained.","Wong, V; Clavel, M; Dehove, A",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.36.2.2686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30152451/,308

There is a dearth of evidence on mechanisms to provide optimum quality care to COVID-19 patients in the resource-constrained healthcare environment. The lessons learned from the Ebola virus outbreak for the deficient health systems and quality improvement are considered to propose strengthening the health systems response to deliver quality-assured care to patients during the current pandemic. In this regard, the World Health Organization (WHO) health systems framework can serve as a guiding principle towards providing quality-assured and safe healthcare services during the ongoing pandemic in Pakistan by ensuring the availability of an adequate workforce, medical supplies and equipment, strong governance, active information system, and adequate health financing to effectively manage COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to determine the interobserver agreement of a 3-point grading system for assessing the angiographic outcome after flow diversion therapy of intracranial, saccular aneurysms and to determine factors affecting such agreement. MATERIALS AND METHODS After approval by the institutional review board, 5 independent readers assessed pretreatment and follow-up digital subtraction angiograms from 96 patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device by using a 3-point grading system (complete, near-complete, and incomplete occlusion). ""Minor discrepancy"" was defined as a difference between any 2 readers of 1 grade, that is, complete vs near-complete or near-complete vs incomplete. ""Major discrepancy"" was defined as a difference between any 2 readers in which 1 reader noted complete occlusion and the other reader noted incomplete occlusion. We performed statistical analysis for the interobserver agreement by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Subgroup analyses for discrepancy rate and ICC were performed for previously coiled aneurysms. RESULTS The interobserver agreement was excellent (ICC, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92). Among 96 cases, there was absolute agreement in 74 (77%), of which 67 had unanimous consensus of ""complete"" occlusion, 2 ""near-complete"" occlusion, and 5 ""incomplete"" occlusion. Discordance between any 2 readers was noted in 22 cases (23%), of which 7 (7.3%) revealed a major discrepancy. Subgroup analysis showed that minor discrepancies were more common among patients previously treated with coils vs those not previously treated with coils (37.5% vs 11.2%; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS The observer agreement regarding occlusion after PED therapy is excellent. Only a minority of cases demonstrated discrepancy considered as major in this study.","Suh, S H; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G; Woodward, K; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

METHODS We carried out a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Studies of adult patients with short-term NSAID use during acute lower respiratory tract infections, including bacterial and viral infections, were included. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular, renal and respiratory complications. RESULTS In total, eight studies including two randomised controlled trials, three retrospective and three prospective observational studies enrolling 44140 patients were included. Five of the studies were in patients with pneumonia, two in patients with Influenza, and one in patients with acute bronchitis. Meta-analysis was not possible due to significant heterogeneity. There was a trend towards a reduction in mortality and an increase in pleuro-pulmonary complications. However, all studies exhibited high risks of bias, primarily due to lack of adjustment for confounding variables. Cardiovascular outcomes were not reported by any of the included studies. CONCLUSION In this systematic review of NSAID use during acute lower respiratory tract infections in adults, we found that the existing evidence for mortality, pleuro-pulmonary complications and rates of mechanical ventilation or organ failure is of extremely poor quality, very low certainty and should be interpreted with caution. Mechanistic and clinical studies addressing the captioned subject are urgently needed, especially in relation to COVID-19.","Vaja, Ricky; Chan, Jeffery; Ferreira, Plinio; Harky, Amer; Rogers, Luke J; Gashaw, Hime H; Kirkby, Nicholas S; Mitchell, Jane A",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805057/,308

In present study, two HRW treatments: foliar application (F-HRW) and irrigation (I-HRW) were applied on the two fragrant rice cultivars, Yuxiangyouzhan and Xiangyaxiangzhan, grown under normal and salt stress conditions, i.e., 0 and 150 mmol NaCl L-1, respectively. Plants without HRW application were grown as control (CK). Results showed that the dry weight per unit plant height (mg cm-1) was increased by 12.6% and 23.0% in F-HRW and I-HRW, respectively under salt stress as compared with CK. Application of HRW, regardless of the application method, modulated the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) while reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) contents under salt stress. Moreover, significant and positive relations were observed among total dry weight and shoot dry weight, dry weight per unit plant height, SOD and CAT activity in root. Overall, F-HRW application modulated the early growth and related physiological attributes in fragrant rice under salt stress whereas I-HRW was found to mitigate salt stress. Novelty statement: Involvement of endogenous H2 in plants for regulating various physiological functions is of great importance to stimulate and/or activate the antioxidant defense responses against oxidative stress; however, there is a lack of research in this aspect. The present study investigated the effects of hydrogen rich water (HRW) on the growth and physiological attributes of two fragrant rice cultivars grown under salt-stress. It was noteworthy to find that application of HRW either foliar application or irrigation improved the morphological characters, i.e., dry weight per unit plant height and enhanced the activities of antioxidants, i.e., peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase whilst decreased the malonaldehyde content. Overall, the application of HRW modulates plant growth and physiological attributes in fragrant rice cultivars under salt-stress conditions. This study will be helpful in improving the early growth and/or stand establishment of fragrant rice nursery under saline conditions.","Fu, Xiaomeng; Ma, Lin; Gui, Runfei; Ashraf, Umair; Li, Yuzhan; Yang, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Jianwen; Imran, Muhammad; Tang, Xiangru; Tian, Hua; Mo, Zhaowen",International journal of phytoremediation,https://doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2021.1889963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617358/,308

EXAMINATION AND DIAGNOSIS On admission, the patient had subfebrile temperatures, exercise dyspnea, and right-basal rales. CRP was moderately elevated and oxygen saturation was slightly reduced. Thoracic CT showed bilateral ground-glass infiltrates. Immediately after the cruise a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. THERAPY AND COURSE Due to the fact that the patient's asymptomatic wife had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immediately after returning from the cruise, we suspected COVID-19 disease and admitted the patient to our isolation ward. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchial lavage yielded negative results for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, suspected COVID-19 diagnosis was verified serologically. CONCLUSION In case of a high degree of clinical suspicion in combination with typical findings of thoracic imaging, the suspected diagnosis COVID-19 disease should be maintained even in case of multiple negative SARS-CoV-2-PCR.

METHODS With institutional review board approval, a 20-year quality assurance database verified against the radiology information system was queried for procedure location (eg, pleura, liver, bowel, and abdomen) and type (eg, biopsy, catheter insertion, and transient drainage), demographics, and change over time. Yearly admissions and new hospital numbers assigned each year served to normalize for overall hospital activity. RESULTS A total of 50,195 IR procedures were performed in 24,309 distinct patients (male:female, 12,625:11,684; average age, 60 years), 940 procedures performed in age <20 years, and 571 procedures performed in patients aged ≥90 years. A total of 15345, 4377, and 1754 patients had one, two, or three procedures, respectively; 470 had ≥10 procedures. Twenty-seven supervising radiologists and 277 individuals participated as operators, double the previous decade. Biopsy (4.8% average yearly increase), abdominal drainage (7.3%), paracentesis (12.9%), tube manipulation (13.0%), suprapubic bladder tube insertion (21.0%), and gastrostomy (44.6%) all increased strongly (P < .001) over 120 months but not biliary drainage, nephrostomy, or chest tubes. Procedures increased faster than either admissions or new hospital numbers (P < .001). For each 1000 new hospital numbers, IR service performed 48 procedures versus 31 the previous decade (P < .0005).

The aim of the study was to analyze the needle's clinical performance when sampling solid lesions and to assess the safety of this device. Methods We performed a multicenter retrospective study of patients undergoing EUS-FNB during July 1-November 15, 2016. Results Two hundred patients (121 males and 79 females) underwent EUS-FNB of solid lesions with the Acquire needle. Lesions included solid pancreatic masses (n = 109), adenopathy (n = 45), submucosal lesions (n = 34), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 8), liver lesions (n = 6), and other (n = 8). Mean lesion size was 30.6 mm (range: 3-100 mm). The mean number of passes per target lesion was 3 (range: 1-7). Rapid onsite cytologic evaluation (ROSE) by a cytologist was performed in all cases. Tissue obtained by EUS-FNB was adequate for evaluation and diagnosis by ROSE in 197/200 cases (98.5%). Data regarding the presence or absence of a core of tissue obtained after EUS-FNB were available in 145/200 procedures. In 131/145 (90%) of cases, a core of tissue was obtained. Thirteen out of 200 patients (6.5%) underwent some form of repeat EUS-based tissue acquisition after EUS-FNB with the Acquire needle. There were no adverse events. Conclusion Overall, this study showed a high rate of tissue adequacy and production of a tissue core with this device with no adverse events seen in 200 patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS • The study comprised 28 patients who underwent LESS pyeloplasty by a single surgeon from October 2007. • A chart review was undertaken to identify the complications that occurred within the first 30 days after surgery. RESULTS • The mean operating time was 197 min. • Seven patients (25%) experienced a total of eight complications. Four patients required nephrostomy tube placement (14%) during the early postoperative period, two for symptomatic obstruction despite the ureteral stent and two for a urine leak. Another had urine leakage that resolved spontaneously after she went home with the surgical drain for 1 week. One patient (4%) developed a retroperitoneal haematoma and required blood transfusion and one had haematuria that prolonged hospital stay by 2 days. • Of the patients experiencing complications, 71% were in the first ten cases. Only two complications occurred in the subsequent 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS • The LESS pyeloplasty procedure is a technically difficult, even for an experienced laparoscopic surgeon and the surgical challenges of this technique may translate to a higher complication rate for LESS than for conventional laparoscopic pyeloplasty early in the learning curve. However, within a relatively few cases, the complication rate is similar to that of standard laparoscopic pyeloplasty. • Additional follow-up is required to determine the long-term success rate.","Best, Sara L; Donnally, Chester; Mir, Saad A; Tracy, Chad R; Raman, Jay D; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2011.10078.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410632/,308

We adopted pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis in the upper mediastinum under such circumstances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. METHODS Two hundred and ten patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction from 1998 to 2013. Among them, 6 patients underwent colon interposition (colon group) and 13 underwent jejunum reconstruction (jejunum group) including 8 thoracoscopic anastomosis. The operative results of both groups were compared with those of 191 gastric tube reconstructions (stomach group). RESULTS The operative times in the colon and jejunum groups were significantly longer than that in the stomach group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively). The colon group showed more operative blood loss and more frequent anastomotic leakage and ischemic stenosis of the conduit than did the stomach group (1605 vs. 530 g, P = 0.007; 50 vs. 12.6 %, P = 0.035; 16.7 vs. 0 %, P = 0.03, respectively). There was no anastomotic leakage, conduit necrosis and mortality in the jejunum group. Ischemic stenosis of the conduit occurred more frequently in jejunum group than in the stomach group (23.1 vs. 0 %, P < 0.001). However, the stenosis could be managed safely with endoscopic treatment. Patient survival in the colon and jejunum groups was consistent with that in the stomach group. CONCLUSIONS Pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis can be performed safely under thoracotomy or thoracoscopic surgery when stomach cannot be used as an esophageal substitute after esophagectomy.","Ninomiya, Itasu; Okamoto, Kouichi; Oyama, Katsunobu; Hayashi, Hironori; Miyashita, Tomoharu; Tajima, Hidehiro; Kitagawa, Hirohisa; Fushida, Sachio; Fujimura, Takashi; Ohta, Tetsuo",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-014-0435-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917205/,308

Kinetic studies showed that acidic conditions were more conducive to the ozone degradation of BPAF than alkaline conditions. In the presence of common anions, Br- and SO42- promoted the degradation of BPAF, whereas NO2-, NO3-, HSO3- inhibited the degradation, and the other anions and cations had no significant effect. The degradation products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and were mainly manifested in hydroxylation, carboxylation and cleavage of benzene ring. The addition of NO2-, HSO3- and Br-produced the corresponding free radicals, resulting in the parent compound being attacked and affecting the degradation efficiency and pathways. The theoretical calculated results showed that the ortho-site of the BPAF phenolic hydroxyl group was more active than the meta-position, and it's more likely for free radicals to attack ortho-sites and initiate substitution reactions. Toxicity assessment of the products in the process of ozone degradation showed that toxicity of the products was reduced by benzene ring cleavage and a reduction in the F atomic number. However, the toxicity of nitro and brominated products of BPAF was increased. These findings provide some new insights into the role of common ions in ozonation process and product formation, and supplement the existing conclusions. The results of this study remind future researchers to concern that inorganic ions in real water may be converted into corresponding free radicals that affect the formation of ozone oxidation products.","Tian, Jie; Li, Beibei; Qu, Ruijuan; Zhou, Dongmei; Sun, Cheng; Wang, Zunyao; Zhu, Feng",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399270/,308

Given the overwhelming evidence of both the cost to society of HTN and the benefits that are accrued from improved BP control, alternatives or adjuncts to current management options have been sought to aid in treatment of these patients. Over the past few years, a device-based approach involving modulation of the autonomic nervous system, termed renal denervation, has evolved to meet this challenge. With early trials showing startlingly good results, with few side effects, multiple devices were fast-tracked to clinical trials and hence to the market. However, larger trials have shone an unfavorable light on the field, with concerns about the short- and long-term effectiveness, diverting attention back to operational and procedural details. Despite this, image-guided manipulation of the sympathetic nervous system to treat HTN remains a fertile area of laboratory and clinical research.","Moriarty, John M; Tung, Roderick; Bradfield, Jason S; McWilliams, Justin; Lee, Edward W; Kuo, Michael D",Journal of laboratory automation,https://doi.org/10.1177/2211068215605838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26384401/,308

Enhanced surveillance systems for early threat detection will be crucial to maximizing response time for implementation of public health measures and mobilization of resources in containing an emerging pandemic. Recent outbreaks have been dominated by viral pathogens with RNA respiratory viruses being the most likely to have pandemic potential. These should therefore be a preparedness priority. Tools in the areas of virology, drug discovery, clinical pharmacology, translational medicine, and pharmacometrics should be considered key components in the rapid identification and development of existing and novel interventions for a pandemic response. Prioritization of therapeutics should be based on in vitro activity, likelihood of achieving effective drug concentrations at the site of action, and safety profile at the doses that will be required for clinical efficacy. Deployment strategies must be tailored to the epidemiology of the disease, and the adequacy of the response should be re-evaluated in view of evolving epidemiological factors. An interdisciplinary framework integrating drug pharmacology, viral kinetics, epidemiology and health economics could help optimize the deployment strategy by improving decision-making around who to treat, when to treat, and with what type of intervention for optimal outcomes. Lastly, while an effective vaccine will ultimately end a pandemic, antiviral drug intervention guided by clinical pharmacology principles will continue to play a critical role in any pandemic response.","Davda, Jasmine; Reynolds, Kellie; Davis, John D; Smith, Patrick F",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855747/,308
151908,Volatility of vaccine confidence.,2021-03-26,"Labor issues related to the nursing profession have been gaining prominence in Taiwan as well as overseas. In 2016, the United Nations highlighted the importance of societies investing sufficient funds in their professional nurses to support and promote public health, gender equality, and economic growth. Good-quality care requires that nurses have good physical and mental health, while creating and maintaining a friendly nursing work environment rely on cooperation among the government, labor unions, and hospitals. Over the past decade, the Taiwan government has increasingly promoted relevant regulations and established a friendly platform to allow nursing staffs to identify problems and report labor rights violations. In addition, nurses have formed unions to defend and advocate for their professional rights. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, the Department of Nursing and Health Care of the Ministry of Health and Welfare actively proposed policies related to creating and maintaining good nursing work environments. The Taiwan Nursing and Medical Industries Union took a supervisory role in this process, providing feedback on policies from the perspective of Taiwan's professional nurses and arguing for the reasonable and fair subsidization of epidemic prevention facilities, implementation of mask and protective equipment, nursing labor rights, and social respect for the nursing profession. Much work still needs to be done to improve the domestic working environment for nursing staffs, including improving and expanding education, normalizing and effectively utilizing nursing staff feedback and whistleblowing information, promoting information transparency, and implementing better policies. We hope that a friendlier nursing work environment will attract many more outstanding young persons to pursue a career in nursing.","Chen, Yu-Feng; Yang, Wan-Ping",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.6224/jn.202012_67(6).03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274421/,308

This study aimed to examine the perceived psychological distress and relationship quality among couples before and during MCO in Malaysia and factors predictive of participants' well-being. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Perceived Relationship Quality Component Inventory, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale were disseminated through the snowball sampling technique. The study found that the participants (N = 124) perceived significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during MCO compared with before MCO. However, no significant differences between the couples were found before and during MCO in relationship quality, except in the trust subscale. Trust on the couple was higher during MCO. Multiple regression results showed that depression and stress predicted participants' well-being negatively during MCO. In contrast, total relationship quality, sexual relationship quality, satisfaction, and trust predicted participants' well-being positively.","Chua, Bee Seok; Siau, Ching Sin; Fitriana, Mimi; Low, Wah-Yun; Abdul Wahab Khan, Rahmattullah Khan Bin",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395211014322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955254/,308

But does it matter?,2020-07-17,"OCD has lagged behind other psychiatric illnesses in the identification of molecular treatment targets, due in part to a lack of significant findings in genome-wide association studies. However, while progress in this area is being made, OCD's symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, and anxiety can be deconstructed into distinct neural functions that can be dissected in animal models. Studies in rodents and non-human primates have highlighted the importance of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits in OCD pathophysiology, and emerging studies in human post-mortem brain tissue point to glutamatergic synapse abnormalities as a potential cellular substrate for observed dysfunctional behaviors. In addition, accumulated evidence points to a potential role for neuromodulators including serotonin and dopamine in both OCD pathology and treatment. Here, we review current efforts to use animal models for the identification of molecules, cell types, and circuits relevant to OCD pathophysiology. We start by describing features of OCD that can be modeled in animals, including circuit abnormalities and genetic findings. We then review different strategies that have been used to study OCD using animal model systems, including transgenic models, circuit manipulations, and dissection of OCD-relevant neural constructs. Finally, we discuss how these findings may ultimately help to develop new treatment strategies for OCD and other related disorders.","Chamberlain, Brittany L; Ahmari, Susanne E",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2020_196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763819/,308

This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to determine the analgesic effect, safety, acceptability, effect on function, and relative rank according to analgesic effect, safety, acceptability, and effect on function of a single course of [an] analgesic medicine(s) or combination of these medicines for people with low back pain. METHODS We will include published and unpublished randomised trials written in any language that compare an analgesic medicine to either another medicine, placebo/sham, or no intervention in adults with low back pain, grouped according to pain duration: acute (fewer than 6 weeks), sub-acute (6 to 12 weeks), and chronic (greater than 12 weeks). The co-primary outcomes are pain intensity following treatment and safety (adverse events). The secondary outcomes are function and acceptability (all-cause dropouts). We will perform a network meta-analysis to compare and rank analgesic medicines. We will form judgements of confidence in the results using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) methodology.

152881,European science in the de-globalizing world.,2020-04-26,"BACKGROUND Psychiatrists in clinical practice face a number of stressors related to patient care, such as overwork. On the other hand, they gain satisfaction from their work. We quantified and assessed the potential relationship between levels of occupational stress, satisfaction, and depressive symptoms among Japanese clinical psychiatrists. We surveyed 206 psychiatrists with up to 15 years of clinical experience who primarily worked in patient care. Levels of occupational stress and occupational satisfaction were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale and the level of depressive symptoms was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Workplace stressors and satisfiers were also evaluated. RESULTS Out of 206 psychiatrists, 154 (74.8%) responded to the survey. The respondents' mean (SD) age was 34.3 (5.2) years. The estimated prevalence of significant depressive symptoms was 34.4% (n = 53), and the experienced frequent violence was 14.9% (n = 23). The level of depressive symptoms was inversely correlated with the level of occupational satisfaction. In respondents who reported a moderate level of occupational stress, having fewer depressive symptoms was associated with higher occupational satisfaction, but this association was not significant in those who reported a high level of stress. In addition, high occupational satisfaction was associated with interest towards work content, ability to work at one's discretion, opportunities for growth and career development, and ease of communication with supervisors and colleagues. CONCLUSIONS Nearly one-third of the psychiatrists screened positive for significant depressive symptoms. Having fewer depressive symptoms was associated with higher occupational satisfaction in those who reported a moderate level of stress. Implications from the present findings may be to enhance occupational satisfaction by discussing work interests with a supervisor, as well as increased opportunities for career development, which may prevent depression among psychiatrists.","Koreki, Akihiro; Nakagawa, Atsuo; Abe, Akiko; Ikeuchi, Hidetsugu; Okubo, Jo; Oguri, Atsushi; Orimo, Keisuke; Katayama, Nariko; Sato, Hiroyo; Shikimoto, Ryo; Nishiyama, Go; Nogami, Waka; Haki, Kazuma; Hayashi, Tetsuro; Fukagawa, Yuko; Funaki, Kei; Matsuzawa, Mia; Matsumoto, Ayako; Mimura, Masaru",BMC research notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-015-1054-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25885051/,308

PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to obtain insight into providers' satisfaction with services offered by health-system integrated specialty pharmacies and to determine whether providers' perceptions of services offered under an integrated model differ from perceptions of external specialty pharmacy services. METHODS A multi-site, cross-sectional, online survey of specialty clinic healthcare providers at 10 academic health systems with integrated specialty pharmacies was conducted. The questionnaire was developed by members of the Vizient Specialty Pharmacy Outcomes and Benchmarking Workgroup and was pretested at 3 pilot sites prior to dissemination. Prescribers of specialty medications within each institution were identified and sent an email invitation to participate in the study that included a link to the anonymous questionnaire. Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with 10 statements regarding quality of services of integrated and external specialty pharmacies on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). An analysis to determine differences in providers' overall satisfaction with the integrated and external specialty pharmacy practice models, as well as differences in satisfaction scores for each of the 10 statements, was performed using paired-samples t tests. RESULTS The mean (SD) score for overall satisfaction with integrated specialty pharmacies was significantly higher than the score for satisfaction with external specialty pharmacies: 4.72 (0.58) vs 2.97 (1.20); 95% confidence interval, 1.64-1.87; P < 0.001. Provider ratings of the integrated specialty pharmacy model were also higher for all 10 items evaluating the quality of services (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION The study results confirm that the health-system integrated specialty pharmacy practice model, implemented at institutions across the United States, promotes high rates of provider satisfaction with services and perceived benefits.","Anguiano, Rebekah H; Zuckerman, Autumn D; Hall, Elizabeth; Diamantides, Erica; Kumor, Lisa; Duckworth, Deborah L; Peter, Megan; Sorgen, Patrick J; Nathanson, Amy; Kandah, Huda-Marie; Dura, Jillian; Campbell, Udobi",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33677493/,308

In every case, the N-methylporphyrinoids exhibited weaker, bathochromically shifted UV-vis absorptions compared to their core unsubstituted congeners. However, proton NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that these derivatives retained strong diamagnetic ring currents and the presence of the internal alkyl substituents had little effect on the global aromatic characteristics. Nevertheless, the UV-vis spectra of N-methyl-oxybenzi- and N-methyl-oxypyriporphyrins were dramatically altered and gave greatly weakened absorptions. N-Methyl-oxybenzi- and N-methyltropiporphyrins reacted with palladium(II) acetate to give stable palladium(II) complexes, demonstrating that N-alkylation alters the metalation properties for these carbaporphyrinoids. The organometallic derivatives also retained strongly aromatic properties, and the proton NMR spectra showed the N-methyl resonances near -3 ppm. N-Methylcarbaporphyrin-2-carbaldehyde also gave a palladium(II) complex but this gradually rearranged at higher temperatures to afford a C-methyl complex. The results demonstrate that core alkylation of porphyrinoids greatly alters the reactivity and spectroscopic properties for these systems.","Latham, Alissa N; Lash, Timothy D",The Journal of organic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c01737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940469/,308

However, complications principally of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure can occur rapidly. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease, is similar to Covid-19 in that most infections are mild or asymptomatic and only a small number develop ARDS. Cytokine storm is considered to be the main incriminating factor in both. High dose steroids have been used to ameliorate the effects in leptospirosis, and similarly, reports suggest a benefit in Covid-19. SARS CoV-2 and leptospira, one a virus and the other a bacterium, are two species separated by millions of years of evolution, but producing illnesses with similar spectra, with cytokine storm being the common precipitating factor.

In order to diagnose COVID-19 more quickly, in this paper, a depthwise separable DenseNet was proposed. The paper constructed a deep learning model with 2 905 chest X-ray images as experimental dataset. In order to enhance the contrast, the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithm was used to preprocess the X-ray image before network training, then the images were put into the training network and the parameters of the network were adjusted to the optimal. Meanwhile, Leaky ReLU was selected as the activation function. VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, DenseNet121 and SDenseNet models were used to compare with the model proposed in this paper. Compared with ResNet34, the proposed classification model of pneumonia had improved 2.0%, 2.3% and 1.5% in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively. Compared with the SDenseNet network without depthwise separable convolution, number of parameters of the proposed model was reduced by 43.9%, but the classification effect did not decrease. It can be found that the proposed DWSDenseNet has a good classification effect on the COVID-19 chest X-ray images dataset. Under the condition of ensuring the accuracy as much as possible, the depthwise separable convolution can effectively reduce number of parameters of the model.","Feng, Yibo; Qiu, Dawei; Cao, Hui; Zhang, Junzhong; Xin, Zaihai; Liu, Jing",Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.7507/1001-5515.202005056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840070/,308

This study aims to assess the state of knowledge of seasonal influenza epidemiology in Africa and identify potential data gaps for policy formulation following the 2009 pandemic. Method We reviewed articles from Africa published into four databases namely: MEDLINE (PubMed), Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Scientific Research Publishing from 2010 to 2019. Results We screened titles and abstracts of 2070 studies of which 311 were selected for full content evaluation and 199 studies were considered.

155097,The camel connection.,2014,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Ischemic lesion volume (ILV) assessed by follow-up noncontrast computed tomography correlates only moderately with clinical end points, such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We hypothesized that the association between follow-up noncontrast computed tomography ILV and outcome as assessed with mRS 3 months after stroke is strengthened when taking the mRS relevance of the infarct location into account. METHODS An anatomic atlas with 66 areas was registered to the follow-up noncontrast computed tomographic images of 254 patients from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). The anatomic brain areas were divided into brain areas of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance as reported in the literature. Based on this distinction, the ILV in brain areas of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance was assessed for each patient. Binary and ordinal logistic regression analyses with and without adjustment for known confounders were performed to assess the association between the ILVs of different mRS relevance and outcome. RESULTS The odds for a worse outcome (higher mRS) were markedly higher given an increase of ILV in brain areas of high mRS relevance (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-1.55 per 10 mL) compared with an increase in total ILV (odds ratios, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.19 per 10 mL). Regression models using ILV in brain areas of high mRS relevance instead of total ILV showed a higher quality. CONCLUSIONS The association between follow-up noncontrast computed tomography ILV and outcome as assessed with mRS 3 months after stroke is strengthened by accounting for the mRS relevance of the affected brain areas. Future prediction models should account for the ILV in brain areas of high mRS relevance.","Ernst, Marielle; Boers, Anna M M; Aigner, Annette; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Yoo, Albert J; Roos, Yvo B; Dippel, Diederik W J; van der Lugt, Aad; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van Zwam, Wim H; Fiehler, Jens; Marquering, Henk A; Majoie, Charles B L M",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.117.017513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28765288/,308

MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively analyzed data from 16 patients with severe to moderate AIS and CT angiography demonstration of large intracranial vessel occlusion treated with SETA between July 2013 and March 2014. We evaluated recanalization rate, clinical outcome after 90 days as well as differential costs of aspiration and stent-assisted thrombectomy. RESULTS A group of 16 patients met the eligibility criteria to undergo ET with a baseline NIHSS score of 22 (range 12-39). In 15/16 cases, we obtained target vessel recanalization, 11 cases with ADAPT technique alone. Modified rankin score (mRS) at 90 days follow-up was ≤2 in 9/16 patients (56%). ADAPT technique had a lower device-related cost than stent-assisted thrombectomy leading to an overall saving of -2,747.28 . CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary data suggest that a SETA beginning with direct aspiration could be useful to optimize ET of stroke in terms of invasiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness allowing recanalization with low complication rate.","Comai, Alessio; Haglmüller, Thomas; Ferro, Federica; Dall'Ora, Elisa; Currò Dossi, Roberto; Bonatti, Giampietro",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-015-0501-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652155/,308
155628,Update on the Opioid Crisis.,2020,"BACKGROUND Optimal treatment of superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears is controversial, in part because the dynamic role of the long head of the biceps muscle (LHBM) in the glenohumeral joint is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine dynamic LHBM behavior during shoulder activity by studying (1) the electromyographic activity of the LHBM during shoulder motion, (2) the effect of elbow immobilization on this activity, and (3) the effect of a load applied to the distal humerus on this activity. HYPOTHESIS The LHBM would not play a significant role in active glenohumeral range of motion. STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. METHODS Thirteen normal volunteers underwent surface electromyography (EMG) measurement of the LHBM, short head biceps muscle (SHBM), deltoid, infraspinatus, and brachioradialis during shoulder motion from the neutral position (0° of rotation, flexion, and abduction) to 45° of flexion, 90° of flexion, 45° of abduction, and 90° of abduction. These motions were repeated both with and without splint immobilization of the forearm and elbow at 100° of flexion and neutral rotation and with and without a 1-kg weight placed on the lateral distal humerus. RESULTS Mean EMG activity within the LHBM and the SHBM was low (≤11.6% ± 9.1%). LHBM activity was significant increased by flexion and abduction (P < .049 in all cases), while SHBM activity was not. EMG activity from the middle head of the deltoid was significantly increased by loading with the shoulder positioned away from the body (ie, in abduction or flexion). When compared with the unloaded state, the addition of a distal humeral load significantly increased LHBM activity in 45° of abduction (P = .028) and 90° of flexion (P = .033) despite forearm and elbow immobilization. The SHBM showed similar trends. CONCLUSION In normal volunteers with forearm and elbow immobilization and application of a load to the distal humerus, LHBM EMG activity is increased by both glenohumeral flexion and abduction, suggesting that this muscle plays a dynamic role in glenohumeral motion with higher demand activities. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Biceps tenodesis may result in dynamic change within the glenohumeral joint with higher demand activities.","Chalmers, Peter N; Cip, Johannes; Trombley, Robert; Cole, Brian J; Wimmer, Markus A; Romeo, Anthony A; Verma, Nikhil N",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967114523902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535304/,308
156461,Life Sciences Discovery and Technology Highlights.,2018,"With hundreds of millions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA-based vaccine doses planned to be delivered worldwide in the upcoming months, it is important to recognize positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) findings in recently vaccinated immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. We aimed to assess PET/CT uptake in the deltoid muscle and axillary lymph nodes of patients that received a COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine, and to evaluate its association with patients' age and immune status. Methods: All consecutive adult subjects undergoing PET/CT scans with any radiotracer at our center during the first month of a national COVID-19 vaccination rollout (between 23 December 2020 and January 27, 2021) were included. Data regarding clinical status, laterality and time interval from recent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed, and correlated with deltoid muscle and axillary lymph nodes uptake. Results: Of 426 eligible, recently vaccinated, subjects (median age, 67±12 years; 49% female), 377 (88%) underwent PET/CT with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positive axillary lymph node uptake was seen in 45% of them. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a strong inverse association between positive FDG uptake in ipsilateral lymph nodes and patients' age (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.57, 95% CI, 0.45-0.72; p<.001), immunosuppressive treatment (OR=0.37, 95% CI, 0.20-0.64; P = 0.003) and presence of hematological disease (OR=0.44, 95% CI, 0.24-0.8; P = 0.021). No such association was found for deltoid muscle uptake. The number of days from the last vaccination and the number of vaccination doses were also significantly associated with increased odds of positive lymph nodes uptake. Conclusion: Following mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination, a high proportion of patients showed ipsilateral lymph node axillary uptake, which was more common in immunocompetent patients. This information will help recognize PET/CT pitfalls and may hint about the patient's immune response to the vaccine.","Eifer, Michal; Tau, Noam; Alhoubani, Yousef; Kanana, Nayroz; Domachevsky, Liran; Shams, Jala; Keret, Nir; Gorfine, Malka; Eshet, Yael","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.121.262194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893188/,308
157178,A Generalist Feeding on Brassicaceae: It Does Not Get Any Better with Selection.,2021-05-11,"Methods We identified that 308 women who had undergone surgical repair of POP were followed up for at least 6 months. Recurrence rates of POP after tension-free vaginal mesh (TVM) surgery (n = 243), native tissue repair (NTR) (vaginal hysterectomy with colpopexy, anterior and posterior colpoplasty, or circumferential suturing of the levator ani muscles and apical repair by transvaginal sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF)) (NTR; n = 31), and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy after subtotal hysterectomy (LSC; n = 34) were compared. Presence of mesh erosion was also recorded. Results Patients who underwent LSC were significantly younger (65.32 ± 3.23 years) than those who underwent TVM surgery (69.61 ± 8.31 years). After TVM surgery, the rate of recurrence (over POP-Q stage II) was 6.17% (15/243) and was highest in patients with advanced POP. The recurrence rate in patients who underwent NTR procedure was 3.23% (1/34) and that in patients who underwent LSC was 11.76% (4/11). There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the three types of surgery. There were 13 cases (5.35%) of mesh erosion after TVM surgery and none after LSC surgery. The risk of mesh erosion was correlated with having had total TVM surgery but not with patient age or POP stage. Repeat procedures were performed in 5 women (2.14%) who underwent TVM surgery and 1 (2.94%) who underwent LSC. No patient underwent repeat surgery after NTR. There was no statistically significant difference in the reoperation rate between the three types of surgery. Conclusion Our study suggested that TVM surgery, NTR, and LSC have comparable outcomes as for the postoperative recurrence rate and mesh erosion. However, the outcomes of each technique need to be carefully evaluated over a long period of time.","Kanasaki, Haruhiko; Oride, Aki; Hara, Tomomi; Kyo, Satoru",Obstetrics and gynecology international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7367403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328104/,308

DESIGN cohort study. SETTING AND POPULATION Mantua and Cremona provinces (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) - included in ATS Val Padana - with COVID-19 incidence rate 7.5‰ and 16.9‰, respectively. Inhabitants aged >= 75 years as of 1st January 2018, 2019, and 2020 (three cohorts), stratified in NCH or not. The indicators calculated were: 1. rate ratio (RR) for NCH vs non-NCH, adjusted by gender, age, chronic diseases number, at least 1 hospitalisation, at least 1 Emergency room access in the previous year, for 2018, 2019, and 2020; 2. adjusted RR, 2019 and 2020 vs 2018, both sub-cohorts (i.e., NCH and non-NCH). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES first four-month period mortality of the considered years. RESULTS aproximately 100,000 inhabitants by year, 7% in NCH. In the 2020 first four-month period, 4,343 deaths occurred of which 45% in NCH. RR in NCH population vs non-NCH for the year 2018 was 2.13 (95%CI 1.94-2.34); for the year 2019 was 2.70 (95%CI 2.43-3.00); for the year 2020 was 6.98 (95%CI 6,49-7,50). Adjusted RR for NCH population in 2020 vs 2018 was 2.22 (95%CI 2.05-2.42) in the whole ATS Val Padana; 1.58 (95%CI 1.40-1.77) in Mantua Province; 2.93 (2.62-3.27) in Cremona Province. Adjusted RR in non-NCH population in the year 2020 vs 2018 was 1.59 (95%CI 1.48-1.70) in the whole ATS; 1.34 (95%CI 1.23-1.46) in Mantua Province; 1.89 (95%CI 1.73-2.07) in Cremona Province. CONCLUSIONS the NCH population experienced an excess risk mortality compared to non-NCH before the COVID-19; this excess increased during the outbreak. In 2020, in NCHs the risk was more than double compared to the 2018 risk, while in non-NCHs it rose approximately by 60%. The gap between NCHs/non-NCHs COVID-19 impact was higher in Cremona than in Mantua.","Ballotari, Paola; Guarda, Linda; Giacomazzi, Enrica; Ceruti, Alessandra; Gatti, Luciana; Ricci, Paolo",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412820/,308

However, towards this direction, a major challenge remains their integration using exclusively CMOS-compatible materials. In this context, herein, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, a CMOS-compatible plasmo-photonic Mach-Zehnder-interferometer (MZI) based on aluminum and Si3N4 waveguides, exhibiting record-high bulk sensitivity of 4764 nm/RIU with clear potential to scale up the bulk sensitivity values by properly engineering the design parameters of the MZI. The proposed sensor is composed of Si3N4 waveguides butt-coupled with an aluminum stripe in one branch to realize the sensing transducer. The reference arm is built by Si3N4 waveguides, incorporating a thermo-optic phase shifter followed by an MZI-based variable optical attenuation stage to maximize extinction ratio up to 38 dB, hence optimizing the overall sensing performance. The proposed sensor exhibits the highest bulk sensitivity among all plasmo-photonic counterparts, while complying with CMOS manufacturing standards, enabling volume manufacturing.","Manolis, A; Chatzianagnostou, E; Dabos, G; Ketzaki, D; Chmielak, B; Giesecke, A L; Porschatis, C; Cegielski, P J; Suckow, S; Markey, L; Weeber, J-C; Dereux, A; Schrittwieser, S; Heer, R; Pleros, N; Tsiokos, D",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.383435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680148/,308
158418,"Integrating silicon nanowire field effect transistor, microfluidics and air sampling techniques for real-time monitoring biological aerosols.",2011,"PURPOSE To study the relationship between roll-off (sudden increase in impedance) and spatial distribution of dehydrated tissue during RF ablation using a cooled electrode (temperatures around 100°C). METHODS We used a double approach: (1) theoretical modelling based on the finite element method, and (2) 20 ablations using an experimental study on ex vivo excised bovine liver in which we measured impedance progress and temperature at three points close to the electrode surface: 0.5 (T1), 1.5 (T2) and 2.5 (T3) mm from the tip. T2 was located exactly at the centre of the 30 mm long electrode. RESULTS Temperatures at T1 and T3 quickly rose to 100°C (at ≈20 and 40 s, respectively), while at the rise at T2 was somewhat slower, stabilized around 50 s and reached a maximum value of 99°C at about 60 s. Impedance reached a minimum of 65 Ω (plateau), began increasing at 50 s and continued rising throughout the procedure, reaching a value equal to the initial value at 70 s. Likewise, computed impedance dropped to ≈73 Ω (plateau), began increasing at 50 s and reached an impedance value equal to the initial value at ≈78 s, which approximately coincided with the time when the entire zone surrounding the electrode was within the 100°C isotherm. CONCLUSION There is a close relationship between the moment at which roll-off occurs and the time when the entire electrode is completely encircled by the dehydrated tissue. The mid-electrode zone is the last in which tissue desiccation occurs.","Trujillo, Macarena; Alba, José; Berjano, Enrique","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2011.631076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235786/,308

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of SBRT with nivolumab+urelumab (CD137 agonist) or nivolumab+cabiralizumab (CSF-1R inhibitor). PATIENTS AND METHODS This phase I clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors that had progressed on standard therapies. SBRT was delivered to 1-4 metastases with nivolumab+urelumab or nivolumab+cabiralizumab given concurrently and following SBRT. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was the primary endpoint with anatomic location-specific SBRT doses deemed safe if {less than or equal to}33% DLT frequency was observed. Secondary endpoints included RECISTv1.1 response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and molecular correlative studies. RESULTS Sixty patients were enrolled, and median follow-up for living patients is 13.8 months. Of these, 23 (38%) received SBRT+nivolumab+urelumab and 37 (62%) received SBRT+nivolumab+cabiralizumab. Seven patients (12%) experienced a DLT (n=3 grade 3, n=4 grade 4) in the following anatomic cohorts: abdominal/pelvic (3/17, 18%), liver (1/13, 8%), central lung (2/14, 14%), and peripheral lung (1/12, 8%). Of 41 patients radiographically evaluable for best overall response including 55 radiated and 23 unirradiated RECIST target lesions, 2 had complete responses (5%), 7 had partial responses (17%), 12 had stable disease (29%), and 20 had progression (49%). Median estimated PFS and OS are 3.0 months (95% CI 2.9-4.8) and 17.0 months (95% CI 6.8-undetermined), respectively. No patients with elevated pre-SBRT serum interleukin-8 experienced a response. CONCLUSIONS SBRT to {less than or equal to}4 sites with nivolumab+urelumab or nivolumab+cabiralizumab for treating advanced solid tumors is feasible with acceptable toxicity and modest anti-tumor activity.","Foster, Corey C; Fleming, Gini F; Karrison, Theodore G; Liao, Chih-Yi; Desai, Ami V; Moroney, John W; Ratain, Mark J; Nanda, Rita; Polite, Blase N; Hahn, Olwen M; O'Donnell, Peter H; Vokes, Everett E; Kindler, Hedy L; Hseu, Robyn; Janisch, Linda A; Dai, Julia; Hoffman, Mark D; Weichselbaum, Ralph R; Pitroda, Sean P; Chmura, Steven J; Luke, Jason J",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-21-0810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168049/,308

Thermal ablation techniques were proposed as alternative treatment options, especially in advanced stages and for unfit-for-surgery patients. This systematic review describes the thermal ablative techniques -i.e., Laser (LA), Radiofrequency (RFA), Microwave (MWA) Ablation, High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and cryoablation- available for pancreatic cancer treatment. Additionally, an analysis of the efficacy, complication rate and overall survival for each technique is conducted. MATERIAL AND METHODS This review collects the ex vivo, preclinical and clinical studies presenting the use of thermal techniques in the pancreatic cancer treatment, searched up to March 2018 in PubMed and Medline. Abstracts, letters-to-the-editor, expert opinions, reviews and non-English language manuscripts were excluded. RESULTS Sixty-five papers were included. For the ex vivo and preclinical studies, there are: 12 records for LA, 8 for RFA, 0 for MWA, 6 for HIFU, 1 for cryoablation and 3 for hybrid techniques. For clinical studies, 1 paper for LA, 14 for RFA, 1 for MWA, 17 for HIFU, 1 for cryoablation and 1 for hybrid techniques. CONCLUSIONS Important technological advances are presented in ex vivo and preclinical studies, as the real-time thermometry, nanotechnology and hybrid techniques to enhance the thermal outcome. Conversely, a lack of standardization in the clinical employment of the procedures emerged, leading to contrasting results on the safety and feasibility of some analyzed techniques. Uniform conclusions on the safety and feasibility of these techniques for pancreatic cancer will require further structured investigation.","Saccomandi, Paola; Lapergola, Alfonso; Longo, Fabio; Schena, Emiliano; Quero, Giuseppe","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2018.1506165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428728/,308

RESULTS Five randomized controlled trials encompassing 1,001 patients were retrieved from the electronic databases. In a random-effects model, operating time, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and risk for hernia recurrence were statistically comparable between the 2 techniques of mesh fixation in LIHR. However, GMF was associated with a reduced risk for developing chronic groin pain. CONCLUSIONS GMF in LIHR does not increase the risk for hernia recurrence and reduces the risk for developing chronic groin pain. It is comparable with tacker mesh fixation in terms of operation time, postoperative pain, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and risk for hernia recurrence.","Sajid, Muhammad S; Ladwa, Nikhil; Kalra, Lorain; McFall, Malcolm; Baig, Mirza K; Sains, Parv",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23388426/,308

Post-operative adhesions are a common cause of bowel obstruction, with complete closed loop obstruction presenting as a surgical emergency. CASE DETAILS A 66-year-old man who had undergone a laparotomy for bowel obstruction two years back, presented to our emergency department with features of complete bowel obstruction. Midline laparotomy revealed propylene suture and intra peritoneal adhesions acting as a constricting band around the jejunum to be the cause. DISCUSSION Adhesions are common perturbing problem after surgeries. The presence of a foreign body further incites the process of adhesion formation by causing hindrance to the fibrinolysis process. In this case, the adhesive bands acted synergistically with the encircling prolene suture material from the previous surgery in causing a complete loop obstruction. CONCLUSION Propylene sutures used in routine surgical procedures can migrate intra-abdominally, and lead to adhesion formation. Adhesions along with the non-absorbable suture can cause complete bowel obstruction.","Khanal, Niharika; Thapa, Anjila; Raut, Akash; Ghimire, Bikal; Pradhan, Susan; Shrestha, Sujan",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34274756/,308

The loss of competitive power of their traditional companies, the obsolescence of many manufacturing facilities, and the take-off of other industrial economies in remote parts of the world have led to the closure of thousands of mines and factories, with the approval of environmental groups. In some privileged places, these ex-industrialized spaces have recovered environmentally, been allocated aid for socio-economic reconversion, and reoriented the old mines and factories (now converted into industrial heritage), towards cultural and tourist uses. The successful examples of Ironbridge, Zollverein or Wieliczka, have created the illusion to managers, owners, and local population of being able to turn almost any ruin of the industrial and mining past into a tourist attraction. Starting in the 1990s, many ex-industrial spaces, which were far from the main urban centres, opted for this tourist transformation as a lifeline to slow down the loss of population and economic activities.

Challenges currently facing the food industry is the food waste and stale food in restaurants, bars and hotels, and rebuilding the trust of people to visit these places given the protocols introduced by the government. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine how the food industry and the government should address the sustainability and financial recovery particularly the affected F&B places. The data was gathered from 500 respondents in Indonesia. The findings of the study reveal that majority no longer visits the F&B places and the fear and lack trust with the government’s restrictions was the confirmed reason. For the 38% respondents who already visited these places, they trust the establishments complying with the health and safe protocols. These findings provide insights for F&B places, food industry and the government to develop strategies that will rebuild trust and confidence with the government with proper communication and consequently boost the sustainability of food industry.","de Leon, Myra V.; Susilo, Daniel Teguh Dwi Putranto Fadjar Kurnia Hartati Santos Roberto Rudolf T.",IOP Conference Series.

163985,The power of primary definers: How journalists assess the pluralism of economic journalism,2021,"Decreasing response rates to traditional survey methods, like face-to-face and telephone interviews, have led survey practitioners around the world to seek new ways of conducting surveys in recent years.” The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this problem because it made conducting face-to-face interviews even more difficult than before. For example, it made conducting face-to-face surveys infeasible in 2020 in South Korea, and so the Korean Academic Multimode Open Survey (KAMOS) was unable to conduct a planned face-to-face survey to recruit new panel members. The entire 8,514-member panel, established via two-stage probability-based sampling from 2016 to 2019, was invited to take three online/telephone surveys in 2020. Of these panel members, 1,352 responded to at least one survey in 2020. To test to what extent the panel remained representative of the adult South Korean population, we compared the two groups of panel members: Those who responded to at least one survey in 2020 and those who did not. After weighting both groups on the basis of age, sex, and geographical area, we analyzed their responses to some of the questions that were asked during multiple rounds of the face-to-face panel-recruiting interviews. Using Cohen’s d for survey items that could be analyzed numerically and Cramér’s V for categorical items, we were able to conclude that the respondents to the 2020 surveys were equivalent to the non-respondents in terms of both demographics and in the answers they originally gave to substantive questions on a variety of topics related to social science or public opinion research, including questions about quality of life, societal issue, and politics (Cohen's d items <0.2, 95% CI;Cramér’s V items <0.1, 95% CI). This analysis may provide a model for others who wish to test the continued representativeness of their panel or who would like to use a different survey mode or change some other aspect of their methodology and test whether it is equivalent to their former methodology. Our success in building a panel that retained its representativeness may be useful to those in other countries where face-to-face surveys had previously been the norm but are becoming increasingly difficult to conduct. © 2021, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

Ethiopia reported the first COVID-19 in March, 2020. The number of cases is increasing, putting much pressure on oncology care. This study examines what the Ethiopian cancer patients and their caregivers knew about COVID 19 after the initial stages of the pandemic. It also assesses the information needs, psychological experiences as well as the impact of pandemic on oncologistpatient- caregiver communication and treatment process. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 participants (100 cancer patients and 100 caregivers) at the initial stage of pandemic (May 1 - June 30, 2020) at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data was collected using a pretested, structured questionnaire to assess knowledge and perceptions on COVID-19. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of TASH (04/14/2015) and the Ethical Review Board of Western Sweden (DNR 520- 18). Results: The results indicate that though both cancer patients and their caregivers show a high awareness of and knowledge about COVID 19, they need more information about the risks specific to cancer patients. The respondents are also concerned about the risks of pandemic outbreak in Ethiopia and its impact on availability of cancer care treatments in the country. The respondents report experiencing psychological concerns in relation to the pandemic. The higher educated patients and caregivers report being more concerned than the lower educated respondents. Delays in appointments and therapy are the main concerns in relation to cancer care. Further, both patients and caregivers experience that the restrictions on the number of caregivers present during interactions with oncologists negatively influence communication, resulting in relatives being excluded and patients experiencing loneliness and lack of support. Conclusions: Getting a better insight into knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among cancer patients and their caregivers is essential for managing the effects of pandemic in cancer care. To our knowledge, there was no similar study in Ethiopia. The results of the study contribute to insights into patient and caregiver awareness of COVID 19, essential for adoption of health care protective practices, providing information and managing oncologist-patient-caregiver communication.","Woldemariam, A.

165102,Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Quantum Information,2020-05-31,"Advanced age in humans is associated with greater susceptibility to and higher mortality rates from infections, including infections with some RNA viruses. The underlying innate immune mechanisms, which represent the first line of defense against pathogens, remain incompletely understood. Drosophila melanogaster is able to mount potent and evolutionarily conserved innate immune defenses against a variety of microorganisms including viruses and serves as an excellent model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions. With its relatively short lifespan, Drosophila also is an organism of choice for aging studies. Despite numerous advantages that this model offers, Drosophila has not been used to its potential to investigate the response of the aged host to viral infection. Here we show that in comparison to younger flies, aged Drosophila succumb more rapidly to infection with the RNA-containing Flock House Virus (FHV) due to an age-dependent defect in disease tolerance. In comparison to younger individuals, we find that older Drosophila mount larger transcriptional responses characterized by differential regulation of more genes and genes regulated to a greater extent. Our results indicate that loss of disease tolerance to FHV with age possibly results from a stronger regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, activation of the Drosophila Immune deficiency (IMD) NF-kB pathway or from downregulation of genes whose products function in mitochondria and mitochondrial respiration. Our work shows that Drosophila can serve as a model to investigate host-virus interactions during aging and sets the stage for future analysis of the age-dependent mechanisms that govern survival and control of virus infections at older age.","Sheffield, Lakbira; Sciambra, Noah; Evans, Alysa; Hagedorn, Eli; Delfeld, Megan; Goltz, Casey; Fierst, Janna L.; Chtarbanova, Stanislava",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.21.307017,308

It also identifies reopening challenges and potential reopening strategies that are discussed by the public. First, the study collects 15,776 tweets that relate to personal opinions on transportation services posted between May 15 and June 15, 2020. Next, it applies text mining and topic modeling techniques to the tweets to determine the prominent themes, terms, and topics in those discussions to understand public feelings, behavior, and broader sentiments about the changes brought about by COVID-19 on transportation systems. Results reveal that people are avoiding public transport and shifting to using private car, bicycle, or walking. Bicycle sales have increased remarkably but car sales have declined. Cycling and walking, telecommuting, and online schools are identified as possible solutions to COVID-19 mobility problems and to reduce car usage with an aim to tackle traffic congestion in the post-pandemic world. People appreciated government decisions for funding allocation to public transport, and asked for the reshaping, restoring, and safe reopening of transit systems. Protecting transit workers, riders, shop customers and staff, and office employees is identified as a crucial reopening challenge, whereas mask wearing, phased reopening, and social distancing are proposed as effective reopening strategies. This framework can be used as a tool by decision makers to enable a holistic understanding of public opinions on transportation services during COVID-19 and formulate policies for a safe reopening.","Habib, Muhammad Ahsanul Anik Md Asif Hasan",Transportation Research Record,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211029926,308

Conventionally, repertoire analysis methods have focused on comprehensive assessment of clonal compositions, including V(D)J segment usage, nucleotide insertion/deletion, and amino acid distribution. Here, we introduce a novel computational approach that applies deep-learning based protein embedding techniques to analyze BCR repertoires. By selecting the most frequently occurring BCR sequences in a given repertoire and computing the sum of the vector representations of these sequences, we represent an entire repertoire as a 100-dimensional vector and eventually as a single data point in vector space. We demonstrate that our new approach enables us to not only accurately cluster repertoires of COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects, but also efficiently track minute changes in immunity conditions as patients undergo a course of treatment over time. Furthermore, using the distributed representations, we successfully trained an XG-Boost classification model that achieved over 87% mean accuracy rate given a repertoire of CDR3 sequences.","Kim, Inyoung; Byun, Sang Yoon; Kim, Sangyeup; Choi, Sangyoon; Noh, Jinsung; Chung, Junho; Kim, Byung Gee",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.02.454701,308

Additionally, some blood product transport systems have been commercialized in Rwanda and other countries and used in pandemic operations for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infected areas. Conversely, implementing goods transportation for commercial purposes in Japan has been difficult, especially in urban areas, due to national legislation. This study examined UAV-assisted transportation in Japan, a natural disaster hotspot, with a focus on the potential uses of UAVs in situations where traffic blockages make ground transportation impossible. UAVs were used to transport 17 kg of medical supplies belonging to a disaster medical assistance team (DMAT), along with 100 emergency meals. We also transported insulin under controlled-temperature conditions, as well as many other emergency supplies. Using UAVs to transport emergency supplies could be an effective approach when dealing with disasters. This paper summarizes the effectiveness of this approach for medical care and disaster response activities. We present a method for using drones to bridge the gap between medical and firefighting personnel, such as DMAT personnel, who are engaged in life-saving activities at the time of a disaster, and those who are unable to transport necessary goods by land using terrestrial vehicles due to traffic interruptions.","Yakushiji, K.; Fujita, H.; Murata, M.; Hiroi, N.; Hamabe, Y.; Yakushiji, F.",Drones,https://doi.org/10.3390/drones4040068,308
166549,Race for a vaccine,2020,"It is increasingly recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can produce long-term complications after recovery from the acute effects of infection. Here, we report the analysis of 32 self-reported short and long-term symptoms in a general adult population cohort comprised of 357 COVID-19+ cases, 5,497 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, and 19,095 non-tested individuals. The majority of our COVID-19+ cases are mild, with only 9 of the 357 COVID-19+ cases having been hospitalized. Our results show that 36.1% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 14.8% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 44.9% at 30 days and 20.8% at 90 days, but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 21.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer. In contrast, only 8.4% of participants from the general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer than 30 days due to any illness during the same study period. The long-term symptoms most enriched in those with COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, chest pain, and pain with deep breaths. In addition to individuals who are initially more sick having more long-term symptoms, we additionally observe that individuals who have an initial symptom of dyspnea are significantly more likely to develop long-term symptoms. Importantly, our study finds that the overall level of illness is an important variable to account for when assessing the statistical significance of symptoms that are associated with COVID-19. Our study provides a baseline from which to understand the frequency of COVID-19 long-term symptoms at the population level and demonstrates that, although those most likely to develop long-term COVID-19 complications are those who initially have more severe illness, even those with mild or asymptomatic courses of infection are at increased risk of long-term complications.","Cirulli, Elizabeth; Barrett, Kelly M Schiabor; Riffle, Stephen; Bolze, Alexandre; Neveux, Iva; Dabe, Shaun; Grzymski, Joseph J; Lu, James T; Washington, Nicole L",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208702,308

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these environments correspond to epidemiological risk from contacts and the social construction of risk by communication within networks of friends. Understanding when, and under which circumstances, each modality of influence can foster the widespread adoption of protective behaviours is critical for shaping useful, practical public health messaging that will best enhance the public response. Methods: We use a multiplex network approach to explore how information from both physical contact and social communication networks is driving a mitigating behavioural response to disease risk. Findings: We show that maintaining focus on awareness of risk in each individuals physical layer contacts promotes the greatest reduction in disease spread, but only when an individual is aware of the symptoms of a non-trivial proportion of their physical contacts (approximately 20% or more). Information from the communication layer was less useful when these connections matched less well with physical contacts and contributed little in combination with accurate information from the physical layer. Interpretation: We conclude that maintaining social focus on local outbreak status will allow individuals to structure their perceived social norms appropriately and respond more rapidly when risk increases. Finding ways to relay accurate local information from trusted community leaders could improve mitigation even where more intrusive/costly strategies, such as contact-tracing, are not possible.","Silk, M.

This paper positions SRT, and its refraction through a geographic lens, as particularly well placed to address emerging issues in the context of ongoing crises—economic, environmental and of care—which have been enhanced by the Covid‐19 pandemic. I present an overview of the Marxist‐feminist traditions that constitute the basis for modern SRT. Through a survey of recent literature, I discuss the potential for extending contemporary SRT through intersectionality theory and suggest the need to draw on theoretical insights originating in the global periphery towards a postcolonial, decolonial SRT. Finally, I contextualize social reproduction theories within geography and suggest three emerging areas of scholarship in which combining a geographic and SRT perspective would yield productive understandings of the current moment and signal towards the construction of alternative, livable futures. These areas are debt and the financialization of social reproduction under neoliberalism;a turn towards a socioecological understanding of reproduction;and resistance, transformation and visions of the future through a “conscious appropriation” of life’s work and life sustaining practices at large.

168489,List of Abbreviations,2015-12-31,"Background ICU patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP or VAP) have high mortality, so broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated at clinical diagnosis, then refined after 2-3 days, once microbiology results become available. Unfortunately, culture-based microbiological investigation is also insensitive, with aetiological agents remaining unidentified in many cases. This leads to extended over-treatment of patients with susceptible pathogens, whilst those with highly-resistant pathogens are treated inadequately for prolonged periods. Using PCR to seek pathogens and their resistance genes directly from clinical samples may improve therapy and stewardship. The INHALE study compared two PCR platforms for HAP/VAP diagnosis against routine microbiology (RM), identifying one to progress into a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Methods Surplus routine sputa, endotracheal tube exudates and bronchoalveolar lavages were collected from ICU patients about to receive new or changed antibiotics for hospital-onset lower respiratory tract infections at 15 UK hospitals. Samples were tested (or frozen for testing) within 72h of collection. Testing was performed using the BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel (bioMerieux) and Unyvero Pneumonia Panel (Curetis). Agreement between machine- and RM- results was categorised as full positive/negative concordance, partial concordance or major/minor discordance. Bayesian latent class (BLC) analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each test, incorporating information from both PCR panels, 16S rDNA analysis and RM. Findings In 652 eligible samples; PCR identified pathogens in considerably more samples compared with RM: 60.4% and 74.2% for Unyvero and FilmArray respectively vs. 44.2%. Both tests also recorded more organisms per sample than routine culture, with the two PCR tests frequently in agreement with each other. For common HAP/VAP pathogens, FilmArray had sensitivity of 91.7-100.0% and specificity of 87.5-99.5%; Unyvero had sensitivity of 83.3-100.0%% except for Klebsiella aerogenes (50.0%) and Serratia marcescens (77.8%), and specificity of 89.4-99.0%. BLC analysis indicated that, compared with PCR, RM had low sensitivity, ranging from 27.0% to 69.4% for common respiratory pathogens. PCR detected more high-consequence antimicrobial resistance genes than would have been predicted by RM and susceptibility testing; around half the host strains could be detected when culture was repeated and they were sought assiduously. Interpretation Conventional and BLC analysis demonstrated that both platforms performed similarly and were considerably more sensitive than RM, detecting potential pathogens in patient samples reported as culture negative. FilmArray had slightly higher sensitivity than Unyvero for common pathogens and was chosen for INHALEs RCT, based on the balance of these results, a swifter turnaround time (75 min vs. 6h), and a smaller footprint. The increased sensitivity of detection realised by PCR offers potential for improved antimicrobial prescribing.","Enne, V. I.; Aydin, A.; Baldan, R.; Owen, D.

Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to this variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, focusing specifically on the transcriptional response to influenza infection. We find that monocytes are the most responsive to influenza infection, but that all cell types mount a conserved interferon response, which is stronger in individuals with increased European ancestry. By comparing European American and African American individuals, we show that genetic ancestry effects on expression are common, influencing 29% of genes, but highly cell type-specific. Further, we demonstrate that much of this population-associated expression variation is explained by cis expression quantitative trait loci, which are enriched for signatures of recent positive selection. Our findings establish common cis-regulatory variants—including those that are differentiated by genetic ancestry—as important determinants of the antiviral immune response.","Randolph, Haley E; Mu, Zepeng; Fiege, Jessica K; Thielen, Beth K; Grenier, Jean-Christophe; Cobb, Mari S; Hussin, Julie G; Li, Yang I; Langlois, Ryan A; Barreiro, Luis B",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423830,308

Decellularization of existing tissues have formed the basis of one major approach to producing 3D scaffolds for such purposes. In this study, we utilize the native hypanthium tissue of apples and a simple preparation methodology to create implantable cellulose scaffolds. To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H&E, Masson’s Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study. Taken together, our results demonstrate that native cellulose scaffolds are biocompatible and exhibit promising potential as a surgical biomaterial.","Modulevsky, Daniel J.; Cuerrier, Charles M.; Pelling, Andrew E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/039644,308

In this regard, this paper aims to explore the teachers' challenges while implementing a reading strategy-based instruction for beginners during the Covid-19 pandemic, taking the Algerian middle schools as a case in point. It highlights the difficulties to achieving quality in developing learners' procedural knowledge and strategic awareness in EFL reading classes. The leading approach to the issue is the interactive approach. To attain the objective of the research, the qualitative method was adopted. Classroom observation and structured interviews were used to collect data. The population targeted was composed of 20 teachers from 16 middle schools in Tizi-Ouzou. The collected data were subjected to qualitative content analysis. The results of the study reveal that most teachers are aware of the importance of reading strategy-based instruction. However, they do not teach them systematically or consistently. Indeed, lack of targeted teacher training, time constraints, and disregard of metacognitive instruction are likely to be obstacles to the efficient implementation of reading strategy-instruction. Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown up several psychological and cognitive learners' difficulties, including decreased motivation and lack of cognitive focus, making the teaching process more challenging. The results imply a need for a revision of teachers' professional development programs and a re-consideration of the elementary EFL courses.","Ammour, K.",Arab World English Journal,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.9,308
171811,A weakly supervised learning method based on attention fusion for COVID-19 segmentation in CT images,2021,"Introduction Traditional surveillance methods have been enhanced by the emergence of online participatory syndromic surveillance systems that collect health-related digital data. These systems have many applications including tracking weekly prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), predicting probable infection of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and determining risk factors of ILI and COVID-19. However, not every volunteer consistently completes surveys. In this study, we assess how different missing data methods affect estimates of ILI burden using data from FluTracking, a participatory surveillance system in Australia. Methods We estimate the incidence rate, the incidence proportion, and weekly prevalence using five missing data methods: available case, complete case, assume missing is non-ILI, multiple imputation (MI), and delta ({delta}) MI, which is a flexible and transparent method to impute missing data under Missing Not at Random (MNAR) assumptions. We evaluate these methods using simulated and FluTracking data. Results Our simulations show that the optimal missing data method depends on the measure of ILI burden and the underlying missingness model. Of note, the {delta}-MI method provides estimates of ILI burden that are similar to the true parameter under MNAR models. When we apply these methods to FluTracking, we find that the {delta}-MI method accurately predicted complete, end of season weekly prevalence estimates from real-time data. Conclusion Missing data is an important problem in participatory surveillance systems. Here, we show that accounting for missingness using statistical approaches leads to different inferences from the data.","Baltrusaitis, K.; Dalton, C.; Carlson, S.; White, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.11.21256420v1?rss=1,308

Although publicly available chest X-ray datasets include high resolution images, most models are trained on reduced size images due to limitations on GPU memory and training time. As compute capability continues to advance, it will become feasible to train large convolutional neural networks on high-resolution images. This study is based on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset, comprising 377,110 high resolution chest X-ray images, and provided with 14 labels to the corresponding free-text radiology reports. We find, interestingly, that tasks that require a large receptive field are better suited to downscaled input images, and we verify this qualitatively by inspecting effective receptive fields and class activation maps of trained models. Finally, we show that stacking an ensemble across resolutions outperforms each individual learner at all input resolutions while providing interpretable scale weights, suggesting that multi-scale features are crucially important to information extraction from high-resolution chest X-rays.","Haque, M.

However, few studies have estimated the impact of COVID-19’s direct and indirect demand shocks on sectoral CO2 emissions and linkages. This study’s goal is to estimate the impact of COVID-19’s direct and indirect demand shocks on the CO2 emissions of the Asia-Pacific countries of Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan (BCIIP). The study, based on the Asian Development Bank’s COVID-19 economic impact scenarios, estimated the impact of direct and indirect demand shocks on CO2 releases using input–output and hypothetical extraction methods. In the no COVID-19 scenario, China emitted the most CO2 (11 billion tons (Bt)), followed by India (2 Bt), Indonesia (0.5 Bt), Pakistan (0.2 Bt), and Bangladesh (0.08 Bt). For BCIIP nations, total demand shocks forced a 1–2% reduction in CO2 emissions under a worst-case scenario. Given BCIIP’s current economic recovery, a best or moderate scenario with a negative impact of less than 1% is more likely in coming years. Direct demand shocks, with a negative 85–63% share, caused most of the CO2 emissions decrease. The downstream indirect demand had only a 15–37% contribution to CO2 emissions reduction. Our study also discusses policy implications.","Sajid, Muhammad Jawad Gonzalez Ernesto D. R. Santibanez",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13169312,308

The proposed models are easy to use and modify, and allow all machines' parameters to be altered for students to replicate easily to support and enhance the learning process of electrical machines courses. Consequently, the developed models are effective tools for educational and research purposes. Dynamic models of single-phase, two-winding, transformers and step-up and step-down auto-transformers were developed using Simulink/MATLAB®. Two different approaches for modelling were proposed, the block diagram representation and Simscape based models. The two modelling methods were validated against the built-in transformer model.

Materials and method: An online survey was used that included demographic characteristics, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, Physical Activity Barriers Scale for the Elderly and questions about well-being. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the risk factors for physical inactivity. Results: Of 131 respondents (mean age, 70.97±5.87 years), 82.4% stated that they were less physically active due to the restrictions. Mean physical activity score was 80.79±65.18 and the most common physical activity was house-hold activities. Inactive elderly had more physical activity barriers (p=0.003). Risk factors for physical inactivity were age, medication, other occupants of the house and house type (Odds ratios were 1.13, 3.3, 3.25, 2.52 and 95% confidence intervals were 1.03-1.23, 1.36-8.05, 1.33-7.93, 1.05-6.06 respectively, p<0.05).

With this work, we set the foundations for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in Portugal by monitoring the trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA circulation in the community, on a nationwide perspective during different epidemiological phases of the pandemic. The Charite assays (E_Sarbecco, RdRP, and N_Sarbecco) were applied to monitor, over 32-weeks (April to December 2020), the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the inlet of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which together serve more than two million people in Portugal. Raw wastewater from three COVID-19 reference hospitals was also analyzed during this period. In total, more than 600 samples were tested. Sampling started late April 2020, during lockdown, and, for the first weeks, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was sporadic, with concentrations varying from 103 to 105 genome copies per liter (GC/L). Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increased steeply by the end of May into late June, mainly in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo region (LVT), during the reopening phase. After the summer, with the reopening of schools in mid-September and return to partial face-to-face work, a pronounced increase of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was detected. In the LVT area, SARS-CoV-2 RNA load agreed with reported trends in hotspots of infection. Synchrony between trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewater and daily new COVID-19 cases highlights the value of WBE as a surveillance tool for this virus, particularly after the phasing out of the epidemiological curve and when hotspots of disease re-emerge in the population which might be difficult to spot based solely on syndromic surveillance and contact tracing.","Monteiro, S.; Rente, D.; Cunha, M.

However, it is plausible to assume that other forms of sexual contact like sexting are occurring. This research aimed to analyse the behaviours and motivations to engage in sexting and to examine some predictors of mental health and loneliness that could be associated with sexting during confinement. The sample consisted of 510 participants: 280 emerging adults and 230 adults. The results showed higher prevalence of sexting behaviours among emerging adults (vs. adults) and among males (vs. females). Moreover, emerging adults reported more motivations to engage in sexting. Finally, the analysis revealed that loneliness would predict engagement in sexting by emerging adults. These findings could have implications for the implementation of sexual education programmes aimed at achieving adequate social interactions associated with sexting.","Garrido-Macias, M.; Villanueva-Moya, L.; Alonso-Ferres, M.; Sanchez-Hernandez, M.

In an effort to contain the spread of the virus, many governments implemented stringent lockdown measures. These lockdown restrictions, coupled with social distancing, severely curtailed transportation and industrial activities, which are the primary drivers of nitrogen oxides emissions. This study investigates whether lockdown orders in the United States have impacted tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels by evaluating 12 major counties with a total population of 38 million. For each county, Sentinel-5P satellite data were obtained and analyzed to determine NO2 column concentrations during the pre-lockdown, peak lockdown, and loosening lockdown periods in 2020. Then, NO2 levels were compared during these three periods to the same time frame in 2019. Our results show that the lockdowns in the 12 major U.S. counties analyzed led to a significant decline in NO2 levels, with an average reduction of 28.7% (+/- 14.6%) and 17.6% (+/- 10.9%) during peak lockdown and loosening lockdown periods, respectively.","Poetzscher, J.; Isaifan, R.

Left-wing parties in Peru were extremely weak during the policy-making process and the political parties were non-programmatic.

Despite the long-lasting and widespread drought in the Sahel, flood events did punctuate in the past. The concern about floods remains dwarf on the international research and policy agenda compared to droughts. In this paper, we elucidate that floods in the Sahel are now becoming more frequent, widespread, and more devastating. We analyzed gridded daily rainfall data over the period 1981–2020, used photographs and satellite images to depict flood areas and threats, compiled and studied flood-related statistics over the past two decades, and supported the results with peer-reviewed literature. Our analysis revealed that the timing of the maximum daily rainfall occurs from the last week of July to mid-August in the Eastern Sahel, but from the last week of July to the end of August in the Western Sahel. In 2019 and 2020, flash and riverine floods took their toll in Sudan and elsewhere in the region in terms of the number of affected people, direct deaths, destroyed and damaged houses and croplands, contaminated water resources, and disease outbreaks and deaths. Changes in rainfall intensity, human interventions in the physical environment, and poor urban planning play a major role in driving catastrophic floods. Emphasis should be put on understanding flood causes and impacts on vulnerable societies, controlling water-borne diseases, and recognizing the importance of compiling relevant and reliable flood information. Extreme rainfall in this dry region could be an asset for attenuating the regional water scarcity status if well harvested and managed. We hope this paper will induce the hydroclimate scholars to carry out more flood studies for the Sahel. It is only then encumbered meaningful opportunities for flood risk management can start to unveil.

In connection with switching to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the investigated students of Kazan Federal University were engaged in both online physical education classes and self-study physical education classes with the obligatory keeping of a self-monitoring diary, which allowed tracking the dynamics of changes in psycho-emotional, functional states as well as physical fitness. As part of the educational process, teachers and students contacted through the Microsoft Teams platform, where classes and consultations were held;information and control materials were exchanged. A control group and an experimental group were formed with 90 students in each of the groups totalling 180 students. Each of the groups included 30 students of the main subgroup (healthy), 30 students of the preparatory subgroup (with minor deviations in health), and 30 students of the special medical subgroup with confirmed diseases of various nosology. In the control group, the students were engaged in physical education classes, fulfilling the general requirements: they filled out a self-monitoring diary, carried out the recommended tests to assess functional and physical fitness. Calculation of ""working pulse rate"" according to Karvonen's formula gave students the opportunity to determine and select the amount and intensity of physical activity in the process of self-study. According to the self-monitoring diaries, the students showed positive dynamics in the psycho-emotional state. Students also noted the interdependence of their mood, well-being, desire to learn and be active on the quantity and quality of physical education classes. Exercises of sufficient intensity improved mood, relieved feelings of anxiety, and increased the positivity of perception of the surrounding environment. For ten weeks of distance learning, the students of the experimental group, whose physical activity was regulated individually, and the intensity of the load was selected with account of peculiarities of the work of their functional systems, showed a value of adaptation potential higher than that of students of the control group.","Fazleeva, E.; Tumakov, D.; Valeeva, A.; Akberov, R.",Journal of Human Sport and Exercise,https://doi.org/10.14198/jhse.2021.16.proc2.26,308

On the one hand ecotourism could impact the occurrence, survival or behavior of species, on the other hand ecotourism is often mentioned as providing a “human shield” by deterring negative practices like gold mining, logging and hunting. Brownsberg Nature Park is easily the most visited protected area of Suriname, with a high number of ecotourists visiting from abroad. A four-year study on the impact of ecotourism on medium-large terrestrial mammals was carried out between 2013 and 2016 using 16 camera trapping stations. The area has a clear gradient of tourism pressure, with the pressure decreasing further away from the lodging facilities. Evidently, the impacts of human presence on the mammal communities were more significant in the busiest areas. Most species avoided areas with many hikers or switched to a more nocturnal activity pattern. In these areas the impact was not reflected in species numbers, however it was causing a significant lowering of the diversity of mammals. On the other hand, vehicles had little impact on species avoidance or diversity, but did increase nocturnality even more than hikers. A few species seemed to be “attracted” by hikers and/or traffic. Giant armadillos and spotted pacas used the pools in the road created by traffic. Ocelots, margays and red-rumped agoutis seemed to favor human disturbance probably because of predator release. Some of the most impacted species were the jaguar, puma and lowland tapir, all three species with significant contribution to ecosystem balance. Their avoidance or even disappearance from highly human frequented areas could easily result in ecosystem changes in these areas. Management measures should focus on lowering the number of hikers in popular places and limiting the number of vehicles in recreational or tourist areas.","Ouboter, Dimitri A.; Kadosoe, Vanessa S.; Ouboter, Paul E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.438794,308

175705,"An organ-based multi-level model for glucose homeostasis: organ distributions, timing, and impact of blood flow",2020-10-21,"Incremental increases in a driver variable, such as nutrients or detritus, can trigger abrupt shifts in aquatic ecosys-tems. Once these ecosystems change state, a simple reduction in the driver variable may not return them to their original state. Because of the long time scales involved, we still have a poor understanding of the dynamics of ecosys-tem recovery after a state change. A model system for understanding ecosystem recovery is the aquatic microecosystem that inhabits the cup-shaped leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. With enrichment of organic matter, this system flips within 1 to 3 days from an oxygen-rich state to an oxygen-poor (hypoxic) state. In a replicated green-house experiment, we enriched pitcher plant leaves at different rates with bovine serum albumin (BSA), a molecular substitute for detritus. Changes in dissolved oxygen ([O2]) and undigested BSA concentration were monitored during enrichment and recovery phases. At low enrichment rates, ecosystems showed a substantial lag in the recovery of [O2] (clockwise hysteresis). At intermediate enrichment rates, [O2] tracked the levels of undigested BSA with the same profile during the enrichment and recovery phases (no hysteresis). At high enrichment rates, we observed a novel response: changes in [O2] were proportionally larger during the recovery phase than during the enrichment phase (counter-clockwise hysteresis). These experiments demonstrate that detrital enrichment rate can modulate a diversity of hysteretic responses in a single aquatic ecosystem. With counter-clockwise hysteresis, rapid reduction of a driver variable following high enrichment rates may be a viable restoration strategy.","Northrop, Amanda C.; Avalone, Vanessa; Ellison, Aaron M.; Ballif, Bryan A.; Gotelli, Nicholas J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.073239,308

A pilot of physiotherapy/dietitian-specific clinics found RC to be an acceptable alternative to standard clinics. Due to COVID19, RC was introduced to replace MDT face-to-face (F2F) clinics. Methods: RC's were run 2x weekly. 117 pwCF were surveyed to evaluate previous experience of RC, usefulness of this consultation and preference in continuing. We asked 9 MDT members about their perception and opinion of RC. Results: 55% pwCF and 100% MDT responded.100% found RC useful and 90% stating time efficiency despite 62% having no previous experience. 80% of pwCF preferred video over telephone calls. 72% of respondents had concerns re: lack of lung function measurement, 56% were concerned re: lack of physical examination which was also raised by the MDT. Confidentiality was identified as a concern but 72% of pwCF felt they had no problem discussing sensitive issues but these would be preferable F2F. Benefits included reduced clinic time (80%), convenience of not travelling/parking at hospital (90%) and ease of clinic allocation irrespective of microbiology infection control concerns (70%). Flexibility of access, not requiring time off work, a relaxed discussion of more relevant issues and improvements in clinical flow were noted. F2F consultations remain valuable as these build relationships and allow thorough examination. Conclusion: 64% pwCF and all MDT agreed that alternating RC would be a preferable format, with frequency depending on clinical need. This would minimise travel and cross infection risks whilst continuing optimal clinical care. RC were well received and a viable option to increase review when clinical space is limited. Concern over lack of objective measurement is important as these are clinically required and should be obtained.

Unfortunately, despite community efforts leading to the development of SBML or the BioModels database, many published models have not been fully exploited, largely due to lack of proper documentation or the dependence on proprietary software. To facilitate synergies within the emerging research fields of systems biology and medicine by reusing and further developing existing models, an open-source toolbox that makes the overall process of model construction more consistent, understandable, transparent and reproducible is desired. Results and Discussion We provide here the update on the development of modelbase, a free expandable Python package for constructing and analysing ordinary differential equation-based mathematical models of dynamic systems. It provides intuitive and unified methods to construct and solve these systems. Significantly expanded visualisation methods allow convenient analyses of structural and dynamic properties of the models. Specifying reaction stoichiometries and rate equations, the system of differential equations is assembled automatically. A newly provided library of common kinetic rate laws highly reduces the repetitiveness of the computer programming code, and provides full SBML compatibility. Previous versions provided functions for automatic construction of networks for isotope labelling studies. Using user-provided label maps, modelbase v1.0 streamlines the expansion of classic models to their isotope-specific versions. Finally, the library of previously published models implemented in modelbase is continuously growing. Ranging from photosynthesis over tumour cell growth to viral infection evolution, all models are available now in a transparent, reusable and unified format using modelbase. Conclusion With the small price of learning a new software package, which is written in Python, currently one of the most popular programming languages, the user can develop new models and actively profit from the work of others, repeating and reproducing models in a consistent, tractable and expandable manner. Moreover, the expansion of models to their label specific versions enables simulating label propagation, thus providing quantitative information regarding network topology and metabolic fluxes.","van Aalst, Marvin; Ebenhöh, Oliver; Matuszyńska, Anna",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.321380,308

Case series report that clozapine-treated patients with COVID-19 have no documented neutropenia.ObjectivesWe sought to investigate the potential adverse effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in patients taking clozapine.MethodsWe retrospectively inspected data of 13 consecutive patients on clozapine, admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre -Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between March and June 2020. Selection was based on their COVID-19 symptoms presentation and/or COVID-19 positive test. We used a linear regression model with COVID status as independent variable and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) as dependent variable to inform about a correlation between COVID-19 status and neutrophil count. STATA was used for statistics.ResultsWe collected data on thirteen patients of which nine were male. The median age was of 41.97 years;six subjects were Black, three were Asian and four were White Caucasian. Ten subjects tested positive to COVID-19 and 3 were suspected cases -these latter were excluded from stastical analysis. During COVID-19 infection, neutrophils count (ANC) dropped significantly to 4.215 from a baseline value of 5.337. The beta values of 0.83 shows that ANC declined significantly during COVID-19 infection (p =<.0001, R2 = 95%).

It has been identified as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spreading rapidly in Asia, America and Europe. Like some other RNA viruses, RNA replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 rely on its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which is a therapeutic target of clinical importance. Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 was solved recently (PDB ID 6M71) with some missing residues. Objective: We used SARS-CoV-2 RdRP as a target protein to screen for possible chemical molecules with potential anti-viral effects. Methods: Here we modelled the missing residues 896-905 via homology modelling and then analysed the interactions of Hepatitis C virus allosteric non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) in the reported NNIs binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 RdRP. Results: We found that MK-3281, filibuvir, setrobuvir and dasabuvir might be able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRP based on their binding affinities in the respective binding sites.

178022,Ozone profile retrieval from nadir TROPOMI measurements in the UV range,2021,"The surfaces of proteins are generally hydrophilic but there have been reports of sites that exhibit an exceptionally high affinity for individual water molecules. Not only do such molecules often fulfil critical biological functions, but also, they may alter the binding of newly designed drugs. In crystal structures, sites consistently occupied in each unit cell yield electron density clouds that represent water molecule presence. These are recorded in virtually all high-resolution structures obtained through X-ray diffraction. In this work, we utilized the wealth of data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank to train a residual deep learning model named ‘hotWater’ to identify sites on the surface of proteins that are most likely to bind water, the so-called water hot spots. The model can be used to score existing water molecules from a PDB file to provide their ranking according to the predicted binding strength or to scan the surface of a protein to determine the most likely water hot-spots de novo. This is computationally much more efficient than currently used molecular dynamics simulations. Based on testing the model on three example proteins, which have been resolved using both high-resolution X-ray crystallography (providing accurate positions of trapped waters) as well as low-resolution X-ray diffraction, NMR or CryoEM (where structure refinement does not yield water positions), we were able to show that the hotWater method is able to recover in the “water-free” structures many water binding sites known from the high-resolution structures. A blind test on a newly solved protein structure with waters removed from the PDB also showed good prediction of the crystal water positions. This was compared to two known algorithms that use electron density and was shown to have higher recall at resolutions >2.6 Å. We also show that the algorithm can be applied to novel proteins such as the RNA polymerase complex from SARS-CoV-2, which could be of use in drug discovery.

We developed and validated a survey questionnaire using a three member expert team. The survey was administered through a cross-sectional web-based (Google forms) platform to all the trainees in gynecological oncology across India listed in our directory in the first week of August, 2020. Data collected was analysed using Google sheets. Results were expressed as percentages of total responses received excluding unattended responses. Inferences were drawn from the content-specific responses. Thirty-seven trainees across the country responded. Majority (97.2%) of the trainees conceded that COVID-19 had significantly impacted their training, of which 78% suggested that hands-on surgical training was the most affected, 15% percieved an impact on academic training and only 7% suggested an impact on clinical trial learning. All respondents were continuing academic training through webinars, online case presentations and tumour boards. None of the responses favoured virtual learning over or equivalent to bedside clinics and face to face interactions. Almost three-fourths (77%) of trainees suggested continuing online platforms in post-COVID times. Presently only 3 of 16 centres from responses received had skill lab and simulation training facilities. Virtual anatomical learning facility was available only in a single centre across the country. Cadaveric dissection (89%) was a preferred choice over simulation modules by in-training candidates to prevent skill decay. Telemedicine clinics were run by 14 of 16 centres in the country but only 54% of trainees were satisfied with telemedicine services. Although, a positive response for online teaching modules was recieved among trainees in gynecological oncology in India, face to face learning and bed side clinics were still valued. There was a modest preference for simulation based skill training while cadaveric dissection lab training was overwhelmingly accepted. This could possibly be attributable to unavailability and non-exposure of majority of trainees to simulation based platforms.

Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a critical clinical symptom of severe COVID-19 patients, and the macrophage is recognized as the direct host cell of SARS-CoV-2 and potential drivers of CSS. In the present study, peramivir was identified to reduce TNF-α by partly intervention of NF-κB activity in LPS-induced macrophage model. In vivo, peramivir reduced the multi-cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alleviated the acute lung injury and prolonged the survival time in mice. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), peramivir could also inhibit the release of TNF-α. Collectively, we proposed that peramivir might be a candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 and other infections related CSS.

179217,Can I Get A Witness?: On Being Seen and Heard in a Relational Psychoanalytic Treatment,2021,"Objective: There is not enough information in the literature about perceived stress among health professional students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the level of perceived stress and its determinants in Turkish undergraduate health professional students during the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional, online survey study included 402 undergraduate health professional students. Data were collected using a personal information form, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Contentment with Life Assessment Scale, and the Ways of Coping Inventory. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Student's t-test, one-way analysis of variance, correlation coefficients, and linear regression analysis were used for data analysis. Results: The PSS mean score of the students was 32.95 +/- 7.34, and 98.2% reported moderate-to-high levels of stress. The significant determinants of stress were younger age (unstandardized beta = -0.23, p = 0.035), poor self-rated health (unstandardized beta = 1.60, p = 0.005), the presence of sleep problems (unstandardized beta = 1.22, p = 0.021), the history of direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients or infected materials (unstandardized beta = 5.82, p &lt; 0.001), following the news about the pandemic closely (unstandardized beta = 0.60, p = 0.041), lower life satisfaction (unstandardized beta = -0.32, p &lt; 0.001), and lower use of optimistic coping (unstandardized beta = -3.24, p &lt; 0.001) but greater use of helpless coping (unstandardized beta = 3.31, p &lt; 0.001). The regression model explained 57.6% of the variance in perceived stress. Conclusions: The level of perceived stress was relatively high among health professional students. This study highlighted the need for psychological support to reduce the level of perceived stress in this population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kara, B.",Aims Medical Science,https://doi.org/10.3934/medsci.2021014,308
179289,Towards an Open Science definition as a political and legal framework: on the sharing and dissemination of research outputs,2020-10-09,"We examine the performance of four parliamentary democracies - Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK - as they confront the need for a substantial fiscal policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research covers the period 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020. We score the four countries on nine components of democratic accountability using Mark Philp's distinction between formal and political accountability. We conclude, first, that to appreciate the nuanced character of accountability, it is important to have a set of operational measures that identify specific aspects of performance. Second, preparation is important for resilience: countries that demonstrated strong accountability before the pandemic maintained relatively high accountability standards during the crisis;weaker accountability mechanisms showed less resistance to the expanding power of the executive. Finally, it is easier to be accountable when outcomes are favourable, but favourable outcomes include adherence to the norms of democratic accountability. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This project demonstrates that the use of the IEEE 2791-2020 Standard, (BioCompute objects [BCO]) enables complete and concise communication of NGS data analysis results. One arm of a clinical trial was replicated using synthetically generated data made to resemble real biological data. Two separate, independent analyses were then carried out using BCOs as the tool for communication of analysis: one to simulate a pharmaceutical regulatory submission to the FDA, and another to simulate the FDA review. The two results were compared and tabulated for concordance analysis: of the 118 simulated patient samples generated, the final results of 117 (99.15%) were in agreement. This high concordance rate demonstrates the ability of a BCO, when a verification kit is included, to effectively capture and clearly communicate NGS analyses within regulatory submissions. BCO promotes transparency and induces reproducibility, thereby reinforcing trust in the regulatory submission process.","King, Charles Hadley S.; Keeney, Jonathon; Guimera, Nuria; Das, Souvik; Fochtman, Brian; Walderhaug, Mark O; Talwar, Sneh; Patel, Janisha; Mazumder, Raja; Donaldson, Eric",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.415059,308

However, the human neurochemistry of social motivation in aversive situations is still poorly understood. In a randomized, double-blind, between-subject design, healthy female volunteers (N = 80) received either 10 mg of the µ-opioid agonist morphine sulfate or a placebo. Following psychosocial stress induction, participants engaged in a social reward task, in which the motivation (subjective ratings of wanting and physical effort) to obtain skin-to-skin social touch and the hedonic reactions (subjective ratings of liking and facial electromyography) elicited by it were assessed. Morphine administration prevented the increase of salivary cortisol, usually observed in response to acute stress exposure. The dampened physiological reaction to the psychosocial stress was associated with increased negative mood and subsequent higher subjective wanting of the most pleasurable touch. Furthermore, participants administered with morphine displayed greater activity of the corrugator muscle during reward anticipation, possibly tracking enhanced attention toward the social stimuli. Overall, the results provide novel evidence on the effect of exogenous opioids administration on the reactions to psychosocial stress and point to a state-dependent regulation of social motivation.","Massaccesi, Claudia; Willeit, Matthaeus; Quednow, Boris B.; Nater, Urs M.; Lamm, Claus; Mueller, Daniel; Silani, Giorgia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.456110,308
180535,Spatial distribution of plant-available silicon and its controlling factors in paddy fields of China,2021,"The article deals with the features of the dynamics of the Eurozone's general business situation (GBS) for the 20 years of its existence. A comparative analysis of the integration bloc GBS within the framework of two full medium-term reproduction cycles (2002-2007 and 2008-2018) is carried out using different economic indicators: value added of different industries, industrial production, manufacturing production, real GDP, real GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) rate, returns on GFCF rate, employment. The recession of 2020 is considered preconditioned (regardless of the COVID-19 repercussions), as the duration of the business cycle since 2008 was approaching the maximum duration of the Juglar cycle (11 years) and signs of a downturn were appearing in 2018. The feature of the second medium-term cycle is outlined - mainly recovery rather than net economic growth, which justifies identification of the Eurozone development since 2008 as the lost decade. An attempt is made to identify long waves in the development of the Eurozone GBS, possible timeframes thereof are hypothesized using GDP per capita as well as labor productivity growth rates. Period of 1996-2011 is suggested as an ascending wave, period of 2012-2019 (and later) - as a descending wave. The conclusion is made on the relatively less favorable Eurozone GBS in the second decade of the XXI century within both the second medium-term cycle and the long wave. The problem (crisis) of competitiveness of the integration bloc as a main factor of such a dynamics is outlined. In this regard a modification of the medium-term reproduction cycle in the second decade of the XXI century is revealed on the basis of the Eurozone member states GBS analysis. The modification consists in a low representativeness of industrial (and manufacturing) production index as an indicator for identifying the phases of the medium-term cycle, and in extraordinary patterns of the industry (and its manufacturing part) dynamics, which result in completion of the medium term cycle without the index reaching its pre-crisis levels in a number of Eurozone countries. This new normality calls forth to reconsider to some extent such GBS theoretical categories as cycle boundaries and peak. In conclusion, forecasts are made regarding the end of the current descending long wave in the mid-2020s and possible GBS improvement within the medium-term cycle in this period subject to reasonable economic policy aimed at tackling the Eurozone competitiveness crisis.","Sidorov, A.

180569,Large-scale Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Maize Seedling Leaves During De-etiolation,2020-03-14,"Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention programmes using faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) as the primary screen typically rely on colonoscopy for secondary and surveillance testing. Colonoscopy capacity is an important constraint, limiting the number of primary tests offered. Many European programmes lack sufficient colonoscopy capacity to provide optimal screening intensity regarding screening age ranges, intervals and FIT cut-offs. It is currently unclear how to optimise programmes within colonoscopy capacity constraints. Design: The MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model was used to determine if more effective CRC screening programmes can be identified within existing colonoscopy capacity. The model assessed 525 strategies of varying screening intervals, age ranges and FIT cut-offs, including previously unevaluated 4 and 5 year screening intervals. These strategies were compared with policy decisions taken in Ireland to provide CRC screening within available colonoscopy capacity. Outcomes estimated net costs, quality-adjusted-life-years and required colonoscopy numbers. The optimal strategies within finite colonoscopy capacity constraints were identified. Results: Combining a reduced FIT cut-off of 10 micrograms Hb/g, an extended screening interval of 4 years and an age range of 60-72 years requires 6% fewer colonoscopies, reduces net costs by 23% while preventing 15% more CRC deaths and saving 16% more QALYs relative to current policy. Conclusion: Previously overlooked longer screening intervals may balance optimal cancer prevention with finite colonoscopy capacity constraints. Simple changes to screening configurations could save lives, reduce costs, and relieve colonoscopy capacity pressures. These findings are directly relevant to CRC screening programmes across Europe that employ FIT-based testing and face colonoscopy capacity constraints.","McFerran, E.; O'Mahony, J.

The use of the cluster methodology made it possible to rethink the toolkit of the regional policy, considering not individual enterprises as an object of regulation, but integrated structures that can become regional ""growth areas"". The article describes some interesting findings. First, the cluster strategy made it possible to ensure sustainable growth rates of individual regions, which became the driver of the development of the leading world powers. Secondly, the Russian experience of cluster development made it possible to identify the competitive advantages and internal regional resources for development, increasing the competitiveness of the cluster structure partners. Increasing the competitiveness of business is of particular importance for the agro-oriented regions of Russia, since the agricultural sector is subject to greater natural risks. Thirdly, the positive impact of agricultural clusters on the socio-economic development of the Rostov region, including that over the Covid-19 pandemic period, is highlighted.

The sudden onset of the pandemic has led to increased levels of anxiety and depression amongst healthcare workers. EMS professionals are the first responders and need to provide emergency Medical Care to their patients. They are required to perform lifesaving interventions in a short period of time. As it is not possible to ascertain the Covid status of the patient, hence EMS professionals are at the greatest risk of getting infected. The study aims to assess the level of clinical preparedness of EMS professionals and suggests recommendations to improve upon it. Objective: To assess the level of clinical preparedness amongst EMS professionals in tackling life threatening emergencies in suspected Covid 19 patients. Methodology: The study was conducted amongst 150 Emergency Medical Professionals in Pune, India. Respondents were asked to respond to each item using 5 point Likert scale. The Questionnaire was administered to the respondents through online mode after obtaining informed consent. Responding to all questions was mandatory. The respondents were given a period of two days to fill the questionnaire. Discussion: The present study was aimed at examining the current level of preparedness with regards to the disease after nearly a year of the pandemic. The result obtained in terms of knowledge were encouraging and pointed to the fact that the EMS professionals had received adequate training in identification of suspected cases and their initial management. Majority of the respondents suffered from high grade anxiety of contracting the infection. The study highlights the urgent need to conduct counselling and stress management sessions for better mental health of EMS professionals and showed that hospitals are slowly but steadily devising appropriate protocols and safety measures to protect their employees. Conclusion: The contribution of EMS professionals in providing emergency lifesaving care to suspected Covid 19 patients cannot be over emphasized. As the pandemic continues it is essential to ensure the mental and physical of all healthcare professionals. The study is a small attempt to portray the level of knowledge and mental attitude amongst EMS professionals.

AI-assisted video analytics can provide valuable information and benefits for parties in various domains. Face recognition, object detection, or movement tracing are prominent examples enabled by this technology. However, the widespread deployment of such mechanism in public areas are a growing cause of privacy and security concerns. Data protection strategies need to be appropriately designed and correctly implemented in order to mitigate the associated risks. Most existing approaches focus on privacy and security related operations of the video stream itself or protecting its transmission. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving system for AI-assisted video analytics, that extracts relevant information from video data and governs the secure access to that information. The system ensures that applications leveraging extracted data have no access to the video stream.

Understanding these system dynamics can support decision making for the pandemic response and recovery measures. This study combined a scoping review with a causal loop diagram to further understanding of the connections between SDH, pandemic measures, and both short- and long-term outcomes in New Zealand. The causal loop diagram showed the reinforcing nature of structural SDH, such as colonization and socio-economic influences, on health inequities. While balancing actions taken by government eliminated COVID-19, the diagram showed that existing structural SDH inequities could increase health inequities in the longer term, unless the opportunity is taken for socio-economic policies to be reset. Such policy resets would be difficult to implement, as they are at odds with the current socio-economic system. The causal loop diagram highlighted that SDH significantly influenced the dynamics of the COVID-19 impact and response, pointing to a need for purposeful systemic action to disrupt the reinforcing loops which increase health inequities over time.

The most severe among the adopted measures is to remain in home isolation for a significant number of hours per day, to avoid the spreading of the infection in an uncontrolled way through public spaces. Recent literature showed that the primary route of transmission is via aerosols, especially produced in poorly ventilated inner spaces. Spain has reached very high levels concerning contagion rates, accumulated incidence, or number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Therefore, this article aims to develop a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the requirements established in Spain, with respect to the European framework in reference to ventilation parameters indoors. The different parameters that serve as calculation for the ventilation flow in homes are analyzed to this aim.

Full- length LBR was targeted to the nuclear envelope. The amino-terminal domain, without any transmembrane segments, was transported to the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus. When the amino-terminal domain of LBR was fused to the amino-terminal side of a transmembrane segment of a type II integral membrane protein of the ER/plasma membrane, the chimeric protein was targeted to the nuclear envelope, likely the inner nuclear membrane. When the amino-terminal domain was deleted from LBR and replaced by alpha-globin, the chimeric protein was retained in the ER.

186977,New Books.,1955,"Telehealth is an increasingly critical component of the health care ecosystem, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid adoption of telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject ~50% of the sub-par quality images, while retaining ~80% of good quality images patients send in, despite heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of teledermatology care.","Vodrahalli, Kailas; Daneshjou, Roxana; Novoa, Roberto A; Chiou, Albert; Ko, Justin M; Zou, James",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

The hybridomas responded to purified u.v.-inactivated TGE virus with interleukin production and growth inhibition. TGE virus recognition by the hybridomas was restricted by the major histocompatibility complex: only splenocytes from syngeneic or semi-syngeneic mice were able to recognize the antigen. The three hybridomas were Thy 1.2+, but did not express detectable levels of Lyt 1 or Lyt 2 antigens by fluorescent cell sorting analysis. Only one hybridoma (T.1J.B5) expressed the L3T4 marker. These hybridomas had helper activity, as they were able to reconstitute in vitro the synthesis of TGE virus-specific antibodies by Th cell-depleted spleen cells from immune BALB/c mice. The antibodies that they induced specifically neutralized by 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold the infectivity of TGE virus, ruling out the possibility of inhibition of virus replication by interferon. These hybridomas could be very useful for identifying antigenic domains in TGE virus recognized by Th cells, which cooperate with B cells in the synthesis of neutralizing antibodies.","Bullido, M J; Correa, I; Jiménez, G; Suñé, C; Gebauer, F; Enjuanes, L",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2471795/,308

Data from the present study draw attention to an additional, genetically determined mechanism controlling CV infections. The resistance to A59 and JHM virus (JHMV) associated with SJL mice was maintained in explanted glial cultures which, by contrast, fully supported a productive infection by the serorelated mouse hepatitis virus type 3. A comparative analysis of the infectious process in glial cell explants from SJL and CD.1 mice helped to define the stage at which restriction is manifested. Cultures of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes from these strains of mice were challenged with JHMV or mouse hepatitis virus type 3, and cell-virus interactions were monitored, including adsorption, uptake of inoculum, transcription, and cell-to-cell dissemination. The sequence of early events from adsorption to genome activation occurred with about equal efficiency with both viruses and genetically different cells, indicating that SJL resistance is not due to any deficiency in specific receptors or penetration of the inoculum or general expression of viral functions. However, intercellular spread of the infection was restricted in SJL glial cells owing to an as yet undefined component. Since cells from (SJL x CD.1)F1 mice were fully susceptible to JHMV, resistance to virus spread must be due to a deficiency in some factor, perhaps a proteolytic activity necessary for dissemination.","Wilson, G A; Dales, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2841490/,308

Flood of sequence data yields clues but few answers.,2003,"A monoclonal antibody-based capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) antigens in nasal swabs collected from cattle showing signs of respiratory tract disease following shipping. These samples had been previously tested for RBCV by inoculation of G clone cultures of human rectal tumor cells (HRT-18G) and for bovine herpes virus 1, parainfluenza virus 3, bovine adenovirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus on other specifically permissive cell cultures. RBCV has not previously been recognized as an important etiological factor in the bovine respiratory disease complex of feedlot cattle. Thirty of 100 samples tested positive for RBCV antigen by capture ELISA in contrast to 38 of 100 samples that yielded RBCV isolates in G clone cells. Samples yielding other bovine respiratory viruses in the absence of RBCV were negative in the capture ELISA, which was based on the use of a single monoclonal antibody that recognizes one RBCV epitope on the S glycoprotein with the broadest reactivity with different strains of RBCV tested. Some RBCV strains may not be detected by this ELISA, which may account for the higher percentage of RBCV-infected cattle detected by RBCV isolation. However, the ELISA was simple to perform, sensitive, and specific and was more rapid than virus isolation. This assay will be useful for processing large numbers of field samples in future epidemiologic and diagnostic studies of RBCV infections of cattle.","da Silva, M R; O'Reilly, K L; Lin, X; Stine, L; Storz, J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9925206/,308

We performed a SILS distal pancreatectomy (SILS-DP) using 3 trocars placed through a single port at an umbilical incision. In our case, the most important surgical technique was the stomach-hanging method to obtain a favorable laparoscopic view of the pancreas. Although SILS-DP is a safe and feasible procedure, further studies are required to determine the advantages of this procedure in comparison with the standard laparoscopic method.","Kuroki, Tamotsu; Adachi, Tomohiko; Okamoto, Tatsuya; Kanematsu, Takashi",Hepato-gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21830435/,308

Whereas most studies suggest that children who present for elective procedures with an upper respiratory tract infection are at increased risk of perioperative adverse events, these events are typically easy to recognize and treat. This review will discuss the current literature regarding outcome in children who present for elective surgery with an upper respiratory tract infection and suggests approaches to optimize their perioperative management. RECENT FINDINGS Although the literature regarding this important topic has been slow to evolve, recent large-scale outcome studies have identified a number of factors that increase the risk of perioperative adverse events among children with upper respiratory tract infections. The significance of these findings will be discussed. SUMMARY An understanding of the risk factors associated with administering anesthesia to the child with an upper respiratory tract infection is important in identifying elements of the preoperative assessment that merit attention and in optimizing the anesthetic plan as a means to limit any perioperative complications.","Tait, Alan R",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16534299/,308
192619,Sustainable yield and conservation goals.,2003,"The discovery of the multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes in which nitric oxide (NO) is involved has promoted a great number of pharmacological researches to develop new drugs that are capable of influencing NO production directly and/or indirectly for therapeutic purposes (i.e, NO-releasing drugs, NO-inhibiting drugs, and phosphodiesterase V inhibitors). In particular, the so-called NO donor drugs could actually have an important therapeutic effect in the treatment of many diseases such as arteriopathies (atherosclerosis and its sequelae, arterial hypertension and some forms of male sexual impotence), various acute and chronic inflammatory conditions (colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and tissue remodelling), and several degenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and cancer). The old organic nitrates show some well-known pitfalls including the induction of tolerance and acute side effects related to abrupt vasodilation such as cephalea and hypotension, which limit their therapeutic indications. A low therapeutic index (i.e., peroxynitrite toxicity) has always characterised the sydnonimines class. A series of interesting new classes of NO donors are under intense pharmacological investigation and scrutiny (S-nitrosothiols, diazeniumdiolates and NO hybrid drugs), each characterised by a particular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The most important obstacle in the field of NO donor drugs is represented by the difficulty in targeting NO release, and thereby its effects, to a particular tissue.","Scatena, Roberto; Bottoni, Patrizia; Martorana, Giuseppe E; Giardina, Bruno",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16022573/,308

METHODS Sixty-eight patients with grades III and IV hemorrhoids were randomized into two groups of 34 each, to undergo LH (Group 1) or SH (Group 2). Patient demographics, operative details, postoperative pain score, number of parenteral analgesic injections, hospital stay, and time to return to work were all prospectively collected. Postoperative complications and recurrence of prolapse were also recorded. All patients were regularly followed-up for a total period of 18 months. RESULTS Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between both groups. The mean operating time, postoperative pain score, parenteral analgesics, hospital stay and time off work were not statistically significant between both groups. Likewise, both groups had similar postoperative complications except for a residual prolapse that was observed, at four weeks postoperatively, in eight patients (23.53%) in the SH group as compared to two patients (5.89%) in the LH group (P=0.040). Although hemorrhoid recurrence, at 18 months, was also higher among the SH group as compared to the LH group (11.76% vs. 2.94%, respectively), yet the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.163). CONCLUSION Both LH and SH yield comparable good results and minimal side effects for the treatment of grades III and IV hemorrhoids, with less residual prolapses observed with LH. Further, owing to their low postoperative pain, short hospital stay and rapid return to work, both procedures offer an excellent therapeutic option for prolapsed grades III and IV hemorrhoids.","Sakr, M F; Moussa, M M; Elserafy, M",Minerva chirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668414/,308

These self-anchoring sutures incorporate evenly spaced barbs in a circumferential distribution along their length, facilitating knotless wound closure and even distribution of tension along the suture line. In this study, we evaluated postoperative complications associated with the use of unidirectional barbed sutures compared with standard sutures for closure of the abdominal incision in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction. METHODS A consecutive series of 142 patients undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction were identified at a single institution. The abdominal closure in the first 71 patients was performed using standard suture materials. In the subsequent 71 patients, closure was performed using unidirectional barbed sutures. Patient demographics, complications, procedure time, and costs were compared between standard and barbed suture groups. RESULTS Demographic characteristics and comorbidity profiles were similar between the 2 groups. Overall, there was a significantly higher incidence of complications in the standard suture group (17 vs 7 complications,P = .0423). Similar rates of wound infection (P = .4412), wound dehiscence (P = .4934), and seroma (P = .1157) were recorded in both groups. Barbed sutures were $ 15.58 more expensive than standard sutures. No significant difference in total length of operation was observed. CONCLUSION In this study, the utility of unidirectional barbed sutures in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction has been demonstrated. Barbed sutures may be useful in a broad range of plastic surgery procedures, not only because of their convenience but also based on favorable clinical outcomes.","de Blacam, Catherine; Colakoglu, Salih; Momoh, Adeyiza O; Lin, Samuel J; Tobias, Adam M; Lee, Bernard T",Eplasty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22662282/,308

Many elements have been examined to reach some conclusions and to allow an updated discussion. Surgical masks protect more the patient than the caregiver. Simple or double surgical masks may be useful, as double gloving protects the hands of the surgical personnel against percutaneous transmission of HIV eventually present in contaminated blood. The frequent substitution of the external masks with a new one will improve the filtering activity against droplets produced by cough or sneezes of the patient. The use of respiratory masks may be suggested in hospitals or in restricted ventilated areas where, even if coronavirus variant is considered an environmental contaminant more than a respiratory risk, droplets nuclei may persist in the air and add consistent dangers to the heath-care givers. Considering that large and medium droplets may infect floors and surfaces, in addition to gloves, gowns, masks and eyes protection, the available list of viral and bacterial factors implicated in SARS ethiology suggests a better hand antisepsis using frequently the alcohol based gels (containing an high percentage of emollients substances), if available. A liquid soap with triclosan can also be used, if the health-care workers compliance to hand washing increases, as expected in this explosive situation. On the basis of the results of some experimental data, the environmental disinfection may be effected with ethyl alcohol 70% in water. Disinfection of floors or larger surfaces may be obtained with chlorine compounds solutions, after an accurate pre-cleaning.

A portion of hitherto unexplained viral respiratory tract illnesses (RTIs) can now be attributed to the human metapneumovirus (hMPV), which was discovered in 2001. Several surveys on the burden of disease of hMPV infection have been conducted in various study groups and with different diagnostic assays. To estimate the impact of hMPV infection in a hospital setting and in the community at large, we reviewed these surveys to establish the burden of disease of hMPV infection. METHODS Published data and our own additional unpublished data on the clinical impact of hMPV infection were reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Worldwide, hMPV infections account for at least 5 to 7% of the RTI in hospitalized children, but immunocompromised and elderly individuals are also at risk. In the general community hMPV infections account for at least 3% of patients who visit a general practitioner for RTI. The seasonality of hMPV infections resembles that for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus infections, with recurrent epidemics during the winter months. Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings associated with hMPV infection exhibit a spectrum virtually indistinguishable from those associated with respiratory syncytial virus disease. The development of diagnostic assays must take into account the existence of two hMPV serotypes.","van den Hoogen, Bernadette G; Osterhaus, D M E; Fouchier, Ron A M",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14730267/,308
196980,Who should be immunised against hepatitis B?,1984,"Attention in this discussion of Viet Nam focuses on the following: history of the demographic situation; the government's overall approach to population problems; population data systems and development planning; institutional arangements for the integration of population within development planning; the government's view of the importance of population policy in achieving development objectives; population size, growth, and natural increase; morbidity and mortality; fertility; international migration; and spatial distribution. Relatively little information has been available on demographic trends in Viet Nam due to the absence of any major survey or census until the last few decades. The government increasingly has been concerned about the high rate of population growth and is working to change the situation through programs directed at fertility reduction. As part of its program for overall social and economic restructuring, the government seeks to give special attention to health problems, particularly those relating to maternal and child health and environmental sanitation. Population censuses in Viet Nam have been undertaken only in the last 2 decades, with censuses conducted in the North in 1960 and 1974. No population census was undertaken in the South, and any population information available was based upon the periodic population and household surveys conducted alternately in different provinces, cities, and rural areas during 1962, 1967, 1971, and 1974. The government considers the formulation and implementation of population policy to be a critical variable for realizing national development objectives. The population of Viet Nam has grown considerably since the 1950s, increasing from over 30 million in 1950 to 35.4 million in 1960 and reaching 43.1 million by 1970, according to UN estimates. 1979 census results indicate that the population of Viet Nam had reached 52.7 million. The current rate of growth is estimated at 2.2%. The government perceives the current rate of population growth as unsatisfactory because it is too high. The official government policy is to take steps to reduce the rate of population growth as rapidly as possible. All 3 demographic factors--mortality, fertility, and spatial distribution--are viewed as subject to direct policy intervention to achieve this goal. Rates of morbidity and mortality have declined considerably in the past few decades. The government reports a decline in the crude death rate from 12.2 in 1957 to 7.0 in 1980 and an increase in the life expectancy at birth from 34 years in 1936 to 60 in 1978. UN estimates are considerably higher. According to UN estimates, the infant mortality rate was 90.3/1000 live births during 1975-80 for Viet Nam as a whole. The current mortality and morbidity situation is considered to be unacceptable. The government estimates the crude birthrate as 29.3/1000 in 1980, an unsatisfactory level. The government perceives the present levels and trends of immigration as not significant and satisfactory and the spatial distribution as inappropriate.",,Population policy compendium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12339360/,308
197310,Estimating wildlife disease dynamics in complex systems using an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework.,2016,"The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, causes acute and chronic neurological diseases in rodents. Here we demonstrate that two closely related virus variants, both of which cause acute encephalitis in susceptible strains of mice, cause markedly different diseases if mice are protected with a suboptimal amount of an anti-JHM neutralizing antibody. One strain, JHM.SD, caused acute encephalitis, while infection with JHM.IA resulted in no acute disease. Using recombinant virus technology, we found that the differences between the two viruses mapped to the spike (S) glycoprotein and that the two S proteins differed at four amino acids. By engineering viruses that differed by only one amino acid, we identified a serine-to-glycine change at position 310 of the S protein (S310G) that recapitulated the more neurovirulent phenotype. The increased neurovirulence mediated by the virus encoding glycine at position S310 was not associated with a different tropism within the central nervous system (CNS) but was associated with increased lateral spread in the CNS, leading to significantly higher brain viral titers. In vitro studies revealed that S310G was associated with decreased S1-S2 stability and with enhanced ability to mediate infection of cells lacking the primary receptor for JHM (""receptor-independent spread""). These enhanced fusogenic properties of viruses encoding a glycine at position 310 of the S protein may contribute to spread within the CNS, a tissue in which expression of conventional JHM receptors is low.","Ontiveros, Evelena; Kim, Taeg S; Gallagher, Thomas M; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970410/,308

The contact interval from person i to person j is the time between the onset of infectiousness in i and infectious contact from i to j, where we define infectious contact as a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. The hazard function of the contact interval distribution equals the hazard of infectious contact from i to j, so it provides a summary of the evolution of infectiousness over time. When who-infects-whom is observed, the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the cumulative hazard function of the contact interval distribution. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we use an EM algorithm to average the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all possible combinations of who-infected-whom consistent with the observed data. This converges to a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the cumulative hazard function that we call the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate. We study the behavior of these methods in simulations and use them to analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.","Kenah, Eben","Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Separate adjusted mixed models were constructed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS There was significant weight loss, increased physical activity, improved fitness and reduced caloric intake over time (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in these outcome variables by obesity onset group. However, there was a significant group by time interaction for fitness (p = 0.001), with the adult onset making significantly greater gains in fitness from baseline to 6 months (p < 0.001); however, this difference was no longer present at 12 or 18 months. CONCLUSIONS With the exception of fitness at 6 months, weight loss, physical activity and diet did not differ between juvenile onset and adult onset participants, suggesting that those with juvenile onset obesity are equally responsive to a standard behavioral weight loss intervention in adulthood.","Rupp, K; Taverno Ross, S E; Lang, W; Jakicic, J M",Obesity science & practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27708841/,308

The 291-nucleotide clone shares 72% homology with the region of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) gene 1b that contains the packaging signal. RNA transcripts were packaged into both BCV and MHV virions when the cloned region was appended to a noncoronavirus RNA. This is the first identification of a BCV packaging signal. The data demonstrate that the BCV genome contains a sequence that is conserved at both the sequence and functional levels, thus broadening our insight into coronavirus packaging.","Cologna, R; Hogue, B G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10590153/,308

The aim of this study was to evaluate initial outcomes and recurrence rate of 92 patients who underwent LHR reinforced with a synthetic bioabsorbable mesh. Surgical approaches included LHR and Nissen fundoplication (n = 64), LHR without fundoplication (n = 10), reoperative LHR (n = 9), LHR with a bariatric operation (n = 6), and emergent LHR (n = 3). The mean length of hospital stay was 2 ± 3 days (range, 1 to 30 days). There were no conversions to open laparotomy and no intraoperative complications. One of 92 patients (1.1%) required intensive care unit stay. The 90-day mortality was zero. Minor complications occurred in 3.3 per cent, major complications in 2.2 per cent, and late complications in 5.5 per cent of patients. There were no perforations or early hernia recurrence. The 30-day reoperation rate was 1.1 per cent. For patients with available 1-year follow-up, the overall recurrence rate was 18.5 per cent with a mean follow-up of 30 months (range, 12 to 51 months). LHR repair with mesh is associated with low perioperative morbidity and no mortality. The use of bioabsorbable mesh appears to be safe with no early hiatal hernia recurrence or late mesh erosion. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the long-term rate of hernia recurrence associated with LHR with mesh.","Gebhart, Alana; Vu, Steven; Armstrong, Chris; Smith, Brian R; Nguyen, Ninh T",The American surgeon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24160791/,308

Immuno-chromatographic rapid tests (FASTest Strips) were applied in the field and their results were compared to the ones obtained with standard methods (modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, antigen-ELISA and cultivation). In 78% of the calves with diarrhea (n=46) and in 29% of the healthy calves (n=14), one or two agents were isolated. Of the diseased calves, 43% excreted cryptosporidia and in 46% rotavirus was isolated. Bovine corona virus and Escherichia coli F5 (K99) seemed to be of minor importance in the investigated population. Compared to the modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain or the antigen-ELISA, the FASTest Strips CRYPTO and ROTA were of very high diagnostic specificity of 100% each and their diagnostic sensitivity was 75% and 57%, respectively. Due to the low number of cases, the results of the FASTest Strips BCV and E.coli-K99 could not be interpreted. Although the diagnostic sensitivity of the FASTest Strips CRYPTO and ROTA--evaluated with standard methods--was not very high, their use in calves with acute diarrhea is recommended.","Luginbühl, A; Reitt, K; Metzler, A; Kollbrunner, M; Corboz, L; Deplazes, P",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15999634/,308

201282,Gum arabic/maltodextrin microencapsulation confers peroxidation stability and antimicrobial ability to pepper seed oil,2020,"Carcinoembryonic Ag cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) consists of highly related homologs in humans and rodents that are characterized by significant alternate splicing generating isoforms capable of negative intracellular signaling by virtue of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in its cytoplasmic (cyt) tail. Although human T cells have been recently observed to express CEACAM1, the expression and function of CEACAM1 in mouse T cells have not been defined. Although resting mouse spleen T cells exhibited no evidence of CEACAM1 on the cell surface, CEACAM1 was rapidly up-regulated on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after activation with either Con A or anti-CD3 without a requirement for either de novo transcription or translation due to the fact that CEACAM1 was present intracellularly before activation. Using a GST-CEACAM1-cytoplasmic tail fusion protein, it was shown that the cytoplasmic tail of CEACAM1 bound the src homology domain-containing phosphatase 1 and adaptor protein 1 complex in its phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated states, respectively. CEACAM1 ligation with an anti-CEACAM1 mAb resulted in inhibition of an allogeneic MLR and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 Ab-induced proliferation of spleen T cells in vitro and inhibition of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to oxazolone in vivo. Inhibition of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response required that the anti-CEACAM1-specific mAb be present at the time of T cell sensitization. These studies support a role for CEACAM1 as a novel class of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-bearing regulatory molecules on T cells that are active during early phases of the immune response in mice.","Nakajima, Atsushi; Iijima, Hideki; Neurath, Markus F; Nagaishi, Takashi; Nieuwenhuis, Edward E S; Raychowdhury, Raktima; Glickman, Jonathan; Blau, Dianna M; Russell, Sara; Holmes, Kathryn V; Blumberg, Richard S",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11801635/,308
202393,Equity Impacts of Dollar Store Vaccine Distribution,2021-04-03,"T cell immunity, such as CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses, plays a vital role in controlling the virus infection and pathological damage. Several studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 proteins could serve as ideal vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection by activating the T cell responses. In the current study, based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and distribution of host human leukocyte antigen (HLA), we predicted the possible epitopes for the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections. Firstly, the current study retrieved the SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein sequences from the NCBI Database. Then, using the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource, we predicted the CTL epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins according to worldwide frequency distributions of HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles (>1%). Our results predicted 90 and 106 epitopes of N and S proteins, respectively. Epitope cluster analysis showed 16 and 34 respective clusters of SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, which covered 95.91% and 96.14% of the global population, respectively. After epitope conservancy analysis, 8 N protein epitopes and 6 S protein epitopes showed conservancy within two SARS-CoV-2 types. Of these 14 epitopes, 13 could cover SARS coronavirus and Bat SARS-like coronavirus. The remaining epitope (KWPWYIWLGF1211-1220) could cover MERS coronavirus. Finally, the 14-epitope combination could vaccinate 89.60% of all individuals worldwide. Our results propose single or combined CTL epitopes predicted in the current study as candidates for vaccines to effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection and development.","Cun, Yina; Li, Chuanyin; Shi, Lei; Sun, Ming; Dai, Shuying; Sun, Le; Shi, Li; Yao, Yufeng",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,308
202771,Israel: Background and US Relations in Brief,2020,"KEY MESSAGE: Among SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers, vaginal delivery rates were high and associated with favorable outcomes with no cases of neonatal COVID-19. PURPOSE: To investigate the mode of delivery and its impact on immediate neonatal outcome in SARS-CoV-2-infected women. METHODS: A prospective study following pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 who delivered between March 15th and July 4th in seven university affiliated hospitals in Israel. RESULTS: A total of 52 women with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 delivered in the participating centers during the study period. The median gestational age at the time of delivery was 38 weeks, with 16 (30.8%) cases complicated by spontaneous preterm birth. Forty-three women (82.7%) underwent a trial of labor. The remaining 9 women underwent pre-labor cesarean delivery mostly due to obstetric indications, whereas one woman with a critical COVID-19 course underwent urgent cesarean delivery due to maternal deterioration. Among those who underwent a trial of labor (n = 43), 39 (90.7%) delivered vaginally, whereas 4 (9.3%) cases resulted in cesarean delivery. Neonatal RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs tested negative in all cases, and none of the infants developed pneumonia. No maternal and neonatal deaths were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study among SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers, vaginal delivery rates were high and associated with favorable outcomes with no cases of neonatal COVID-19. Our findings underscore that delivery management among SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers should be based on obstetric indications and may potentially reduce the high rates of cesarean delivery previously reported in this setting.","Rottenstreich, Amihai; Tsur, Abraham; Braverman, Nava; Kabiri, Doron; Porat, Shay; Benenson, Shmuel; Oster, Yonatan; Kam, Hadas Allouche; Walfisch, Asnat; Bart, Yossi; Meyer, Raanan; Lifshitz, Shirlee Jaffe; Amikam, Uri; Biron-Shental, Tal; Cohen, Gal; Sciaky-Tamir, Yael; Shachar, Inbar Ben; Yinon, Yoav; Reubinoff, Benjamin",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,308

We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive COVID-19, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.","Thakur, Kiran T; Miller, Emily Happy; Glendinning, Michael D; Al-Dalahmah, Osama; Banu, Matei A; Boehme, Amelia K; Boubour, Alexandra L; Bruce, Samuel S; Chong, Alexander M; Claassen, Jan; Faust, Phyllis L; Hargus, Gunnar; Hickman, Richard A; Jambawalikar, Sachin; Khandji, Alexander G; Kim, Carla Y; Klein, Robyn S; Lignelli-Dipple, Angela; Lin, Chun-Chieh; Liu, Yang; Miller, Michael L; Moonis, Gul; Nordvig, Anna S; Overdevest, Jonathan B; Prust, Morgan L; Przedborski, Serge; Roth, William H; Soung, Allison; Tanji, Kurenai; Teich, Andrew F; Agalliu, Dritan; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Goldman, James E; Canoll, Peter",Brain,,308

205331,Into the unknown,2020,"Purpose: We aim to study the level of mental health distress and COVID-19 prevention in practice behaviors among general practitioners (GPs) in Bali, Indonesia, as well as their determinants. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey. Survey recruitment material was disseminated by purposive snowballing through regional professional association as well as research team's personal acquaintances. The survey measured mental health status by DASS-21 questionnaire and practice behavior by a questionnaire based on WHO recommendations for hand hygiene and PPE use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted multivariate analyses to identify independent determinants for mental health and practice behavior. Results: Analyses included 635 (41.75%) of GPs in Bali. Mental health status was relatively good with prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress of 13.2%, 19.7%, and 11% respectively, lower than previous studies in Indonesia and elsewhere. Practice behavior, however, was not considerably lower with only 65.4% and 32.1% reported consistent hand hygiene and recommended PPE use respectively. Routine optional PPE use was reported by 23.6% of respondents. Long working hours and fear of COVID-19 was identified as detrimental to mental health while consistent hand hygiene improved it. Meanwhile, workplace, work setting, and fear of COVID-19, were identified as determinants for PPE use. GPs working in primary health centers and private hospitals were also found to have less adherence to hand hygiene protocols. Conclusion: Our results showed relatively good mental health status along with inadequate infection prevention in practice behavior of GPs in Bali, Indonesia. Intervention should be made to improve practice behavior. Determinants of practice behavior identified in this study could help to pinpoint intervention targets.","Sitanggang, F. P.; Wirawan, G. B.

207887,Dare we hope,2021,"This study explores hospital workers' experiences with workplace communication overload and its implications for effective safety and risk messaging in hospital organizations. We use a multi-step thematic analysis of interview (N = 12) and focus group (N = 8, 28 participants) data collected from hospital workers to analyze how they describe specific organizational communication channels influencing their communication overload. We specifically examine how workers' socially constructed channel affordances and constraints for sending/receiving safety information provide meaning to their communicatively overloaded states. Hospital workers explained that asynchronous channels such as e-mail and voicemail aggravated communication overload, while synchronous channels such as team huddles alleviated it. We discuss the implications of these results for the communication overload model by pointing to violations of communication channel preference and literature on the social affordances of communication channels. Study limitations and future directions are offered.","Barrett, Ashley K; Ford, Jessica; Zhu, Yaguang",Health Commun,,308
208001,Deep Geometric Texture Synthesis,2020-06-30,"Benzophenone synthase (BPS) catalyzes the production of 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone via the condensation of benzoyl-CoA and three units of malonyl-CoA. The biosynthetic pathway proceeds with the formation of the prenylated xanthone &#945;-mangostin from 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone. Structural elucidation was performed to gain a better understanding of the structural basis of the function of Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) BPS (GmBPS). The structure reveals the common core consisting of a five-layer &#945;ß&#945;ß&#945; fold as found in other type III polyketide synthase enzymes. The three residues Met264, Tyr266 and Gly339 are proposed to have a significant impact on the substrate-binding specificity of the active site. Crystallographic and docking studies indicate why benzoyl-CoA is preferred over 4-coumaroyl-CoA as the substrate for GmBPS. Met264 and Tyr266 in GmBPS are properly oriented for accommodation of the 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone product but not of naringenin. Gly339 offers a minimal steric hindrance to accommodate the extended substrate. Moreover, the structural arrangement of Thr133 provides the elongation activity and consequently facilitates extension of the polyketide chain. In addition to its impact on the substrate selectivity, Ala257 expands the horizontal cavity and might serve to facilitate the initiation/cyclization reaction. The detailed structure of GmBPS explains its catalytic function, facilitating further structure-based engineering to alter its substrate specificity and obtain the desired products.","Songsiriritthigul, Chomphunuch; Nualkaew, Natsajee; Ketudat-Cairns, James; Chen, Chun Jung",Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun,,308

208179,"Determining crucial genes associated with COVID-19 based on COPD Findingsâ¶,â¶â¶",2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral epidemics have negative and sometimes extreme impacts on psychological well-being, particularly in health care workers. Studies have reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, distress, fear, burnout, and post-traumatic symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to explore the psychological impacts of COVID 19 on paramedicine students. METHODS: A convergent mixed method design study was undertaken using self-reporting instruments and qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Responses were received from 151 students (38.3% responses rate). Most students experienced some level of anxiety (62%), although severe levels were only reported by 6% of respondents. Students had significantly greater odds (OR = 2.05, p = 0.045, 95% CI: 1.02, 4.12) of higher anxiety levels if they were female. Thematic analysis of the interviews largely supported these results, with themes focused on changing approaches to study, financial situation, social support, University adaptation, acceptance and career pathway choice. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified and explored the anxiety and coping strategies in an undergraduate paramedicine cohort when faced with a viral epidemic. Although most of the responding paramedic students reported above normal levels of anxiety in the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, many students, with the help of learning, financial and social support, and a range of positive coping strategies, have adapted well to the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdown period.","King, Christine; Shannon, Brendan; Gosling, Cameron",Int Emerg Nurs,,308
208248,Learning From Mistakes: The Role of Phages in Pandemics,2021,"Serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used across pathologies, often providing users a simple, binary result (positive or negative) in as little as 5 to 20 min. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, new RDTs for identifying SARS-CoV-2 have rapidly proliferated. However, these seemingly easy-to-read tests can be highly subjective, and interpretations of the visible ""bands"" of color that appear (or not) in a test window may vary between users, test models, and brands. We developed and evaluated the accuracy/performance of a smartphone application (xRCovid) that uses machine learning to classify SARS-CoV-2 serological RDT results and reduce reading ambiguities. Across 11 COVID-19 RDT models, the app yielded 99.3% precision compared to reading by eye. Using the app replaces the uncertainty from visual RDT interpretation with a smaller uncertainty of the image classifier, thereby increasing confidence of clinicians and laboratory staff when using RDTs, and creating opportunities for patient self-testing.","Mendels, David-A; Dortet, Laurent; Emeraud, Cécile; Oueslati, Saoussen; Girlich, Delphine; Ronat, Jean-Baptiste; Bernabeu, Sandrine; Bahi, Silvestre; Atkinson, Gary J H; Naas, Thierry",Proc.

Much, but not all, of the guidance has been previously published in peer-reviewed journals. Our purpose is to collect it in one location to serve as a stand-alone resource for decision modelers who draw most or all of their information from the published literature. Our focus is on the technical aspects of manipulating data to derive transition probabilities. We explain how to derive model transition probabilities from the following types of statistics: relative risks, odds, odds ratios, and rates. We then review the well-known approach for converting probabilities to match the model's cycle length when there are two health-state transitions and how to handle the case of three or more health-state transitions, for which the two-state approach is not appropriate. Other topics discussed include transition probabilities for population subgroups, issues to keep in mind when using data from different sources in the derivation process, and sensitivity analyses, including the use of sensitivity analysis to allocate analyst effort in refining transition probabilities and ways to handle sources of uncertainty that are not routinely formalized in models. The paper concludes with recommendations to help modelers make the best use of the published literature.","Gidwani, Risha; Russell, Louise B",Pharmacoeconomics,,308

Healthcare workers are at risk of contracting and spreading SARS-CoV-2 given their proximity to positive cases, often with a lack of personal protective equipment. The South African Department of Health requires that all employees be screened daily for symptoms and potential persons under investigation identified timeously. This report aims to assesses the efficacy of daily self-screening tools in detecting and managing potential staff cases of SARS-CoV-2. Our hospital, situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, developed a daily self-screening tool for all healthcare workers to complete, consisting of questions on symptoms and epidemiological risk factors. The screening tools were collected and assessed after four weeks of use. Fifty-four forms were assessed. Twenty-eight (51.9%) forms were not completed, whilst 12 (22.2%) indicated positive symptoms with no documentation that any further medical assessment, testing or isolation was done. We identified that the poor completion of forms was likely because of the lack of education of staff on the importance of the forms, poor oversight by management, staff forgetfulness or lack of awareness of the forms. Screening of staff is vital during this pandemic but requires constant oversight by line managers, staff motivation and adequate education. Ongoing development of efficient screening programmes is required.","Booth, Amy; Omed, Ridwaan A; Naidoo, Mergan",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,308

211725,The Asymmetry Between Growth Opportunities and Debt Maturity Structure (preprint),2021,"Ivermectin is a widely used antiparasitic drug with known efficacy against several single-strain RNA viruses. Recent data shows significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro by ivermectin concentrations not achievable with safe doses orally. Inhaled therapy has been used with success for other antiparasitics. An ethanol-based ivermectin formulation was administered once to 14 rats using a nebulizer capable of delivering particles with alveolar deposition. Rats were randomly assigned into three target dosing groups, lower dose (80-90 mg/kg), higher dose (110-140 mg/kg) or ethanol vehicle only. A toxicology profile including behavioral and weight monitoring, full blood count, biochemistry, necropsy and histological examination of the lungs was conducted. The pharmacokinetic profile of ivermectin in plasma and lungs was determined in all animals. There were no relevant changes in behavior or body weight. There was a delayed elevation in muscle enzymes compatible with rhabdomyolysis, that was also seen in the control group and has been attributed to the ethanol dose which was up to 11 g/kg in some animals. There were no histological anomalies in the lungs of any rat. Male animals received a higher ivermectin dose adjusted by adipose weight and reached higher plasma concentrations than females in the same dosing group (mean Cmax 86.2 ng/ml vs. 26.2 ng/ml in the lower dose group and 152 ng/ml vs. 51.8 ng/ml in the higher dose group). All subjects had detectable ivermectin concentrations in the lungs at seven days post intervention, up to 524.3 ng/g for high-dose male and 27.3 ng/g for low-dose females. nebulized ivermectin can reach pharmacodynamic concentrations in the lung tissue of rats, additional experiments are required to assess the safety of this formulation in larger animals.","Chaccour, Carlos; Abizanda, Gloria; Irigoyen-Barrio, Ángel; Casellas, Aina; Aldaz, Azucena; Martínez-Galán, Fernando; Hammann, Felix; Gil, Ana Gloria",Sci Rep,,308
212077,Establishment of Monoclonal Antibody Standards for Quantitative Serological Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in Low Incidence Settings,2021,"BACKGROUND: Asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants experience a number of risk factors for mental health problems. However, in comparison to the host population, these populations are less likely to use mental health services. Digital mental health approaches have been shown to be effective in improving well-being for the general population. Thus, they may provide an effective and culturally appropriate strategy to bridge the treatment gap for these populations vulnerable to mental health risks. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to provide the background and rationale for conducting a scoping review on digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants. It also provides an outline of the methods and analyses, which will be used to answer the following questions. What are the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants? Are they effective, feasible, appropriate, and accepted by the population? What are the knowledge gaps in the field? METHODS: The scoping review methodology will follow 5 phases: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Searches will be conducted in the following databases: EBSCOhost databases (CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and APA PsycInfo), PubMed, and Scopus. Additionally, OpenGrey, Mednar, and Eldis will be searched for gray literature. All primary studies and gray literature in English concerning the use of information and communication technology to deliver services addressing mental health issues for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants will be included. RESULTS: This scoping review will provide an overview of the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants and describe the implementation outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of such approaches for those populations. Potential gaps in the field will also be identified. CONCLUSIONS: As of February 2020, there were no scoping reviews, which assessed the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the available digital mental health resources for asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrants. This review will provide an extensive coverage on a promising and innovative intervention for such populations. It will give insight into the range of approaches, their effectiveness, and progress in their implementation. It will also provide valuable information for health practitioners, policy makers, and researchers working with the population.

Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including mania. We present a case of a middle aged man presenting with acute mania with psychotic symptoms 20 days post COVID infection in the absence of prior psychiatric illness. This report highlights the need for rigorous neuropsychiatric assessment in patient with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.MethodA 52-year-old man of West African origin with past history of hypertension and no previous history of mental health illness presented with acute manic symptoms on background of two weeks of high fever, diarrhoea, mild headache, dry cough and anosmia. He was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID PCR test. He was under self-isolation along with his family members who exhibited mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, none of them required hospital admission. He was initially fearful to seek medical attention but was brought in by family after exhibiting behaviour changes, obsession with toilet cleaning, reckless spending and getting aggressive approximately two weeks after the onset of acute upper respiratory symptoms. He presented elated in mood with pressure of speech and grandiose ideas. Investigations like neuroimaging and bloods were unremarkable. Initial psychiatric assessment found symptoms consistent with acute mania and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. During admission, he was sexually disinhibited and agitated on the ward requiring IM antipsychotics. He was treated with high dose of Olanzapine and Sodium valproate and his symptoms subsided within two weeks.ResultThis case emphasises the manifestation of neuropsychiatric illness post COVID-19 without a background of psychiatric illness, hypoxemia and cerebral infarction.Based on the CORONERVE Programme and latest retrospective Lancet cohort studies, the period between 14 and 90 days after diagnosis, 5.8% COVID-19 survivors had their first recorded diagnosis of psychiatric illness.It is also important to consider other organic disease given the simultaneous diagnosis of COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to confirm here due to the lack of a validated CSF-PCR assay, previous reports have implicated SARS-CoV-2 in the development of viral encephalitis, and this remains an important differential.ConclusionClinicians should be alert to the possibility of patients with COVID-19 developing neuropsychiatric complications post SARS-CoV-2 infection, mandating the need for vigilant initial neuropsychiatric assessment and possibly follow-up care in 3 months.","Shanmugam, Sridevi Kumar Praveen Carr Blaga",BJPsych Open,,308

Little information is known about nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family members. METHODS: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological characteristics from 25 healthcare workers with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5â days, the mean±sd clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.2±3.2â days, and the median virus shedding time was 18.5â days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they have symptoms, in both hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas. Besides this, healthcare workers should be alert during the epidemic and self-quarantine if self-suspected of infection.","Wang, Xiaorong; Zhou, Qiong; He, Yukun; Liu, Lingbo; Ma, Xinqian; Wei, Xiaoshan; Jiang, Nanchuan; Liang, Limei; Zheng, Yali; Ma, Ling; Xu, Yu; Yang, Dong; Zhang, Jianchu; Yang, Bohan; Jiang, Ning; Deng, Tao; Zhai, Bingbing; Gao, Yang; Liu, Wenxuan; Bai, Xinghua; Pan, Tao; Wang, Guoqing; Chang, Yujun; Zhang, Zhi; Shi, Huanzhong; Ma, Wan-Li; Gao, Zhancheng",Eur. respir. j,,308

Plans and policies for responding to public health emergencies are generally framed at higher levels of governance, but developing, improving and sustaining the capacities necessary for implementing these policies is a direct function of local-level authorities. Evaluating local-level public health capacities is an important process for identifying strengths and weaknesses that can impact the preparedness for, detection of and response to health security threats. However, while various evaluations and assessments exist for evaluating capacities at other levels, currently, there are no readily available health security assessments for the local-level. In this paper, we describe a tool-the Rapid Urban Health Security Assessment (RUHSA) Tool-that is based on a variety of other relevant assessments and guidance documents. Assessing capacities allow for local-level authorities to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their local health security systems, create multiyear action plans and prioritise opportunities for improving capacities, effectively engage with development partners to target resources effectively and develop compelling narratives and a legacy of leadership. While the RUHSA Tool was not designed to be used in the midst of a public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it may also be adapted to inform a checklist for prioritising what capacities and activities a city needs to rapidly develop or to help focus requests for assistance.","Boyce, Matthew R; Katz, Rebecca",,,308
217957,Affine Quantization on the Half Line,2020-05-18,"Managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a challenge faced by clinicians and their patients, especially concerning whether to proceed with biologics and immunosuppressive agents in the background of a global outbreak of a highly contagious new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). The knowledge about the impact of this virus on patients with IBD, although it is still scarce, is rapidly evolving. In particular, concerns surrounding medications' impact for IBD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection or developing COVID-19, and potentially exacerbate viral replication and the COVID-19 course, are a current thinking of both practicing clinicians and providers caring for patients with IBD. Managing patients with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 depends on both the clinical activity of the IBD and the occasional development and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the current data regarding gastrointestinal involvement by SARS-CoV-2 and pharmacologic and surgical management for IBD concerning this infection, and the COVID-19 impact on both the patient's psychological functioning and endoscopy services, and we concisely summarize the telemedicine roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chebli, Júlio Maria Fonseca; Queiroz, Natália Sousa Freitas; Damião, Adérson Omar Mourão Cintra; Chebli, Liliana Andrade; Costa, Márcia Henriques de Magalhães; Parra, Rogério Serafim",World J Gastroenterol,,308

With the advent of globalisation and rapid growth in the information technology sector, the world has opened itself to numerous vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities range from individual-centric privacy issues to collective interests in the form of a nation's political and economic interests. While we have victims who can identify themselves as victims, there are also victims who can barely identify themselves as victims, and there are those who do not realise that they have become victims. Misinformation, disinformation, fake news and other methods of spreading questionable content can be regarded as a new and increasingly widespread type of collective victimisation. This paper, drawing on recent examples from India, examines and analyses the rationale and modus operandi-both methods and types-that lead us to regard questionable content as a new form of collective victimisation.","Chang, Lennon Y C; Mukherjee, Souvik; Coppel, Nicholas",Asian J Criminol,,308
218172,Projected Statistical Methods for Distributional Data on the Real Line with the Wasserstein Metric,2021-01-22,"BackgroundCOVID-19-related restrictions impacted weight and weight-related factors during the initial months of the pandemic. However, longitudinal analyses are scarce. MethodsAn online, longitudinal study was conducted among self-selected UK adults (n=1,818), involving three surveys during 2020 (May-June, August-September, November-December), covering height, weight and sociodemographic, COVID-19-related and behavioural measures. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. ResultsSelf-reported average weight and body mass index (BMI) significantly increased from May-June to August-September (74.95kg to 75.33kg, 26.22kg/m2 to 26.36kg/m2, both p<0.001), and then significantly decreased to November-December (to 75.06kg, 26.27kg/m2, both p<0.01), comparable to May-June levels (p=0.274/0.204). However, there was great interindividual variation, with 37.0%/26.7% reporting an increase and 34.5%/26.3% reporting a decrease in weight/BMI greater than 0.5kg/0.5kg/m2, respectively from May-June to November-December. The average weight/BMI increase was 3.64kg (95% confidence interval: 3.32,3.97)/1.64kg/m2 (1.49,1.79), and the average weight/BMI decrease was 3.59kg (3.34,3.85)/1.53kg/m2 (1.42,1.63). In fully adjusted models, increase in weight/BMI across surveys was significantly negatively associated with initial BMI, and positively associated with monthly high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks intake and alcohol consumption, and for BMI only, older age. However, associations were time-varying, such that lower initial BMI, higher HFSS snacks intake and high-risk alcohol consumption were associated with maintenance of increased weight/BMI from August-September to November-December. ConclusionThe average weight/BMI of UK adults increased during the early pandemic months, before returning to baseline levels in November-December 2020. However, this masks substantial interindividual variation in weight/BMI trajectories, indicating vulnerabilities associated with changes in food and alcohol consumption throughout the pandemic. What is currently known from previous studiesO_LISmall increases in average weight/BMI have been reported (1.57kg/0.31kg/m2) during the initial three months of the pandemic. C_LIO_LIChanges in weight/BMI during the early months were not uniform, with significant proportions increasing (11.2-72.4%) as well as decreasing (7.2-51.4%) weight/BMI. C_LIO_LIWeight/BMI change has been associated with several sociodemographic, lifestyle and behavioural factors. C_LIO_LIWhether these weight/BMI changes persist over longer durations of the pandemic, and the factors associated with any long-term weight/BMI change is largely unknown. C_LI What this paper addsO_LIIn UK adults, average weight/BMI first increased and then decreased from May to December 2020 during the pandemic, but this masks large interindividual variability in average changes. C_LIO_LIInitial BMI at the start of the pandemic and health behavioural factors such as alcohol consumption and high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks intake were significantly associated with a change in weight/BMI.

219131,Toward An Interdisciplinary Methodology to Solve New (Old) Transportation Problems,2020-02-20,"COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. In the absence of efficient therapeutics or large-scale vaccination, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 governmental interventions published up to May 22, 2020, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.","Jorge, Daniel C P; Rodrigues, Moreno S; Silva, Mateus S; Cardim, Luciana L; da Silva, Nívea B; Silveira, Ismael H; Silva, Vivian A F; Pereira, Felipe A C; de Azevedo, Arthur R; Amad, Alan A S; Pinho, Suani T R; Andrade, Roberto F S; Ramos, Pablo I P; Oliveira, Juliane F",Epidemics,,308

The development of a universal human coronavirus vaccine could prevent future pandemics. We characterize 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID-19+ subjects and identify 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targets the N-terminal domain (NTD), one recognizes an epitope in S2, and 11 bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the neutralization potency and antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralize the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus, our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.","Jennewein, Madeleine F; MacCamy, Anna J; Akins, Nicholas R; Feng, Junli; Homad, Leah J; Hurlburt, Nicholas K; Seydoux, Emilie; Wan, Yu-Hsin; Stuart, Andrew B; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Mascola, John R; Doria-Rose, Nicole; Wang, Lingshu; Yang, Eun Sung; Chu, Helen Y; Torres, Jonathan L; Ozorowski, Gabriel; Ward, Andrew B; Whaley, Rachael E; Cohen, Kristen W; Pancera, Marie; McElrath, M Juliana; Englund, Janet A; Finzi, Andrés; Suthar, Mehul S; McGuire, Andrew T; Stamatatos, Leonidas",Cell Rep,,308

223104,Automated Lay Language Summarization of Biomedical Scientific Reviews,2020-12-23,"BackgroundThe current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had large impacts on society, including people practicing social distancing. This behavioral response has increased loneliness. Loneliness not only increases the risk of psychiatric disorders, but also affects occupational mental health. To avoid the negative effects of isolation, it is important to have social contact with other people, especially family members. Employment and economic instability caused by COVID-19 may have also affected family relationships. It is important to understand the association between family relationships and loneliness in workers under the pandemic. MethodsWe collected usable data from 27,036 Japanese workers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked how long they spend with members of their family during mealtimes or at home, and if they experienced loneliness; the latter was assessed by a single question. Other questions included whether participants lived with their spouse, or with someone in need of care. To estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of time with family associated with loneliness we used a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustments for age, sex, marital status, presence of a cohabitant requiring care, equivalent income, educational level, frequency of remote work, availability of someone for casual chat, smoking, drinking, time for leisure interests, and cumulative rates of COVID-19 in the prefecture. ResultsTen percent (2,750) of the 27,036 participants reported loneliness. The survey showed a significant negative correlation between time spent with family and loneliness (p<0.001): participants who spent more time with family were less likely to feel loneliness. In addition, not living with a spouse and living with someone in need of care were associated with loneliness (not living with a spouse: p<0.001; living with someone in need of care: p<0.001). ConclusionLoneliness under COVID-19 pandemic conditions was negatively associated with time spent with family members, with the converse result found for participants cohabiting with someone in need of care. These associations suggest the potential value of changes to working practices and interventions to combat loneliness.","Fujii, Rintaro; Konno, Yusuke; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Hino, Ayako; Tsuji, Mayumi; Ikegami, Kazunori; Nagata, Masako; Yoshimura, Reiji; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",,,308

To aid in this effort, we have developed an interpretable risk calculator that utilized de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (UAB-i2b2) COVID-19 repository under the U-BRITE framework. The generated risk scores are analogous to commonly used credit scores where higher scores indicate higher risks for COVID-19 infection. By design, these risk scores can easily be calculated in spreadsheets or even with pen and paper. To predict risk, we implemented a Credit Scorecard modeling approach on longitudinal EHR data from 7,262 patients enrolled in the UAB Health System who were evaluated and/or tested for COVID-19 between January and June 2020. In this cohort, 912 patients were positive for COVID-19. Our workflow considered the timing of symptoms and medical conditions and tested the effects by applying different variable selection techniques such as LASSO and Elastic-Net. Within the two weeks before a COVID-19 diagnosis, the most predictive features were respiratory symptoms such as cough, abnormalities of breathing, pain in the throat and chest as well as other chronic conditions including nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder. When extending the timeframe to include all medical conditions across all time, our models also uncovered several chronic conditions impacting the respiratory, cardiovascular, central nervous and urinary organ systems. The whole pipeline of data processing, risk modeling and web-based risk calculator can be applied to any EHR data following the OMOP common data format. The results can be employed to generate questionnaires to estimate COVID-19 risk for screening in building entries or to optimize hospital resources.","Mamidi, T. K. K.; Tran-Nguyen, T.

How should our understanding of capacity shift in light of COVID-19, and how can we incorporate political capacity into thinking about pandemic preparedness? Second, several of the mechanisms through which democracy has been shown to be beneficial for health have not traveled well to explain the performance of governments in this pandemic.

226103,Promoting equitable water distribution system from Melamchi Water Supply Project in Kathmandu Valley,2020,"BACKGROUND: The surge of critically ill patients due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) overwhelmed critical care capacity in areas of northern Italy. Anesthesia machines have been used as alternatives to traditional ICU mechanical ventilators. However, the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure cared for with Anesthesia Machines is currently unknow. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving care with Anesthesia Machines would have worse outcomes compared to standard practice. METHODS: We designed a retrospective study of patients admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a large tertiary urban hospital in northern Italy. Two care units were included: a 27-bed standard ICU and a 15-bed temporary unit emergently opened in an operating room setting. Intubated patients assigned to Anesthesia Machines (AM group) were compared to a control cohort treated with standard mechanical ventilators (ICU-VENT group). Outcomes were assessed at 60-day follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis of risk factors between survivors and non-survivors was conducted to determine the adjusted risk of death for patients assigned to AM group. RESULTS: Complete daily data from 89 mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted to the two units were analyzed. Seventeen patients were included in the AM group, whereas 72 were in the ICU-VENT group. Disease severity and intensity of treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the AM group compared to the ICU-vent group (12/17 vs. 27/72, 70.6% vs. 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.016). Allocation to AM group was associated with a significantly increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (HR 4.05, 95% CI: 1.75-9.33, p = 0.001). Several incidents and complications were reported with Anesthesia Machine care, raising safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that care associated with the use of Anesthesia Machines is inadequate to provide long-term critical care to patients with COVID-19. Added safety risks must be considered if no other option is available to treat severely ill patients during the ongoing pandemic.

METHODS: The study used a quantitative, cross-sectional approach. Data was collected online using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18); the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-6 (CAS-6) and a questionnaire that included psychological and sociodemographic questions. The total sample size consisted of 1559 respondents from Honduras (34%), Chile (29%), Costa Rica (17%), Mexico (11%), and Spain (9%). RESULTS: The most common stress domains correspond to family (22.97%), financial (22.53%), academic (16.47%), leisure time constraints (14.23%), health (12.48%), peer group (7.63%), and religious concerns (3.69%). These domains are significantly associated with the respondent's country, sex, employment status, and being or not a health worker. Respondents who reported confinement stress also reported higher scores in anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Global Severity Index was significantly predicted by confinement stress, health, academic, and leisure time-related stress, sex, age, being a health worker, COVID-19 Personal Concern, and Perceived Seriousness. Non-significant predictors were employment status, the number of people at home, presence of older adults and children at home, financial, peer group, family, and religious concerns; the regression model had an R2 of 0.26. Similar analyses were conducted for somatization, depression, and anxiety subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the mental health of the general population, particularly regarding anxiety, depression, and somatization.

One of the affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus receptor binding domains and neutralizes representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with high potency. Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a distinct angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope that overlaps the receptor binding site. In immunocompetent mouse models of SARS and COVID-19, prophylactic administration of ADG-2 provided complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate against clade 1 sarbecoviruses.","Rappazzo, C Garrett; Tse, Longping V; Kaku, Chengzi I; Wrapp, Daniel; Sakharkar, Mrunal; Huang, Deli; Deveau, Laura M; Yockachonis, Thomas J; Herbert, Andrew S; Battles, Michael B; O039,; Brien, Cecilia M; Brown, Michael E; Geoghegan, James C; Belk, Jonathan; Peng, Linghang; Yang, Linlin; Hou, Yixuan; Scobey, Trevor D; Burton, Dennis R; Nemazee, David; Dye, John M; Voss, James E; Gunn, Bronwyn M; McLellan, Jason S; Baric, Ralph S; Gralinski, Lisa E; Walker, Laura M",Science,,308

228081,Vaccine mandates in the US and Australia: balancing benefits and burdens for children and physicians,2020,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19-related shortage of ICU beds magnified the need of tools to properly titrate the ventilator assistance. We investigated whether bedside-available indices such as the ultrasonographic changes in diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) and the tidal swing in central venous pressure (&#916;CVP) are reliable estimates of inspiratory effort, assessed as the tidal swing in esophageal pressure (&#916;Pes). METHODS: Prospective, observational clinical investigation in the intensive care unit of a tertiary care Hospital. Fourteen critically-ill patients were enrolled (age 64 ± 7 years, BMI 29 ± 4 kg/m2), after 6 [3; 9] days from onset of assisted ventilation. A three-level pressure support trial was performed, at 10 (PS10), 5 (PS5) and 0 cmH2O (PS0). In each step, the esophageal and central venous pressure tidal swing were recorded, as well as diaphragm ultrasound. RESULTS: The reduction of pressure support was associated with an increased respiratory rate and a reduced tidal volume, while minute ventilation was unchanged. &#916;Pes significantly increased with reducing support (5 [3; 8] vs. 8 [14; 13] vs. 12 [6; 16] cmH2O, p < 0.0001), as did the diaphragm TR (9.2 ± 6.1 vs. 17.6 ± 7.2 vs. 28.0 ± 10.0%, p < 0.0001) and the &#916;CVP (4 [3; 7] vs. 8 [5; 9] vs. 10 [7; 11] cmH2O, p < 0.0001). &#916;CVP was significantly associated with &#916;Pes (R2 = 0.810, p < 0.001), as was diaphragm TR, albeit with a lower coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.399, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation, &#916;CVP is a better estimate of inspiratory effort than diaphragm ultrasound.","Lassola, Sergio; Miori, Sara; Sanna, Andrea; Cucino, Alberto; Magnoni, Sandra; Umbrello, Michele",J. clin. monit. comput,,308

The objective of this study was to review the EEG findings in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection through a systematic review of published articles. METHODS: We systematically searched until July 25, 2020 for published articles that reported on descriptive EEG findings in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in PUBMED by Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL by the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: From a total of 94 identified records, 29 relevant articles were included in this review. A total of 177 patients with COVID-19 with descriptive EEG reports were analyzed. The most common indication for EEG was unexplained altered mental status. Disturbances of background activity such as generalized and focal slowing were seen as well epileptiform abnormalities and rhythmic or periodic discharges. There were no consistent EEG findings specific to COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The EEG findings in COVID-19 appear to be non-specific. Further research on the relationship of the EEG findings to the clinical state and short- or long-term prognosis of COVID-19 patients may be conducted to help clinicians discern which patients would necessitate an EEG procedure and would eventually require treatment.","Roberto, Katrina T; Espiritu, Adrian I; Fernandez, Marc Laurence L; Gutierrez, Josephine C",Seizure,,308

Thailand was the first to report a confirmed case outside China. Cutaneous eruption in COVID-19 has been reported since the disease became pandemic but limited in tropical countries such as Thailand. The aim of this study was to observe the incidence, characteristics and relation of cutaneous eruption with COVID-19 at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, a referral center of emerging infectious diseases in Thailand. An observational descriptive study observed the incidence and characteristics of cutaneous eruption in 204 COVID-19-infected patients at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute. We report five patients, who represented six incidences of skin eruption with four characteristics: maculopapular rash (50%), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (16.67%), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (16.67%) and urticarial vasculitis (16.67%). Incidences of cutaneous eruption in COVID-19 at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute were low. Most of the incidents were associated with medication used to treat COVID-19 infection, so drug allergy cannot be excluded as a cause of the rashes. Therefore, drug allergy should always be ruled out, and skin manifestation in COVID-19-infected patients should be further observed.","Punyaratabandhu, Preawphan; Chirachanakul, Pornchai",J Dermatol,,308

Yet, that occurred at the very onset of the COVID-19 era, a time that has shattered any preconceived notions of what I might experience during a clinical visit. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many physicians to approach patient care in completely different ways. While many have been providing care in hospitals, many more of us have had to stop seeing patients in person, shift to telemedicine, and consider other ways to improve the health of our patients. The rapid changes we have had to make in the last year have demonstrated the resiliency of our profession. This is a critical time to refocus and make sure that health care is person-centered, encompasses all modifiable health determinants, and helps individuals achieve health rather than primarily manage disease.","Rosenbaum, Elena",Ann Fam Med,,308

With many countries lifting lockdown restrictions, aesthetic clinics have started reopening with strict standard operating procedures in place. It is pertinent that the physician today understands the infection, disinfection measures and personal protective equipment to reduce chances of viral transmission and provide safe clinical settings for oneself, the staff and the patients. An online meeting of 8 experts in the field of aesthetic dermatology was convened, which particularly focussed on PPE in detail, risk categorization of aesthetic procedures, pre procedure recommendations, generalised and specialised SOP's for aesthetic procedures. These recommendations were aimed to bridge the gap between published guidelines and clinical practice and are by no means fully conclusive, but signify learnings over the past few months in an active clinical aesthetic practice.

231779,Burma: The Generals Strike Back,2021,"BACKGROUND: Congenital intrahepatic bile duct dilatation without fibrosis is called Caroli disease (CD), and is called Caroli syndrome (CS) when it has fibrotic and cirrhotic liver morphology. The development of intrahepatic carcinoma is described in both conditions, but the reported incidence varies extensively. Potential risk factors for the malignant transformation were not described. Furthermore, conservative or surgical treatment is performed depending on the extent of cystic malformation, hepatic dysfunction and structural hepatic changes, but little is known about which treatment should be offered to patients with CD or CS and cancer. AIM: To further investigate the malignant transformation in these conditions. METHODS: A systematic review of the current literature until January 2019 was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A search using Medline (PubMed) was performed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms ""caroli disease"", ""caroli syndrome"", ""tumor"", ""malignant"", and ""cholangiocarcinoma"". Only human studies published in English were used for this systematic review. The following parameters were extracted from each article: year of publication, type of study, number of patients, incidence of malignant tumor, duration of symptoms, age, sex, diagnostics, identification of tumor, surgical therapy, survival and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: Twelve retrospective studies reporting the courses of 561 patients (53% females) were included in this systematic review. With a mean age of 41.6 years old (range 23 to 56 years old), patients were younger than other populations undergoing liver surgery. Depending on the size of the study population the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varied from 2.7% to 37.5% with an overall incidence of 6.6%. There were only few detailed reports about preoperative diagnostic work-up, but a multimodal work-up including ultrasound of the liver, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used in most studies. Disease duration was variable with up to several years. Most patients had episodes of cholangitis, sepsis, fever or abdominal pain. Tumor detection was an incidental finding of the surgical specimen in most cases because it is currently often impossible to detect tumor manifestation during preoperative diagnostics. Liver resection or liver transplantation was performed depending on the extent of the biliary pathology and additional alterations of the liver structure or function. No postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was reported, but chemotherapy was administered in selected cases of tumor recurrence. Overall survival rates after one year were low at 36% and a high recurrence rate of up to 75% during the observation period. CONCLUSION: Only few retrospective studies reported a low tumor incidence. Despite the high rate of mortality and tumor recurrence, definite surgical treatment should be offered as soon as possible.","Fahrner, René; Dennler, Sandra Gc; Inderbitzin, Daniel",World J Gastroenterol,,308

However, the characteristics of repositive results are still not well understood, leading to a lack of effective monitoring strategies. METHODS: In the present study, a total of 59 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and the characteristics of the repositive samples were analyzed. RESULTS: The repositive rate in this cohort was 15.79%. The N gene was the main target gene that was positive in the repositive results as well as in the last positive results of all patients. The median duration from diagnosis to the last positive test was 20 days (IQR, 16-31 days), and the longest duration was 40 days. Repositivity was only observed in IgM single- or both IgM- and IgG-positive patients, instead of IgG single-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant proportion of repositives in the recovered COVID-19 patients, and increasing the required number of negatives for consecutive nucleic acid tests may reduce the incidence of repositives. The recommended monitoring strategy for repositivity is monitoring the N gene in IgM-positive patients. This can ensure high sensitivity while reducing the time and cost of nucleic acid detection.","Zhang, Xuzhao; Li, Min; Zhang, Bin; Chen, Tao; Lv, Dong; Xia, Pengfei; Sun, Zhuanyi; Shentu, Xiaoyan; Chen, Haiyan; Li, Libin; Qian, Wenbin",Clin Chim Acta,,308

237785,Moving academic conferences online: Understanding patterns of delegate engagement,2021,"This is an article about quarantine and the paradox of propinquity. There is a common assumption in sociology that people who interact and are in close physical contact develop social relationships. It is also believed that proximity and the socius of being with others allows for the coordination of activities and construction of society. During the COVID-19 lockdown, social distance measures made physical interactions near impossible. And the onset of these changes to everyday behaviors prove that society is not limited to propinquity. In order to better understand alternative forms of sociability, this article will introduce two concepts: banality and neighborship. The analysis of these ideas will confirm that interactions are preceded by social feelings, such as conviviality and togetherness.

METHODS: We use provisional vital statistics data for births occurring in the central region of New Jersey. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is employed to assess depressive symptoms. Our focal analysis uses linear regression models to test whether giving birth during the pandemic is associated with elevated depressive symptoms. All analyses are performed using time-matched (September 2019-April 2020; n = 18,531) and month-matched (January 2019-April 2019 and January 2020- April 2020; n = 18,346) samples. RESULTS: Women who gave birth in March and not in April reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who gave birth prior to the pandemic in our time-matched (b = 0.09) and month-matched (b = 0.09) samples. The magnitude of this association is approximately one-third the magnitude of the association between preterm birth and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay special attention to signs of postpartum depression and women's adaptive coping responses in the early stages of pandemics.","McFarland, Michael J; McFarland, Cheryl A S; Hill, Terrence D; D039,; Oria, Robyn",Matern. child health j,,308

Dental staff members including ancillary personnel, residents, and attendings were redeployed and functioned throughout the facility. Dental anesthesiology residents provided medical services in support of their colleagues in a step-down COVID-19-dedicated ICU, providing intubation, ventilator management, and critical and palliative care. (Step-down units provide an intermediate level of care between ICUs and the general medical-surgical wards.) Clear communication of an acute need, a well-articulated mission, creative use of personnel, and dedicated staff members were evident during this challenging time. Although not routinely called upon to provide support in the medical and surgical inpatient areas, dental staff members may provide additional health care personnel during times of need.","Badner, Victor; Saraghi, Mana",Public Health Rep,,308
240963,Corpus-based Open-Domain Event Type Induction,2021-09-07,"Risk management is a fundamental approach to improving critical infrastructure systems’ safety against disruptive events This approach focuses on designing robust critical infrastructure systems (CISs) that could resist disruptive events by minimizing the possible events’ probability and consequences using preventive and protective programs However, recent disasters like COVID-19 have shown that most CISs cannot stand against all potential disruptions Recently there is a transition from robust design to resilience design of CISs, increasing the focus on preparedness, response, and recovery Resilient CISs withstand most of the internal and external shocks, and if they fail, they can bounce back to the operational phase as soon as possible using minimum resources Moreover, in resilient CISs, early warning enables managers to get timely information about the proximity and development of distributions An understanding of the concept of resilience, its influential factors, and available evaluation and analyzing tools are required to have effective resilience management Moreover, it is important to highlight the current gaps Technological resilience is a new concept associated with some ambiguity around its definition, its terms, and its applications Hence, using the concept of resilience without understanding these variations may lead to ineffective pre- and post-disruption planning A well-established systematic literature review can provide a deep understanding regarding the concept of resilience, its limitation, and applications The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to study the current research around technological CISs’ resilience In the review, 192 primary studies published between 2003 and 2020 are reviewed Based on the results, the concept of resilience has gradually found its place among researchers since 2003, and the number of related studies has grown significantly It emerges from the review that a CIS can be considered as resilient if it has (i) the ability to imagine what to expect, (ii) the ability to protect and resist a disruption, (iii) the ability to absorb the adverse effects of disruption, (iv) the ability to adapt to new conditions and changes caused by disruption, and (v) the ability to recover the CIS’s normal performance level after a disruption It was shown that robustness is the most frequent resilience contributing factor among the reviewed primary studies Resilience analysis approaches can be classified into four main groups: empirical, simulation, index-based, and qualitative approaches Simulation approaches, as dominant models, mostly study real case studies, while empirical methods, specifically those that are deterministic, are built based on many assumptions that are difficult to justify in many cases","Mottahedi, Adel Sereshki Farhang Ataei Mohammad Nouri Qarahasanlou Ali Barabadi Abbas",Energies,,308

242028,Tidal heating of black holes and exotic compact objects on the brane,2021-03-23,": The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to exacerbate existing anxiety and substance use disorders (SUDs) and increase vulnerability among individuals previously free of these conditions. Numerous pandemic-related stressors-coronavirus infection fears, social distancing and isolation, activity restrictions, financial insecurity and unemployment, caregiving or childcare responsibilities-place a substantial burden both on the general population and on many health care providers. Anxiety symptoms such as worry, tension, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disruption are increasingly prevalent. For individuals in SUD treatment, anxiety can complicate efforts to achieve treatment goals. In this commentary, we outline the potential impact of anxiety on substance use problems during the COVID-19 crisis and describe key behavioral, pharmacological, and digital health treatment considerations. We highlight populations of special concern due to heightened vulnerability and challenges accessing services, strategies to support health care providers, and directions for future research.","Satre, Derek D; Iturralde, Esti; Ghadiali, Murtuza; Young-Wolff, Kelly C; Campbell, Cynthia I; Leibowitz, Amy S; Sterling, Stacy A",J Addict Med,,308
242128,Dynamic market risk of green stocks across regions: Where does the devil lie?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: A first protective dose of vaccine may allow delaying the second dose in a context of low supply. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) after twelve days of its administration in healthcare personnel (HCP) of a Health Department. METHODS: A case-control study was made. HCP with suspected COVID-19 and HCP close contacts of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27 and February 7, 2021. They were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2;those with positive PCR were considered cases and those with negative PCR were considered controls. The crude (VE) and adjusted (VEa) vaccine effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence interval were calculated using the formula VE = (1-Odds ratio) x 100. RESULTS: 268 HCP were included, of which 70 (26.1%) were considered cases and 198 (73.9%) controls. The frequency of vaccine exposure in cases was 55.7% vs. 69.7% in controls (p=0.035). The VEa of the first vaccine dose was 52.6% (95%CI: 1.1-77.3). The VEa in the subgroup of HCP studied for suspected disease was 74.6% (CI95%: 38.4-89.5). CONCLUSIONS: One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 offers early protection after twelve days of administration. These data could be considered to adapt strategies and consider postponing the second dose in situations of limited vaccine supply in order to achieve the maximum number of people covered with a first dose.","Gras-Valenti, P.; Chico-Sanchez, P.; Algado-Selles, N.; Jimenez-Sepulveda, N.

242381,Two new compartmental epidemiological models and their equilibria,2021-09-03,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible negative action of lockdown, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, in the follow-up of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. METHODS: We compared the number of JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 to the same months of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 10 JIA reactivations have been documented on 58 patients (17%) visited in the period March-July 2018; 10 reactivations on 61 patients (16%) in the period March-July 2019; and 19 reactivations on 39 patients (49%) in the period March-July 2020, with a statistically significant increase (p <0.001). The other 19 patients who should have been visited during the same period, contacted by phone, indicated remission. Therefore, we hypothesize that the effective number of reactivations in the period March-July 2020 would be 19/58 patients (33%) which remains significantly greater than in the previous 2 years (p < 0.05). Among the 19 JIA patients reactivated in 2020, 3 spontaneously stopped the basic treatment due to parents' choice for fear of serious complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 4 had poor compliance with underlying treatment. In addition, 14/19 reactivated JIA patients did not perform the scheduled check according to the follow-up. In fact, the mean time interval between two follow-up visits was significantly greater in 2020 (157 ± 53 days, p < 0.0001) vs 2018 (108 ± 68 days) and 2019 (107 ± 40 days). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant increase in JIA reactivations in the period March-July 2020 compared to the same interval of 2018 and 2019. This increase may have been caused by poor compliance with background treatment, as documented in 7/19 JIA patients reactivated, and by a greater interval in follow-up checks. Therefore, it is necessary, in occasion of a new pandemic and lockdown, to implement greater controls using more appropriate telemedicine tools. Key Points â¢ COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a negative effect on the follow-up of JIA patients. â¢ A significant increase in JIA reactivations was found during the lockdown. â¢ Poor therapeutic compliance and follow-up checks have been proven during the lockdown. â¢ It is necessary to improve telemedicine tools and scientific information during a pandemic and lockdown.","Conti, Giovanni; Galletta, Francesca; Carucci, Nicolina Stefania; La Mazza, Antonella; Mollica, Salvatore Antonio; Alibrandi, Angela; Visalli, Carmela",Clin. rheumatol,,308
242550,Simulating near-field enhancement in transmission of airborne viruses with a quadrature-based model,2021-04-02,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the ability of four models of behaviour, namely, Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM), and Social Cognitive Theory and the Reasoned Action Approach (SCT and RAA) to understand adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs) advised by national governments for suppression of SARS-CoV2. DESIGN: A series of six cross-sectional telephone surveys of a random representative sample of adults living in Scotland. METHODS: Self-reported adherence to three TRBs (physical distancing, wearing a face covering and handwashing), PMT, CS-SRM, and SCT/RAA constructs, and sociodemographic variables were measured each week for 6 weeks (n = ~500 p/w; third June-15th July) via a 15 min telephone survey. RESULTS: Adherence was high ('Always' or 'Most times') throughout for physical distancing and handwashing, and, when mandated, for wearing a face covering. Older people were more adherent to all TRBs. Constructs from all three models predicted all three TRBs. Intention and self-efficacy (SCT/RAA) were the only beliefs to predict to all three TRBs each week and for all groups equally; intention was the strongest predictor. The predictive utility of PMT and CS-SRM varied by TRB and by group. Of note was the observation that several illness beliefs were associated with adherence only for those who believed they had not had COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The CHARIS project has identified beliefs about specific behaviours, the illness and the risks associated with lower adherence rates that might be addressed in national interventions. It confirms previous findings that some groups show lower levels of adherence and might be specially targeted.","Dixon, Diane; Den Daas, Chantal; Hubbard, Gill; Johnston, Marie",Br. j. health psychol,,308

Here we investigate how these mAbs target the B.1.351 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. In particular, we show that two superpotent mAbs, BD-812 and BD-836, have non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike. Both block the interaction between RBD and the ACE2 receptor; and importantly, both remain fully efficacious towards the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants.

246795,News in Brief,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and home isolation has impacted quality of life, but the perceived impact on anxiety and sleep remains equivocal. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders on self-report anxiety and sleep quality, with a focus on sex differences. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with increased anxiety and decreased sleep quality, with stronger associations in women. METHODS: One hundred three participants (61 female, 38 ± 1 years) reported perceived changes in anxiety and sleep quality due to stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic and were administered the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Chi-square and T test analyses were utilized to assess sex differences in reported anxiety and sleep. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the associations between reported impact of COVID-19 and anxiety/sleep parameters. RESULTS: Women (80.3%) reported higher prevalence of increased general anxiety due to COVID-19 when compared to men (50%; p = 0.001) and elevated STAI state anxiety compared to men (43 ± 1 vs. 38 ± 1 a.u., p = 0.007). Despite these differences in anxiety, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on PSQI was not different between sexes. However, when stratified by perceived changes in anxiety due to COVID-19, participants with higher anxiety responses to COVID-19 had higher ISI compared to those with no perceived changes in anxiety (9 ± 1 vs. 5 ± 1 a.u., p = 0.003). Additionally, participants who reported reduced sleep quality due to COVID-19 reported higher state anxiety (45 ± 1 a.u.) compared to those that perceived no change (36 ± 2 a.u., p = 0.002) or increased (36 ± 2 a.u., p < 0.001) sleep quality.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to our intermediate care unit in Pisa between March 5 and March 30, 2020, with follow-up until hospital discharge or death. Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P<0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS: The main findings of this study are that: 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001); and 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (ß=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic ultrasound may be a valid tool to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure. Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","Corradi, Francesco; Isirdi, Alessandro; Malacarne, Paolo; Santori, Gregorio; Barbieri, Greta; Romei, Chiara; Bove, Tiziana; Vetrugno, Luigi; Falcone, Marco; Bertini, Pietro; Guarracino, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Forfori, Francesco",Minerva Anestesiol,,308

Near-infrared spectra from CHARIS and thermal infrared photometry from NIRC2 constrain newly-discovered companion spectral types, temperatures, and gravities. Relative astrometry of companions from SCExAO/CHARIS and NIRC2 and absolute astrometry of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia together yield direct dynamical mass constraints. Even in its infancy, our survey has already yielded multiple discoveries, including at least one likely jovian planet.

To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Methods Participants were Australians aged 18 + years that were employed in paid work prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey from 27th March to 12th June 2020 as part of a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Outcome measures include Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score < = 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results The cohort consisted of 2,603 respondents, including groups who had lost their job (N = 541), were not working but remained employed (N = 613), were working less (N = 660), and whose work was unaffected (N = 789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR = 1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR = 2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR = 1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR = 1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources. Responses that increase financial security and enhance social connections may alleviate the health impacts of work loss.

256839,Long Live the Revolution?,2020,"The nature of armed conflict throughout the world is intensely dynamic. Consequently, the protection of non-combatants and the provision of humanitarian services must continually adapt to this changing conflict environment. Complex political affiliations, the systematic use of explosive weapons and sexual violence, and the use of new communication technology, including social media, have created new challenges for humanitarian actors in negotiating access to affected populations and security for their own personnel. The nature of combatants has also evolved as armed, non-state actors might have varying motivations, use different forms of violence, and engage in a variety of criminal activities to generate requisite funds. New health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and new capabilities, such as modern trauma care, have also created new challenges and opportunities for humanitarian health provision. In response, humanitarian policies and practices must develop negotiation and safety capabilities, informed by political and security realities on the ground, and guidance from affected communities. More fundamentally, humanitarian policies will need to confront a changing geopolitical environment, in which traditional humanitarian norms and protections might encounter wavering support in the years to come.","Wise, Paul H; Shiel, Annie; Southard, Nicole; Bendavid, Eran; Welsh, Jennifer; Stedman, Stephen; Fazal, Tanisha; Felbab-Brown, Vanda; Polatty, David; Waldman, Ronald J; Spiegel, Paul B; Blanchet, Karl; Dayoub, Rita; Zakayo, Aliyu; Barry, Michele; Martinez Garcia, Daniel; Pagano, Heather; Black, Robert; Gaffey, Michelle F; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Lancet,,308

This paper investigates the associations between both COVID-19 incidence and mortality and air pollutant concentration levels, and screens the potential effect of the type of agri-food industry and the overall land use and cover (LULC) at area level. We used a main model with demographic, socioeconomic and comorbidity covariates highlighted in previous research as important predictors. This allowed us to take a glimpse of the independent effect of the explanatory variables when controlled for the main model covariates. Our findings are aligned with previous research showing that the baseline features of the regions in terms of general health status, pollutant concentration levels (here NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), type of agri-food industry, and type of land use and land cover have modulated the impact of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study is among the first to explore the associations between COVID-19 and the type of agri-food industry and LULC data using a population-based approach. The results of this paper might serve as the basis to develop new research hypotheses using a more comprehensive approach, highlighting the inequalities of regions in terms of risk factors and their response to COVID-19, as well as fostering public policies towards more resilient and safer environments.","Zaldo-Aubanell, Q.; Campillo, I.

We extracted 167 K of Cov19doms that have been registered between the end of December 2019 and the end of September 2020. We attempt to answer the following research questions through our measurement study: RQ1: Is the number of Cov19doms registrations correlated with the COVID-19 outbreaks?, RQ2: For what purpose do people register Cov19doms? Our chief findings are as follows: (1) Similar to the global COVID-19 pandemic observed around April 2020, the number of Cov19doms registrations also experienced the drastic growth, which, interestingly, pre-ceded the COVID-19 pandemic by about a month, (2) 70% of active Cov19doms websites with visible content provided useful information such as health, tools, or product sales related to COVID-19, and (3) non-negligible number of registered Cov19doms was used for malicious purposes. These findings imply that it has become more challenging to distinguish domain names registered for legitimate purposes from others and that it is crucial to pay close attention to how Cov19doms will be used/misused in the future. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Kawaoka, R.; Chiba, D.; Watanabe, T.; Akiyama, M.; Mori, T.","22nd International Conference on Passive and Active Measurement, PAM 2021",,308

""Should I Stay or Should I Go Now?""",2021,"INTRODUCTION: In April 2020, the military medical planning needs to be recalibrated to support the COVID-19 crisis during a large-scale combat operation carried out by the French army in Sahel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 2019, proper positioning of Forward Surgical Teams (FSTs) has been imperative in peer-to-near-peer conflict and led to the development of a far-forward surgical asset: The Golden Hour Offset Surgical Team (GHOST). Dedicated to damage control surgery close to combat, GHOST made the FST aero-mobile again, with a light logistical footprint and a fast setting. On 19 and 25 March 2020, Niger and Mali confirmed their first COVID-19 cases, respectively. The pandemic was ongoing in Sahel, where 5,100 French soldiers were deployed in the Barkhane Operation. RESULTS: For the first time, the FST had to provide, continuously, both COVID critical care and surgical support to the ongoing operation in Liptako. Its deployment on a Main Operating Base had to be rethought on Niamey, to face the COVID crisis and support ongoing operations. This far-forward surgical asset, embedded with a doctrinal Role-1, sat up a 4-bed COVID intensive care unit while maintaining a casualty surgical care capacity. A COVID training package has been developed to prepare the FST for this innovative employment. This far-forward surgical asset was designed to support a COVID-19 intensive care unit before evacuation, preserving forward surgical capability for battalion combat teams. CONCLUSION: Far-forward surgical assets like GHOST have demonstrated their mobility and effectiveness in a casualty care system and could be adapted as critical care facilities to respond to the COVID crisis in wartime.","de Lesquen, Henri; Bergez, Marie; Vuong, Antoine; Boufime-Jonqheere, Alexandre; l039, de; Escalopier, Nicolas",Mil. med,,308

The pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is thought to relate to a thromboinflammatory state within the pulmonary vasculature, triggered by the infection, but other risk factors such as reduced mobility, prolonged immobilisation and dehydration are likely to contribute. Several societies have released comprehensive guidelines emphasising the importance of risk stratification in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. They advocate the use of clinically validated risk scores in conjunction with biochemical and imaging results. Patients with mild disease can now be managed in the outpatient setting and with newly developed therapies, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, becoming available in more centres, treatment options for those with more severe disease are also expanding. This article presents four theoretical but realistic cases, each diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, but differing in levels of severity. These demonstrate how the guidelines can be applied in a clinical setting, with particular focus on risk stratification and management.","Stevenson, Alexander; Davis, Sarah; Murch, Nick",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,308

This review summarizes findings up to date on the relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19. Recent Findings: Preexisting CVD is a common condition among patients with COVID-19 and is associated with increased disease severity and mortality. Conversely, COVID-19 has various clinical manifestations on cardiovascular system, including thrombotic events and cardiac dysfunction. The pandemic has impacted healthcare utilization among patients with CVD, which may have led to potential delay in access to the healthcare system during acute events not directly COVID-19-related. Summary: While COVID-19 vaccine is being developed and distributed, controlling CVD risk factors and adherence to recommendations of existing immunization (e.g., influenza vaccine) are key in protecting the health of individuals with CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiological and pathophysiological basis for the interaction between CVD and COVID-19.","Ishigami, Junichi; Kou, Minghao; Ding, Ning; Matsushita, Kunihiro",Curr Epidemiol Rep,,308

Most of the anesthesia-related adverse events are preventable by the identification and correction of anesthesia machine errors and equipment preparation in the pre-induction period. This paper aimed to keep a high-quality environment for workers and patients in the surgical operating theater. Materials and Methods: Data were collected after ethical clearance obtained from the institutional ethical review board, and daily observations of pre-induction anesthesia preparation were done in all surgical rooms at the start of each day and continuously before the next cases with a prepared anesthesia machine checklist. Descriptive statistical analysis and cross-tabulation of each checklist with the type of anesthesia and urgency of surgery were done to determine the degree of staff compliance with daily preparations using SPSS version 22, and finally, results were presented by texts and graphs. Results: In this study, a total of 61 checking events with 19 items were involved during the study period. There were 893 (77.1%) fully met checking events, 205 (17.7%) not-met checking events(sodalime) 61 (5.3%) not available in anesthesia machine check and equipment preparation before use.

265593,A third of UK population might not be protected from third wave,2021,"Background: The development of barotrauma has been suggested to complicate the management of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aims to identify potential risk factors associated with the development of barotrauma related complications in COVID-19 patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in a single COVID-19 designated center in Kuwait. Three hundred and forty-three confirmed COVID-19 patients transferred and/or admitted to our institution between February 26, 2020 and June 20, 2020 were included in the study. All patients were admitted into the ICU with the majority being mechanically ventilated (81.3%). Results: Fifty-four (15.4%) patients developed barotrauma, of which 49 (90.7%) presented with pneumothorax, and 14.8% and 3.7% due to pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium respectively. Of those that developed barotrauma, 52 (96.3%) patients were in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Biochemically, the white blood cells (pâ¯=â¯0.001), neutrophil percentage (pâ¯=â¯0.012), lymphocyte percentage (pâ¯=â¯0.014), neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p=<0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (pâ¯=â¯0.002) were found to be significantly different in patients that developed barotrauma. Intubation due to low level of consciousness (pâ¯=â¯0.007), a high admission COVID-GRAM score (pâ¯=â¯0.042), and a positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) higher than the control group (pâ¯=â¯0.016) were identified as potential risk factors for the development of barotrauma. Conclusion: Patients infected with COVID-19 have a significant risk of developing barotrauma when receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. This poses a substantial impact on the hospital course of the patients and clinical outcome, correlating to a higher mortality rate in this cohort of patients.","Elsaaran, Hussein; AlQinai, Shamlan; AlTarrah, Dana; Abdulrasoul, Mahdi; Al-Youha, Sarah; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Jamal, Mohammad H; Al-Sabah, Salman",,,308

265942,A Note from the Editor,2021,"Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine antibody response under ""real-world"" conditions. This longitudinal study investigated the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 846 specimens from 350 subjects: comparing BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals (19 previously diagnosed with COVID-19 [RecoVax]; 49 never been diagnosed [NaiveVax]) to 122 hospitalized unvaccinated (HospNoVax) and 160 outpatient unvaccinated (OutPtNoVax) COVID-19 patients. NaiveVax experienced a delay in generating SARS-CoV-2 total antibody levels (TAb) and neutralizing antibodies (SNAb) after the 1st vaccine dose (D1), but a rapid increase in antibody levels was observed after the 2nd dose (D2). However, these never reached the robust levels observed in RecoVax. In fact, NaiveVax TAb and SNAb levels decreased 4-weeks post-D2 (p=0.003;p<0.001). For the most part, RecoVax TAb persisted throughout this study, after reaching maximal levels 2-weeks post-D2; but SNAb decreased significantly [~]6-months post-D1 (p=0.002). Although NaiveVax avidity lagged behind that of RecoVax for most of the follow-up periods, NaiveVax did reach similar avidity by [~]6-months post-D1. These data suggest that one vaccine dose elicits maximal antibody response in RecoVax and may be sufficient. Also, despite decreasing levels in TAb and SNAb overtime, long-term avidity maybe a measure worth evaluating and possibly correlating to vaccine efficacy.","Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Yee, Jim; Sukhu, Ashley; Qiu, Yuqing; Rand, Sophie; Barron, Paul; Hao, Ying; Yang, He S; Meng, Qing H; Apple, Fred S; Shi, Yuanyuan; Chadburn, Amy; Golden, Encouse; Formenti, Silvia C; Cushing, Melissa; Zhao, Zhen",,,308

266400,Dear Reader,2021,"Now a days COVID 19 is rapidly spreading everywhere. It is one of the deadliest viruses within the global. The pandemic caused by the corona virus is huge and the world goes under more struggle and also many of the people were died due to this. So that the doctor has to diagnosis the virus as quick as possible to recover the patient from the virus. Currently for diagnosing the corona virus ANN algorithm is used. This makes more time to diagnosis the virus from the patient. The ANN algorithm includes the process, first we have to take the CT image of chest region of the patient. Next, we have to analysis the CT image is there any new type of virus is present are not with the help of healthy patient CT image. This takes more time to analysis the corona virus. For reducing that time consumption, we are going for CNN algorithm (Convolution Neural Network). This reduces the time of diagnosing the virus from the patient. This algorithm is trained to find the corona virus from the CT image of the patient.","Shanmugavadivel, G.; Arun, M.; Dinakaran, M.; Prasad, M.

266683,When in Doubt: Neural Non-Parametric Uncertainty Quantification for Epidemic Forecasting,2021-06-07,"OBJECTIVE: Information to women with epilepsy on pregnancy-related antiseizure medication (ASM) issues and reliable tools for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) are important aspects of epilepsy care. We aimed to develop and test an online tool for patient education on pregnancy-related issues and communication with epilepsy nurses during pregnancy for women with epilepsy. METHODS: An existing national platform for online communication (1177.se) was used, and an online tool was developed by two epilepsy nurses, two neurologists, and an IT technician. The tool was launched as a complement to standard care, and patients deciding to use it were invited to participate in a survey of user experiences and knowledge questions. RESULTS: The online tool consists of two modules: one for patient education and one for TDM during pregnancy. The latter module allows scheduling of automatic reminders of blood tests that are sent to patients at set intervals. The epilepsy nurse can communicate results and suggested dose changes in the tool. A total of 48 women answered the survey: 28 had been invited to use the information module and 20 to use the TDM module. Patient experiences were generally good, and most users of the TDM module would prefer an online means of communication in future pregnancies. For epilepsy nurses, the tool provided good overview of patients currently pregnant and administrative advantages compared with traditional means of communication. SIGNIFICANCE: Online patient education and communication about TDM during pregnancy are feasible and can be a valuable part of future digitalization efforts in epilepsy care.","Lisovska, Kristina; Gustafsson, Eva; Klecki, Judith; Edelvik Tranberg, Anna; Zelano, Johan",Epilepsia Open,,308

268058,„Vor uns liegt ein spannendes Themenfeld.“,2020,"Objectives. To examine shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection point prevalence during universal testing at homeless shelters in the United States.Methods. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to clients and staff at homeless shelters, irrespective of symptoms. Site assessments were conducted from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to collect information on shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices. We assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and shelter characteristics, including 20 infection prevention practices by using crude risk ratios (RRs) and exact unconditional 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results. Site assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing results were reported for 63 homeless shelters in 7 US urban areas. Median infection prevalence was 2.9% (range = 0%-71.4%). Shelters implementing head-to-toe sleeping and excluding symptomatic staff from working were less likely to have high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3, 0.8; and RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.6; respectively); shelters with medical services available were less likely to have very high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2, 1.0).Conclusions. Sleeping arrangements and staffing policies are modifiable factors that might be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters. Shelters should follow recommended practices to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Self, Julie L; Montgomery, Martha P; Toews, Karrie-Ann; Samuels, Elizabeth A; Imbert, Elizabeth; McMichael, Temet M; Marx, Grace E; Lohff, Cortland; Andrews, Tom; Ghinai, Isaac; Mosites, Emily",Am J Public Health,,308
268127,"Every T. rex, COVID asthma drug and variant control",2021,"AIMS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The current paper described how carnosine, a naturally occurring supplement, can be an effective drug candidate for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the basis of molecular docking and modeling to host ACE2 cocrystallized with nCoV spike protein. METHODS: First, the starting point was ACE2 inhibitors and their structure-activity relationship (SAR). Next, chemical similarity (or diversity) and PubMed searches made it possible to repurpose and assess approved or experimental drugs for COVID-19. Parallel, at all stages, the authors performed bioactivity scoring to assess potential repurposed inhibitors at ACE2. Finally, investigators performed molecular docking and modeling of the identified drug candidate to host ACE2 with nCoV spike protein. RESULTS: Carnosine emerged as the best-known drug candidate to match ACE2 inhibitor structure. Preliminary docking was more optimal to ACE2 than the known typical angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitor (enalapril) and quite comparable to known or presumed ACE2 inhibitors. Viral spike protein elements binding to ACE2 were retained in the best carnosine pose in SwissDock at 1.75 Angstroms. Out of the three main areas of attachment expected to the protein-protein structure, carnosine bound with higher affinity to two compared to the known ACE2 active site. LibDock score was 92.40 for site 3, 90.88 for site 1, and inside the active site 85.49. CONCLUSION: Carnosine has promising inhibitory interactions with host ACE2 and nCoV spike protein and hence could offer a potential mitigating effect against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Saadah, Loai M; Deiab, Ghina039; Abu, a I; Al-Balas, Qosay; Basheti, Iman A",Molecules (Basel),,308

This study aimed to investigate if dentists are anxious about returning to their daily activities, and what the perception of the risk is for dentists and orthodontists regarding orthodontic procedures. An online questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), was sent to Italian dentists during the final days of the lockdown with items about anxiety, fear, distress, perceived risk for operators, and concerns about orthodontic patients caused by working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were analyzed with a chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The level of significance was set as p < 0.05. A total of 349 dentists completed the survey, including 183 orthodontists. Returning to their daily work activity was a source of anxiety for 192 participants and this was associated with the level of distress (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; p < 0.001). Most of the orthodontists (67.6%) thought that they would increase the number of working hours during the week (OR = 1.8; p = 0.007). Italian dentists were mostly scared to return to their daily activities because they considered their jobs a high risk to them and their families. Dentists with an exclusive/prevailing orthodontic activity were forced to increase their working day during the week.","Martina, Stefano; Amato, Alessandra; Rongo, Roberto; Caggiano, Mario; Amato, Massimo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,308
268585,Removal of sulfadiazine in a modified ultrafiltration membrane (PVDF-PVP-TiO2-FeCl3) filtration-photocatalysis system: parameters optimizing and interferences of drinking water,2020,"Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited against the receptor-binding site (RBS) of the spike protein of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 are generally less effective against recent variants of concern. RBS residues E484, K417 and N501 are mutated in variants first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). We analyzed their effects on ACE2 binding and K417N and E484K mutations on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternate binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.","Yuan, Meng; Huang, Deli; Lee, Chang-Chun D; Wu, Nicholas C; Jackson, Abigail M; Zhu, Xueyong; Liu, Hejun; Peng, Linghang; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Burton, Dennis R; Reincke, S Momsen; Prüss, Harald; Kreye, Jakob; Nemazee, David; Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Ian A",Science (Wash.),,308
269131,Crowd Sensing and Living Lab Outdoor Experimentation Made Easy,2021-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Detection of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and subtype diversity (SD) are public health strategies to assess current HIV-1 regimen and ensure effective therapeutic outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-1 patients. Globally, limited data exist on TDR and SD among blood donors. In this study, drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and SD amongst HIV-1 sero-positive blood donors in Accra, Ghana were characterized. METHODS: Purposive sampling method was used to collect 81 HIV sero-positive blood samples from the Southern Area Blood Center and confirmed by INNO-LIA as HIV-1 and/or HIV-2. Viral RNA was only extracted from plasma samples confirmed as HIV-1 positive. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the RNA as a template and subsequently amplified by nested PCR with specific primers. The expected products were verified, purified and sequenced. Neighbour-joining tree with the Kimura's 2-parameter distances was generated with the RT sequences using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 6.0 (MEGA 6.0). RESULTS: Out of the 81 plasma samples, 60 (74%) were confirmed as HIV-1 sero-positive by INNO-LIA HIVI/II Score kit with no HIV-2 and dual HIV-1/2 infections. The remaining samples, 21 (26%) were confirmed as HIV sero-negative. Of the 60 confirmed positive samples, (32) 53% and (28) 47% were successfully amplified in the RT and PR genes respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of amplified samples revealed the presence of major drug resistance mutations in two (2) samples; E138A in one sample and another with K65R. HIV-1 Subtypes including subtypes A, B, CRF02_AG and CRF09_cpx were found. CONCLUSION: This study found major drug resistance mutations, E138A and K65R in the RT gene that confer high level resistance to most NNRTIs and NRTI respectively. CRF02_AG was most predominant, the recorded percentage of subtype B and the evolutionary relationship inferred by phylogenetic analysis may suggest possible subtype importation. However, a more prospective and detailed analysis is needed to establish this phenomenon. The data obtained would inform the selection of drugs for ART initiation to maximize therapeutic options in drug-naïve HIV-1 patients in Ghana.","Obeng, Billal Musah; Bonney, Evelyn Yayra; Asamoah-Akuoko, Lucy; Nii-Trebi, Nicholas Israel; Mawuli, Gifty; Abana, Christopher Zaab-Yen; Sagoe, Kwamena William Coleman",Virol J,,308

269933,Impact of a large sub-tropical reservoir on the cycling of nutrients in a river,2020,"Since the first reports of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, over 33 million people have been infected worldwide and approximately 1 million people worldwide have died from the disease caused by this virus, COVID-19. In the US alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and over 200,000 deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5\% of patients require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists of a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with camera vision control via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located outside the room. Engineering system tests demonstrated that the open-loop mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5\,mm, and that the average positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was 5.94\,mm. Successful usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were carried out and are reported. In addition to enabling a significant reduction in PPE consumption, the prototype system has been shown in a preliminary evaluation to significantly reduce the total time required for a respiratory therapist to perform typical setting adjustments on a commercial ventilator, including donning and doffing PPE, from 271 seconds to 109 seconds.","Vagvolgyi, Balazs P.; Khrenov, Mikhail; Cope, Jonathan; Deguet, Anton; Kazanzides, Peter; Manzoor, Sajid; Taylor, Russell H.; Krieger, Axel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05247v1.pdf,308

The aim was to explore whether the presence of common comorbidities increases COVID-19 patients' risk. A literature search was performed using the electronic platforms (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases) to obtain relevant research studies published up to March 1, 2020. Relevant data of research endpoints in each study were extracted and merged. All data analysis was performed using Stata12.0 software. A total of 1558 patients with COVID-19 in 6 studies were enrolled in our meta-analysis eventually. Hypertension (OR: 2.29, P<0.001), diabetes (OR: 2.47, P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR: 5.97, P<0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.93, P<0.001), and cerebrovascular disease (OR:3.89, P=0.002)were independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis revealed no correlation between increased risk of COVID-19 and liver disease, malignancy, or renal disease. Hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of these risk factors can be a resource for clinicians in the early appropriate medical management of patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Bolin; Li, Ruobao; Lu, Zhong; Huang, Yan",Aging (Albany NY),,308

During this pandemic situation, reliable operations of these robots are necessary that depend upon the stability of flexible manipulators. In this article, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Pole Placement, and Proportional-Integral-Derivatives (PID) control methods have been used to investigate the robust control method for controlling the position of manipulator with flexible link in medical robots. To carry out this research, an effective variant of the flexible Link robotic manipulator has been used as a framework to analyze the robust control method. The Matlab®/Simulink result shows that the LQR control method provides better control response compared to PID and pole placement method and thus provides reliable operation to Medical Robots.","Jayaswal, Kuldeep; Palwalia, D K; Kumar, Subodh",Microsyst Technol,,308

How ethnicity affects Indigenous peoples in Mexico is unclear. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the mortality associated with ethnicity, particularly of Indigenous peoples, in a large sample of patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We used open access data from the Mexican Ministry of Health, which includes data of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country. We used descriptive statistics to compare differences among different groups of patients. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: From February 28 to August 3, 2020, a total of 416546 adult patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these, 4178 were Indigenous peoples. Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5% vs 11.1%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7% vs 1.7%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). DISCUSSION: In this large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.","Ibarra-Nava, Ismael; Flores-Rodriguez, Kathia G; Ruiz-Herrera, Violeta; Ochoa-Bayona, Hilda C; Salinas-Zertuche, Alfonso; Padilla-Orozco, Magaly; Salazar-Montalvo, Raul G",PLoS One,,308

This study aimed to investigate nurses' perceptions and experiences of COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Design: This thematic analysis study was conducted in March 2020. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 nurses in Qazvin, Arak, Shiraz and Kashan cities of Iran. Results: It was found out that all the participants had faced a mysterious world created by the virus. No one had clear understanding of the new virus and knew how to tackle with such a virus. In this case, the main experiences were related to defected preparedness, the worst perceived risk, family protection, social stigma and sacrificial commitment. Urgent preparedness of facilities in such outbreaks is inevitable. Accordingly, psycho-social support of nurses and their families and strengthening their sacrificial commitments are proposed in these conditions.","Kalateh Sadati, Ahmad; Zarei, Leila; Shahabi, Saeed; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Taheri, Vajihe; Jiriaei, Razieh; Ebrahimzade, Najme; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",,,308
274454,Meet Your Editorial Team,2021,"Innate immune sensing of viral molecular patterns is essential for development of antiviral responses. Like many viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved strategies to circumvent innate immune detection, including low cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) levels in the genome, glycosylation to shield essential elements including the receptor-binding domain, RNA shielding and generation of viral proteins that actively impede anti-viral interferon responses. Together these strategies allow widespread infection and increased viral load. Despite the efforts of immune subversion, SARS-CoV-2 infection activates innate immune pathways inducing a robust type I/III interferon response, production of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils and myeloid cells. This may induce hyperinflammation or, alternatively, effectively recruit adaptive immune responses that help clear the infection and prevent reinfection. The dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system due to down-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, together with the activation of type I/III interferon response, and inflammasome response converge to promote free radical production and oxidative stress. This exacerbates tissue damage in the respiratory system, but also leads to widespread activation of coagulation pathways leading to thrombosis. Here, we review the current knowledge of the role of the innate immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection, much of which is based on the knowledge from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. Understanding how the virus subverts the initial immune response and how an aberrant innate immune response contributes to the respiratory and vascular damage in COVID-19 may help to explain factors that contribute to the variety of clinical manifestations and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Amor, S; Fernández Blanco, L; Baker, D",Clin Exp Immunol,,308

This study aims to estimate the relative contributions to fatality disparities in terms of differences in SARS-CoV-2 infections, diagnoses, and disease severity. METHODS: We constructed COVID-19 outcome continua (similar to the HIV care continuum) for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults in New York State. For each stage in the COVID-19 outcome continua (population, infection experience, diagnosis, hospitalization, fatality), we synthesized the most recent publicly available data. We described each continuum using overall percentages, fatality rates, and relative changes between stages, with comparisons between race and ethnicity using risk ratios. RESULTS: Estimated per-population COVID-19 fatality rates were 0.03%, 0.18%, and 0.12% for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults, respectively. The 3.48-fold disparity for Hispanic, relative to white, communities was explained by differences in infection experience, whereas the 5.38-fold disparity for non-Hispanic Black, relative to white, communities was primarily driven by differences in both infection experience and in the need for hospitalization, given infection.

278071,Clinical characteristics of acute respiratory syndrome with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children in South China,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has created challenges to neurosurgical patient care. Despite editorials evaluating neurosurgery responses to 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), data reporting effects of COVID-19 on neurosurgical case volume, census, and resident illness are lacking. The aim of this study was to present a real-world analysis of neurosurgical volumes, resident deployment, and unique challenges encountered during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak peak in New York City. METHODS: Daily census and case volume data were prospectively collected throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak in spring 2020. Neurosurgical census was compared against COVID-19 system-wide data. Neurosurgical cases during the crisis were analyzed and compared with 7-week periods from 2019 and early 2020. Resident deployment and illness were reviewed. RESULTS: From March 16, 2020, to May 5, 2020, residents participated in 72 operations and 69 endovascular procedures compared with 448 operations and 253 endovascular procedures from January 2020 to February 2020 and 530 operations and 340 endovascular procedures from March 2019 to May 2019. There was a 59% reduction in neurosurgical census during the outbreak (median 24 patients, 2.75 average total cases daily). COVID-19 neurosurgical admissions peaked in concert with the system-wide pandemic. Three residents demonstrated COVID-19 symptoms (no hospitalizations occurred) for a total 24 workdays lost (median 7 workdays). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide real-world guidance on neurosurgical infrastructure needs during a COVID-19 outbreak. While redeployment to support the COVID-19 response was required, a significant need remained to continue to provide critical neurosurgical service.","Rothrock, Robert J; Maragkos, Georgios A; Schupper, Alexander J; McNeill, Ian T; Oermann, Eric K; Yaeger, Kurt A; Gilligan, Jeffrey; Bederson, Joshua B; Mocco, J D",World Neurosurg,,308

In Italy, these restrictions have dramatically changed the way people work and spend their leisure time, also with repercussions on diet and physical activity. An anonymous survey was disseminated via websites and social media to a convenience sample of the Italian population during and immediately after the first lockdown (10 March-18 May 2020). Data collected on 1826 individuals show that lockdown might have worsened the quality of sleep of almost half of the participants in this cross-sectional study. This worsening was associated with a deterioration in crucial determinants of health, such as physical activity and diet (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.18-2.40 and OR 4.19; 95% CI 2.51-6.96, respectively), with symptoms of psychological distress, such as tension (OR 3.88; 95% CI 2.74-5.52) and loneliness (OR 3.27; 95% CI 2.23-4.79), and with the presence of financial problems (some OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.27-2.72; many OR 7.27; 95% CI 3.59-14.73).

The objective of this study was to assess short-term adverse events (AEs) of HCQ in HCWs. Methods: This cross-sectional study among consenting HCWs taking prophylaxis and working in hospitals with COVID-19 patients used online forms to collect details of HCWs, comorbidities, prophylactic drugs used and AEs after the first dose of HCQ. Verification of dose and AEs was done by personal contact. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the effect of age, gender and dose of HCQ on AE. Results: Of the 1303 HCWs included, 98.4 per cent (n=1282) took HCQ and 66 per cent (n=861) took 800 mg as first day's dose. Among the 19.9 per cent (n=259) reporting AEs, 1.5 per cent (n=20) took treatment for AE, none were hospitalized and three discontinued HCQ. Gastrointestinal AEs were the most common (172, 13.2%), with less in older [odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.89], with more in females (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.78-3.38) and in those taking a total dose of 800 mg on day one compared to a lower dose. Hypoglycaemia (1.1%, n=14), cardiovascular events (0.7%, n=9) and other AEs were minimal. Interpretation & conclusions: HCQ prophylaxis first dose was well tolerated among HCWs as evidenced by a low discontinuation. For adverse effects, a small number required treatment, and none required hospitalization.

285424,Therapeutic delivery: industry update covering June 2020,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization. DESIGN: A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.","Cho, Hyunyi; Li, Wenbo; Cannon, Julie; Lopez, Rachel; Song, Chi Chuck",Ethn Health,,308

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: As part of an RCT, CP was collected per FDA guidelines from individuals recovered from COVID-19 infection. CP donors had to have &#8805;145 optical density (OD) units (ideal target &#8805;300) using a semiquantitative, immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 (typical range 0-500 OD units). A random subset of samples [14 control plasma, 12 CP ""medium-anti-NP"" (145-299 OD units), and 13 CP ""high"" anti-NP (&#8805;300 OD units)] were tested for neutralizing antibodies using an established viral luciferase antibody inhibition assay to detect the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus that encoded spike protein (SARS2-Strunc ) on a human immunodeficiency virus 1 vector (NL43dEnvNanoLuc), using ACE2-expressing 293 T cells. The titer needed to neutralize 50% of viral activity (NT50) was calculated. RESULTS: The uptake of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus by 293TACE2 cells was inhibited by pretreatment with CP compared to control CP (p < .001) with control plasma having a median (IQR) 50% neutralization titer (NT50) of 1:28 (1:16,1:36) compared to 1:334 (1:130,1:1295) and 1:324 (1:244,1:578), for medium anti-NP and high anti-NP CP units, respectively. The neutralizing activity of CP met minimum FDA criteria with neutralizing antibody titers >1:80 in 100% of randomly selected samples, using a conservative approach that excluded non-specific binding. DISCUSSION: Plasma from donors screened using an immunochromatographic test for IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 NP exhibited neutralizing activity meeting FDA's minimum standard in all randomly selected COVID-19 CP units.","Freedenberg, Alex T; Pan, Chun-Hao; Diehl, William E; Romeiser, Jamie L; Hwang, Ga-Ram; Leiton, Cindy V; Muecksch, Frauke; Shroyer, Kenneth R; Bennett-Guerrero, Elliott",Transfusion,,308

287887,"Vaccine-associated enhanced disease: Case definition and guidelines for data collection, analysis, and presentation of immunization safety data",2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is until today a global health emergency. In an immense effort, effective drugs against COVID-19 are searched and intensive researches on possible repurposing of antiviral agents are performed. Since chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown in vitro anti- COVID-19 activities, the potential effect of CQ/HCQ to treat and/or prevent COVID-19 infection has caused global attention. However, concern regarding possible hemolysis in G6PD-deficient COVID-19 patients exists and for this reason, the association between HCQ and G6PD deficiency (G6PDD) is back in the limelight. This study aims to answer the question raised by Mastroianni et al. ""Hydroxychloroquine: Culprit or Innocent Bystander in G6PD-Deficient Patients with COVID-19?"", reporting all cases of HCQ in G6PD deficient COVID-19 patients published on PubMed (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), in addition to the Mastroianni's patient. In our opinion, after an accurate revision of these cases and responding the question raised by Mastroianni et al., we believe that it is difficult to reach a final verdict about the definitive role of HCQ in these patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has reopened attention on HCQ use and G6PDD. G6PD status is extremely important in modulating the level of reactive oxygen species and many cellular immune responses such as enhanced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and inflammasome activation. Since these processes are involved in COVID-19 infection, acute hemolytic anemia, a severe complication of the G6PDD, can occur in these patients. In this context, the role of HCQ, usually effective, safe, and well tolerated in G6PD deficient patients, must be redefined in these patients with COVID-19.As consequence, answering the question: ""Hydroxychloroquine: Culprit or Innocent Bystander in G6PD-Deficient Patients with COVID-19?"", we state that it is risky to believe that HCQ may be an ""innocent bystander"" in G6PD-deficient COVID-19 patients.","Onori, Maria Elisabetta; Ricciardi Tenore, Claudio; Urbani, Andrea; Minucci, Angelo",Mol Biol Rep,,308
288386,Laplace-aided variational inference for differential equation models,2021-04-07,"OBJECTIVE: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus confers a risk of significant coagulopathy, with the resulting development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), potentially contributing to the morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. METHODS: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death.

Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted.

El tratamiento se basa fundamentalmente en medidas de soporte. En este contexto, se han aprobado múltiples terapias de potencial utilidad para su uso en ensayos clínicos, como la transfusión de plasma convaleciente (TPC). Se realizó una búsqueda en PubMed de estudios sobre plasma convaleciente y COVID-19, SARS o MERS. Los estudios sobre la eficacia clínica en enfermedades causadas por otros coronavirus (SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV) evidenciaron mejoría clínica, aumento de anticuerpos neutralizantes, disminución de la mortalidad y ausencia de eventos adversos durante y después del tratamiento. En el caso de la COVID-19, se encontraron 13 estudios en pacientes con la COVID-19 grave y crítica. Aunque existen limitaciones en la metodología, en el número de pacientes y en los protocolos para el análisis del plasma convaleciente de los donantes, los pacientes que recibieron TPC evidenciaron mejoría clínica, mejoría de patrones ventilatorios, resolución de lesiones pulmonares, disminución de mortalidad, mejoría de parámetros laboratoriales, aumento de anticuerpos neutralizantes, disminución de carga viral y baja frecuencia de eventos adversos.","Galván, César A.; Toribio-Dionicio, Crhistian; Álvarez-Ángeles, Marco; Alama-Bazán, Oscar; Sánchez-Ramírez, Luis",Rev. peru. med. exp. salud publica,,308
290400,An integrated psychological score for occupants based on their perception and emotional response according to the windows' outdoor view size,2020,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems in many countries. The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets. The rapidly expanding literature on COVID-19 should be interpreted with care as it is often hampered by methodological and statistical flaws.","van Dam, Peter A; Huizing, Manon; Mestach, Gino; Dierckxsens, Stazie; Tjalma, Wiebren; Trinh, Xuan Bich; Papadimitriou, Kostantinos; Altintas, Sevilay; Vermorken, Jan; Vulsteke, Christof; Janssens, Annelies; Berneman, Zwi; Prenen, Hans; Meuris, Leander; Vanden Berghe, Wim; Smits, Evelien; Peeters, Marc",Cancer Treat Rev,,308
290507,Optimally (Distributional-)Robust Kalman Filtering,2010-04-20,"OBJECTIVE: To describe how the primary healthcare (PHC) in Iceland changed its strategy to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. SETTING: Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. POPULATION: The Reykjavik area has a total of 233 000 inhabitants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number and the mode of consultations carried out. Drug prescriptions and changes in the 10 most common diagnoses made in PHC. Laboratory tests including COVID-19 tests. Average numbers in March and April 2020 compared with the same months in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Pragmatic strategies and new tasks were rapidly applied to the clinical work to meet the foreseen healthcare needs caused by the pandemic. The number of daytime consultations increased by 35% or from 780 to 1051/1000 inhabitants (p<0.001) during the study period. Telephone and web-based consultations increased by 127% (p<0.001). The same tendency was observed in out-of-hours services. The number of consultations in maternity and well-child care decreased only by 4% (p=0.003). Changes were seen in the 10 most common diagnoses. Most noteworthy, apart from a high number of COVID-19 suspected disease, was that immunisation, depression, hypothyroidism and lumbago were not among the top 10 diagnoses during the epidemic period. The number of drug prescriptions increased by 10.3% (from 494 to 545 per 1000 inhabitants, p<0.001). The number of prescriptions from telephone and web-based consultations rose by 55.6%. No changes were observed in antibiotics prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: As the first point of contact in the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHC in Iceland managed to change its strategy swiftly while preserving traditional maternity and well-child care, indicating a very solid PHC with substantial flexibility in its organisation.","Sigurdsson, Emil Larus; Blondal, Anna Bryndis; Jonsson, Jon Steinar; Tomasdottir, Margret Olafia; Hrafnkelsson, Hannes; Linnet, Kristjan; Sigurdsson, Johann Agust",BMJ Open,,308

293226,"The conundrum of human immune system ""senescence""",2020,"Fossil fuels are currently the most convenient on-board energy sources for vehicles in terms of energy density and refueling time. However, the increase in global temperature together with the increase in transported people and goods in recent years has forced regulatory authorities around the world to establish strict regulations on pollutant and CO2 emissions. These scenarios are challenging for vehicle manufacturers, but they also create opportunities for the development of new technologies and concepts. For example, automotive companies and researchers are currently exploring hybrid powertrains with either advanced internal combustion engine technologies and low levels of electrification, or with high levels of electrification combined with simpler internal combustion engines. While these hybridization approaches can provide significant improvements in efficiency and emissions, there is a global movement at the government level to accelerate the adoption of zero tailpipe emitting vehicles (e.g., battery electric vehicles). This paper reviews the current state of powertrain technologies, analyzing first the evolution of emissions regulations in major markets and emphasizing the future tighter measures that will be adopted in Europe and the US. After that, an analysis of current global vehicle sales considering the COVID situation is performed, followed by a forecast of future powertrain technology market share trends. Finally, reviews of internal combustion engine, hybrid, and battery electric vehicle technologies announced in 2020 are carried out.","Conway, Graham Joshi Ameya Leach Felix García Antonio Senecal Peter Kelly",Transportation Engineering,,308

There is little evidence to guide surgeons in assessing what processes should be put in place to restart elective surgery safely in a time of endemic COVID-19 in the community. Methods: We used data from a stand-alone hospital admitting and operating on 91 trauma patients. All patients were screened on admission and 100% of patients have been followed-up after discharge to assess outcome. Results: Overall, 87 (96%) patients remained symptom-free and recovered well following surgery. Four (4%) patients developed symptoms of COVID-19, with polymerase chain reaction ribonucleiuc acid (PCR-RNA) testing confirming infection. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we propose that if careful cohorting and screening is carried out in a stand-alone cold operating site, it is reasonable to resume elective operating, in a time of endemic but low community prevalence of SAR-Cov2.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:229-235.","Lazizi, Mohamed; Marusza, Christopher J; Sexton, Shaun A; Middleton, Rory G",Bone Jt Open,,308

The molecular docking approach can provide a fast prediction of the positive influence the targets on the COVID-19 outbreak. In this work, we choose resveratrol (RV) derivatives (22 cases) and two newly released coordinate structures for COVID-19 as receptors [Papain-like Protease of SARS CoV-2 (PBD ID: 6W9C) and 2019-nCoV RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (PBD ID: 6M71)]. The results show that conformational isomerism is significant and useful parameter for docking results. A wide spectrum of interactions such as Van der Waals, conventional hydrogen bond, Pi-donor hydrogen bond, Pi-Cation, Pi-sigma, Pi-Pi stacked, Amide-Pi stacked and Pi-Alkyl is detected via docking of RV derivatives and COVID-19 receptors.

He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any ”normal” post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.","Schweitzer, Wolf; Ruder, Thomas; Baumeister, Rilana; Bolliger, Stephan; Thali, Michael; Meixner, Eva; Ampanozi, Garyfalia",For.

Based on the in vitro cell-based assay, TPNT1 inhibited six major clades of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with effective concentration within the range to be used as food additives. TPNT1 was shown to block viral entry by inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to interfere with the syncytium formation. In addition, TPNT1 also effectively reduced the cytopathic effects induced by human (H1N1) and avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, including the wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus isolates. Together with previously demonstrated efficacy as antimicrobials, TPNT1 can block viral entry and inhibit or prevent viral infection to provide prophylactic effects against both SARS-CoV-2 and opportunistic infections.","Chang, Sui-Yuan; Huang, Kuo-Yen; Chao, Tai-Ling; Kao, Han-Chieh; Pang, Yu-Hao; Lu, Lin; Chiu, Chun-Lun; Huang, Hsin-Chang; Cheng, Ting-Jen Rachel; Fang, Jim-Min; Yang, Pan-Chyr",Sci Rep,,308

METHODS AND RESULTS: All major cardiac procedures (n = 374,899) performed between 1st January and 31st May for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 were analysed, stratified by procedure type and time-period (pre-COVID: January-May 2018 and 2019 and January-February 2020 and COVID: March-May 2020). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality for procedures performed in the COVID period.Overall, there was a deficit of 45,501 procedures during the COVID period compared to the monthly averages (March-May) in 2018-2019. Cardiac catheterisation and device implantations were the most affected in terms of numbers (n = 19,637 and n = 10,453) whereas surgical procedures such as MVR, other valve replacement/repair, ASD/VSD repair and CABG were the most affected as a relative percentage difference (&#916;) to previous years' averages. TAVR was the least affected (&#916;-10.6%). No difference in 30-day mortality was observed between pre-COVID and COVID time-periods for all cardiac procedures except cardiac catheterisation (OR 1.25 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.47, p = 0.006) and cardiac device implantation (OR 1.35 95% CI 1.15-1.58, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Cardiac procedural activity has significantly declined across England during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a deficit in excess of 45000 procedures, without an increase in risk of mortality for most cardiac procedures performed during the pandemic. Major restructuring of cardiac services is necessary to deal with this deficit, which would inevitably impact long-term morbidity and mortality.","Mohamed, Mohamed O; Banerjee, Amitava; Clarke, Sarah; de Belder, Mark; Patwala, Ashish; Goodwin, Andrew T; Kwok, Chun Shing; Rashid, Muhammad; Gale, Chris P; Curzen, Nick; Mamas, Mamas A",Eur.

In 1 case, 195 downstream contacts were all tested to prevent a mass outbreak in a deployment posture. Analysis of these contacts yielded only a single positive test, which could be reasonably ascribed to respiratory droplet transmission.

However, worldwide distribution of mRNA molecules has been limited by their thermostability, which is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic instability of RNA molecules to a chemical degradation reaction called in-line hydrolysis. Predicting the degradation of an RNA molecule is a key task in designing more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we describe a crowdsourced machine learning competition (""Stanford OpenVaccine"") on Kaggle, involving single-nucleotide resolution measurements on 6043 102-130-nucleotide diverse RNA constructs that were themselves solicited through crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment was completed in less than 6 months. Winning models demonstrated test set errors that were better by 50% than the previous state-of-the-art DegScore model. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly predicting orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules (504-1588 nucleotides) with improved accuracy over DegScore and other models. Top teams integrated natural language processing architectures and data augmentation techniques with predictions from previous dynamic programming models for RNA secondary structure. These results indicate that such models are capable of representing in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting their use for designing stabilized messenger RNAs. The integration of two crowdsourcing platforms, one for data set creation and another for machine learning, may be fruitful for other urgent problems that demand scientific discovery on rapid timescales.","Wayment-Steele, Hannah K.; Kladwang, Wipapat; Watkins, Andrew M.; Kim, Do Soon; Tunguz, Bojan; Reade, Walter; Demkin, Maggie; Romano, Jonathan; Wellington-Oguri, Roger; Nicol, John J.; Gao, Jiayang; Onodera, Kazuki; Fujikawa, Kazuki; Mao, Hanfei; Vandewiele, Gilles; Tinti, Michele; Steenwinckel, Bram; Ito, Takuya; Noumi, Taiga; He, Shujun; Ishi, Keiichiro; Lee, Youhan; Ozturk, Fatih; Chiu, Anthony; Ozturk, Emin; Amer, Karim; Fares, Mohamed; Participants, Eterna; Das, Rhiju",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07531v1.pdf,308

We conducted this cross-sectional, nationwide study to ascertain the psychological effect of quarantine and identify factors associated with mental health outcomes among population quarantined to further inform interventions of mitigating mental health risk especially for vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions. Sociodemographic data, attitudes toward the COVID-19, and mental health measurements of 56,679 participants from 34 provinces in China were collected by an online survey from February 28 to March 11, 2020. Of the 56,679 participants included in the study (mean [SD] age, 36.0 [8.2] years), 27,149 (47.9%) were male and 16,454 (29.0%) ever experienced home confinement or centralized quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak. Compared those without quarantine and adjusted for potential confounders, quarantine measures were associated with increased risk of total psychological outcomes (prevalence, 34.1% vs 27.3%; odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.28-1.39; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that vulnerable groups of the quarantined population included those with pre-existing mental disorders or chronic physical diseases, frontline workers, those in the most severely affected areas during outbreak, infected or suspected patients, and those who are less financially well-off. Complying with quarantine, being able to take part in usual work, and having adequate understanding of information related to the outbreak were associated with less mental health issues. These results suggest that quarantine measures during COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased risk of experiencing mental health burden, especially for vulnerable groups.

302015,Undetected cases,2020,"Microbial biosynthesis of plant natural products (PNPs) can facilitate access to valuable medicinal compounds and derivatives. Such efforts are challenged by metabolite transport limitations, which arise when complex plant pathways distributed across organelles and tissues are reconstructed in unicellular hosts without concomitant transport machinery. We recently reported an engineered yeast platform for production of the tropane alkaloid (TA) drugs hyoscyamine and scopolamine, in which product accumulation is limited by vacuolar transport. Here, we demonstrate that alleviation of transport limitations at multiple steps in an engineered pathway enables increased production of TAs and screening of useful derivatives. We first show that supervised classifier models trained on a tissue-delineated transcriptome from the TA-producing plant Atropa belladonna can predict TA transporters with greater efficacy than conventional regression- and clustering-based approaches. We demonstrate that two of the identified transporters, AbPUP1 and AbLP1, increase TA production in engineered yeast by facilitating vacuolar export and cellular reuptake of littorine and hyoscyamine. We incorporate four different plant transporters, cofactor regeneration mechanisms, and optimized growth conditions into our yeast platform to achieve improvements in de novo hyoscyamine and scopolamine production of over 100-fold (480 µg/L) and 7-fold (172 µg/L). Finally, we leverage computational tools for biosynthetic pathway prediction to produce two different classes of TA derivatives, nortropane alkaloids and tropane N-oxides, from simple precursors. Our work highlights the importance of cellular transport optimization in recapitulating complex PNP biosyntheses in microbial hosts and illustrates the utility of computational methods for gene discovery and expansion of heterologous biosynthetic diversity.","Srinivasan, Prashanth; Smolke, Christina D",Proc.

The current COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from SARS-CoV-2, induces acute pneumonia, a phenotype that is alarmingly increased with aging. In this article, we review findings of how aging alters immunity to respiratory viral infections to identify age-impacted pathways common to several viral pathogens, permitting us to speculate about potential mechanisms of age-enhanced mortality to COVID-19. Aging generally leads to exaggerated innate immunity, particularly in the form of elevated neutrophil accumulation across murine and large animal studies of influenza infection. COVID-19 patients who succumb exhibit a 2-fold increase in neutrophilia, suggesting that exaggerated innate immunity contributes to age-enhanced mortality to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation in relevant experimental models will elucidate the mechanisms by which aging impacts respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Such investigation could identify therapies to reduce the suffering of the population at large, but especially among older people, infected with respiratory viruses.","Chen, Judy; Kelley, William J; Goldstein, Daniel R",J. immunol,,308

As a large health system in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, we were faced with these challenges early on, including the need to rapidly transition patients from acute care beds to provide bed capacity for the acute care hospitals. Rehabilitation medicine has always played an essential role in the continuum of care, establishing functional goals while identifying patients for postacute care planning. During this crisis, this expertise and the overwhelming need to adapt and facilitate patient transitions resulted in a collaborative process to efficiently assess patients for postacute care needs. We worked closely with our skilled nursing facility, home care partners, and an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital to adapt their admissions processes to the patient population with COVID-19, all the while grappling with varying access to vital supplies, testing, and manpower. As the patient criteria were established, rapid pathways were created to postacute care, and we were able to create much needed bed capacity in our acute care hospitals.","Levin, Sheryl R; Gitkind, Andrew I; Bartels, Matthew N",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,308

The immediate animal origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, remains unknown, a notoriously challenging task for emerging disease investigations. Coevolution with hosts leads to specific evolutionary signatures within viral genomes that can inform likely animal origins. We obtained a set of 650 spike protein and 511 whole genome nucleotide sequences from 222 and 185 viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, respectively. We then trained random forest models independently on genome composition biases of spike protein and whole genome sequences, including dinucleotide and codon usage biases in order to predict animal host (of nine possible categories, including human). In hold-one-out cross-validation, predictive accuracy on unseen coronaviruses consistently reached ~73%, indicating evolutionary signal in spike proteins to be just as informative as whole genome sequences. However, different composition biases were informative in each case. Applying optimised random forest models to classify human sequences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed evolutionary signatures consistent with their recognised intermediate hosts (camelids, carnivores), while human sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted as having bat hosts (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), supporting bats as the suspected origins of the current pandemic. In addition to phylogeny, variation in genome composition can act as an informative approach to predict emerging virus traits as soon as sequences are available. More widely, this work demonstrates the potential in combining genetic resources with machine learning algorithms to address long-standing challenges in emerging infectious diseases.","Brierley, Liam; Fowler, Anna",PLoS Pathog,,308

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of all women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 23 and 37 weeks of gestation within a large integrated health system from March 13 to April 24, 2020. Cases with severe fetal structural malformations detected prior to infection were excluded. Women were stratified into two groups based on gestational age at diagnosis: early preterm (230/7 to 336/7 weeks) versus late preterm (34 to 366/7 weeks). We compared the rate of PTB during hospitalization with infection between the two groups. Statistical analysis included use of Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher exact tests, as well as a multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value <0.05. RESULTS: Of the 65 patients included, 36 (53.7%) were diagnosed in the early preterm period and 29 (46.3%) were diagnosed in the late preterm period. Baseline demographics were similar between groups. The rate of PTB during hospitalization with infection was significantly lower among women diagnosed in the early preterm period compared with late preterm (7/36 [19.4%] vs. 18/29 [62%], p-value = 0.001). Of the 25 patients who delivered during hospitalization with infection, the majority were indicated deliveries (64%, 16/25). There were no deliveries <33 weeks of gestation for worsening coronavirus disease 2019 and severity of disease did not alter the likelihood of delivery during hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-1.59). Increased maternal age was associated with a lower likelihood of delivery during hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.58-0.96), while later gestational age at diagnosis of infection was associated with a higher likelihood of delivery during hospitalization (aOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.67-8.09). CONCLUSION: The likelihood of PTB during hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 infection is significantly lower among women diagnosed in the early preterm period compared with late preterm. Most women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early preterm period recovered and were discharged home. The majority of PTB were indicated and not due to spontaneous preterm labor.

In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19.","Shkurnikov, Maxim; Nersisyan, Stepan; Jankevic, Tatjana; Galatenko, Alexei; Gordeev, Ivan; Vechorko, Valery; Tonevitsky, Alexander",Front Immunol,,308

The main reported concerns are centered around privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic without similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better understand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy policies, terms&conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used COVID-19, Social Media&Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that Social Media&Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and ethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots of people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared to most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and led users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists will need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour and trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps and encourage them to download and use these apps. Moreover, COVID-19 apps need many accessibility enhancements to allow a wider range of users from different societies and cultures to access to these apps.","Haggag, Omar; Haggag, Sherif; Grundy, John; Abdelrazek, Mohamed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01779v1.pdf,308

We studied their preparedness and delivery of palliative care during COVID-19 as part of a mixed-method study. We present the results of an online questionnaire. METHODS: All FBOs providing palliative care in India were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Response rate was 46/64 (72%); 44 provided palliative care; 30/44 (68%) were in rural or semiurban areas with 10-2700 beds. Fifty-two per cent (23/44) had dedicated palliative care teams and 30/44 (68%) provided it as part of general services; 17/44 (39%) provided both. 29/44 (66%) provided palliative care for cancer patients; 17/44 (34%) reported that this was more than half their workload.The pandemic led to reduced clinical work: hospital 36/44 (82%) and community 40/44 (91%); with reduction in hospital income for 41/44 (93%). 18/44 (44%) were designated government COVID-19 centres; 11/40 (32%) had admitted between 1 and 2230 COVID-19 patients.COVID-19 brought challenges: 14/44 (32%) lacked personal protective equipment; 21/44 (48%) had reduced hospital supplies and 19/44 (43%) lacked key medications including morphine. 29/44 (66%) reported reduction in palliative care work; 7/44 (16%) had stopped altogether. Twenty-three per cent (10/44) reported redeployment of palliative care teams to other work. For those providing, palliative care 32/37 (86%) was principally for non-COVID patients; 13/37 (35%) cared for COVID-19 patients. Service adaptations included: teleconsultation, triaged home visits, medication delivery at home and food supply. CONCLUSIONS: FBOs in India providing palliative care had continued to do so despite multiple challenges. Services were adapted to enable ongoing patient care. Further research is exploring the effects of COVID-19 in greater depth.","Sundararaj, Jenifer Jeba; Munday, Daniel; Duomai, Savita; John, Priya; Priscilla S, Ruby Angeline; Powys, Ruth; Singh, Ashita; Boyd, Kirsty J; Grant, Liz; Murray, Scott A",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,308
311974,"Breaking all the rules, at lightning speed",2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 has restricted access to face-to-face delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Evidence suggests that telehealth-PR is non-inferior to outpatient PR. However, it is unknown whether patients who have been referred to face-to-face programmes can feasibly complete an online-PR programme. METHODS: This service evaluation used a mixed-methods approach to investigate a rapid PR service remodelling using the University of Gloucestershire eLearn Moodle platform. Quantitative baseline demographic and PR outcome data were collected from online-PR participants, and semistructured interviews were completed with PR staff and participants. RESULTS: Twenty-five individuals were eligible from a PR waiting list. Thirteen declined participation and 14 completed PR. Significant pre-post online PR improvements were achieved in 1 min sit-to-stand (CI 2.1 to 9 (p=0.004)), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (CI -0.3 to -2.6 (p=0.023)), Primary Health Questionnaire-9 (CI -0.3 to -5.1 (p=0.029)), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnoea (CI 0.5 to 1.3 (p=0.001)), fatigue (CI 0.7 to 2 (p=0.0004)), emotion (CI 0.7 to 1.7 (p=0.0002)), mastery (CI 0.4 to 1.3 (p=0.001)). Interviews indicated that patient PR inclusion was made possible with digital support and a PR introduction session improved participant engagement and safety. Incremental progression of exercise was perceived as more successful online compared with face-to-face PR. However, perceptions were that education sessions were less successful. Online-PR required significant staff time resource. DISCUSSION: Online-PR improves patient outcomes and is feasible and acceptable for individuals referred for face-to-face PR in the context of a requirement for social distancing. Face-to-face programmes can be adapted in a rapid fashion with both staff and participants perceiving benefit. Future pragmatic trials are now warranted comparing online-PR including remote assessments to centre-based PR with suitably matched outcomes, and patient and staff perceptions sought regarding barriers and facilitators of online delivery.","Lewis, Adam; Knight, Ellena; Bland, Matthew; Middleton, Jack; Mitchell, Esther; McCrum, Kate; Conway, Joy; Bevan-Smith, Elaine",,,308
313833,Real-Time Approximate Routing for Smart Transit Systems,2021-03-10,"The spike (S) protein is one of the three proteins forming the coronaviruses' viral envelope. The S protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a spatial structure similar to the S proteins of other mammalian coronaviruses, except for a unique receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a significant inducer of host immune response. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD is widely used as a highly specific minimal antigen for serological tests. Correct exposure of antigenic determinants has a significant impact on the accuracy of such tests-the antigen has to be correctly folded, contain no potentially antigenic non-vertebrate glycans, and, preferably, should have a glycosylation pattern similar to the native S protein. Based on the previously developed p1.1 vector, containing the regulatory sequences of the Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EEF1A1) from Chinese hamster, we created two expression constructs encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD with C-terminal c-myc and polyhistidine tags. RBDv1 contained a native viral signal peptide, RBDv2 -human tPA signal peptide. We transfected a CHO DG44 cell line, selected stably transfected cells, and performed a few rounds of methotrexate-driven amplification of the genetic cassette in the genome. For the RBDv2 variant, a high-yield clonal producer cell line was obtained. We developed a simple purification scheme that consistently yielded up to 30 mg of RBD protein per liter of the simple shake flask cell culture. Purified proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reducing and non-reducing conditions and gel filtration; for RBDv2 protein, the monomeric form content exceeded 90% for several series. Deglycosylation with PNGase F and mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of N-glycosylation. The antigen produced by the described technique is suitable for serological tests and subunit vaccine studies.","Sinegubova, Maria V; Orlova, Nadezhda A; Kovnir, Sergey V; Dayanova, Lutsia K; Vorobiev, Ivan I",PLoS One,,308

By March 11, this outbreak was designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. So far, it has affected 213 countries and territories around the world. It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread. In the present paper, we discuss the various non-pharmacological approaches that have to be adopted at the personal or community level and by the healthcare providers to win against this virus.","Verma, Madhur; Aydin, Hasan",J Pak Med Assoc,,308

We calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) via the next-generation matrix method and estimate the per day infection, death and recovery rates. The local stability of the disease-free equilibrium is established in terms of R 0. A sensibility analysis is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the disease transmission. We calibrate the parameters of the SEIARD model to the reported number of infected cases, fatalities and recovered cases for several states in Mexico by minimizing the sum of squared errors and attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak until November 2020.","Avila-Ponce de León, Ugo; Pérez, Ángel G.C.; Avila-Vales, Eric",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,308
315283,What new COVID variants mean for schools is not yet clear,2021,"Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a ""cytokine storm"", the mechanism of which is not yet understood. I propose that cytokine storms result from synergistic interactions among Toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR) due to combined infections of SARS-CoV-2 with other microbes, mainly bacterial and fungal. This proposition is based on eight linked types of evidence and their logical connections. (1) Severe cases of COVID-19 differ from healthy controls and mild COVID-19 patients in exhibiting increased TLR4, TLR7, TLR9 and NLRP3 activity. (2) SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses activate TLR3, TLR7, RIG1 and NLRP3. (3) SARS-CoV-2 cannot, therefore, account for the innate receptor activation pattern (IRAP) found in severe COVID-19 patients. (4) Severe COVID-19 also differs from its mild form in being characterized by bacterial and fungal infections. (5) Respiratory bacterial and fungal infections activate TLR2, TLR4, TLR9 and NLRP3. (6) A combination of SARS-CoV-2 with bacterial/fungal coinfections accounts for the IRAP found in severe COVID-19 and why it differs from mild cases. (7) Notably, TLR7 (viral) and TLR4 (bacterial/fungal) synergize, TLR9 and TLR4 (both bacterial/fungal) synergize and TLR2 and TLR4 (both bacterial/fungal) synergize with NLRP3 (viral and bacterial). (8) Thus, a SARS-CoV-2-bacterium/fungus coinfection produces synergistic innate activation, resulting in the hyperinflammation characteristic of a cytokine storm. Unique clinical, experimental and therapeutic predictions (such as why melatonin is effective in treating COVID-19) are discussed, and broader implications are outlined for understanding why other syndromes such as acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis display varied cytokine storm symptoms.","Root-Bernstein, Robert",Int. j. mol. sci.

315536,Vocal music listening enhances post-stroke language network reorganization,2021,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes. This happens, at least in part, because TLR4 modulates the enzyme NADPH oxidase, a primary source of ROS in vascular structures. Increased oxidative stress disrupts key vascular signaling mechanisms and drives the progression of diabetes, elevating the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it has been shown that patients with diabetes are also at a higher risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given the importance of the interaction between TLR4 and NADPH oxidase to the disrupted diabetic vascular system, we put forward the hypothesis that TLR4-mediated NADPH oxidase-derived ROS might be a critical mechanism to help explain why this disparity appears in diabetic patients, but unfortunately, conclusive experimental evidence still lacks in the literature. Herein, we focus on discussing the pathological implications of this signaling communication in the diabetic vasculature and exploring this crosstalk in the context of diabetes-associated COVID-19.","de Oliveira, Amanda Almeida; Nunes, Kenia Pedrosa",Vascul Pharmacol,,308
316097,Challenges in cybersecurity: Lessons from biological defense systems,2021-07-21,"Athletes going through transition periods such as injury or retirement have previously reported feelings of depression and anxiety, especially when feeling unsupported. Cessation of competitive sport during the pandemic has forced athletes through a non-normative transition and has reduced many opportunities to satisfy their basic psychological needs increasing the risk of poor wellbeing and loneliness. Whilst athletes are often praised for their resilience-a trait that serves to support them during tough times-the inability to play sport can be particularly challenging for those with strong athletic identities. An online cross-sectional survey (n = 744) was conducted to capture adult athlete and non-athlete mental health factors (specifically wellbeing, depression, anxiety, loneliness) during emergence from a COVID-19 lockdown. Results showed that resilience was positively correlated with mental health but was no higher in athletes than non-athletes. Furthermore, athletes reported greater anxiety than non-athletes, a difference mediated by negative affectivity-a subfactor of athletic identity. We present evidence that after a temporary transition away from sport, athletes' resilience is comparable to non-athletes leaving them just as likely to suffer poor mental health. Moreover, athletes with strong athletic identities are likely to experience anxiety symptoms above and beyond those reported by non-athletes. Findings have implications for the development of self-management guidance for athletes as the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on sport participation continue.","Knowles, C.; Shannon, S.; Prentice, G.; Breslin, G.",Frontiers in Sports &amp; Active Living,,308

Singapore has escalated its alert level to Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) Orange, signifying severe disease with community spread. We aimed to study the overall volume of AIS cases and the delivery of hyperacute stroke services during DORSCON Orange. This was a single-centre, observational cohort study performed at a comprehensive stroke centre responsible for AIS cases in the western region of Singapore, as well as providing care for COVID-19 patients. All AIS patients reviewed as an acute stroke activation in the Emergency Department (ED) from November 2019 to April 2020 were included. System processes timings, treatment and clinical outcome variables were collected. We studied 350 AIS activation patients admitted through the ED, 206 (58.9%) pre- and 144 during DORSCON Orange. Across the study period, number of stroke activations showed significant decline (p = 0.004, 95% CI 6.513 to - 2.287), as the number of COVID-19 cases increased exponentially, whilst proportion of activations receiving acute recanalization therapy remained stable (p = 0.519, 95% CI - 1.605 to 2.702). Amongst AIS patients that received acute recanalization therapy, early neurological outcomes in terms of change in median NIHSS at 24 h (-4 versus -4, p = 0.685) were largely similar between the pre- and during DORSCON orange periods. The number of stroke activations decreased while the proportion receiving acute recanalization therapy remained stable in the current COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.","Paliwal, Prakash R; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Leow, Aloysius S T; Sibi, Sunny; Chor, Daniel W P; Chin, Amanda X Y; Yau, Ying-Wei; Cross, Gail B; Wong, Lily Y H; Chia, Magdalene L J; Quak, Zhixuan; Chua, Christopher Y K; Tang, David K K; Zune, Ei The; Hung, Jennifer; Goh, Yihui; Jing, Mingxue; Gopinathan, Anil; Yang, Cunli; Ahmad, Aftab; Khoo, Deborah X L; Lee, Chang-Chuan M; Seet, Raymond C S; Sharma, Vijay K; Teoh, Hock-Luen; Yeo, Leonard L L; Chan, Bernard P L",J Thromb Thrombolysis,,308

We report systemic and mucosal antibody responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying severity of disease. Whereas assessment of neutralization and antibody-mediated effector functions revealed polyfunctional antibody responses in serum, only robust neutralization and phagocytosis were apparent in nasal wash samples. Serum neutralization and effector functions correlated with systemic SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. Antibody depletion experiments support the mechanistic relevance of these correlations. Associations between nasal IgA responses, virus neutralization at the mucosa, and less severe disease suggest the importance of assessing mucosal immunity in larger natural infection cohorts. Further characterization of antibody responses at the portal of entry may define their ability to contribute to protection from infection or reduced risk of hospitalization, informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development efforts.","Butler, Savannah E; Crowley, Andrew R; Natarajan, Harini; Xu, Shiwei; Weiner, Joshua A; Bobak, Carly A; Mattox, Daniel E; Lee, Jiwon; Wieland-Alter, Wendy; Connor, Ruth I; Wright, Peter F; Ackerman, Margaret E",Front Immunol,,308

We recruit both undergraduate and postgraduate assistants for this task in separate stages, and compare their performance against the support vectors machine ML algorithm at classifying European Research Council Starting Grant project abstracts to their actual evaluation panels, which are organised by discipline groups. On average, ML is more accurate than human classifiers, across a variety of training and test datasets, and across evaluation panels. ML classifiers trained on different training sets are also more reliable than human classifiers, meaning that different ML classifiers are more consistent in assigning the same classifications to any given abstract, compared to different human classifiers. While the top five percentile of human classifiers can outperform ML in limited cases, selection and training of such classifiers is likely costly and difficult compared to training ML models. Our results suggest ML models are a cost effective and highly accurate method for addressing problems in comparative bibliometric analysis, such as harmonising the discipline classifications of research from different funding agencies or countries.","Goh, Yeow Chong; Cai, Xin Qing; Theseira, Walter; Ko, Giovanni; Khor, Khiam Aik",Scientometrics,,308

319181,Zinc,2021,"BACKGROUND: While much progress was made throughout the Millennium Development Goals era in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, both remain unacceptably high, especially in areas affected by humanitarian crises. While valuable guidance on interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health in both non-crisis and crisis settings exists, guidance on how best to deliver these interventions in crisis settings, and especially in conflict settings, is still limited. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the available literature on the delivery on maternal and neonatal health interventions in conflict settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and maternal and neonatal health. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing a maternal or neonatal health intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention, and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated but no meta-analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: 115 publications met our eligibility criteria. Intervention delivery was most frequently reported in the sub-Saharan Africa region, and most publications focused on displaced populations based in camps. Reported maternal interventions targeted antenatal, obstetric and postnatal care; neonatal interventions focused mostly on essential newborn care. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics, by doctors and nurses, and were mostly delivered through non-governmental organisations or the existing healthcare system. Delivery barriers included insecurity, lack of resources and lack of skilled health staff. Multi-stakeholder collaboration, the introduction of new technology or systems innovations, and staff training were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. DISCUSSION: The relevant existing literature focuses mostly on maternal health especially around the antenatal period. There is still limited literature on postnatal care in conflict settings and even less on newborn care. In crisis settings, as much as in non-crisis settings, there is a need to focus on the first day of birth for both maternal and neonatal health. There is also a need to do more research on how best to involve community members in the delivery of maternal and neonatal health interventions.

This study examines the differences in COVID-19 infection, death, and testing by governor party affiliation across the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was conducted in December 2020 examining COVID-19 incidence, death, testing, and test positivity rates from March 15, 2020 through December 15, 2020. A Bayesian negative binomial model was fit to estimate the daily risk ratios and posterior intervals comparing rates by gubernatorial party affiliation. The analyses adjusted for state population density, rurality, Census region, age, race, ethnicity, poverty, number of physicians, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, smoking, and presidential voting in 2020. RESULTS: From March 2020 to early June 2020, Republican-led states had lower COVID-19 incidence rates than Democratic-led states. On June 3, 2020, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had a higher incidence (risk ratio=1.10, 95% posterior interval=1.01, 1.18). This trend persisted through early December 2020. For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic but higher rates from July 4, 2020 (risk ratio=1.18, 95% posterior interval=1.02, 1.31) through mid-December 2020. Republican-led states had higher test positivity rates starting on May 30, 2020 (risk ratio=1.70, 95% posterior interval=1.66, 1.73) and lower testing rates by September 30, 2020 (risk ratio=0.95, 95% posterior interval=0.90, 0.98).

These inequities have been further underscored by the recent murders of Black Americans by police and a resulting spotlight on racial injustice in the United States. Results Efforts to lessen the spread of the virus, have resulted in changes in pediatric primary and subspecialty service delivery which may affect access for BIPOC communities. BIPOC trainees including those with debt or caregiving responsibilities may be faced with new barriers resulting in delays in completion of their training. Further, clinical, community-based, and translational research has been disrupted by heightened safety precautions and social distancing which may affect BIPOC representation in research downstream. Conclusion In our roles as clinicians, supervisors, trainees, and researchers in primary and subspecialty care as well as in academia, pediatric psychologists have an ethical responsibility to address the disproportionate burden of this pandemic on vulnerable communities and to allocate our time and resources to ensuring health equity now and in the aftermath of COVID-19.","Valenzuela, Jessica; Crosby, Lori E; Harrison, Roger R",J Pediatr Psychol,,308
322098,Ensuring vaccine safety,2020,"SUMMARY Background Hand washing is an important targeted hygiene intervention for limiting the spread of infectious agents, including the Ebola virus, which continues to re-emerge We have assessed the virucidal efficacy of a commercially available liquid hand wash product (LHW) for inactivating Ebola virus Methods The ASTM E1052-11 Standard was used to evaluate the efficacy of an LHW containing the microbicidal active salicylic acid for inactivating Ebola virus - Makona variant suspended in an organic load Three concentrations (12 5%, 25%, 50%) of three lots of LHW prepared in 440 ppm hard water were evaluated at room temperature for 20, 30, and 60 s contact time Results A 25% solution of the LHW caused 4 5 log10 and 4 8 log10 reduction in Ebola virus titer within 20 and 30 s, respectively The efficacy of a 12 5% LHW solution was lower (1 9 and 2 0 log10 reduction in titer within 20 and 30 s, respectively) The efficacy of the 50% LHW solution could not be measured, due to inability to sufficiently neutralize the LHW at the end of exposure Conclusion These results suggest the potential utility of an appropriately formulated liquid hand wash agent during Ebola virus disease outbreaks for use within healthcare, community, and home settings Such an LHW should also be effective against other enveloped viruses, such as the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","Cutts, T.

Patients' management and outcomes, especially in severe and critical cases, can vary depending on regional standard operating procedures and local guidance. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Rapid review methodology was applied to include all the studies published on PubMed and Embase between December 15th 2019 and February 28th 2021, reporting in-hospital and respiratory support-related mortality in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that underwent either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Only English language studies with &#8805;100 patients and reporting data on respiratory failure were included. Data on comorbidities, ventilatory parameters and hospital-related complications were registered. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifty-two studies (287359 patients - 57.5% males, mean age 64 years (range 24-98)) from 17 different countries were included in the final analysis. 33.3% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units. 44.2% had hypertension, 26.1% had diabetes, and 7.1% a chronic respiratory disease. 55% of patients underwent respiratory support (36% IMV, 62% NIV and 2% CPAP). Without considering a study with the highest number of patients treated with NIV (n=96729), prevalence of NIV and CPAP use was 12.5% and 13.5% respectively. Globally, invasive and non-invasive approaches were heterogeneously applied. In-hospital mortality was 33.7%, and IMV-related mortality was 72.6% (range: 4.3%-99%). Specific mortality in patients treated with CPAP or NIV was available for 53% of studies, and was 29% (range: 7.2%-100%). The median length of hospital stay was 13 days (range: 6-63). The most frequent hospital-related complication was acute kidney injury being reported in up to 55.7% of enrolled patients. CONCLUSIONS: Global employment of respiratory supports and related outcomes are very heterogeneous. The most frequent respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is IMV, while NIV and CPAP are less frequently and equally applied, the latter especially in Europe, while data on NIV/CPAP-related mortality is often under-reported. Integrated and comprehensive reporting is desirable and needed to construct evidence-based recommendations.","Radovanovic, Dejan; Santus, Pierachille; Coppola, Silvia; Saad, Marina; Pini, Stefano; Giuliani, Fabio; Mondoni, Michele; Chiumello, Davide A",Minerva anestesiol,,308

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed with the keywords COVID-19 and their synonyms and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. The data selection and extraction was elaborated by two researchers, independently. The results were discussed with a Primary Care physicians clinical group and the results were synthesized using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: A good quality systematic review was found that includes articles with a high risk of bias. And 8 EC launched that will produce results beyond May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Although the conclusions of the systematic review generate a low confidence in the results, and the clinical variables that show benefit are intermediate variables, the side effects are acceptable and could be minimized with the use of QT lengthening risk tools, so it is could make a weak recommendation in favor of the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in patients with mild-moderate stage COVID-19.","Mayayo-Vicente, S; Rodriguez Salvanés, F; Gallego-Arenas, A; Sánchez-Gómez, L M; Ruiz-López, M; Sierra García, B; Jurado-López, A; Arriola-Bolado, P; Cervera Cano, M; Novella-Arribas, B",Semergen,,308

We have been running virtual cardiology clinics as per Health Service Executive guidance. AIMS: Our study aims to determine how virtual clinics change practice vs traditional clinics. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on patients attending cardiology clinics in our hospital from 6 January to 13 March 2020 ('traditional clinic', n = 1644), compared with clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak, from 16 March to 22 April 2020 ('virtual clinic', n = 691), with the same medical staff. RESULTS: There was no difference in age (61 vs 60), case mix or new vs return appointments in virtual vs traditional clinics. There were similar rates of clinic participation, 71.8% vs 74.2%. A lower proportion of investigations (e.g. imaging) were booked in virtual (38.5%) vs traditional (55.7%) clinics, p < 0.00001. Management changes (e.g. medication changes) were less frequent in virtual (19.9%) vs traditional (38.5%) clinics, p < 0.00001. However, the discharge rate was higher in virtual (28.8%) vs traditional (19.5%) clinics, p = 0.00003. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that virtual clinic consultations are associated with fewer investigations, fewer management changes, and increased discharge rates compared with traditional consultations. These practice changes would reduce costs and hospital outpatient congestion by avoiding unnecessary hospital reviews. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether patients requiring face-to-face consultations could be missed as a result of this virtual approach. Longitudinal studies are required to assess clinical outcomes as a result of these practice changes and whether patient satisfaction is altered.","Offiah, Gregory; O039,; Connor, Cormac; Waters, Max; Hickey, Niall; Loo, Bryan; Moore, David; Mulcahy, David; Maher, Vincent",Ir. j. med. sci,,308
329705,Application-oriented mathematical algorithms for group testing,2020-05-05,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efforts deployed by different nations and territories in sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates, thus enabling detection of variants, known and novel, of concern. METHODS: The sources of over one million full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus available in the COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker (CovMT) were analyzed to determine the number of variants in the RBD region of the genome determining infectivity detected in the various nations and territories. RESULTS: The number of detected variants increased as the square root of sequencing effort by nations. Eight nations have contributed 79% of all SARS-CoV-2 isolates that have been sequenced, with two-thirds of all unique variants, adding to 1118 RBD variants, reported by five nations. The median number of sequenced isolates required to detect, on average, one novel RBD variant is 24.05, which is a threshold achieved by 70 nations. CONCLUSIONS: Many developing nations have not contributed any sequences due to lack of capacity. This poses a risk of dangerous virus variants in these under-sampled regions spreading globally before being detected. A collaborative program to sequence SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and other pathogens of concern, is needed to monitor, track, and control the pandemic.","Duarte, Carlos M; Jamil, Tahira; Gojobori, Takashi; Alam, Intikhab",Int J Infect Dis,,308
330751,The trouble with naïve Keynesianism,2020,"Uncovering the tail risk spillover among global financial markets helps provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information transmission in extreme market conditions such as the COVID-19 outbreak. In this paper, we examine systemic distress risk spillover between the global stock market and individual stock markets in the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using two important measures of tail dependence risk: conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and delta conditional VaR (ΔCoVaR), we apply the bivariate dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) conditional autoregressive heteroscedastic (GARCH) model. The empirical results reveal that bivariate systemic risk contagion between the global stock market and each individual stock market evolved during the sample period and intensified as COVID-19 spread worldwide. During the COVID-19 period, the developed markets in Europe and North America transmitted and received more marginal extreme risk to and from the entire global market than Asian stock markets. Further analysis involving the connectedness among the value at risk (VaR) series of the sampled stock market indices and the global stock index, shows a high degree of integration in the extreme downside risk of the stock market system, especially during the COVID-19 period. These findings offer practical implications for regulators, policymakers, and portfolio risk managers during the unprecedented uncertainty period provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Abuzayed, B.; Bouri, E.; Al-Fayoumi, N.; Jalkh, N.",Economic Analysis and Policy,,308

The survey was able to bring together the response of 34 services, nine of which were located in a high epidemic cluster zone. Dedicated acute geriatric units for patients infected with COVID-19 were present in eight facilities, only outside the cluster zones. Nine geriatric follow-up and rehabilitation services were dedicated, an additional telemedicine activity concerned 35% of the facilities, and family listening and tablet communication facilities concerned 36% of the facilities. This survey is a snapshot of an initial moment in the epidemic.

332970,Genital lockdown,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity, mortality, and strained healthcare systems worldwide. Thus, a search for modalities that can expedite and improve the diagnosis and management of this entity is underway. Recent data suggested the utility of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting an interstitial pattern (B-pattern). Hence, we aimed to pool the proportion of various reported lung abnormalities detected by LUS in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE until April 25, 2020) and a proportion meta-analysis. We included seven studies examining the role of LUS in 122 COVID-19 patients. The pooled proportion (PP) of B-pattern detected by lung ultrasound (US) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00 I 2 0%, Q 4.6). The PP of finding pleural line abnormalities was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.13-1.00 I 2 96%, Q 103.9), of pleural thickening was 0.54 (95% 0.11-0.95 I 2 93%, Q 61.1), of subpleural or pulmonary consolidation was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.58 I 2 72%, Q 17.8), and of pleural effusion was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00-0.37 I 2 93%, Q 27.3). Our meta-analysis revealed that almost all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have abnormal lung US. The most common abnormality is interstitial involvement depicted as B-pattern. The finding from our review highlights the potential role of this modality in the triage, diagnosis, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. A sizable diagnostic accuracy study comparing LUS, computed tomography scan, and COVID-19-specific tests is warranted to further test this finding and to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic yield of each of these modalities.","Mohamed, Mouhand F H; Al-Shokri, Shaikha; Yousaf, Zohaib; Danjuma, Mohammed; Parambil, Jessiya; Mohamed, Samreen; Mubasher, Mahmood; Dauleh, Mujahed M; Hasanain, Bara; AlKahlout, Mohamed Awni; Abubeker, Ibrahim Y",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,308
333608,A Survey for C II Emission-Line Stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of medical students, medical faculties have faced the challenge of adapting instruction to digital platforms. Although medical students are willing to support pandemic response efforts, how the crisis will affect their medical training remains uncertain. Thus, in this study, we investigated the teaching- and learning-related stressors and expectations of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to undergraduate medical students at medical faculties in Germany. Students answered questions about COVID-19 and teaching (on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (""not at all"") to 6 (""completely"")) and completed mental well-being measurements, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Perceived Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive data analysis, a t-test and Pearson correlations were performed to process the data. RESULTS: Medical students felt well-informed about COVID-19 in general (M = 5.64, SD = 1.28) and in the medical context (M = 5.14, SD = 1.34) but significantly less informed about the pandemic in the academic context, M = 2.47, SD = 1.49, t(371) = 31.98, p < .001. Their distress levels were high (STAI: M = 45.12, SD = 4.73) and significantly correlated with the academic context (rp = .164, p < .01) but not their private lives. Concerning how they were taught, they most often expected online lectures (91.7%) and live broadcasts (67.2%) and less often expected innovative digital teaching strategies, including serious games (17.3%) and virtual-reality exercises (16.7%). DISCUSSION: Medical students seem to be aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for academic and healthcare contexts. They also seem to think that their teachers will enhance their digital competencies during the pandemic. Therefore, faculties of medicine need to rapidly and adequately digitalise their approaches to teaching.","Loda, Teresa; Löffler, Tobias; Erschens, Rebecca; Zipfel, Stephan; Herrmann-Werner, Anne",PLoS One,,308
334170,Is aberrant CD8+ T cell activation by hypertension associated with cardiac injury in severe cases of COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Aerosol-generating procedures, including endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES), are a major risk for physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Techniques for reducing aerosolization and risk of transmission of COVID-19 during these procedures would be valuable to the neurosurgical community. The authors aimed to simulate the generation of small-particle aerosols during EES and craniectomy in order to develop methods to reduce the spread of aerosolized particles, and to test the effectiveness of these methods. METHODS: This study was performed at the Anatomical Laboratory for Visuospatial Innovations in Otolaryngology and Neurosurgery at The Ohio State University. The following two scenarios were used to measure three different particle sizes (0.3, 2.5, and 10 µm) generated: 1) drilling frontotemporal bone, simulating a craniectomy; and 2) drilling sphenoid bone, simulating an endonasal approach. A suction mask device was created with the aim of reducing particle release. The presence of particles was measured without suction, with a single Frazier tip suction in the field, and with the suction mask device in addition to the Frazier suction tip. Particles were measured 12 cm from the craniectomy or endonasal drilling region. RESULTS: In the absence of any aerosol-reducing devices, the number of particles measured during craniectomy was significantly higher than that generated by endonasal drilling. This was true regardless of the particle size measured (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; 2.5 µm, p < 0.001; and 10 µm, p < 0.001). The suction mask device reduced the release of particles of all sizes measured in the craniectomy simulation (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; 2.5 µm, p < 0.001; and 10 µm, p < 0.001) and particles of 0.3 µm and 2.5 µm in the single Frazier suction simulation (0.3 µm, p = 0.031; and 2.5 µm, p = 0.026). The suction mask device further reduced the release of particles of all sizes during EES simulation (0.3 µm, p < 0.001; and 2.5 µm, p < 0.001) and particles of 0.3 µm and 2.5 µm in the single Frazier suction simulation (0.3 µm, p = 0.033; and 2.5 µm, p = 0.048). Large particles (10 µm) were not detected during EES. CONCLUSIONS: The suction mask device is a simple and effective means of reducing aerosol release during EES, and it could potentially be used during mastoidectomies. This could be a valuable tool to reduce the risk of procedure-associated viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hara, Takuma; Zachariah, Marcus A; Li, Ruichun; Martinez-Perez, Rafael; Carrau, Ricardo L; Prevedello, Daniel M",J Neurosurg,,308

This research was aimed to focus on the antiviral properties of CGA on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in vivo and in vitro for the very first time. The outcome of in vitro experiments validated that, out of five previously reported antiviral components, CGA significantly reduced the relative mRNA expression of IBV-N in CEK cells. At high concentration (400 mg/kg), CGA supplementation reduced IBV-N mRNA expression levels and ameliorated the injury in trachea and lungs. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-12, and NF-&#954;B were considerably turned down, but IL-22 and IL-10 were enhanced in trachea. However, CGA-H treatment had considerably increased the expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TLR7, MyD88, IRF7, IFN-ß and IFN-&#945; both in trachea and lungs. Moreover, CGA-H notably induced the CD3+, CD3+ CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ proliferation and significantly increased the IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in the serum. In conclusion, these results showed that at high concentration CGA is a strong anti-IBV compound that can effectively regulate the innate immunity through MDA5, TLR7 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways and have the potential to induce the cell mediated and humoral immune response in IBV infected chickens.","Abaidullah, Muhammad; Peng, Shuwei; Song, Xu; Zou, Yuanfeng; Li, Lixia; Jia, Renyong; Yin, Zhongqiong",Int Immunopharmacol,,308

335777,Stretching and break-up of saliva filaments during speech: A route for pathogen aerosolization and its potential mitigation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Forecasting methods rely on trends and averages of prior observations to forecast coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts. COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and are affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts are evaluated based on how well they forecast one-. three-, and seven-days forward when utilizing one-, three-, seven-, or all-prior days' cumulative case counts during early onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. METHODS: One-, three-, and seven-days forecasts are created at the county, health district, and state levels using: (1) a naïve approach; (2) Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW); (3) growth rate (Growth); (4) moving average (MA); (5) autoregressive (AR); (6) autoregressive moving average (ARMA); and (7) autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).

Statistically significant results are identified using 95% confidence intervals of Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE) error metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. RESULTS: Next-day MA forecast with three-day lookback obtained the lowest MdAE (0.67, 0.49-0.84, P < .001) and statistically significantly differs from 39 (66.1%) to 53 (89.8%) of alternatives at each geographic level at a significance level of 0.01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperform methods with assumptions of weak- or non-stationarity means. MdAPE results reveal statistically significant differences across geographic levels. CONCLUSIONS: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset: (1) MA is effective for forecasting one-, three-, and seven-days' cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth is not the best representation of case growth during early onset when the public is aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution is a factor in forecasting method selection.

The difference is largely caused by difference in the objectives for MaaS as perceived by the different actors involved. To the manufacturer of automobiles, some may now see or be advised that MaaS can redesign parts of his business model away from selling vehicles to drivers, to selling ?ride-hailing? services to provide links in a MaaS journey, or indeed the whole journey. From an architectural perspective, a typical MaaS paradigm from the perspective of the public transport/transit service provider model, or the independent ?broker? model, the system architectures are similar. Many planners/social engineers are relying on the MaaS Apps to change behaviour, just because the MaaS apps are created. In the short term, so long as Covid-19 remains controlled only by social distancing and sanitisation, the concept of MaaS is on hold. Abstract Background Mandates to social distance and ?shelter in place? during the COVID 19 pandemic necessitated the exploration of new academic content delivery methods. Digital communication platforms (DCP) (e.g., Zoom?) were widely used to facilitate content delivery, yet little is known about DCP?s capacity or effectiveness, especially for simulation. Objective To compare the experience, outcomes, and resources required to implement a simulation-based communication skill curriculum on death notification to a cohort of learners using in-person vs. DCP delivery of the same content. Methods We used the GRIEV_ING mnemonic to train students in death notification techniques either in-person or utilizing a DCP. For all learners, three measures were collected: knowledge, confidence, and performance. Individual learners completed knowledge and confidence assessments pre and post-intervention. All performance assessments were completed by standardized patients (SPs) in real-time. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to identify differences in individual and between-group performances. Results Thirty-four learners participated (N=34), 22 in-person and 12 via DCP. There was a statistically significant improvement in both groups for all three measures: knowledge, confidence, and performance. Between-group comparisons revealed a difference in pre-test confidence but no differences between groups in knowledge or performance. More preparation and prior planning were required to set up the DCP environment than the in-person event. Conclusions The in-person and DCP delivery of death notification training were comparable in their ability to improve individual knowledge, confidence, and performance. Additional preparation time, training, and practice with DCPs may be required for SPs, faculty, and learners less familiar with this technology.","Hughes, Mary Gerstner Brett Bona Anna Falvo Lauren Schroedle Karen Cooper Dylan Sarmiento Elisa Hobgood Cherri Ahmed Rami",Automated Vehicles and MaaS,,308

The disease's course ranges from entirely asymptomatic to severely ill patients. Hypercoagulation is often a complication of this disease, worsening the prognosis, which is extremely important in patients at higher risk of thromboembolic events, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), where thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) is frequent. LAA could be of various sizes, volumes, and shapes, distinguish several morphologies, from which the WindSock LAA is the most frequent. In contrast, thromboembolic complications occur most frequently in patients with AF and the Cactus LAA. We present a clinical case of a 70-year-old woman with an initial negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, suspicion of device-related infection after dual pacemaker implantation, AF, and LAA without thrombus in the initial transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Despite apixaban treatment, spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm, and WindSock LAA morphology, the sludge in LAA was diagnosed in control TEE. The patient did not present any typical clinical COVID-19 symptoms but re-checked the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection was positive. The described case presents echocardiographic evidence of hypercoagulation as the first and only feature of SARS-CoV-2 condition besides the usual morphological presentation of the WindSock LAA.","Swiatczak, M; Nowak, R; Faran, A; Wabich, E; Raczak, G; Klimkiewicz, M; Danilowicz-Szymanowicz, L",Folia morphol.

After failure of mechanical ventilation because of persistant severe hypoxemia treatment was switched to ECMO which was applicated for 24 days. Prognostic parameters indicated a favourable trend after day 14. After discontinuation of ECMO and 11 days of intermittent assisted ventilation via tracheostoma and low dose oxygen (1âl/min), the patient could be transferred to rehabilitation. The last chest radiograph prior to transferral revealed a nearly complete resolution of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

342701,An objective criterion for cluster detection in stochastic epidemic models,2021-03-24,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a meta-analysis of previously published papers on the COVID-19-related clinical features and laboratory findings in children. METHOD: This meta-analysis was conducted by using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences and Google Scholar. Finally, 32 articles were selected for full-text assessment. RESULTS: The most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, and dyspnea. Regarding the combined results of the meta-analysis, fever (46%, 95% CI 40-53%), cough (37%, 95% CI 29-46%), diarrhea (19%, 95% CI 9-28%), and pharyngalgia (13%, 95% CI 5-20%) were the most widely reported symptom. Besides, positive RT-PCR test results (43%, 95% CI 33-53%), low oxygen saturation (38%, 95% CI 25-51%), and elevated D-dimer levels (36%, 95% CI 16-56%) were the most common laboratory findings. CONCLUSION: This review found that clinical presentations were milder, the prognosis was better, and the mortality rate was lower in children with COVID-19 compared with adult patients; however, children are potential carriers, like adults, and can transmit the infection among the population. Therefore, early identification and intervention in pediatric patients with COVID-19 are essential in order to control the pandemic. Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms were more common symptoms among children.","Mansourian, M; Ghandi, Y; Habibi, D; Mehrabi, S",Arch. pediatr,,308

We quantify the reduction in doubling rate, by state, that is associated with this intervention. Using the earlier of K-12 school closures and restaurant closures, by state, to define the start of the intervention, and considering daily confirmed cases through April 23rd, 2020, we find that social distancing is associated with a statistically-significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the doubling rate for all states except for Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, when controlling for false discovery, with the doubling rate averaged across the states falling from 0.302 (0.285, 0.320) days-1 to 0.010 (-0.007, 0.028) days-1. However, we do not find that social distancing has made the spread subcritical. Instead, social distancing has merely stabilized the spread of the disease. We provide an illustration of our findings for each state, including estimates of the effective reproduction number, R, both with and without social distancing. We also discuss the policy implications of our findings.","Wagner, Aaron B; Hill, Elaine L; Ryan, Sean E; Sun, Ziteng; Deng, Grace; Bhadane, Sourbh; Martinez, Victor Hernandez; Wu, Peter; Li, Dongmei; Anand, Ajay; Acharya, Jayadev; Matteson, David S",Stat (Int Stat Inst),,308
342895,Social Volatility and Temporal Foci as Accelerators of Economic Trends (preprint),2021,"India, the second-most populous country in the world is witnessing a daily surge in the COVID-19 infected cases. India is currently among the worst-hit nations worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ranks just behind Brazil and the USA. The prediction of the future course of the pandemic is thus of utmost importance in order to prevent further worsening of the situation. In this paper, we develop models for the past trajectory (March 01, 2020-July 25, 2020) and also make a month-long (July 26, 2020-August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India by using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We determine the most optimal ARIMA model (ARIMA(7,2,2)) based on the statistical parameters viz. root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ). Subsequently, the developed model is used to obtain a one month-long forecast for the cumulative cases, active cases, recoveries, and the number of fatalities. According to our forecasting results, India is likely to have 3800,989 cumulative infected cases, 1634,142 cumulative active cases, 2110,697 cumulative recoveries, and 56,150 cumulative deaths by August 24, 2020, if the current trend of the pandemic continues to prevail. The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month, the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines in order to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.","Ganiny, Suhail; Nisar, Owais",Model Earth Syst Environ,,308
342961,Problems of grain transportation and transshipment through Russian ports in the framework of export trade relations,2020,"Sphingolipid dysregulation is often associated with insulin resistance, while the enzymes controlling sphingolipid metabolism are emerging as therapeutic targets for improving insulin sensitivity. We report herein that sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), a key enzyme in sphingolipid catabolism, plays a critical role in the regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo. Hepatocyte-specific Sphk2 knockout mice exhibit pronounced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Likewise, SphK2-deficient hepatocytes are resistant to insulin-induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-FoxO1 pathway and elevated hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, SphK2 deficiency leads to the accumulation of sphingosine that, in turn, suppresses hepatic insulin signaling by inhibiting PI3K activation in hepatocytes. Either reexpressing functional SphK2 or pharmacologically inhibiting sphingosine production restores insulin sensitivity in SphK2-deficient hepatocytes. In conclusion, the current study provides both experimental findings and mechanistic data showing that SphK2 and sphingosine in the liver are critical regulators of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.","Aji, Gulibositan; Huang, Yu; Ng, Mei Li; Wang, Wei; Lan, Tian; Li, Min; Li, Yufei; Chen, Qi; Li, Rui; Yan, Sishan; Tran, Collin; Burchfield, James G; Couttas, Timothy A; Chen, Jinbiao; Chung, Long Hoa; Liu, Da; Wadham, Carol; Hogg, Philip J; Gao, Xin; Vadas, Mathew A; Gamble, Jennifer R; Don, Anthony S; Xia, Pu; Qi, Yanfei",Proc.

A 69-year-old male was transferred to our hospital for the management of an infra-renal mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm. During his hospital course, the patient contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He was intubated due to respiratory distress. Over a short period, his mycotic aneurysm increased in size from 2.5 cm to 3.9 cm. An emergency repair of his expanding aneurysm was achieved using our previously described protocol of coating endovascular stents with rifampin. The patient was managed with a rifampin-coated endovascular stent graft without any major complications. Postoperatively, the patient did not demonstrate any neurological deficits nor any vascular compromise. He remained afebrile during his postoperative course and was extubated sometime thereafter. He was then transferred to the ward for additional monitoring prior to his discharge to a rehab hospital while being on long-term antibiotics. During his hospital stay, he was monitored with serial ultrasounds to ensure the absence of abscess formation, aortic aneurysm growth or graft endoleak. At 6 weeks after stent graft placement, he underwent a CT scan, which showed a patent stent graft, with a residual sac size of 2.5 cm without any evidence of abscess or endoleak.

While the pulmonary complications of COVID-19 are obvious, the effect of the virus on the other organs and the chronicity of the organ dysfunction remain unknown. The virus causes a debilitating infection with multiorgan injury and has a high mortality rate estimated to be around 3.70%. Several hypotheses are formulated to explain the liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients which include collateral damage from cytokine storm, drug-induced liver injury, viral-induced hepatitis and hypoxia-induced damage. Through this case series, we would like to highlight that liver enzyme abnormalities are often seen in COVID-19 patients and would like to highlight that physicians need to serially monitor biochemical testing until the liver enzymes return to baseline. Physicians also need to be vigilant of liver enzyme abnormalities in these patients, especially before starting new medications.","Kudaravalli, Pujitha; Saleem, Sheikh A; Ibeche, Bashar; John, Savio",Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,308

349090,In Their Own Words: Douglas Futuyma,2020,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated whether pandemic-related stressors, worries, and social distancing have affected the mental health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data came from an online survey of United States pregnant women (n = 715), conducted in May 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, thoughts of self-harm, and moderate or severe anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID-19 experiences with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self-harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID-19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self-harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self-harm. CONCLUSION: High percentages of pregnant women had symptoms of depression or anxiety, suggesting an urgent need to screen and treat mental health conditions among pregnant women during the pandemic. Pandemic-related risks and protective factors are relevant to developing tailored interventions to address the mental health of pregnant women during pandemic circumstances.","Liu, Jihong; Hung, Peiyin; Alberg, Anthony J; Hair, Nicole L; Whitaker, Kara M; Simon, Jessica; Taylor, Sherri K",Birth,,308

351068,Author Reply,2021,"N-glycolyl chondroitin (Gc-CN) is a metabolite of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a sialic acid that is commonly found in mammals, but not humans. Humans can incorporate exogenous Neu5Gc into their tissues from eating red meat. Neu5Gc cannot be biosynthesized by humans due to an evolutionary mutation and has been implicated in causing inflammation causing human diseases, such as cancer. The study Neu5Gc is important in evolutionary biology and the development of potential cancer biomarkers. Unfortunately, there are several limitations to detecting Neu5Gc. The elimination of Neu5Gc involves a degradative pathway leading to the incorporation of N-glycolyl groups into glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as Gc-CN. Gc-CN has been found in humans and in animals including mice, lamb and chimpanzees. Here, we present the biosynthesis of Gc-CN in bacteria by feeding chemically synthesized N-glycolylglucosamine to Escherichia coli. A metabolically engineered strain of E. coli K4, fed with glucose supplemented with GlcNGc, converted it to N-glycolylgalactosamine (GalNGc) that could then be utilized as a substrate in the chondroitin biosynthetic pathway. The final product, Gc-CN was converted to disaccharides using chondroitin lyase ABC and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring detection. This analysis showed the incorporation of GalNGc into the backbone of the chondroitin oligosaccharide.","Awofiranye, Adeola E; Baytas, Sultan N; Xia, Ke; Badri, Abinaya; He, Wenqin; Varki, Ajit; Koffas, Mattheos; Linhardt, Robert J",AMB Express,,308

352487,Hantavirus: The Next Pandemic We Are Waiting For?,2021,"Introduction: Loneliness and low social support can be detrimental to the health of individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) and family care partners. Restrictions on gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 create an even greater risk for social isolation. Memory Cafés are a highly replicated program that provide individuals living with ADRD and care partners an opportunity to socialize in an inclusive and supportive environment without fear of judgment, pressure, or stigma. Following restrictions on in-person gatherings, virtual Memory Cafés offer regular social engagement opportunities in an online format. While the Memory Café model has been replicated globally, their effects on loneliness and perceived social support are generally unknown. Even less is known about their impact when operating in a virtual environment. Methods: Semi-structured interviews in Spanish and English were conducted with individuals living with dementia and family care partners who regularly attend Memory Cafés hosted by partners in a Texas Memory Café Network. Interviews took place online using video conferencing software, were transcribed, then analyzed for common themes using a combined inductive and deductive approach. Results: A total of 17 interviews were conducted with persons living with dementia (n = 5) and family care partners (n = 12) who attend Memory Cafés to learn about their perceived experiences of social connectedness since COVID-19. Care partners included spouses (n = 8) and adult children (n = 4). Interviews included attendees of different Memory Café models, including in-person only (n = 2), virtual only (n = 9), and those who attend both models (n = 6). Five key themes were identified: (1) Reprieve; (2) What is still possible; (3) Connectedness; (4) Inclusivity; and (5) Value added, with ten sub-themes supporting these main themes. Discussion: Findings substantiate evidence that Memory Cafés offer important benefits for families living with dementia, providing vital new insight into the potential for virtual Memory Cafés to offer similar benefits. Findings have implications beyond the context of COVID-19, where virtual models may support the social connectedness of those living in geographically marginalized and underserved areas. Virtual models may not address the needs of all families experiencing dementia due to lack of access to technology and limitations for virtual engagement with those experiencing later stage dementia.","Masoud, Sara S; Meyer, Kylie N; Martin Sweet, Lauryn; Prado, Patricia J; White, Carole L",Front Public Health,,308

METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted from March 5th to April 5th, 2020. To evaluate the workload and mental health of participants NASA-TLX and GHQ-12 online questionnaires were distributed. Data were entered into software SPSS (Version 23) and T-test, ANOVA, Regression methods were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Health workers who encountered COVID- 19 patients, were subjected to more task load compared to those who had no contact with COVID- 19 patients at the workplace (p < 0.001). In terms of the subscale score of NASA-TLX, nurses had more scores in mental pressure, physical pressure, time pressure (temporal), and frustration compared to the other jobs (p < 0.05). Moreover, nurses had significantly more workload compared to the other jobs. CONCLUSIONS: Type of job, the shift of work, educational level, and facing COVID-19 affected the score of NASA-TLX. NASA-TLX scores were higher in nursing compared to the scores of other health staff groups. The results of this study indicate that the scores of NASA-TLX and GHQ-12 among staff who had contact with COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those who did not face COVID-19 patients.

Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.","Xu, Ru; Huang, Jieting; Duan, Chaohui; Liao, Qiao; Shan, Zhengang; Wang, Min; Rong, Xia; Li, Chengyao; Fu, Yongshui; Wang, Hao",J. med. virol,,308

Here we present the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients with active cancer in a nonendemic cancer center at the time of the study. METHODS: All adult patients with an active history of cancer undergoing any elective surgery were screened for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, including fever &#8805; 38 degrees Celsius, chills, dyspnea, cough, sputum production, pharyngitis, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, anosmia, and nasal discharge. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 preoperatively via nasopharyngeal swab within 48 hours of surgery using an RT-PCR assay. Active cancer was defined as receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation within 1 year of the SARS-CoV-2 test. Deidentified, institutional review board-exempt patient data were analyzed with IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26. RESULTS: Between March 16, 2020 and June 30, 2020, a total of 227 patients were tested preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2. Median age was 64.0 years (range 21 to 90). The majority of the cohort were White. Only 2 patients (0.8%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. One 73-year-old woman undergoing hip replacement had Stage IV breast cancer and a 75-year-old man undergoing port placement had Stage IV retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma. Neither patient had symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, underwent hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2, or proceeded to have the scheduled surgery after the positive test results until a 14-day quarantine period and a subsequent negative test result. Both patients subsequently received the procedures they were originally scheduled for with no complications. CONCLUSION: Careful consideration of resource allocation and treatment limitations for cancer patients should occur in lower endemic regions.","Puckett, Yana; Wilke, Lee; Weber, Sharon; Parkes, Amanda; LoConte, Noelle K",WMJ,,308
356097,Scanning acoustic microscopy investigation of weld lines in injection-molded parts manufactured from industrial thermoplastic polymer,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic. Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. METHODS: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 1094 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (298) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (796). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. RESULTS: A larger percentage of decedents overall were male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) compared to the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (82% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Disease surveillance through medical examiners and coroners could supplement other forms of surveillance and may serve as a possible early outbreak warning sign.","Brouwer, Andrew F; Myers, Jeffrey L; Martin, Emily T; Konopka, Kristine E; Lauring, Adam S; Eisenberg, Marisa C; Lephart, Paul R; Nguyen, Teresa; Jaworski, Andrea; Schmidt, Carl J",Clin Infect Dis,,308

Due to this rapid implementation, there is a lack of standardized workflows to assess and treat for various nephrotic conditions, symptoms, treatment modalities and transition processes in the pediatric population. In order to provide a foundation/suggestion for future standardized workflows, the authors of this paper have developed standardized workflows via the Delphi method. These workflows were informed based on results from cross sectional surveys directed to patients and providers. The majority of patients and providers were satisfied, 87% and 71% respectively, with their telemedicine visits. Common issues that were raised with the use of telemedicine included difficulty in procuring physical laboratory results and a lack of personal warmth during telemedicine visits.

358595,A Characteristic Function-based Algorithm for Geodesic Active Contours,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND: The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to mutations during viral replication due to the errors generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contact tracing. METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies variants, and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints. RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and a combination of mutations that appear in only a small number of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of 100 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients and determined their general prevalence when compared to over 70,000 other strains. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.","Lau, Billy T; Pavlichin, Dmitri; Hooker, Anna C; Almeda, Alison; Shin, Giwon; Chen, Jiamin; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, Chun Hong; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Lee, Ho Joon; Ji, Hanlee P",Genome Med,,308

This has necessitated urgent reconfiguration within inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) services to ensure safety of patients and staff and seamless continuity of care provision. AIM: To describe the adaptations made by a large inflammatory bowel disease service, caring for over 3,500 IBD patients, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A diary record of responses to the pandemic were logged, and meeting minutes were reviewed. Data were recorded from IBD advice lines, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting minutes, infusion unit attendances, and electronic referral systems for the 8-week period from 9 March 2020 until 2 May 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: The IBD service at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (IBD Hull) instituted rapid structural and functional changes to the service. Outpatient services were suspended and substituted by virtual consultations, and inpatient services were reduced and moved to ambulatory care where possible. The delivery of biologic and immunomodulatory therapies was significantly modified to ensure patient and staff safety. There was a substantial increase in IBD advice line calls. CONCLUSION: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic required a prompt response, regular reassessment and planning, and continues to do so. We share our experience in of the successful adaptations made to our IBD service.","Gonzalez, Haidee A; Myers, Sally; Whitehead, Emma; Pattinson, Alisson; Stamp, Katie; Turnbull, Jack; Fory, Rebecca; Featherstone, Bethia; Wilkinson, Amy; Lisle, Jessica; Haire, Greg; Henderson, Eileen; Sebastia, Shaji",Clin Med (Lond),,308

Therapeutic agents, including dexamethasone, are mostly transported through the body by binding to serum albumin. Here, the first structure of serum albumin in complex with dexamethasone is reported. Dexamethasone binds to drug site 7, which is also the binding site for commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and testosterone, suggesting potentially problematic binding competition. This study bridges structural findings with an analysis of publicly available clinical data from Wuhan and suggests that an adjustment of the dexamethasone regimen should be further investigated as a strategy for patients affected by two major COVID-19 risk factors: low albumin levels and diabetes.","Shabalin, Ivan G; Czub, Mateusz P; Majorek, Karolina A; Brzezinski, Dariusz; Grabowski, Marek; Cooper, David R; Panasiuk, Mateusz; Chruszcz, Maksymilian; Minor, Wladek",,,308

In this review, we expand the understanding and present an overview of the optimized management of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients. Recent Findings: Transplant recipients are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. The unique characteristics of transplant recipients can make it more difficult to identify COVID-19. Based on the COVID-19 data to date and our experience, we present testing, management, and prevention methods for COVID-19. Comprehensive diagnostic tests should be performed to determine disease severity, phase of illness, and identify other comorbidities in transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19. Outpatients should receive education for preventative measures and optimal health care delivery minimizing potential infectious exposures. Multidisciplinary interventions should be provided to hospitalized transplant recipients for COVID-19 because of the complexity of caring for transplant recipients. Summary: Transplant recipients should strictly adhere to infection prevention measures. Understanding of the transplant specific pathophysiology and development of effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 should be prioritized.","Kim, Min Young; Brennan, Daniel C; Shah, Pali",Curr Transplant Rep,,308
362999,The Economic Imperative: Cities Need Migrants,2021,"Quite a few people in the world have to stay under permanent surveillance for health reasons; they include diabetic people or people with some other chronic conditions, the elderly and the disabled.These groups may face heightened risk of having life-threatening falls or of being struck by a syncope. Due to limited availability of resources a substantial part of people at risk can not receive necessary monitoring and thus are exposed to excessive danger. Nowadays, this problem is usually solved via applying Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods. HAR is a perspective and fast-paced Data Science field, which has a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sport, security etc. However, the currently techniques of recognition are markedly lacking in accuracy, hence, the present paper suggests a highly accurate method for human activity classification. Wepropose a new workflow to address the HAR problem and evaluate it on the UniMiB SHAR dataset, which consists of the accelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform localizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a CNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting that CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to obtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive capacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and vary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, image size, type of mother wavelet, the order of zero moment of mother wavelet etc. Besides, we also apply models with residual blocks which resulted in significantly higher metric values. Finally, we succeed to reach 99.26 % accuracy and it is a worthy performance for this problem.","Nedorubova, Anna; Kadyrova, Alena; Khlyupin, Aleksey",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12666v2.pdf,308

Sixty-six patients with Type 1 hereditary angioedema and 60 healthy controls were included in the study. The laboratory results of the patients in their episode-free periods were similar to those of the healthy controls. The median of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was higher during episodes when compared to normal periods (3.5 versus 2.0, p < .001). A significant positive correlation was present between the episode count and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio calculated during the episodes (r = 0.557, p < .001). We can conclude that the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, which is cheap and easy to calculate, can be used by clinicians as a predictive parameter for prediction of the episode count in patients with hereditary angioedema.","Ozden, Guzin; Yanardag Acik, Didar",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,,308

Current COVID-19 guidelines encourage ambulatory care where possible in this patient cohort. This paper aims to establish the impact of the Clinical Frailty Scale, anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapeutics and season variation on pre-pandemic admissions to help identify patients suitable for ambulatory epistaxis management. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Scottish Regional Health Board PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients attending secondary care with epistaxis between March 2019 and March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Likelihood of epistaxis hospital admission based on Clinical Frailty Scale. RESULTS: 299 epistaxis presentations were identified, of which 122 (40.8%) required admission. Clinical Frailty Scale of &#8805;4 had an increased likelihood of admission (OR 3.15 (95% CI:1.94-5.16), P < .05). In the majority of presentations (66.2%), patients were taking either an antiplatelet or anticoagulant. Of these presentations, the use of an anticoagulant (OR: 2.00 (95% CI: 1.20-3.33), P < .05 and dual antiplatelet (OR: 2.82 (95% CI: 1.02-7.86), P < .05) demonstrated increased likelihood of admission. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that frailty increases the risk of admission in adult patients presenting with epistaxis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) could be utilised in risk stratification to identify suitable patients for outpatient management. Patients with CFS &#8804; 3 could be considered for outpatient management of their epistaxis. It is likely that patients with CFS &#8805;4 on anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet will require admission.","Davies, Timothy; Alatsatianos, Anton; Slim, Mohd Afiq Mohd; Royce, William; Whymark, Andrew",Clin. otolaryngol,,308

During a public health emergency, estimating all cause excess deaths above an expected level of death can provide a more reliable picture of the mortality burden. Here, we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained weekly mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender, and geographic region from 2015 to 2020. We also compiled surveillance data on COVID-19 cases and deaths to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic and assembled weekly series of the proportion of tweets about 'death' from Mexico to assess the correlation between people's media interaction about 'death' and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression models and forecasted the total excess deaths for Mexico for the first 4 weeks of 2021 using the generalized logistic growth model. RESULTS: We estimated the all-cause excess mortality rate associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in 2020 at 26.10 per 10,000 population, which corresponds to 333,538 excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females (18.53). Mexico City reported the highest excess death rate (63.54) and RR (2.09) compared to rest of the country (excess rate = 23.25, RR = 1.62). While COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total excess deaths in Mexico, our forecast estimate that Mexico has accumulated a total of ~ 61,610 [95% PI: 60,003, 63,216] excess deaths in the first 4 weeks of 2021. Proportion of tweets was significantly correlated with the excess mortality (&#961; = 0.508 [95% CI: 0.245, 0.701], p-value = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected Mexico. The lab-confirmed COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total all cause excess deaths (333,538) in Mexico in 2020. This reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of deaths due to other causes during the pandemic. A model-based forecast indicates that an average of 61,610 excess deaths have occurred in January 2021.","Dahal, Sushma; Banda, Juan M; Bento, Ana I; Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",BMC Infect Dis,,308

Study design: Retrospective study including patients under 18 years of age admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antibody testing. We describe the epidemiological and clinical data, laboratory and imaging findings, as well as treatment and outcome in these patients. In light of these findings, patients were classified into two severity groups and then compared. Results: Thirty-nine children were included, with a median age of 9 years (range 12 days-16 years); 23 were boys. Cases with uncomplicated disease course (24) mostly presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever and/or respiratory symptoms without significant alterations in laboratory findings. Of the 15 children with a complicated course, 12 developed shock. In addition to fever, they frequently presented altered appearance, extreme tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and/or conjunctival hyperemia.

We sought to (1) estimate the prevalence of face mask use in northern Vermont and (2) assess the effect of age and sex on the likelihood of face mask use. METHODS: We monitored the entrances to public businesses and visually assessed age, sex, and face mask use. We collected 1004 observations during May 16-30, 2020. We calculated estimates of overall face mask use and odds ratios (ORs) for effects by age and sex. RESULTS: Of 1004 observations, 758 (75.5%) sampled people used a face mask. Our census-weighted estimate was 74.1%. A higher percentage of females than males wore face masks (83.8% vs 67.6%). The odds of face mask use were lower among males than among females (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.73). Face mask use generally decreased with decreasing age: 91.4% among adults aged >60, 70.7% among adults aged 26-60, 74.8% among people aged 15-25, and 53.3% among people aged &#8804;14. The OR of an adult aged >60 wearing a face mask was 14.70 times higher, for young people aged 15-25 was 2.72 times higher, and for adults aged 26-60 was 2.99 times higher than for people aged &#8804;14. Females aged >60 had the highest percentage of face mask use (96.3%) and males aged &#8804;14 had the lowest (43.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Educational efforts promoting the use of face masks should be targeted at males and younger age groups to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Beckage, Brian; Buckley, Thomas E; Beckage, Maegan E",Public Health Rep,,308

Second, the effects of age and gender on parameters were evaluated. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 987 COVID-19 patients were enrolled from SMS Medical College, Jaipur (Rajasthan, India). The survival analysis was carried out from February 29 through May 19, 2020, for two hazards: Hazard 1 was hospital discharge, and Hazard 2 was hospital death. The starting point for survival analysis of the two hazards was considered to be hospital admission. The survival curves were estimated and additional effects of age and gender were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: The Kaplan Meier estimates of lengths of hospital stay (median = 10 days, IQR = 5-15 days) and median survival rate (more than 60 days due to a large amount of censored data) were obtained. The Cox model for Hazard 1 showed no significant effect of age and gender on duration of hospital stay. Similarly, the Cox model 2 showed no significant difference of age and gender on survival rate. The case fatality rate of 8.1%, recovery rate of 78.8%, mortality rate of 0.10 per 100 person-days, and hospital admission rate of 0.35 per 100,000 person-days were estimated. Conclusion: The study estimates hospital bed requirements based on median length of hospital stay and hospital admission rate. Furthermore, the study concludes there are no effects of age and gender on average length of hospital stay and no effects of age and gender on survival time in above-60 age groups.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Tak, Amit; Singhal, Sanjay; Shukla, Jyotsna; Shaktawat, Ajit Singh; Gupta, Jitendra; Patel, Bhoopendra; Kakkar, Shivankan; Dube, Amitabh; Dia, Sunita; Dia, Mahendra; Wehner, Todd C",Front Public Health,,308
373032,Pheromone components affect motivation and induce persistent modulation of associative learning and memory in honey bees,2020,"In this paper, we explore the response of an aggregate measure of subjective wellbeing to the arrival and passage of the COVID-19 pandemic in a small, geographically separate economy in the South Pacific. Studies of national wellbeing and emotional responses to infection rates during a pandemic have been rare thus far. While several disciplines offer theoretical priors in the case of individuals, far less attention has been paid to the wellbeing and emotional response at a national level. Our paper contributes to the literature by applying a time-series approach to the relationship between wellbeing, emotions and the passage of a pandemic. As such we contribute to a wider literature on macro responses to exogenous shocks. Our analysis involves the use of a wellbeing index and emotional time-series derived from Big Data in the form of tweets originating within New Zealand. The index captures the daily evaluative mood of the country several weeks before the first domestic case of COVID-19 was recorded until several weeks of no new COVID-19 cases. We find distinct reactions to the pandemic: a initial fall in national wellbeing generated by a decrease in the emotions ‘joy’, ‘anticipation’ and ‘trust’. Following a rapid and severe lockdown designed to limit domestic transmission of the virus national wellbeing recovered relatively quickly. Gaining insight into the wellbeing (happiness) reponse to pandemics at the national level is important because the average level of happiness within countries is known to be associated with a range of economic, social, health and political outcomes.","Morrison, Philip S.; Rossouw, Stephanié Greyling Talita",Applied Research in Quality of Life,,308

Our oncology service (at an Irish national cancer centre) rapidly transitioned to the use of telemedicine or virtual clinics (VC) to minimise potential risk of exposure to COVID-19 amongst an immunosuppressed, high-risk population. Our study aimed to evaluate the use of VC in this setting. METHODS: An 18-point questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC. Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using SPSS®. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63% response rate). Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n = 58/100, 58%; no answer provided (NAP), n = 4) equally satisfied or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual clinic encounter. The majority of patients felt that there should be a role for VC in the future (n = 84/102, 82%; NAP, n = 2). The majority of patients (n = 61/99, 61%; NAP, n = 5) were very relieved to avoid a hospital visit due to perceived risk of potential exposure to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of oncology patients were satisfied with a VC encounter. VC may have a role in the future of medical care in Ireland post the COVID-19 pandemic.","O039,; Reilly, David; Carroll, Hailey; Lucas, Mairi; Sui, Jane; Al Sendi, Maha; McMahon, David; Darwish, Waseem; McLaughlin, Ronan; Khan, Mohammed Raza; Sullivan, Hazel O; Chew, Sonya; Dennehy, Colum; Kelly, Catherine M; McCaffrey, John; Greally, Megan; Carney, Desmond; Higgins, Michaela J",Ir. j. med. sci,,308

This study aimed to describe genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a patient with longitudinal follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Sequential samples collected between January 29th and February 4th, 2020, from a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 were used to perform amplification of two genome fragments-including genes encoding spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins-and NGS was carried out with Illumina® technology. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PhyML and viral variant identification with VarScan. RESULTS: Majority consensus sequences were identical in most of the samples (5/7) and differed in one synonymous mutation from the Wuhan reference sequence. We identified 233 variants; each sample harboured in median 38 different minority variants, and only four were shared by different samples. The frequency of mutation was similar between genes and correlated with the length of the gene (r = 0.93, p = 0.0002). Most of mutations were substitution variations (n = 217, 93.1%) and about 50% had moderate or high impact on gene expression. Viral variants also differed between lower and upper respiratory tract samples collected on the same day, suggesting independent sites of replication of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time minority viral populations representing up to 1% during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Quasispecies were different from one day to the next, as well as between anatomical sites, suggesting that in vivo this new coronavirus appears as a complex and dynamic distributions of variants.","Jary, Aude; Leducq, Valentin; Malet, Isabelle; Marot, Stéphane; Klement-Frutos, Elise; Teyssou, Elisa; Soulié, Cathia; Abdi, Basma; Wirden, Marc; Pourcher, Valérie; Caumes, Eric; Calvez, Vincent; Burrel, Sonia; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève; Boutolleau, David",Clin Microbiol Infect,,308

The clinical and laboratory data were collected for statistical analysis. The texture features of the Non-focus area of the first chest CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were extracted, and then the classification model of the first chest CT of COVID-19 pneumonia was constructed by using these texture features based on the Auto-ML method of radiomics, The area under curve(AUC), true positive rate(TPR), true negative rate (TNR), positive predictive value(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the first chest CT image classification model in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The TPR, TNR, PPV, NPV and AUC of the training cohort and test cohort of the moderate group and the control group, the severe group and the control group, the moderate group and the severe group were all greater than 95% and 0.95 respectively. The non-focus area of the first CT image of COVID-19 pneumonia has obvious difference in different clinical types. The AUTO-ML classification model of Radiomics based on this difference can be used to predict the clinical types of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Tan, Hui-Bin; Xiong, Fei; Jiang, Yuan-Liang; Huang, Wen-Cai; Wang, Ye; Li, Han-Han; You, Tao; Fu, Ting-Ting; Lu, Ran; Peng, Bi-Wen",Sci Rep,,308

We systematically reviewed efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Studies evaluating remdesivir in adults with hospitalized COVID-19 were searched in several engines until August 21, 2020. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, clinical improvement or recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2296) [two vs. placebo (n = 1299) and two comparing 5-day vs. 10-day regimens (n = 997)], and two case series (n = 88). Studies used intravenous remdesivir 200mg the first day and 100mg for four or nine more days. One RCT (n = 236) was stopped early due to AEs; the other three RCTs reported outcomes between 11 and 15 days. Time to recovery was decreased by 4 days with remdesivir vs. placebo in one RCT (n = 1063), and by 0.8 days with 5-days vs. 10-days of therapy in another RCT (n = 397). Clinical improvement was better for 5-days regimen vs. standard of care in one RCT (n = 600). Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality (RR 0.71, 95%CI 0.39 to 1.28, I2 = 43%) and need for invasive ventilation (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42, I2 = 60%) vs. placebo at 14 days but had fewer SAEs; 5-day decreased need for invasive ventilation and SAEs vs. 10-day in one RCT (n = 397). No differences in all-cause mortality or SAEs were seen among 5-day, 10-day and standard of care. There were some concerns of bias to high risk of bias in RCTs. Heterogeneity between studies could be due to different severities of disease, days of therapy before outcome determination, and how ordinal data was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: There is paucity of adequately powered and fully reported RCTs evaluating effects of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Until stronger evidence emerges, we cannot conclude that remdesivir is efficacious for treating COVID-19.","Piscoya, Alejandro; Ng-Sueng, Luis F; Parra Del Riego, Angela; Cerna-Viacava, Renato; Pasupuleti, Vinay; Roman, Yuani M; Thota, Priyaleela; White, C Michael; Hernandez, Adrian V",PLoS One,,308

Data presented on COVID-19 therapies included trials showcasing the use of monoclonal antibodies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Promising new data were presented on lenacapavir, an investigational HIV capsid inhibitor given as a subcutaneous injection every 6 months. Although encouraging data from settings across the globe reported achievement of 90-90-90 HIV care cascade targets, disparities exist in care engagement and viral suppression, particularly for people of color and young people with HIV. Several interventions were associated with improved care cascade outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted HIV care engagement, but mitigation strategies can allow programs to continue to serve people with HIV during the pandemic. Studies examining the resistance patterns of existing antiretroviral therapy (ART) agents were presented, as were resistance mechanisms of novel agents such as lenacapavir and resistance patterns among individuals who seroconverted while on preexposure prophylaxis. Data from large observational cohorts were presented on patterns of ART uptake and trends in mortality and in virologic failure. Pertinent findings relating to pediatric and maternal health issues included data on dolutegravir-based ART in children and adolescents with HIV;safety and tolerability of dolutegravir-based ART in children and pregnant women;similarly high maternal viral suppression at 50 weeks postpartum in women receiving certain ART regimens;weight gain in pregnant women receiving dolutegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine;and viral suppression with dolutegravir-based ART when started during the third trimester of pregnancy.","Gunaratne, S.

An exploration of ACP uptake in older adults may identify barriers and facilitators. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an integrative review of research on the uptake of ACP in older adults and create a conceptual model of the findings. METHODS: Using Whittemore and Knafl's methodology, we systematically searched four electronic databases of ACP literature in older adults from 1996 through December 2019. Critical appraisal tools were used to assess study quality, and articles were categorized according to level of evidence. Statistical and thematic analysis was then undertaken. RESULTS: Among 1081 studies, 78 met inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis evaluated ACP and variables within the domains of demographics, psychosocial, disability and functioning, and miscellaneous. Thematic analysis identified a central category of enhanced communication, followed by categories of 1) provider role and preparation; 2) patient/family relationship patterns; 3) standardized processes and structured approaches; 4) contextual influences; and 5) missed opportunities. A conceptual model depicted categories and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced communication and ACP facilitators improve uptake of ACP. Clinicians should be cognizant of these factors. This review provides a guide for clinicians who are considering implementation strategies to facilitate ACP in real-world settings.","Frechman, Erica; Dietrich, Mary S; Walden, Rachel Lane; Maxwell, Cathy A",J. pain symptom manage,,308
389228,"New Year, New Administration, New Health Policy Director",2021,"Background: COVID-19 has been shown to induce a hypercoagulable state thereby increasing the risk of arterial thrombosis resulting in Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke (LVOs) Objective: We performed a systematic review of published reports to study the clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with LVO treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and compared them with historical controls. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 2019 to July 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid databases according to the PRISMA meta-analyses and systemic reviews guidelines and then pooled data from individual case series. We included studies where COVID -19 associated LVO cases were treated with MT and their clinical outcomes were reported. We then compared these findings with the historic patient data from the five landmark randomized MT trials, the Hermes collaborators (HC). Results: An initial search generated 12 studies but after excluding case reports and multiple reports comprising of the same series of patients, a total of five reports consisting of 51 patients were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 59 years (IQR 36-75), and 40 (78 %) were men. Median NIHSS on presentation was 20 (IQR 10-29). AIS with LVO was the presenting manifestation of COVID-19 in 16 (20%) of patients. Intracranial ICA was the most common site of occlusion found in 27 (53%) of patients with multi-territory occlusion in 10 (20 %). Final recanalization TICI ≥ 2b was achieved in 33 (64%) of patients but reocclusion was noted in 7 (14 %). Modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-2 was reported in 12 (23 %) of patients with 40 % in-hospital mortality. When compared to historic data from HC, COVID -19 patients were younger (59 vs 69 years), presented with a higher median NIHSS score (20 vs 17), and had a higher prevalence of ICA terminus occlusion (53% vs21% ). Similarly, patient outcomes were poor in the COVID -19 group with mRs 0-2 in (23 % versus46 %) and mortality (40 % vs 15 %) compared to Hermes group. Conclusion: COVID -19 AIS patients with LVO who underwent MT were younger, had multipleterritory occlusions with a propensity for ICA terminus location, and had poor angiographic andclinical outcomes as compared to historic data.","Memon, M.

As of today, therapeutic interventions in severe COVID-19 cases are still not available as no effective therapeutics have been developed so far. Despite the ongoing development of a number of effective vaccines, therapeutics to fight the disease once it has been contracted will still be required. Promising targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the viral RNA genome. The 5'- and 3'-genomic ends of the 30 kb SCoV-2 genome are highly conserved among Betacoronaviruses and contain structured RNA elements involved in the translation and replication of the viral genome. The 40 nucleotides (nt) long highly conserved stem-loop 4 (5_SL4) is located within the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) important for viral replication. 5_SL4 features an extended stem structure disrupted by several pyrimidine mismatches and is capped by a pentaloop.

B-cell epitope identification with the help of an accurate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process, a crucial necessity in the COVID-19 era. Consequently, several B-cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades, but without significant success. In this study, we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear B-cell epitope predictors which are available via a command-line interface, namely, BcePred, BepiPred, ABCpred, COBEpro, SVMTriP, LBtope, and LBEEP. Additionally, we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier, which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output, accelerating the epitope-based vaccine design. While the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets, we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor, for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines, diagnostic kits, immunotherapeutics, immunodiagnostic tests, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.","Galanis, Kosmas A; Nastou, Katerina C; Papandreou, Nikos C; Petichakis, Georgios N; Pigis, Diomidis G; Iconomidou, Vassiliki A",Int. j. mol. sci.

METHODS: Between March and June 2020, all appointments at the practice of a single Andrology-focused academic urologist were conducted by telephone. Consecutive patients were contacted by telephone following their appointment to complete a telephone questionnaire. Baseline demographic information was obtained, and perceptions regarding telephone appointments were assessed using a Likert scale. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients completed the telephone questionnaire. Median age was 48.5 years (interquartile range 37.3-62.8 years) with 55 of 96 (57.3%) of the appointments Andrology-focused. Mean distance of residence from the hospital was 8.4 km (interquartile range 4.7-25.2 km). Only 9 of 96 (9.3%) of the patients felt that the telephone format did not adequately address their needs. However, 26 of 96 (27.1%) of patients said they would prefer an in-person appointment. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, presenting complaint, type of appointment, education level, and employment status, no factors were associated with feeling that the telephone appointment adequately addressed needs or preference for an in-person appointment in the future. CONCLUSION: Patients were generally satisfied with telephone appointments as an alternative to in-person appointments during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Nonetheless, a substantial portion of patients said they would prefer in-person appointments in the future.","Shiff, Benjamin; Frankel, Jed; Oake, Justin; Blachman-Braun, Ruben; Patel, Premal",Urology,,308

391621,Understanding peacefulness through the world news,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant pressure on health and social care. Survivors of COVID-19 may be left with substantial functional deficits requiring ongoing care. We aimed to determine whether pre-admission frailty was associated with increased care needs at discharge for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients were included if aged over 18 years old and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 27 February and 10 June 2020. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess pre-admission frailty status. Admission and discharge care levels were recorded. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and admission CRP as a marker of severity of disease. RESULTS: Thirteen hospitals included patients: 1671 patients were screened, and 840 were excluded including, 521 patients who died before discharge (31.1%). Of the 831 patients who were discharged, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 58-81 years) and 369 (44.4%) were women. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 6-24). Using the CFS, 438 (47.0%) were living with frailty (&#8805; CFS 5), and 193 (23.2%) required an increase in the level of care provided. Multivariable analysis showed that frailty was associated with an increase in care needs compared to patients without frailty (CFS 1-3). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were as follows: CFS 4, 1.99 (0.97-4.11); CFS 5, 3.77 (1.94-7.32); CFS 6, 4.04 (2.09-7.82); CFS 7, 2.16 (1.12-4.20); and CFS 8, 3.19 (1.06-9.56). CONCLUSIONS: Around a quarter of patients admitted with COVID-19 had increased care needs at discharge. Pre-admission frailty was strongly associated with the need for an increased level of care at discharge. Our results have implications for service planning and public health policy as well as a person's functional outcome, suggesting that frailty screening should be utilised for predictive modelling and early individualised discharge planning.","Vilches-Moraga, A; Price, A; Braude, P; Pearce, L; Short, R; Verduri, A; Stechman, M; Collins, J T; Mitchell, E; Einarsson, A G; Moug, S J; Quinn, T J; Stubbs, B; McCarthy, K; Myint, P K; Hewitt, J; Carter, B",BMC Med,,308

In this study, we aimed to investigate how people experience the activities, interactions, and settings of their lives during the pandemic. The sample (N = 604) was assessed in Ireland on the 25 March 2020, following the closure of schools and non-essential businesses. We examined within-person variance in emotional well-being and how people spend their time. We found that while most time was spent in the home (74%), time spent outdoors (8%) was associated with markedly raised positive affect and reduced negative emotions. Exercising, going for walks, gardening, pursuing hobbies, and taking care of children were the activities associated with the greatest affective benefits. Home-schooling children and obtaining information about COVID-19 were ranked lowest of all activities in terms of emotional experience. These findings highlight activities that may play a protective role in relation to well-being during the pandemic, the importance of setting limits for exposure to COVID-19-related media coverage, and the need for greater educational supports to facilitate home-schooling during this challenging period.","Lades, Leonhard K; Laffan, Kate; Daly, Michael; Delaney, Liam",Br J Health Psychol,,308

In the first model, we use a moment-based ambiguity set. In the second model, we use an ambiguity set that incorporates all distributions within a 1-Wasserstein distance from a reference distribution. To solve DMFRS models, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm and derive lower bound and two-families of symmetry-breaking inequalities to strengthen the master problem and speed up convergence. Finally, we present extensive computational experiments comparing the operational and computational performance of the proposed distributionally robust models and a stochastic programming model and drive insights into DMFRS.","Shehadeh, Karmel S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10894v3.pdf,308

It addresses the following problems: dose COVID-19 pneumonia reduced people's demand for green space? Our results showed that despite the restriction of epidemic situation, people still have a great demand for external green space. Older people have less negative sentiment, while younger people (under 18 years) have more negative sentiment. There were significant differences in emotional scores between inside and outside the park. During the period of pneumonia in COVID-19, tourists in Beijing Park generated more positive microblogs inside the park.

The diagnostic value of LUS in the workup of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in the hospital setting is still uncertain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this observational study was to explore correlations of the LUS appearance of COVID-19-related pneumonia with CT findings. METHODS: Twenty-six patients (14 males, age 64 ± 16 years) urgently hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, who underwent chest CT and bedside LUS on the day of admission, were enrolled in this observational study. CT images were reviewed by expert chest radiologists, who calculated a visual CT score based on extension and distribution of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. LUS was performed by clinicians with certified competency in thoracic ultrasonography, blind to CT findings, following a systematic approach recommended by ultrasound guidelines. LUS score was calculated according to presence, distribution, and severity of abnormalities. RESULTS: All participants had CT findings suggestive of bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with an average visual scoring of 43 ± 24%. LUS identified 4 different possible -abnormalities, with bilateral distribution (average LUS score 15 ± 5): focal areas of nonconfluent B lines, diffuse confluent B lines, small subpleural microconsolidations with pleural line irregularities, and large parenchymal consolidations with air bronchograms. LUS score was significantly correlated with CT visual scoring (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) and oxygen saturation in room air (r = -0.66, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: When integrated with clinical data, LUS could represent a valid diagnostic aid in patients with suspect COVID-19 pneumonia, which reflects CT findings.","Nouvenne, Antonio; Zani, Marco Davìd; Milanese, Gianluca; Parise, Alberto; Baciarello, Marco; Bignami, Elena Giovanna; Odone, Anna; Sverzellati, Nicola; Meschi, Tiziana; Ticinesi, Andrea",Respiration,,308

In zebrafish, Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.","Katz, Hilary R; Menelaou, Evdokia; Hale, Melina E",J. comp. neurol,,308

Objective: To evaluate neonatal outcomes in relation to maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in pregnancy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationwide, prospective cohort study based on linkage of the Swedish Pregnancy Register, the Neonatal Quality Register, and the Register for Communicable Diseases. Ninety-two percent of all live births in Sweden between March 11, 2020, and January 31, 2021, were investigated for neonatal outcomes by March 8, 2021. Infants with malformations were excluded. Infants of women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were matched, directly and using propensity scores, on maternal characteristics with up to 4 comparator infants. Exposures: Maternal test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality; neonatal resuscitation; admission for neonatal care; respiratory, circulatory, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and hematologic disorders and their treatments; length of hospital stay; breastfeeding; and infant test positivity for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of 88â¯159 infants (49.0% girls), 2323 (1.6%) were delivered by mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean gestational age of infants of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers was 39.2 (SD, 2.2) weeks vs 39.6 (SD, 1.8) weeks for comparator infants, and the proportions of preterm infants (gestational age <37 weeks) were 205/2323 (8.8%) among infants of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and 4719/85â¯836 (5.5%) among comparator infants. After matching on maternal characteristics, maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was significantly associated with admission for neonatal care (11.7% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.70) and with neonatal morbidities such as respiratory distress syndrome (1.2% vs 0.5%; OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.50-3.84), any neonatal respiratory disorder (2.8% vs 2.0%; OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07-1.90), and hyperbilirubinemia (3.6% vs 2.5%; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.90). Mortality (0.30% vs 0.12%; OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.99-6.57), breastfeeding rates at discharge (94.4% vs 95.1%; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05), and length of stay in neonatal care (median, 6 days in both groups; difference, 0 days; 95% CI, -2 to 7 days) did not differ significantly between the groups. Twenty-one infants (0.90%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the neonatal period; 12 did not have neonatal morbidity, 9 had diagnoses with unclear relation to SARS-CoV-2, and none had congenital pneumonia.

Our objectives were to investigate which classes of obesity are associated with higher in-hospital mortality and to assess the association between obesity and systemic inflammation. This was a retrospective study which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a tertiary center. Three thousand five hundred thirty patients were included in this analysis (female sex: 1579, median age: 65 years). The median body mass index (BMI) was 28.8 kg/m2. In the overall cohort, a J-shaped association between BMI and in-hospital mortality was depicted. In the subgroup of men, BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 and BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2 were found to have significant association with higher in-hospital mortality, while only BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2 was found significant in the subgroup of women. No significant association between BMI and IL-6 was noted. Obesity classes II and III in men and obesity class III in women were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. The male population with severe obesity was the one that mainly drove this association.

The common symptoms include cough usually dry in nature, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath and anosmia. World Health Organization has declared it ‘pandemic’ with a higher mortality rate especially among elderly having weaker immune system. There is no specific treatment for this dreadful infection until now and prevention is the only way to curb the disease. Antiviral drugs like remdesvir, oseltamivir, lopinavir and ritonavir along with antimalarial drugs like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are found to be effective against the novel coronavirus but are still under trial. In any disease outbreak, those who are fit with strong immune system persist otherwise will face grave results. Nature has created a treasury of medicinal herbs which boost the immune system besides having other benefits. In this paper we have proposed a polyherbal formulation, along with a thorough review of its ingredients, with the aim to highlight its potential in prevention and cure of COVID-19.","Iqbal, Arsheed; Quraishi, Haider Ali; Bhat, Shabir Ahmad; Jan, Afroza; Rashid, Adil",Int.

402936,The Coronavirus Outbreak Calls for Cosmopolitan Responses,2020,"PURPOSE: We reviewed the clinical experience of kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in order to understand the impact of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic infection on transplant recipients. Given that early reports from heavily affected areas demonstrated a very high mortality rate amongst kidney transplant recipients, ranging between 30% and 40%, we sought to evaluate outcomes at a center with a high burden of cases but not experiencing acute crisis due to COVID-19. PROCEDURES: In this single center retrospective observational study, medical records of all kidney transplant recipients at the UCLA Medical Center were reviewed for a diagnosis of COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction, followed by chart review to determine kidney transplant characteristics and clinical course. MAIN FINDINGS: A total of 41 kidney transplant recipients were identified with COVID-19 positive polymerase chain reaction. Recipients had been transplanted for a median of 47 months before diagnosis. The large proportion of infected individuals were minorities (Hispanic 65.9%, black 14.6%), on prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (95.1%, 87.8%, and 87.8%, respectively), and had excellent allograft function (median 1.25 mg/dL). The most common presenting symptoms were fever, dyspnea, or cough. Most patients were hospitalized (63.4%); mortality was 9.8% and occurred only in patients in the intensive care unit. The most common treatment was reduction or removal of antimetabolite (77.8%). Approximately 26.9% presented with AKI. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients results in a higher rate of hospitalization and mortality than in the general population. In an area with a high number of infections, the mortality rate was lower compared with earlier reports from areas experiencing early surge and strain on the medical system. Minorities were disproportionately affected. Future studies are needed to determine optimal approach to treatment and management of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection.","Lum, Erik; Bunnapradist, Suphamai; Multani, Ashrit; Beaird, Omer E; Carlson, Margrit; Gaynor, Pryce; Kotton, Camille; Abdalla, Basmah; Danovitch, Gabriel; Kendrick, Elizabeth; Nieves-Borrero, Karid; Pham, Phuong T; Yabu, Julie; Schaenman, Joanna",Transplant Proc,,308

404648,DIC/Sun buys Sensient Imaging,2020,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious life-threatening viral disease that has killed more than three million people worldwide to date. Attempts have been made to identify biomarker(s) to stratify disease severity and improve treatment and resource allocation. Patients with SARS-COV-2 infection manifest with a higher inflammatory response and platelet hyperreactivity; this raises the question of the role of thrombopoiesis in COVID-19 infection. Immature platelet fraction (IPF, %) and immature platelet counts (IPC, ×109 /l) can be used to assess thrombopoiesis. This study investigates whether the level of thrombopoiesis correlates with COVID-19 severity. A large cohort of 678 well-characterized COVID-19 patients was analyzed, including 658 (97%) hospitalized and 139 (21%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Elevated percentage IPF at presentation was predictive of length of hospitalization (P < 0·01) and ICU admission (P < 0·05). Additionally, percentage IPF at the peak was significantly higher among ICU patients than non-ICU patients (6·9 ± 5·1 vs 5·3 ± 8·4, P < 0·01) and among deceased patients than recovered patients (7·9 ± 6·3 vs 5·4 ± 7·8, P < 0·01). Furthermore, IPC at the peak was significantly higher among ICU patients than non-ICU patients (18·5 ± 16·2 vs. 13·2 ± 8·3, P < 0·05) and among patients on a ventilator than those not (22·1 ± 20·1 vs.13·4 ± 8·4, P < 0·05). Our study demonstrated that elevated initial and peak values of percentage IPF and IPC might serve as prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 progression to severe conditions.","Welder, Daniel; Jeon-Slaughter, Haekyung; Ashraf, Bilal; Choi, Sung-Hee; Chen, Weina; Ibrahim, Ibrahim; Bat, Taha",Br J Haematol,,308
404731,Editor's Note,2020,"The COVID-19 epidemic appeared in Poland in early March 2020. Since then, the epidemic has impacted strongly on the socioeconomic nature of the country. Since April 2020, the region with the most confirmed cases is the province of Silesia (Śląskie). This paper has two main aims. First, the authors focus on explanations for the causes of the large number of confirmed cases in this region. The second issue is the mosaic pattern of COVID-19 cases in Śląskie province. The paper explains these patterns with reference to urban shrinkage, trans-industrialism, hard coal mining and polycentricity. The impact of these drivers is clearly visible in the local patterning of the pandemic. The authors point out that this specific relationship in this province complicates regional and local policy and indirectly affects state policy focused on the epidemic as well. The key problem is the negative impact of COVID-19 on hard coal mining. This sector, in turn, is considered by the Polish government as one of the most important from an economic and political point of view.","Krzysztofik, Robert; Kantor-Pietraga, Iwona; Spórna, Tomasz",Eurasian Geogr.

405296,Covid vaccine could be rolled out to children by autumn,2021,"Respiratory rate (RR) is routinely used to monitor patients with infectious, cardiac and respiratory diseases and is a component of early warning scores used to predict patient deterioration. However, it is often measured visually with considerable bias and inaccuracy.Objectives. Firstly, to compare distribution and accuracy of electronically measured RR (EMRR) and visually measured RR (VMRR). Secondly, to determine whether, and how far in advance, continuous electronic RR monitoring can predict oncoming hypoxic and pyrexic episodes in infectious respiratory disease.Approach.A retrospective cohort study analysing the difference between EMRR and VMRR was conducted using patient data from a large tertiary hospital. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether continuous, EMRR measurements could predict oncoming hypoxic (SpO2 < 92%) and pyrexic (temperature >38 °C) episodes.Main results.Data were gathered from 34 COVID-19 patients, from which a total of 3445 observations of VMRR (independent of Hawthorne effect), peripheral oxygen saturation and temperature and 729 117 observations of EMRR were collected. VMRR had peaks in distribution at 18 and 20 breaths per minute. 70.9% of patients would have had a change of treatment during their admission based on the UK's National Early Warning System if EMRR was used in place of VMRR. An elevated EMRR was predictive of hypoxic (hazard ratio: 1.8 (1.05-3.07)) and pyrexic (hazard ratio: 9.7 (3.8-25)) episodes over the following 12 h.Significance.Continuous EMRR values are systematically different to VMRR values, and results suggest it is a better indicator of true RR as it has lower kurtosis, higher variance, a lack of peaks at expected values (18 and 20) and it measures a physiological component of breathing directly (abdominal movement). Results suggest EMRR is a strong marker of oncoming hypoxia and is highly predictive of oncoming pyrexic events in the following 12 h. In many diseases, this could provide an early window to escalate care prior to deterioration, potentially preventing morbidity and mortality.","McCartan, Thomas A; Worrall, Amy P; Conluain, Ruán Ó; Alaya, Fátimah; Mulvey, Christopher; MacHale, Elaine; Brennan, Vincent; Lombard, Lorna; Walsh, Joanne; Murray, Myles; Costello, Richard W; Greene, Garrett",Physiol. meas,,308

Ever since, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swiftly invaded every corner on the planet. By the end of April 2020, almost 3.5 million cases have been reported worldwide, with a death toll of about 250,000 deaths. It is currently well-recognized that patient's immune response plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This inflammatory element was evidenced by its elevated mediators that, in severe cases, reach their peak in a cytokine storm. Together with the reported markers of liver injury, such hyperinflammatory state may trigger significant derangements in hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic machinery, and subsequent modulation of drug clearance that may result in unexpected therapeutic/toxic response. We hypothesize that COVID-19 patients are potentially vulnerable to a significant disease-drug interaction, and therefore, suitable dosing guidelines with therapeutic drug monitoring should be implemented to assure optimal clinical outcomes.","El-Ghiaty, Mahmoud A; Shoieb, Sherif M; El-Kadi, Ayman O S",Med Hypotheses,,308

The field of algorithmic contact tracing, in particular, an area of research that had previously received limited attention, has moved into the spotlight as a crucial factor in containing the pandemic. The use of digital tools to enable more robust and expedited contact tracing and notification, while maintaining privacy and trust in the data generated, is viewed as key to identifying chains of transmission and close contacts, and, consequently, to enabling effective case investigations. Scaling these tools has never been more critical, as global case numbers have exceeded 100 million, as many asymptomatic patients remain undetected, and as COVID-19 variants begin to emerge around the world. In this context, there is increasing attention on blockchain technology as a part of systems for enhanced digital algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. By analyzing the literature that has emerged from this trend, the common characteristics of the designs proposed become apparent. An archetypal system architecture can be derived, taking these characteristics into consideration. However, assessing the utility of this architecture using a recognized evaluation framework shows that the added benefits and features of blockchain technology do not provide significant advantages over conventional centralized systems for algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. From our study, it, therefore, seems that blockchain technology may provide a more significant benefit in other areas of public health beyond contact tracing.","Platt, Moritz Hasselgren Anton Román-Belmonte Juan Manuel Marcela Tuler de Oliveira De la Corte-Rodríguez Hortensia Sílvia Delgado Olabarriaga Rodríguez-Merchán E.

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. METHODS: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs ® 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress ® SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs ® 480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs ® 480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs ® 480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Federman, Daniel G; Gupta, Shaili; Stack, Gary; Campbell, Sheldon M; Peaper, David R; Dembry, Louise M; Fisher, Ann; Tarabar, Asim F; Kozal, Michael; Ruser, Christopher B",PLoS One,,308

The safety of both patients and healthcare workers should be taken into consideration when performing anesthesia management for patients with COVID-19. General anesthesia requiring airway intervention may exacerbate COVID-19 pneumonia, and aerosol generation during airway intervention risks COVID-19 transmission to medical staff. However, regional anesthesia is not an aerosol-generating procedure. The neuraxial anesthesia may have little adverse influence on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 after reviewing previous case reports. Regional anesthesia may have some advantages over general anesthesia for this group of patients, but unplanned conversion to general anesthesia during surgery is not preferred. Thus, careful consideration should be given to ensure that the surgery is performed entirely under regional anesthesia. The use of ultrasound guidance and the performance by an experienced physician may reduce the incidence of failed block and complications. The use of long-acting local anesthetic prolongs the anesthetic effect of regional anesthesia. Besides, a safe and sufficient dose of local anesthetic should be used.","Hotta, Kunihisa",J. anesth,,308
413423,In Reply,2021,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in China and has spread worldwide with a significant rate of infection. Considering the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19, it is suggested that cytokine storms play a critical role in its pathogenesis, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no specific drug for preventing the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by COVID-19. Indeed, interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been highlighted for its many biological functions, such as immune regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism. Therapeutic blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway is expected to reduce the excessive immune reponse observed in COVID-19. Currently, the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab, have been adopted for preventing CRS during the progression of COVID-19, and remarkable beneficial effects were observed by using these humanized monoclonal antibodies. Based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, we reviewed the biological mechanism of IL-6 blockade in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated its clinical applications.","Wang, Yao; Liu, Chen; Miao, Xiaolong; Kong, Deqiang; Zhao, Yingli; Gong, Weihua; Ding, Xianfeng",Eur. cytokine netw,,308

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids, commonly utilized antiinflammatory agents, to treat COVID-19-induced CRS is controversial. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat COVID-19-induced CRS. Here, we discuss the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-induced CRS, compare the CRS in COVID-19 with that in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and summarize the existing therapies for CRS. We propose to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade to manage COVID-19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application.","Liu, Bingwen; Li, Min; Zhou, Zhiguang; Guan, Xuan; Xiang, Yufei",J Autoimmun,,308

414664,After the WHO report: what's next in the search for COVID's origins,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Use of corticosteroids is common in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019, but clinical effectiveness is controversial. We aimed to investigate the association of corticosteroids therapy with clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this single-centre, retrospective cohort study, adult patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and dead or discharged between 29 December 2019 and 15 February 2020 were studied; 1:1 propensity score matchings were performed between patients with or without corticosteroid treatment. A multivariable COX proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between corticosteroid treatment and in-hospital mortality by taking corticosteroids as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: Among 646 patients, the in-hospital death rate was higher in 158 patients with corticosteroid administration (72/158, 45.6% vs. 56/488, 11.5%, p < 0.0001). After propensity score matching analysis, no significant differences were observed in in-hospital death between patients with and without corticosteroid treatment (47/124, 37.9% vs. 47/124, 37.9%, p 1.000). When patients received corticosteroids before they required nasal high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, the in-hospital death rate was lower than that in patients who were not administered corticosteroids (17/86, 19.8% vs. 26/86, 30.2%, log rank p 0.0102), whereas the time from admission to clinical improvement was longer (13 (IQR 10-17) days vs. 10 (IQR 8-13) days; p < 0.001). Using the Cox proportional hazards regression model accounting for time varying exposures in matched pairs, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with mortality difference (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.03, p 0.4694).

We then focus on the deployment of convalescent plasma and neutralizing mAbs for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We review specific clinical questions, including the rationale for stratification of patients, potential biomarkers, known risk factors and temporal considerations for optimal clinical use. To answer these questions, there is a need to understand factors such as the kinetics of viral load and its correlation with clinical outcomes, endogenous antibody responses, pharmacokinetic properties of neutralizing mAbs and the potential benefit of combining antibodies to defend against emerging viral variants.","Taylor, Peter C; Adams, Andrew C; Hufford, Matthew M; de la Torre, Inmaculada; Winthrop, Kevin; Gottlieb, Robert L",Nat. rev. immunol,,308

Applying simple rules, (such as identifying a mechanistic rationale, confirming the ability to reach exposure targets at therapeutic dosage and ensuring tests show drug efficacy in appropriate in vitro and animal models before entering clinical trials) might have saved considerable amounts of time and money, and might have avoided useless research. Moreover, combining these simple rules with the implementation of a relevant policy at both an international and a national level, by limiting studies with a poor methodological/scientific approach and aggregating studies with similar design into single clinical trials, is potentially a far more-efficient strategy.","Lemaitre, Florian; Locher, Clara; Verdier, Marie-Clémence; Naudet, Florian",J. antimicrob. chemother,,308

The models used in the discovery of cancer treatment are continuously changing and extending toward advanced preclinical studies. Cancer models are either naturally existing or artificially prepared experimental systems that show similar features with human tumors though the heterogeneous nature of the tumor is very familiar. The choice of the most fitting model to best reflect the given tumor system is one of the real difficulties for cancer examination. Therefore, vast studies have been conducted on the cancer models for developing a better understanding of cancer invasion, progression, and early detection. These models give an insight into cancer etiology, molecular basis, host tumor interaction, the role of microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity in tumor metastasis. These models are also used to predict novel cancer markers, targeted therapies, and are extremely helpful in drug development. In this review, the potential of cancer models to be used as a platform for drug screening and therapeutic discoveries are highlighted. Although none of the cancer models is regarded as ideal because each is associated with essential caveats that restraint its application yet by bridging the gap between preliminary cancer research and translational medicine. However, they promise a brighter future for cancer treatment.","Sajjad, Humna; Imtiaz, Saiqa; Noor, Tayyaba; Siddiqui, Yusra Hasan; Sajjad, Anila; Zia, Muhammad",Animal Model Exp Med,,308

Spain has been one of the most severely affected countries, and Madrid has reported a high number of cases and deaths. We discuss our strategies for optimal breast cancer management during COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study at Clínico San Carlos Hospital to analyze the management of patients with breast cancer during the pandemic outbreak and the surgical strategy after the pandemic outbreak. We created a practical and dynamic tool based on a ""traffic light"" system for prioritizing surgical time. Every patient was contacted by telephone with a preoperative COVID-19 protocol. After surgical procedures, patient satisfaction was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer in-patient satisfaction with cancer care questionnaire (EORTC IN-PATSAT32). RESULTS: Patients with breast cancer actively treated with surgical procedures were put on a waiting list and received systemic therapy. Telemedicine was used to evaluate any side effects and to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. Surgery was only considered after the pandemic outbreak, and then, only those procedures designed to minimize surgical complications and, therefore, reduce hospital stay. We also measured patients' satisfaction with medical and nursing scales that resulted in a ""very good"" evaluation tending to ""excellent"". CONCLUSION: It is necessary to adapt management of oncology treatment and surgical strategy to optimize resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients' perception of care quality and the degree of patients' satisfaction with health services has potential relevance in the absence of outcome data.","Brenes Sánchez, Juana María; Picado, Amanda López; Olivares Crespo, María Eugenia; García Sáenz, José Ángel; De La Plata Merlo, Rosa María; De La Muela, María Herrera",Clin. breast cancer,,308

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494, and asparagine by valine or threonine at position 501. Substitutions at positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.","Polydorides, Savvas; Archontis, Georgios",Biophys. j,,308

Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust provides 1412 inpatient beds staffed by 1200 junior doctors and faced a large burden of COVID-19 admissions. LOCAL PROBLEM: A survey of doctors revealed only 20% felt confident that they would know to whom they could raise concerns and that most were getting information from a combination of informal work discussions, trust emails, social media and medical literature. METHODS: This quality improvement project was undertaken aligning with Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines. Through an iterative process, a digital network (Imperial Covid cOmmunications Network; ICON) using existing smartphone technologies was developed. Concerns were collated from the junior body and conveyed to the leadership team (vertical-bottom-up using Google Form) and responses were conveyed from leadership to the junior body (vertical-top-down using WhatsApp and Zoom). Quantitative analysis on engagement with the network (members of the group and number of issues raised) and qualitative assessment (thematic analysis on issues) were undertaken. RESULTS: Membership of the ICON WhatsApp group peaked at 780 on 17 May 2020. 197 concerns were recorded via the Google Form system between 20 March and 14 June 2020. There were five overarching themes: organisational and logistics; clinical strategy concerns; staff safety and well-being; clinical (COVID-19) and patient care; and facilities. 94.4% of members agreed ICON was helpful in receiving updates and 88.9% agreed ICON improved collaboration.

426752,Coronavirus: limit short-term economic damage,2020,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases in recent months has strained hospital resources, making rapid and accurate triage of patients presenting to emergency departments a necessity. Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information.","Sriram, Anuroop; Muckley, Matthew; Sinha, Koustuv; Shamout, Farah; Pineau, Joelle; Geras, Krzysztof J.; Azour, Lea; Aphinyanaphongs, Yindalon; Yakubova, Nafissa; Moore, William",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04909v2.pdf,308
429273,Sasol sheds interest in Escravos GTL plant,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral complications related to COVID-19 were recently reported, and the underlying mechanisms of brain damage remain uncertain, probably multifactorial. Among various hypotheses suggested, a possible vasculitis was issued but never confirmed. Herein, we aimed to describe brain MRIs focused on the intracranial vessel wall in a population of COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, 69 consecutive COVID-19 patients with neurologic manifestations underwent a brain MRI allowing the study of the intracranial vessel wall at Strasbourg University hospitals and were retrospectively included. During the same period, 25 consecutive patients, without suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, underwent a brain MRI urgently, with the same imaging protocols. A vasculitis seemed likely when imaging demonstrated vessel wall thickening with homogeneous and concentric enhancement. RESULTS: Among the 69 COVID-19 patients included, 11 (16%) presented arterial vessel wall thickening with homogeneous and concentric enhancement, compatible with cerebral vasculitis. These neuroimaging findings were not found among the 25 patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the difference was statistically significant (pâ¯=â¯0.03). Middle cerebral arteries, basilar artery, and posterior cerebral arteries were the most frequent vessels involved. For nine of them, imaging demonstrated ischemic or hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION: Cerebral vasculitis of medium-sized vessels seems to be one of the mechanisms at the origin of brain damage related to COVID-19.","Lersy, François; Anheim, Mathieu; Willaume, Thibault; Chammas, Agathe; Brisset, Jean-Christophe; Cotton, François; Kremer, Stéphane",J. neuroradiol,,308
430587,Traditional salt-in-water electrolyte vs. water-in-salt electrolyte with binary metal oxide for symmetric supercapacitors: capacitive vs. faradaic,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced public health experts to develop contingent policies to stem the spread of infection, including measures such as partial/complete lockdowns. The effectiveness of these policies has varied with geography, population distribution, and effectiveness in implementation. Consequently, some nations (e.g., Taiwan, Haiti) have been more successful than others (e.g., United States) in curbing the outbreak. A data-driven investigation into effective public health policies of a country would allow public health experts in other nations to decide future courses of action to control the outbreaks of disease and epidemics. We chose Spain and India to present our analysis on regions that were similar in terms of certain factors: (1) population density, (2) unemployment rate, (3) tourism, and (4) quality of living. We posit that citizen ideology obtainable from twitter conversations can provide insights into conformity to policy and suitably reflect on future case predictions. A milestone when the curves show the number of new cases diverging from each other is used to define a time period to extract policy-related tweets while the concepts from a causality network of policy-dependent sub-events are used to generate concept clouds. The number of new cases is predicted using sentiment scores in a regression model. We see that the new case predictions reflects twitter sentiment, meaningfully tied to a trigger sub-event that enables policy-related findings for Spain and India to be effectively compared.

Although many concerns about it have been highlighted, its impact on children and adolescents has scarcely been examined. The purpose of this study was to explore behavioral consequences and coping strategies related to the pandemic among families in Italy, by focusing on developmental ages from the caregivers' perspective, 3 weeks into quarantine. An exploratory cross-sectional online survey was conducted over 14 days. Google Forms was employed to conduct the survey. Demographic variables and pre-existing Psychological Weaknesses (PsW) were asked. Adults' sleep difficulties (SleepScore) and coping strategies during quarantine were assessed. Behavioral changes related to quarantine of both subjects completing the form (COVIDStress) and their children (when present) were questioned. Of the 6,871 respondents, we selected 6,800 valid questionnaires; 3,245 declared children aged under 18 years of age (caregivers). PsWs were recognizable in 64.9% among non-caregivers and in 61.5% of caregivers, with a mean PsW score of 1.42 ± 1.26 and 1.30 ± 1.25 over 3 points, respectively. The 95.5% of the non-caregivers and the 96.5% of caregivers presented behavioral changes with a mean COVIDStress of 3.85 ± 1.82 and 4.09 ± 1.79 over 8, respectively (p<0.001). Sleep difficulties were present in the 61.6% of the non-caregivers and in the 64.4% of the caregivers (p < 0.001), who showed higher SleepScores (2.41 ± 1.26 against 2.57 ± 1.38 points over 6, p < 0.001). COVIDStress (and SleepScore) strongly correlated with PsW (p < 0.001). Caregivers observed behavioral changes in their children in the 64.3% of the <6 years old and in 72.5% of 6-18 years old. Caregivers' discomfort related to quarantine (COVIDStress, SleepScore) was strongly associated to behavioral changes in both age groups of <6 and 6-18 (p < 0.001). Presence of caregivers' coping strategies was less associated to behavioral changes in the <6 sample (p = 0.001) but not in the 6-18 (p = 0.06). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted families in Italy with regard to behavioral changes, especially in high-risk categories with PsWs and caregivers, especially the ones with children aged <6 years. While coping strategies functioned as protective factors, a wide array of stress symptoms had implications for children's and adolescents' behaviors. It is recommended that public children welfare strategies be implemented, especially for higher-psychosocial-risk categories.","Uccella, Sara; De Grandis, Elisa; De Carli, Fabrizio; D039,; Apruzzo, Maria; Siri, Laura; Preiti, Deborah; Di Profio, Sonia; Rebora, Serena; Cimellaro, Paola; Biolcati Rinaldi, Alessandra; Venturino, Cristina; Petralia, Paolo; Ramenghi, Luca Antonio; Nobili, Lino",Front Public Health,,308

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMed's curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV­2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV­2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV­2 in tissue. Currently, RNA detection by RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, extensive validation studies and method harmonization are not available and are absolutely necessary.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,,308

METHODS: Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. RESULTS: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (&#961; = -0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype. CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes.

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. RESULTS: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27 × 10e-4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69 × 10e-4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers.

439028,Science in the time of coronavirus,2020,"Previous empirical social science research on Covid-19 has mainly focused on predicting compliance with behavioural instructions in terms of demographics and socioeconomic determinants. In terms of political variables, trust in government and left-right political orientation has been a major focus of research. One aspect that so far appears to have been ignored is the attitudes of political elites and how they compare with the attitudes of those they represent. Based on a survey of local councillors and members of the public in England in the early phase of the lockdown, we can show that the UK government lockdown measures enjoyed overwhelming support among local elites as well as the general public. However, we can also find sources of lack of support and consensus even at this early stage: While younger and male members of the public, as well as members of the LGBT community, were less enthusiastic about the lockdown, opposition among the public is mainly based on ""populist"" attitudes that became prominent in the Brexit debate such as evaluations of immigration and scepticism about climate change. These sources of dissent could be expected to become more prominent as the pandemic unravels.

439050,Vaccine optimism reduces EM risks,2021,"BackgroundThe Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been suggested as a useful mammalian model for a variety of diseases and infections, including infection with respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The MesAur1.0 genome assembly was published in 2013 using whole-genome shotgun sequencing with short-read sequence data. Current more advanced sequencing technologies and assembly methods now permit the generation of near-complete genome assemblies with higher quality and higher continuity. FindingsHere, we report an improved assembly of the M. auratus genome (BCM_Maur_2.0) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing to produce a chromosome-scale assembly. The total length of the new assembly is 2.46 Gbp, similar to the 2.50 Gbp length of a previous assembly of this genome, MesAur1.0. BCM_Maur_2.0 exhibits significantly improved continuity with a scaffold N50 that is 6.7 times greater than MesAur1.0. Furthermore, 21,616 protein coding genes and 10,459 noncoding genes were annotated in BCM_Maur_2.0 compared to 20,495 protein coding genes and 4,168 noncoding genes in MesAur1.0. This new assembly also improves the unresolved regions as measured by nucleotide ambiguities, where approximately 17.11% of bases in MesAur1.0 were unresolved compared to BCM_Maur_2.0 in which the number of unresolved bases is reduced to 3.00%. ConclusionsAccess to a more complete reference genome with improved accuracy and continuity will facilitate more detailed, comprehensive, and meaningful research results for a wide variety of future studies using Syrian hamsters as models.","Harris, R.

Current process drift detection methods perform well on clean event log data, but the performance can be tremendously affected by noises. A good process drift detection method should be accurate, fast, and robust to noises. In this paper, we propose an offline process drift detection method which identifies each newly observed behaviour as a candidate drift point and checks if the new behaviour can signify significant changes to the original process behaviours. In addition, a bidirectional search method is proposed to accurately locate both the adding and removing of behaviours. The proposed method can accurately detect drift points from event logs and is robust to noises. Both artificial and real-life event logs are used to evaluate our method. Results show that our method can consistently report accurate process drift time while maintaining a reasonably fast detection speed.","Lu, Yang; Chen, Qifan; Poon, Simon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10749v3.pdf,308

The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of masked hypertension in patient with unexplained left ventricle hypertrophy. METHOD: A total of 120 consecutive unexplained left ventricle hypertrophy patients without overt hypertension and diabetes and 121 healthy control subjects were included in the study. After a complete medical history and laboratory examination, patients' height, weight, waist circumference heart rate, and office blood pressure were recorded. All subjects underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and transthoracic echocardiography. RESULTS: Mean age were similar between patients with ULVH and controls. There was no significant difference in total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, left ventricle ejection fraction, between the groups. Prevalence of Masked hypertension was significantly higher in patients with ULVH than controls (28.3% vs 6.6%, p < .001). Left ventricular mass index (141.9 ± 16.8 g/cm2 vs. 67.3 ± 10.3 g/cm2, p < .001) was significantly higher in masked hypertensive patients with ULVH compared to normotensive ULVH and control subjects. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found high prevalence of masked hypertension in ULVH patients. Patients with ULVH should be screened by ABPM to detect possible masked hypertension.","Yilmaz, Ö Çaglar; Özkan, Selçuk",Clin Exp Hypertens,,308

444887,[Basic information of Coronavirus],2020,"We report clinical profile of hundred and nine patients with SARS CoV-2 infection, and whole genome sequences (WGS) of seven virus isolates from the first reported cases in India, with various international travel histories. Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were frequently associated with severity of the disease. WBC and neutrophil counts showed an increase, while lymphocyte counts decreased in patients with severe infection suggesting a possible neutrophil mediated organ damage, while immune activity may be diminished with decrease in lymphocytes leading to disease severity. Increase in SGOT, SGPT and blood urea suggests the functional deficiencies of liver, heart, and kidney in patients who succumbed to the disease when compared to the group of recovered patients. The WGS analysis showed that these isolates were classified into two clades: I/A3i, and A2a (four according to GISAID: O, L, GR, and GH). Further, WGS phylogeny and travel history together indicate possible transmission from Middle East and Europe.

METHODS: 93 patients with COVID-19 were divided into mild and severe groups. The data of lymphocyte subgroups and cytokines were collected, the imaging characteristics were measured, and correlation analysis was performed to analyze the differences. RESULTS: 60 mild and 33 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets decreased in both groups. The reduction percentages of the absolute lymphocytes value in mild and severe groups were 32% and 64%, respectively. The lung CT lesion volume of all patients was 241.45 ± 282.92 cm3, among which the mild group was 151.29 ± 226.04 cm3, and the severe group was 405.38 ± 304.90 cm3, respectively. In critically ill patients, the decrease of the absolute value of CD4+ T cells and the increase of IL-6 levels are significantly correlated with the volume of lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute values of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells are lower in patients with COVID-19, while the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are increased. The severity of lung lesions predicts poor clinical outcomes and may be a predictor of the transition from mild to severe.","He, Susu; Zhou, Chao; Lu, Dongqing; Yang, Haihua; Xu, Hailing; Wu, Guixian; Pan, Weijia; Zhu, Rui; Jia, HaiJian; Tang, Xinni; Chen, Xi; Wu, Xiaomai",Int J Infect Dis,,308

450067,Coronavirus (COVID-19)-Associated Psychological Distress Among Medical Students in Iran,2021,"Since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide. Due to the limited virus strains, few key mutations that would be very important with the evolutionary trends of virus genome were observed in early studies. Here, we downloaded 1809 sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 strains from GISAID before April 2020 to identify mutations and functional alterations caused by these mutations. Totally, we identified 1017 nonsynonymous and 512 synonymous mutations with alignment to reference genome NC_045512, none of which were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. On average, each of the strains could have about 1.75 new mutations each month. The current mutations may have few impacts on antibodies. Although it shows the purifying selection in whole-genome, ORF3a, ORF8 and ORF10 were under positive selection. Only 36 mutations occurred in 1% and more virus strains were further analyzed to reveal linkage disequilibrium (LD) variants and dominant mutations. As a result, we observed five dominant mutations involving three nonsynonymous mutations C28144T, C14408T and A23403G and two synonymous mutations T8782C, and C3037T. These five mutations occurred in almost all strains in April 2020. Besides, we also observed two potential dominant nonsynonymous mutations C1059T and G25563T, which occurred in most of the strains in April 2020. Further functional analysis shows that these mutations decreased protein stability largely, which could lead to a significant reduction of virus virulence. In addition, the A23403G mutation increases the spike-ACE2 interaction and finally leads to the enhancement of its infectivity. All of these proved that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is toward the enhancement of infectivity and reduction of virulence.","Cheng, Liang; Han, Xudong; Zhu, Zijun; Qi, Changlu; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Xue",Brief Bioinform,,308

451339,The birth environment of planetary systems,2020-07-15,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has been disrupting supply chains in an unprecedented fashion, one type of firms that has been particularly affected are small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We focus on these SMEs, specifically on SME suppliers to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and investigate the impact that the pandemic has had on these suppliers, as well as the effectiveness of various government procurement efforts to alleviate the challenges. In doing so, we rely on survey data collected by the National Defense Industry Association (NDIA) during the early stages of the pandemic in March and April 2020 to assess initial government responses and SME supplier receptions. To derive more granular insight, we scrutinize the results across firm size, dependence on the DoD, whether the SME is a first-tier supplier or not, and industry. Through this investigation, we for instance find that the weakest suppliers are the very small SMEs (1–49 employees), and that most government measures were judged to not be that effective—at least in these early stages of the pandemic. Overall, our study leverages insight from one of the few large-scale surveys conducted on the impact of the pandemic on SME suppliers and their relationship with government agencies in the very early phases of the pandemic.","Melnyk, Steven A.; Schoenherr, Tobias Verter Vedat Evans Corbin Shanley Camilla",Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management,,308
452159,It Can Wait,2021,"BACKGROUND: Determination of the comparative efficacy of one therapy over another for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be challenging. Application of a recognized value framework to published studies could objectively compare the potential benefit across available therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An umbrella review of phase III trials for HCC therapies was performed. ASCO Value Framework Net Health Benefit Score version 2 (ASCO-NHB v2) scores, the primary analysis, and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 scores, the secondary analysis, were computed using selected drug registration trials. Both scores were compared between drugs that were Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved by 2020 and those that were not. RESULTS: Of the 22 studies identified, nine were FDA-approved and 13 were not. Across 22 trials, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.2 months (range, 1.9-16.4 months), with a median gain of 0.35 month (range, 2.3-3.3 months). HCC therapies that were FDA-approved showed longer OS (median 10.7 v 7.9 months, P < .01) and higher ASCO NHB scores (+18.4 v -5.7 scores, P < .01). The median gain in OS was 2.2 months in the approved treatments compared with -0.3 months in the unapproved group, with no difference in progression-free survival between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The nine FDA-approved therapies for HCC have higher mean NHB score than those that were not FDA-approved. The application of ASCO-NHB v2 and other proposed value frameworks could examine data of future therapies for HCC through a patient-oriented approach.","Chen, Emerson Y; Cook, Madeline; Deig, Christopher; Arastu, Asad; Prasad, Vinay; Nabavizadeh, Nima; Lopez, Charles D; Kardosh, Adel",JCO Oncol Pract,,308

COVID-19, in its severe form, presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, and multiorgan failure. Thrombotic microangiopathy of the lungs and kidneys has been observed in these patients. Elevated D-dimer levels have been observed in people with serious COVID-19 illness, and this could be helpful in guiding treatment with anticoagulation in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the role of anticoagulation as a treatment modality for COVID-19. METHODS: We present the unique case of a COVID-19 patient who developed sepsis, ARDS, acute kidney injury, and deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), who was deteriorating clinically. She was treated with anticoagulation. RESULTS: There was rapid recovery after treatment with systemic anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic anticoagulation could prove to be essential in the treatment of CO-VID-19. Further studies are required to assess its role in improving long-term morbidity and mortality in these patients.","Mahajan, Pranav; Dass, Bhagwan; Radhakrishnan, Nila; McCullough, Peter A",Cardiorenal Med,,308
453427,41st Annual David W. Smith workshop on malformations and morphogenesis: Abstracts of the 2020 annual meeting,2021,"Prompt and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of COVID-19, including in hospital settings (1-3). In vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.* Antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive. The performance of antigen detection tests, compared with that of NAATs, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Quidel Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) received Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4). The reported test positive percentage agreement§ between this test and an RT-PCR test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% CI = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.¶ However, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing. Data collected during June 30-August 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of RT-PCR in a hospital setting. Among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with RT-PCR. Among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory NAAT testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.","Brihn, Auguste; Chang, Jamie; OYong, Kelsey; Balter, Sharon; Terashita, Dawn; Rubin, Zach; Yeganeh, Nava",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,308

453661,Lockdown texts,2020,"PURPOSE: To investigate inter-subject variability of B1 + , SAR and temperature rise in a database of human models using a local transmit array for 7 T cardiac imaging. METHODS: Dixon images were acquired of 14 subjects and segmented in dielectric models with an eight-channel local transmit array positioned around the torso for cardiac imaging. EM simulations were done to calculate SAR distributions. Based on the SAR distributions, temperature simulations were performed for exposure times of 6 min and 30 min. Peak local SAR and temperature rise levels were calculated for different RF shim settings. A statistical analysis of the resulting peak local SAR and temperature rise levels was performed to arrive at safe power limits. RESULTS: For RF shim vectors with random phase and uniformly distributed power, a safe average power limit of 35.7 W was determined (first level controlled mode). When RF amplitude and phase shimming was performed on the heart, a safe average power limit of 35.0 W was found. According to Pennes' model, our numerical study suggests a very low probability of exceeding the absolute local temperature limit of 40 °C for a total exposure time of 6 min and a peak local SAR of 20 W/kg. For a 30 min exposure time at 20 W/kg, it was shown that the absolute temperature limit can be exceeded in the case where perfusion does not change with temperature. CONCLUSION: Safe power constraints were found for 7 T cardiac imaging with an eight-channel local transmit array, while considering the inter-subject variability of B1 + , SAR and temperature rise.","Steensma, Bart R; Meliadò, Ettore F; Luijten, Peter; Klomp, Dennis W J; van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Raaijmakers, Alexander J E",NMR Biomed,,308

This study evaluated students' experience in the course, the curriculum content and format, and its short-term impact on students' knowledge and attitudes around COVID-19. METHODS: Students responded to discussion board prompts throughout the course and submitted pre-/post-course reflections. Pre-/post-course questionnaires assessed pandemic knowledge and attitudes using 4-point Likert scales. Authors collected aggregate data on enrollment, discussion posts, field placements, and scholarly work resulting from course activities. After the elective, authors conducted a focus group with a convenience sample of 6 participants. Institutional elective evaluation data was included in analysis. Authors analyzed questionnaire data with summary statistics and paired t-tests comparing knowledge and attitudes before and after the elective. Reflection pieces, discussion posts, and focus group data were analyzed using content analysis with a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Twenty-seven students enrolled. Each student posted an average of 2.4 original discussion posts and 3.1 responses. Mean knowledge score increased from 43.8 to 60.8% (p < 0.001) between pre- and post-course questionnaires. Knowledge self-assessment also increased (2.4 vs. 3.5 on Likert scale, p < 0.0001), and students reported increased engagement in the pandemic response (2.7 vs. 3.6, p < 0.0001). Students reported increased fluency in discussing the pandemic and increased appreciation for the field of public health. There was no difference in students' level of anxiety about the pandemic after course participation (3.0 vs. 3.1, p = 0.53). Twelve students (44.4%) completed the institutional evaluation. All rated the course ""very good"" or ""excellent."" Students favorably reviewed the field placements, suggested readings, self-directed research, and learning from peers. They suggested more clearly defined expectations and improved balance between volunteer and educational hours. CONCLUSIONS: The elective was well-received by students, achieved stated objectives, and garnered public attention. Course leadership should monitor students' time commitment closely in service-learning settings to ensure appropriate balance of service and education. Student engagement in a disaster response is insufficient to address anxiety related to the disaster; future course iterations should include a focus on self-care during times of crisis. This educational innovation could serve as a model for medical schools globally.","Altillo, Brandon S A; Gray, Megan; Avashia, Swati B; Norwood, Aliza; Nelson, Elizabeth A; Johnston, Clarissa; Bhavnani, Darlene; Patel, Hemali; Allen, Coburn H; Adeni, Sarayu; Phelps, Nicholas D; Mercer, Tim",BMC Med Educ,,308

To help settling these problems, we adopted a remote-enabled and automated contactless imaging workflow for CT examination by the combination of intelligent guided robot and automatic positioning technology to reduce the potential exposure of radiologists to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and to increase the examination efficiency, patient scanning accuracy and better image quality in chest CT imaging. Methods : From February 10 to April 12, 2020, adult COVID-19 patients underwent chest CT examinations on a CT scanner using the same scan protocol except with the conventional imaging workflow (CW group) or an automatic contactless imaging workflow (AW group) in Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital (China) were retrospectively and prospectively enrolled in this study. The total examination time in two groups was recorded and compared. The patient compliance of breath holding, positioning accuracy, image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and compared between the two groups. Results : Compared with the CW group, the total positioning time of the AW group was reduced ((118.0±20.0) s vs. (129.0±29.0) s, P=0.001), the proportion of scanning accuracy was higher (98% vs. 93%), and the lung length had a significant difference ((0.90±1.24) cm vs. (1.16±1.49) cm, P=0.009). For the lesions located in the pulmonary centrilobular and subpleural regions, the image noise in the AW group was significantly lower than that in the CW group (centrilobular region: (140.4 ±78.6) HU vs. (153.8±72.7) HU, P=0.028;subpleural region: (140.6±80.8) HU vs. (159.4 ±82.7) HU, P=0.010).

463273,Plasticity of haemoglobin concentration and thermoregulation in a mountain lizard,2020,"After the initial outbreak in China, the diffusion in Italy of SARS-CoV-2 is exhibiting a clear regional trend with more elevated frequency and severity of cases in Northern areas. Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility.","Fattorini, Daniele; Regoli, Francesco",Environ Pollut,,308

The results of tests for group differences and regression analyses demonstrate that administrations that were structurally prepared, learned during preceding crises, and that displayed a high quality in their network cooperation with other administrations and with the civil society, on average, performed significantly better in the respective crises.","Schomaker, Rahel M; Bauer, Michael W",PAR.

465277,Artificial Intelligence-Guided De Novo Molecular Design Targeting COVID-19,2021,"AIMS: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with poor outcomes. While several medications are beneficial, achieving optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is challenging. COVID-19 created a need to explore new ways to deliver care. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients were taught to identify fluid congestion and monitor their vital signs using BP monitors and electronic scales with NP-led telephone support. Quantitative data were collected and a patient experience interview was performed. RESULTS: The majority (76%) of the cohort (male, 76%;Maori/Pacific, 58%) had a new diagnosis of HFrEF, with 90% having severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. There were 216 contacts (129 (60%) by telephone), which eliminated travelling, (time saved, 2.12 hours per patient), petrol costs ($58.17 per patient), traffic pollution (607 Kg of CO2) and time off work. Most (75%) received contact within two weeks and 75% were optimally titrated within two months. Improvements in systolic BP (SBP) (124mmHg to 116mmHg), pulse (78 bpm to 70 bpm) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (292 to 65) were identified. Of the 43 patients who had a follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), 33 (77%) showed important improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). CONCLUSIONS: Patients found the process acceptable and experienced rapid titration with less need for clinic review with titration rates comparable with most real-world reports.","McLachlan, A.; Aldridge, C.; Morgan, M.; Lund, M.; Gabriel, R.; Malez, V.",New Zealand Medical Journal,,308

466521,Smoothed inference and graphics via LP modeling,2020-05-26,"We study the role of information and access in capacity-constrained selection problems with fairness concerns. We develop a theoretical framework with testable implications that formalizes the trade-off between the (potentially positive) informational role of a feature and its (negative) exclusionary nature when members of different social groups have unequal access to this feature. Our framework finds a natural application to recent policy debates on dropping standardized testing in college admissions. Our primary takeaway is that the decision to drop a feature (such as test scores) cannot be made without the joint context of the information provided by other features and how the requirement affects the applicant pool composition. Dropping a feature may exacerbate disparities by decreasing the amount of information available for each applicant, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds. However, in the presence of access barriers to a feature, the interaction between the informational environment and the effect of access barriers on the applicant pool size becomes highly complex. In this case, we provide a threshold characterization regarding when removing a feature improves both academic merit and diversity. Finally, using application and transcript data from the University of Texas at Austin, we illustrate that there exist practical settings where dropping standardized testing improves or worsens all metrics.","Garg, Nikhil; Li, Hannah; Monachou, Faidra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04396v4.pdf,308

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of pregnant women consecutively admitted for delivery, and universally tested via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All infants of mothers with COVID-19 underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. SETTING: Three New York City hospitals. POPULATION: Pregnant women >20 weeks of gestation admitted for delivery. METHODS: Data were stratified by SARS-CoV-2 result and symptomatic status, and were summarised using parametric and nonparametric tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and outcomes of maternal COVID-19, obstetric outcomes, neonatal SARS-CoV-2, placental pathology. RESULTS: Of 675 women admitted for delivery, 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 78.6% were asymptomatic. We observed differences in sociodemographics and comorbidities among women with symptomatic COVID-10 versus asymptomatic COVID-19 versus no COVID-19. Caesarean delivery rates were 46.7% in symptomatic COVID-19, 45.5% in asymptomatic COVID-19 and 30.9% in women without COVID-19 (P = 0.044). Postpartum complications (fever, hypoxia, readmission) occurred in 12.9% of women with COVID-19 versus 4.5% of women without COVID-19 (P < 0.001). No woman required mechanical ventilation, and no maternal deaths occurred. Among 71 infants tested, none were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Placental pathology demonstrated increased frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion, indicative of thrombi in fetal vessels, in women with COVID-19 versus women without COVID-19 (48.3% versus 11.3%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among pregnant women with COVID-19 at delivery, we observed increased caesarean delivery rates and increased frequency of maternal complications in the postpartum period. Additionally, intraplacental thrombi may have maternal and fetal implications for COVID-19 remote from delivery.

OBJECTIVE: The current paper presented a review of the early literature concerning emerging nursing challenges during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search of the published literature between January and May 2020 was carried out in Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar to identify relevant quantitative and qualitative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two original articles were retrieved, the majority of which were survey studies from China. Synthesis of the evidence resulted in four overarching themes including ""being physically and mentally drained in the face of fear and uncertainty,"" ""shortage of personal protective equipment and usability issues,"" ""psychosomatic disturbances among nurses,"" and ""moderators to mitigate nurses' challenges."" CONCLUSIONS: Providing care for demanding COVID-19 patients, nurses experienced a gruelling situation, during which a significant amount of psychological and physical distress was inflicted to them. However, receiving proper support from their organization and society could improve the condition substantially. Further research is required to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses, especially from Western countries.","Danesh, Mojtaba K; Garosi, Ehsan; Golmohamadpour, Hamedeh",Work,,308

OBJECTIVES: Describing characteristics, consultation demands, patients' needs, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received a palliative care evaluation. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients (aged 18+ years) with COVID-19 admitted to an academic quaternary center and seen by the geriatrics and palliative medicine team from March 1st to May 11th, 2020. Socio-demographics, operational metrics, severity of illness, goals of care-advanced care planning documentation, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-six (17.6%) out of 2138 COVID-19 admissions were seen by the consultation team. Compared with prepandemic situation (September 1st, 2019, to February 29th, 2020), overall new consults (205 vs. 371, P < 0.001) significantly increased, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU; 9.5% vs. 36.9%, P < 0.001). For the COVID-19 population, median age was 78 years (interquartile range, 70-87; range, 36-102); 56% were male. LACE score, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein suggested severe disease and increased risk of mortality. Seventy-five percent of consults were for goals of care-advanced care planning, and 9.6% for symptoms. During the index admission, 7.1% had documented advanced directives, and 69.7% became do not resuscitate. Of all deaths, 55.5% were in the ICU, and 87.2% were aged &#8805;65 years. Underserved minority patients had a disproportionate mortality. Overall consultation mortality (38.3% vs. 70.4%, P < 0.001) and ICU mortality (55.2% vs. 78.1%, P < 0.001) significantly increased compared with those before COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During this pandemic, understanding inpatient specialized palliative care needs and the vulnerable populations driving these causes may encourage health-care agencies and local, state, and federal governments to support the dedicated palliative care workforce.","Lopez, Santiago; Finuf, Kayla D; Marziliano, Allison; Sinvani, Liron; Burns, Edith A",J. pain symptom manage,,308

MethodsUsing 2019 and 2020 provisional death counts from the National Center for Health Statistics and population estimates from the US Census Bureau, we estimate age-standardized death rates by race/ethnicity and attribute changes in mortality to various causes of death. We also examine how patterns of change across racial/ethnic groups vary by age and sex. ResultsCovid-19 death rates in 2020 were highest in the Hispanic community whereas Black individuals had the largest increase in all-cause mortality between 2019 and 2020. Increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and external causes of death accounted for the adverse trend in all-cause mortality within the Black population. Percentage increases in all-cause mortality were similar for men and women and for ages 25-64 and 65+ for Black and White populations, but increases were greatest for working-aged men among the Hispanic population. ConclusionsExamining increases in non-Covid-19 causes of death is essential for fully capturing both the direct and indirect impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic mortality disparities.","Luck, Anneliese N.; Preston, Samuel H.; Elo, Irma T.; Stokes, Andrew C.",,,308

Over the past 12 months, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, has already infected over 160 million (>20% located in United States) and killed more than 3.3 million people around the world (>20% deaths in USA). As we face one of the most challenging times in our recent history, there is an urgent need to identify drug candidates that can attack SARS-CoV-2 on multiple fronts. We have therefore initiated a computational dynamics drug pipeline using molecular modeling, structure simulation, docking and machine learning models to predict the inhibitory activity of several million compounds against two essential SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and their host protein interactors-S/Ace2, Tmprss2, Cathepsins L and K, and Mpro-to prevent binding, membrane fusion and replication of the virus, respectively. All together, we generated an ensemble of structural conformations that increase high-quality docking outcomes to screen over >6 million compounds including all FDA-approved drugs, drugs under clinical trial (>3000) and an additional >30 million selected chemotypes from fragment libraries. Our results yielded an initial set of 350 high-value compounds from both new and FDA-approved compounds that can now be tested experimentally in appropriate biological model systems.

The acuity level in our ICU jumped to an all-time high, with many critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our goal was simple, provide safe patient care, free up precious nursing time, and preserve the personal protective equipment supply. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use a rapid cycle process improvement project to implement a low-intensity monitoring (LIM) protocol in stable, suspected stroke patients, who are deemed at low risk for complications, in the first twenty-four hours following IV thrombolysis. Methods: We utilized the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model to implement this project. Collaboration between physician, nursing, and stroke program leaders occurred during the month of April 2020. Our new process utilized the Optimal Post T-pa Iv Monitoring in Ischemic STroke (OPTIMIST) protocol. We continued to admit our post IV alteplase patients to the ICU, rather than a step-down unit, in order to accommodate the 3:1 patient to nurse ratio, ensure protocol adherence, and maximize patient safety with this high-risk medication. We used change of shift huddles to educate the ICU nursing staff over a two-week period. Stroke program advanced practice nurses were onsite to ensure compliance. Results: Since implementation of the new protocol, two IV alteplase patients have met protocol criteria;both remained stable throughout the twenty-four-hour LIM period. The protocol's nursing ratio changes allowed the other, critically ill patients, to be staffed with traditional ICU ratios. Conclusion: Rapid cycle PI projects can be accomplished during times of extreme challenge, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing staff was able to adapt and even welcomed the change, while maintaining patient safety. Further study is needed to document the ongoing effect of this protocol.","Whaley, M.; Van Vliet, R.; Farrell, L.; Welcom, D.",Stroke,,308

METHODS: HOPE-COVID-19 (NCT04334291) is an international investigator-initiated registry. Patients are eligible when discharged after an in-hospital stay with COVID-19, dead or alive. Here, we analyze the impact of previous and continued in-hospital treatment with RASi in all-cause mortality and the development of in-stay complications. RESULTS: We included 6503 patients, over 18 years, from Spain and Italy with data on their RASi status. Of those, 36.8% were receiving any RASi before admission. RASi patients were older, more frequently male, with more comorbidities and frailer. Their probability of death and ICU admission was higher. However, after adjustment, these differences disappeared. Regarding RASi in-hospital use, those who continued the treatment were younger, with balanced comorbidities but with less severe COVID19. Raw mortality and secondary events were less frequent in RASi. After adjustment, patients receiving RASi still presented significantly better outcomes, with less mortality, ICU admissions, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation or prone, sepsis, SIRS and renal failure (p<0.05 for all). However, we did not find differences regarding the hospital use of RASi and the development of heart failure. CONCLUSION: RASi historic use, at admission, is not related to an adjusted worse prognosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, although it points out a high-risk population. In this setting, the in-hospital prescription of RASi is associated with improved survival and fewer short-term complications.","Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Olier, Iván; Feltes, Gisela; Viana-Llamas, María C; Maroun-Eid, Charbel; Romero, Rodolfo; Fernández-Rozas, Inmaculada; Uribarri, Aitor; Becerra-Muñoz, Victor M; Alfonso-Rodriguez, Emilio; García-Aguado, Marcos; Elola, Javier; Castro-Mejía, Alex; Pepe, Martino; Garcia-Prieto, Juan Fortunato; Gonzalez, Adelina; Ugo, Fabrizio; Cerrato, Enrico; Bondia, Elvira; Raposeiras-Roubin, Sergio; Mendez, Jorge L Jativa; Espejo, Carolina; López-Masjuan, Álvaro; Marin, Francisco; López-Pais, Javier; Abumayyaleh, Mohammad; Corbi-Pascual, Miguel; Liebetrau, Christoph; Ramakrishna, Harish; Estrada, Vicente; Macaya, Carlos; Fernandez-Ortiz, Antonio",Am Heart J,,308

METHODS: In all, 249 patients had elective MRIs postponed from March 23, 2020, to April 24, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these patients, 99 completed a 22-question survey about living arrangement and health care follow-up, effect of imaging postponement, safety of imaging, and factors important for elective imaging. Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's exact, &#967;2 tests, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Statistical significance was set to P &#8804; .05 with Bonferroni correction applied. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of patients felt imaging postponement had no impact or a small impact on health, 68% felt it was fairly or extremely safe to obtain imaging, and 53% thought there was no difference in safety between hospital-based and outpatient locations. Patients who already had imaging performed or rescheduled were more likely to feel it was safe to get an MRI (odds ratio [OR] 3.267, P = .028) and that the hospital setting was safe (OR 3.976, P = .004). Staff friendliness was the most important factor related to an imaging center visit (95% fairly or extremely important). Use of masks by staff was the top infection prevention measure (94% fairly or extremely important). Likelihood of rescheduling imaging decreased if a short waiting time was important (OR = 0.107, P = .030). CONCLUSION: As patients begin to feel that it is safe to obtain imaging examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic, many factors important to their imaging experience can be considered by radiology practices when developing new strategies to conduct elective imaging.","Carotenuto, Giuseppe; Brewer-Hofmann, Amissa; Zech, John R; Sajjad, Sana; Bekheet, Zane N; Jaramillo, Diego; Wong, Tony T",J.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 using epidemiological contact tracing data, and to explore whether there were different incubation periods among different age gr1oups. Methods: We collected contact tracing data in a municipality in Hubei province during the full outbreak period of COVID-19. The exposure periods were inferred from the history of travel in Wuhan and/or history of exposure to confirmed cases. The incubation periods were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models accounting for interval censoring of exposures. Results: The incubation period of COVID-19 follows a Weibull distribution and has a median of 5.8 days with a bootstrap 95% CI: 5.4–6.7 days. Of the symptomatic cases, 95% showed symptoms by 14.3 days (95% CI: 13.0–15.7), and 99% showed symptoms by 18.7 days (95% CI: 16.7–20.9). The incubation periods were not found significantly different between male and female. Elderly cases had significant longer incubation periods than young age cases (HR 1.49 with 95% CI: 1.09–2.05). The median incubation period was estimated at 4.0 days (95% CI: 3.5–4.4) for cases aged under 30, 5.8 days (95% CI: 5.6–6.0) for cases aged between 30 and 59, and 7.7 days (95% CI: 6.9–8.4) for cases aged greater than or equal to 60. Conclusion: The current practice of a 14-day quarantine period in many regions is reason-able for any age. Older people infected with SARS-CoV2 have longer incubation period than that of younger people. Thus, more attention should be paid to asymptomatic elderly people who had a history of exposure.","Dai, Jingyi; Yang, Lin; Zhao, Jun",Risk Manage. Healthc. Policy,,308

In this paper, we build on existing network models for heterogeneous, clustered networks with random link activation/deletion dynamics to put forth realistic mechanisms of social distancing using piecewise constant activation/deletion rates. We find our models are capable of rich qualitative behavior, and offer meaningful insight with relatively few intervention parameters. In particular, we find that the severity of social distancing interventions and when they begin have more impact than how long it takes for the interventions to take full effect.","Corcoran, Carl; Clark, John Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06990v1.pdf,308

Patients were divided into two groups according to the results of both SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and other exams (Group A = pneumonia due to SARS-CoV2 infection vs Group B = no SARS-CoV2 infection and another definite diagnosis). LUS showed an excellent accuracy in predicting the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (area under the ROC curve of 0.92 with a sensibility of 73% and a specificity of 89% a the cut-off of 12.5). LUS score was more impaired in SARS-CoV-2 patients (18.1 ± 6.0 vs 7.6 ± 5.9, p < 0.00001) and it is significantly negatively correlated with PF ratio values (r = - 0.719, p < 0.0001). An intrahospital mortality rate of 46% was found; patients with adverse outcome had significant higher value of LUS, PF, LDH, and APACHE II score. None of these parameters was predictive of mortality. LUS is a useful tool for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for the evaluation of the disease severity, but does not predict mortality. Further studies with repeated evaluations of LUS score are needed to further explore the role of LUS in the assessment of severity in SARS-CoV-2 disease and in the monitoring of the response to treatments.","Bosso, Giorgio; Allegorico, Enrico; Pagano, Antonio; Porta, Giovanni; Serra, Claudia; Minerva, Valentina; Mercurio, Valentina; Russo, Teresa; Altruda, Concetta; Arbo, Paola; De Sio, Chiara; Dello Vicario, Ferdinando; Numis, Fabio Giuliano",Intern. emerg. med,,308
483211,Viral Performance: Contagious Theaters from Modernism to the Digital Age,2021,"BACKGROUND: Based on previous experience there is justifiable concern about suicidal behaviour and news media reporting of it during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study used a systematic search of online news media reports (versions of newspapers, magazine and other digital publications) of suicidal behaviour during India's COVID-19 lockdown and compared it to corresponding dates in 2019. Data was gathered using a uniform search strategy from 56 online news media publications 24 March to 3 May for the years 2019 and 2020 using keywords, suicide, attempted suicide, hangs self and kills self. Demographic variables and methods used for suicide were compared for suicide and attempts between the 2 years using chi-squared tests (&#967;2). RESULTS: There were online news media reports of 369 cases of suicides and attempted suicides during COVID lockdown vs 220 reports in 2019, a 67.7% increase in online news media reports of suicidal behaviour. Compared to 2019, suicides reported during lockdown were significantly older (30 vs 50 years, p < 0.05), men (71.2% vs 58.7%; p < 0.01), married (77.7% vs 49%; p < 0.01) and employed (82.9% vs 59.5%; p < 0.01). During the lockdown, significantly more suicides were by hanging (64.4% vs 42%), while poisoning (8.5% vs 21.5%) and jumping in front of a train (2% vs 9.4%) (p < 0.05) were significantly reduced. Comparison of COVID and non-COVID groups showed that online news media reports of COVID cases of suicide and attempted suicide were significantly more likely to be men (84.7% vs 60.4%; p < 0.01), older (31-50 years 52.9% vs 25.8%; p < 0.01) employed (91.5% vs 64.3%; p < 0.01), had poor mental (40.1% vs 20.8%; p < 0.01) and poor physical health (24.8% vs 7.9%;11.8, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Increase in online news media reports of suicides and attempts during COVID-19 lockdown may indicate an increase in journalists' awareness about suicide or more sensational media reporting or may be a proxy indicator of a real community increase in suicidal behaviour. It is difficult to attribute changes in demographic profile and methods used only to changes in journalists' reporting behaviour and should be further explored. We therefore call upon the Government of India to urgently release national suicide data to help devise a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy to address COVID-19 suicidal behaviour.","Pathare, Soumitra; Vijayakumar, Lakshmi; Fernandes, Tanya Nicole; Shastri, Manisha; Kapoor, Arjun; Pandit, Deepa; Lohumi, Isha; Ray, Somidha; Kulkarni, Arti; Korde, Palak",Int J Ment Health Syst,,308

At our institution, routine COVID-19 testing was implemented from 19th of March on to all pregnant women who were admitted for delivery. The purpose of the study was to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in our obstetric population admitted for delivery. Mathods Between 19th March and May 4th, 184 pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection upon admission. Results Eleven women were positive for SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to a global prevalence of 6.0%. Of these, only two reported symptoms at admission. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection was 4.9%. We report a lower rate of positive cass than other studies. Eighty-two percent of our cases had no symptoms at admission. Conclusions The proportion of asymptomatic infection highlights the importance of universal laboratory screening for all women admitted for delivery as opposed to symptom-based screening.","Figueiredo, Rita; Tavares, Sara; Moucho, Marina; Ramalho, Carla",J Perinat Med,,308

Considerable evidence established that the immuno-endocrine balance could deeply influence the experimental T. cruzi progression inside the host's body. A high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring approach (MRMHR) was used to study the influence of melatonin on adrenal and plasma steroidal hormones profile of T. cruzi infected Wistar rats. Young (5â¯weeks) and middle-aged (18â¯months) male Wistar rats received melatonin (5â¯mg/Kg, orally) during the acute Chagas disease. Corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC), cortisol, cortisone, aldosterone, progesterone and melatonin concentration were evaluated. Interleukin-1 alpha and ß (IL-1&#945; and ß), IL-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) were also analyzed. Our results revealed an increased production of corticosterone, cortisone, cortisol and aldosterone in middle-aged control animals, thus confirming the aging effects on the steroidal hormone profile. Serum melatonin levels were reduced with age and predominantly higher in young and middle-aged infected rats. Melatonin treatment reduced the corticosterone, 11-DHC, cortisol, cortisone, aldosterone and progesterone in response to T. cruzi infection. Decreased IL-1 &#945; and ß concentrations were also found in melatonin treated middle-aged infected animals. Melatonin treated middle-aged control rats displayed reduced concentrations of TGF-ß. Melatonin levels were significantly higher in all middle-aged rats treated animals. Reduced percentages of early and late thymocyte apoptosis was found for young and middle-aged melatonin supplemented rats. Finally, our results show a link between the therapeutic and biological effects of melatonin controlling steroidal hormones pathways as well as inflammatory mediators.","Brazão, Vânia; Santello, Fabricia Helena; Colato, Rafaela Pravato; Duarte, Andressa; Goulart, Amanda; Sampaio, Pedro Alexandre; Nardini, Viviani; Sorgi, Carlos Arterio; Faccioli, Lúcia Helena; do Prado, José Clóvis",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,308

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey of pediatric neurologists across the world affiliated with the International Child Neurology Association, the Chinese Child Neurology Society, the Child Neurology Society, and the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium. Results were analyzed in relation to regional burden of COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: From April 10 to 24, 2020, a sample of 212 respondents from 49 countries indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed many aspects of pediatric epilepsy care, with 91.5% reporting changes to outpatient care, 90.6% with reduced access to electroencephalography (EEG), 37.4% with altered management of infantile spasms, 92.3% with restrictions in ketogenic diet initiation, 93.4% with closed or severely limited epilepsy monitoring units, and 91.3% with canceled or limited epilepsy surgery. Telehealth use had increased, with 24.7% seeing patients exclusively via telehealth. Changes in practice were related both to COVID-19 burden and location. CONCLUSIONS: In response to COVID-19, pediatric epilepsy programs have implemented crisis standards of care that include increased telemedicine, decreased EEG use, changes in treatments of infantile spasms, and cessation of epilepsy surgery. The long-term impact of these abrupt changes merit careful study.","Wirrell, Elaine C; Grinspan, Zachary M; Knupp, Kelly G; Jiang, Yuwu; Hammeed, Biju; Mytinger, John R; Patel, Anup D; Nabbout, Rima; Specchio, Nicola; Cross, J Helen; Shellhaas, Renée A",J Child Neurol,,308

It comprises 500â000 participants. Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System is a centralized microbiology database covering English clinical diagnostics laboratories that provides national surveillance of legally notifiable infections, bacterial isolations and antimicrobial resistance. We previously developed secure, pseudonymized, individual-level linkage of these systems. In this study, we implemented rapid dynamic linkage, which allows us to provide a regular feed of new COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) test results to UKB to facilitate rapid and urgent research into the epidemiological and human genetic risk factors for severe infection in the cohort. Here, we have characterized the first 1352 cases of COVID-19 in UKB participants, of whom 895 met our working definition of severe COVID-19 as inpatients hospitalized on or after 16 March 2020. We found that the incidence of severe COVID-19 among UKB cases was 27.4â% lower than the general population in England, although this difference varied significantly by age and sex. The total number of UKB cases could be estimated as 0.6â% of the publicly announced number of cases in England. We considered how increasing case numbers will affect the power of genome-wide association studies. This new dynamic linkage system has further potential to facilitate the investigation of other infections and the prospective collection of microbiological cultures to create a microbiological biobank (bugbank) for studying the interaction of environment, human and microbial genetics on infection in the UKB cohort.","Armstrong, Jacob; Rudkin, Justine K; Allen, Naomi; Crook, Derrick W; Wilson, Daniel J; Wyllie, David H; O039,; Connell, Anne Marie",Microb. genom,,308

OBJECTIVES: To understand the significance of the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, particularly IgG, using a rapid antibody kit, during the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with different severities. METHODS: Sixty-three serum samples from 18 patients (5 asymptomatic and 13 symptomatic patients) were retrospectively examined using a commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody kit. PCR positivity of patient samples was also examined as a marker of current SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: IgG antibodies were detected in all cases in this study. The IgG detection rates reached 100.0% in samples collected on day 13 or later. IgG seropositivity after an initial negative status was observed in 13 patients (3/5 asymptomatic and 10/13 symptomatic cases). Interestingly, the persistence of both PCR and IgG positivity was detected in seven cases, of which three were asymptomatic. The longest overlap duration of the PCR and IgG positivity was 17 days in asymptomatic status. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG production can be detected in all infected individuals, using a rapid antibody kit, irrespective of clinical status. However, these findings suggest that, in some infected individuals, particularly those with asymptomatic status, the presence of virus-specific IgG antibodies does not imply prompt viral clearance.","Chong, Yong; Ikematsu, Hideyuki; Tani, Naoki; Arimizu, Yoko; Watanabe, Haruka; Fukamachi, Yukako; Yonekawa, Akiko; Iwasaka, Sho; Nishida, Ruriko; Eriguchi, Yoshihiro; Miyake, Noriko; Shimoda, Shinji; Nagasaki, Yoji; Shimono, Nobuyuki; Akashi, Koichi",Influenza other respir. viruses,,308

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.","Kim, G-U; Kim, M-J; Ra, S H; Lee, J; Bae, S; Jung, J; Kim, S-H",Clin Microbiol Infect,,308

497923,The Garden,2020,"As the world went suddenly into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending individuals to their homes and shutting businesses and institutions, the closing of schools posed big problems. The majority of the world's children were out of school, leading to the longest sustained period of school closures in history. We saw educators turning towards responses not aimed at collegial and community-engaged strategies for education in an emergency but at online learning cast as education/business as usual. This study explores the logic driving this global response through analyses of the documents released by three key global education actors: (1) the OECD and its paper A Framework to Guide Education Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020; (2) UNESCO's Global Education Coalition #LearningNeverStops; and (3) the World Bank's Guidance Note on Education Systems' Response to COVID-19; and Guidance Note: Remote Learning and COVID-19. The authors of this article draw on Carol Bacchi's approach to poststructural policy analysis to make visible the key concepts and binaries used within policy texts and to understand the ""technologies of saving"" that were invoked in each policy response, locating the education programmes, activities and actors within knowledge practices in educational reform. This article explores the World Bank, OECD and UNESCO responses using an analysis of knowledge harmonisation and difference among these institutions as well as their location as key norm-setters and governing actors in the field of education. The authors argue that all three responses privilege private-sector providers of digital technology. The consequence of these responses is that technologies of saving have centred on privatised, corporate edu-business and edu-tech aimed at online education delivery, bringing significant risks for the erasure of local knowledges. The authors' study suggests that local policymakers, including community-based and national actors, must be invited into the discussion to envision other possibilities and to name the potential destructiveness embedded in the international organisations' actions.","Shultz, Lynette; Viczko, Melody",Int Rev Educ,,308

499726,[Thermal impact of subsurface urban structures on groundwater temperatures in the city of Basel]./ Thermischer Einfluss urbaner Untergrundstrukturen auf die Grundwassertemperaturen im Kanton Basel-Stadt,2021,"BACKGROUND: It has become clear that healthcare workers are at high risk, and otolaryngology has been theorized to be among the highest risk specialties for COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to detail the international impact of COVID-19 among otolaryngologists, and to identify instructional cases. METHODS: Country representatives of the Young Otolaryngologists - International Federation of Otolaryngologic Societies (YO-IFOS) surveyed otolaryngologists through various channels. Nationwide surveys were distributed in 19 countries. The grey literature and social media channels were searched to identify reported deaths of otolaryngologists from COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 361 otolaryngologists were identified to have had COVID-19, and data for 325 surgeons was available for analysis. The age range was 25 to 84, with half under the age of 44. There were 24 deaths in the study period, with 83% over age 55. Source of infection was likely clinical activity in 175 (54%) cases. Prolonged exposure to a colleague was the source for 37 (11%) surgeons. Six instructional cases were identified where infections occurred during the performance of aerosol-generating operations (tracheostomy, mastoidectomy, epistaxis control, dacryocystorhinostomy and translabyrinthine resection). In three of these cases, multiple operating room attendees were infected, and in two, the surgeon succumbed to complications of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of reported cases within the otolaryngology community appear to stem equally from clinical activity and community spread. Multiple procedures performed by otolaryngologists are aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) and great care should be taken to protect the surgical team before, during, and after these operations.

Resuscitation events present risks to healthcare provider safety and the potential for compromised patient care. Current resuscitation practices and policies for children with suspected/confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 are unknown. DESIGN: Multi-institutional survey regarding inpatient resuscitation practices during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. SETTING: Internet-based survey. SUBJECTS: U.S. PICU representatives (one per institution) involved in resuscitation system planning and oversight. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 130 institutions surveyed, 78 (60%) responded. Forty-eight centers (62%) had admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 26 (33%) reported code team activation for patients with suspected/confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Sixty-seven respondents (86%) implemented changes to inpatient emergency response systems. The most common changes were as follows: limited number of personnel entering patient rooms (75; 96%), limited resident involvement (71; 91%), and new or refined team roles (74; 95%). New or adapted technology is being used for coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitations in 58 centers (74%). Most institutions (57; 73%) are using enhanced personal protective equipment for all coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitation events; 18 (23%) have personal protective equipment policies dependent on the performance of aerosol generating procedures. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, most respondents are intubating earlier during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%), utilizing video laryngoscopy (67; 86%), pausing chest compressions during laryngoscopy (56; 72%), and leaving patients connected to the ventilator during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%). Responses were varied regarding airway personnel, prone cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ventilation strategy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation without an airway in place, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Most institutions (46; 59%) do not have policies regarding limitations of resuscitation efforts in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most U.S. pediatric institutions rapidly adapted their resuscitation systems and practices in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Changes were commonly related to team members and roles, personal protective equipment, and airway and breathing management, reflecting attempts to balance quality resuscitation with healthcare provider safety.","Morgan, Ryan W; Kienzle, Martha; Sen, Anita I; Kilbaugh, Todd J; Dewan, Maya; Raymond, Tia T; Himebauch, Adam S; Berg, Robert A; Tegtmeyer, Ken; Nadkarni, Vinay M; Topjian, Alexis A; Sutton, Robert M; Wolfe, Heather A",Pediatr Crit Care Med,,308
501022,Understanding epidemic spread,2020,"At present, there is yet no specific antiviral treatment or immunization against the newly identified human severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV2) that results in a rapidly progressive pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We believe in a crucial need for a clinical strategy to counteract this viral pandemic based on the known pathogenesis throughout the disease course. Evidence suggests that exaggerated patient's inflammatory response and oxidative stress are likely to aggravate the disease pathology. The resulting endothelial dysfunction further induces fibrosis and coagulopathy. These disturbances can generate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can progress into respiratory and circulatory failure. Nicorandil is an anti-anginal vasodilator drug acts by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and opening of the KATP channel. Recently, nicorandil has been recognized to possess multiple protective effects against tissue injury. Here, we address a possible modulatory role of nicorandil against COVID-19 pathogenesis. We hypothesise nicorandil would be an effective form of adjuvant therapy against COVID-19.","Ashour, Hend; Elsayed, Mohamed H; Elmorsy, Soha; Harb, Inas A",Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,,308

501546,Headlines and hashtags: communicating science during an outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: During 2009-2010, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (pH1N1) infections in England occurred in two epidemic waves. Reasons for a reported increase in case-severity during the second wave are unclear. METHODS: We analysed hospital-based surveillance for patients with pH1N1 infections in England during 2009-2010 and linked national data sets to estimate ethnicity, socio-economic status and death within 28 days of admission. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess whether changes in demographic, clinical and management characteristics of patients could explain an increase in ICU admission or death, and accounted for missing values using multiple imputation. RESULTS: During the first wave, 54/960 (6%) hospitalised patients required intensive care and 21/960 (2%) died; during the second wave 143/1420 (10%) required intensive care and 55/1420 (4%) died. In a multivariable model, during the second wave patients were less likely to be from an ethnic minority (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.26-0.42), have an elevated deprivation score (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83), have known comorbidity (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97) or receive antiviral therapy &#8804;2 days before onset (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.92). Increased case-severity during the second wave was not explained by changes in demographic, clinical or management characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring changes in patient characteristics could help target interventions during multiple waves of COVID-19 or a future influenza pandemic. To understand and respond to changes in case-severity, surveillance is needed that includes additional factors such as admission thresholds and seasonal coinfections.","Plumb, Ian D; Harris, Ross; Green, Helen K; Ellis, Joanna; Baisley, Kathy; Pebody, Richard G",Influenza other respir. viruses,,308

METHODS: The clinical data of 278 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 20th to February 10th in 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and critical types. The differences of clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory examination indexes and CT image features of lung in different clinical types were analyzed and compared, and the relationship between clinical and imaging features and clinical types of diseases were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 278 patients with COVID-19, 130 were male (46.8%) and 148 were female (53.2%), of whom 88.8% (247/278) were 20 to 69 years old. 238 (85.6%) patients combined one or more basic diseases. The source of cases was mainly imported cases (n = 201, 72.3%), of whom 89 cases were imported from Wuhan, accounting for 44.3% of all imported cases. With the aggravation of the disease, the male composition ratio, age and the number of basic diseases of patients gradually increased, and the incidences of fever, dry cough, chilly or chills, and fatigue in severe and critical patients were significantly higher than those in the mild and ordinary ones. The white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil counts (NEU) and proportions (NEU%) of the severe and critical patients were higher than those of the mild and ordinary patients [WBC (×109/L): 5.7±3.1, 6.5±2.4 vs. 5.4±1.7, 4.9±1.6; NEU (×109/L): 4.4±3.1, 4.9±2.5 vs. 2.8±1.2, 2.9±1.3; NEU%: 0.72±0.13, 0.73±0.14 vs. 0.51±0.12, 0.59±0.11; all P < 0.01], while the lymphocyte count (LYM) and ratio (LYM%), platelet count (PLT) were lower than those in the mild and ordinary patients [LYM (×109/L): 1.0±0.4, 1.2±0.8 vs. 2.1±0.9, 1.5±0.6; LYM%: 0.21±0.11, 0.20±0.12 vs. 0.40±0.11, 0.32±0.11; PLT (×109/L): 177.1±47.8, 157.7±51.6 vs. 215.3±59.7, 191.8±64.3; all P < 0.05]. The level of albumin (Alb) was the lowest in the critical patients and the level of total bilirubin (TBil) was the highest, which was statistically significant as compared with the mild, ordinary and severe patients [Alb (g/L): 33.0±5.8 vs. 42.8±4.4, 39.6±5.1, 34.4±4.2; TBil (µmol/L): 20.1±12.8 vs. 12.0±8.7, 10.9±6.3, 12.2±8.3; both P < 0.01]. Lactate dehydration (LDH) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the severe and critical patients were significantly higher than those in the mild and ordinary patients [LDH (µmol×s-1×L-1): 5.6±2.2, 5.0±2.9 vs. 2.8±0.9, 3.3±1.2; cTnI (µg/L): 0.010 (0.006, 0.012), 0.010 (0.006, 0.012) vs. 0.005 (0.003, 0.006), 0.005 (0.001, 0.008); both P < 0.05]. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of severe patients were higher than that in the mild, ordinary and critical patients [mg/L: 43.3 (33.2, 72.1) vs. 22.1 (16.2, 25.7), 29.7 (19.8, 43.1), 25.8 (23.0, 36.7), P < 0.01]. The level of procalcitonin (PCT) in the severe and critical patients was higher than that in the mild and ordinary patients [µg/L: 0.17 (0.12, 0.26), 0.13 (0.09, 0.24) vs. 0.06 (0.05, 0.08), 0.05 (0.04, 0.09), P < 0.01]. The typical CT imaging features were as follows: the ordinary type mainly showed the single or multiple ground glass shadows on the chest image; the severe type mainly showed the multiple ground glass shadows, infiltration shadows or solid transformation shadows. Compared with the ordinary patients, the lesions increase, and the scope of the lesion expanded to show double lungs. Critical type was mainly manifested as diffuse consolidation of both lungs with multiple patchy density increase shadows, multiple leafy patchy density increase shadows were seen on each leaf, most of them were ground glass-like density, and some were shown separately lung consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: Men, advanced aged, and combining multiple underlying diseases are high-risk populations of COVID-19, and they should pay close attention to the risk of progressing to severe or critical type. CT imaging features could be used as an important supplement when diagnosing severe and critical COVID-19.","Liu, Changquan; Deng, Xilong; Pan, Yuejun; Ling, Zhoukun; Zhang, Guoming; Wei, Guangying; Peng, Ping; He, Xi; Zhang, Fuchun",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,308

Considering the importance of managing with COVID-19, we aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment, follow-up and behavioral characteristics of chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) patients. Materials and Methods: Patients followed-up in our clinic with diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B or C were screened retrospectively and a total 213 adults included in the study. We performed a telephone survey with patients. Results: The mean age of participants was 49.9±13.4 years. Of the participants, 62% were male. Totally 75 (35.2%) patients disrupted their follow-up visits due to COVID-19 pandemic. The only risk factor for disruption in follow-up was found as anxiety. The vast majority of CVH patients paid attention to prevention measures for COVID-19. Conclusion: We can say that CVH patients’ awareness about COVID-19 and application of control measures were well enough. Continuity of treatment can be provided in patients with chronic illness during crisis period with informing patients in a way not to cause anxiety and efficient implementations in healthcare system.","Sarıcaoğlu, Elif M.; Kayaaslan, Bircan Rahmet Güner",Viral Hepatit Dergisis,,308

The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of overall 28-day mortality at the peak of the Italian outbreak. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of all Covid-19 patients admitted to the main hospital of Bergamo, from February 23 to March, 14, 2020. RESULTS: 508 patients were hospitalized , predominantly male (72.4%), mean age of 66±15 years; 49.2% were older than 70 years. Most of patients presented with severe respiratory failure (median value [IQR] of PaO2/FiO2 233 [149-281]). Mortality rate at 28 days resulted of 33.7% (N=171). 39.0% of patients were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), 9.5% with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and 13.6% with endotracheal intubation. 9.5% were admitted to semi-intensive respiratory care unit, and 18.9% to ICU. Risk factors independently associated with 28-day mortality were advanced age (&#8805;78 years: odds ratio, OR, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.91 [10.67-141.93], p<0.001; 70-77 years: 17.30 [5.40-55.38], p<0.001; 60-69 years: 3.20 [1.00-10.20], p=0.049), PaO2/FiO2 <200 at presentation (3.50 [1.70-7.20], p=0.001), need for CPAP/NIV in the first 24 hours (8.38 [3.63-19.35], p <0.001), and blood urea value at admission (1.01 [1.00-1.02], p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: At the peak of the outbreak, with a probable high infectious dose and viral load, older age, the severity of respiratory failure and renal impairment at presentation, but not comorbidities, are predictors of 28-day mortality in Covid-19.","Novelli, Luca; Raimondi, Federico; Ghirardi, Arianna; Pellegrini, Dario; Capodanno, Davide; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Guagliumi, Giulio; Senni, Michele; Russo, Filippo M; Lorini, Ferdinando L; Rizzi, Marco; Barbui, Tiziano; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Cosentini, Roberto; Grazioli, Lorenzo S; Marchesi, Gianmariano; Sferrazza Papa, Giuseppe F; Cesa, Simonetta; Colledan, Michele; Civiletti, Roberta; Conti, Caterina; Casati, Monica; Ferri, Francesco; Camagni, Stefania; Sessa, Maria; Masciulli, Arianna; Gavazzi, Antonello; Falanga, Anna; Da Pozzo, Luigi F; Buoro, Sabrina; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Ruggenenti, Piero; Callegaro, Annapaola; D039,; 039,; Antiga, Lorenzo; Pasulo, Luisa; Pezzoli, Fabio; Gianatti, Andrea; Parigi, Piercarlo; Farina, Claudio; Bellasi, Antonio; Solidoro, Paolo; Sironi, Sandro; Di Marco, Fabiano; Fagiuoli, Stefano",Panminerva med,,308

506393,"The use of historical sources in a multi-layered methodology for karez research in Turpan, China",2020,"Quarantining close contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 10 to 14 days is a key strategy in reducing transmission. However, quarantine requirements are often unpopular, with low adherence, especially when a large fraction of the population has been vaccinated. Daily contact testing (DCT), in which contacts are required to isolate only if they test positive, is an alternative to quarantine for mitigating the risk of transmission from traced contacts. In this study, we developed an integrated model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and compared the strategies of quarantine and DCT with regard to reduction in transmission and social/economic costs (days of quarantine/self-isolation). Specifically, we compared 10-day quarantine to 7 days of self-testing using rapid lateral flow antigen tests, starting 3 days after exposure to a case. We modelled both incomplete adherence to quarantine and incomplete adherence to DCT. We found that DCT reduces transmission from contacts with similar effectiveness, at much lower social/economic costs, especially for highly vaccinated populations. The findings were robust across a spectrum of scenarios with varying assumptions on the speed of contact tracing, sensitivity of lateral flow antigen tests, adherence to quarantine and uptake of testing. Daily tests would also allow rapid initiation of a new round of tracing from infected contacts.","Ferretti, Luca; Wymant, Chris; Nurtay, Anel; Zhao, Lele; Hinch, Robert; Bonsall, David; Kendall, Michelle; Masel, Joanna; Bell, John; Hopkins, Susan; Kilpatrick, A.

Geospatially distributed diagnostics with minimal uncertainty facilitate efficient point-of-need strategies. OBJECTIVES: To use original mathematics to interpret COVID-19 test metrics; assess Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorizations and Health Canada targets; compare predictive values for multiplex, antigen, polymerase chain reaction kit, point-of-care antibody, and home tests; enhance test performance; and improve decision-making. DESIGN: PubMed/newsprint generated articles documenting prevalence. Mathematica and open access software helped perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize performance by comparing predictive value geometric mean-squared patterns. RESULTS: Tiered sensitivity/specificity comprise: T1) 90%, 95%; T2) 95%, 97.5%; and T3) 100%, &#8805;99%. Tier 1 false negatives exceed true negatives at >90.5% prevalence; false positives exceeded true positives at <5.3% prevalence. High sensitivity/specificity tests reduce false negatives and false positives yielding superior predictive values. Recursive testing improves predictive values. Visual logistics facilitate test comparisons. Antigen test quality falls off as prevalence increases. Multiplex severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2)*Influenza A/B*Respiratory-Syncytial Virus (RSV) testing performs reasonably well compared to Tier 3. Tier 3 performance with a Tier 2 confidence band lower limit will generate excellent performance and reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The overriding principle is select the best combined performance and reliability pattern for the prevalence bracket. Some public health professionals recommend repetitive testing to compensate for low sensitivity. More logically, improved COVID-19 assays with less uncertainty conserve resources. Multiplex differentiation of COVID-19 from Influenza A/B-RSV represents an effective strategy if seasonal flu surges next year.","Kost, Gerald J",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),,308

In line with this assumption, the present study illustrates a comparative, empirical analysis of the role of socioeconomic and demographic dimensions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic grounded on a large set of indicators comparing the background context across a global sample of countries. Results indicate that-in addition to epidemiological factors-basic socioeconomic forces significantly shaped contagions as well as hospitalization and death rates across countries. As a response to the global crisis driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, all-embracing access to healthcare services should be strengthened along with the development of sustainable health systems supported by appropriate resources and skills.

These drugs include fingolimod, colchicine, N4-hydroxycytidine, remdesivir, methylprednisone, oseltamivir, icatibant, perphanizine, viracept, emetine, homoharringtonine, aloxistatin, ribavirin, valrubicin, famotidine, almitrine, amprenavir, hesperidin, biorobin, cromolyn sodium, and antibodies- tocilzumab and sarilumab. Also, we provide a list of 31 drugs that are predicted to function against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, we provide succinct overview of various therapeutic modalities. Among these 53 drugs, based on various clinical trials and literature, remdesivir, nelfinavir, methylpredinosolone, colchicine, famotidine and emetine may be used for COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE: It is of utmost important priority to develop novel therapies for COVID-19. Since the effect of SARS-CoV-2 is so severe, slowing the spread of diseases will help the health care system, especially the number of visits to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of any country. Several clinical trials are in works around the globe. Moreover, NCI developed a recent and robust response to COVID-19 pandemic. One of the NCI's goals is to screen cancer related drugs for identification of new therapies for COVID-19. https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/covid-19-cancer-nci-response?cid=eb_govdel.","Yousefi, Hassan; Mashouri, Ladan; Okpechi, Samuel C; Alahari, Nikhilesh; Alahari, Suresh K",Biochem Pharmacol,,308

509912,What has the BBC ever done for us?,2020,"AIM: To explore oncology health care professionals' perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic response. BACKGROUND: The pandemic has created health care delivery challenges globally and many countries have exhibited low readiness and emergency preparedness. METHODS: A descriptive design using a qualitative approach was employed. Semi-structured interviews, which were completed via telephone, were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants (N = 30) were mostly registered nurses (70%). Three themes emerged: (1) ability to adapt and operationalize disaster planning, training and restructure nursing models (subtheme: reactive vs. proactive approach to emergency preparedness); (2) COVID-19 task forces and professional organisations were critical for valid information surrounding the pandemic; and (3) recommendations for emergency preparedness/planning for future pandemics. CONCLUSION: Oncology organisations adapted during the pandemic, but policies and procedures were perceived as reactive and not proactive. Recommendations for planning for future pandemics included (1) adequate personal protective equipment, (2) developing cancer-specific guidelines/algorithms and (3) telehealth training related to billing/reimbursement. Professional organisations were reliable resources of information during the pandemic, but oncology professionals ultimately trusted employers and administration to distribute information needed for safe patient care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Frontline nurses should hold positions on task forces to develop future emergency preparedness.","Marshall, Victoria K; Chavez, Melody; Mason, Tina M; Martinez-Tyson, Dinorah",J. nurs. manag,,308

In Spain, measures to contain the pandemic are novel, and include the possibility of contracting Nursing and Medical students who might not be ready or willing to treat infected cases. OBJECTIVES: To study Spanish Nursing and Medical students' knowledge about COVID-19 community transmission prevention measures, treating infected patients, and their confidence and willingness to treat cases. To learn their views about the first public health policy measures adopted by the Spain government to contain the pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 237 Spanish Nursing and Medical students. METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed on the knowledge, confidence and willingness to treat, and the suitability of the public health policy measures adopted in Spain. The data were collected through social networks. The results were compared according to their university degree. RESULTS: Knowledge about community prevention was suitable, unlike knowledge about treating infected patients. Students had little confidence in treating cases, but their willingness and moral responsibility were high. Very few significant differences were found in their university degrees. Medical students evaluated the measures taken in Spain more favorably. CONCLUSIONS: Students' knowledge about COVID-19 community prevention measures was adequate, but not about preventive measures when treating patients with COVID-19. They felt little confidence despite being willing to treat infected patients. The sample agreed with the public health measures adopted in Spain.","Mena-Tudela, Desirée; González-Chordá, Víctor M; Andreu-Pejó, Laura; Mouzo-Bellés, Víctor M; Cervera-Gasch, Águeda",Nurse Educ Today,,308

510623,Mechanical properties of HA@Ag/PLA nanocomposite structures prepared by extrusion-based additive manufacturing,2021,": Self-medication with antibiotics is a major contributing factor to antimicrobial resistance. Prior research examining factors associated with antibiotic self-medication has focused on an individual's knowledge about antibiotics, antibiotic usage practices, accessibility to antibiotic medication, and demographic characteristics. The role of psychological distress associated with perceived health risks in explaining antibiotic self-medication is less understood. This study was designed to address this knowledge gap in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. An online survey of 2217 participants was conducted at the height of the initial outbreak and revealed that 19.5% of participants took antibiotics to protect themselves from COVID-19. Multivariate logistic analysis examined the predictors of taking antibiotics for protection against COVID-19. An integrative framework developed from the results illustrates potential pathways and facilitating factors that may contribute to prophylactic self-medication with antibiotics. Specifically, COVID-19 pandemic-induced psychological distress was significantly positively related to self-medication. Preventive use of antibiotics was also facilitated by a lack of understanding about antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotics usage practices, the nature of the patient-doctor relationship, and demographic characteristics. The findings highlight that to combat antimicrobial resistance due to self-medication, interventions need to focus on interrupting entrenched behavioural responses and addressing emotional responses to perceived health risks.","Zhang, Airong; Hobman, Elizabeth V; De Barro, Paul; Young, Asaesja; Carter, David J; Byrne, Mitchell",,,308
510625,Do we support our governments to use strict surveillance methods in the fight against the coronavirus?,2020,"This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Wanqiu; Hao, Fengyi; McIntyre, Roger S; Jiang, Li; Jiang, Xiaojiang; Zhang, Ling; Zhao, Xinling; Zou, Yiran; Hu, Yirong; Luo, Xi; Zhang, Zhisong; Lai, Andre; Ho, Roger; Tran, Bach; Ho, Cyrus; Tam, Wilson",Brain Behav Immun,,308

511288,KRADA: Known-region-aware Domain Alignment for Open World Semantic Segmentation,2021-06-11,"The worldwide healthcare and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for a deeper understanding of investing in the mitigation of epidemic risks. To address this, we built a mathematical model to optimize investments into two types of measures for mitigating the risks of epidemic propagation: prevention/containment measures and treatment/recovery measures. The new model explicitly accounts for the characteristics of networks of individuals, as a critical element of epidemic propagation. Subsequent analysis shows that, to combat an epidemic that can cause significant negative impact, optimal investment in either category increases with a higher level of connectivity and intrinsic loss, but it is limited to a fraction of that total potential loss. However, when a fixed and limited mitigation investment is to be apportioned among the two types of measures, the optimal proportion of investment for prevention and containment increases when the investment limit goes up, and when the network connectivity decreases. Our results are consistent with existing studies and can be used to properly interpret what happened in past pandemics as well as to shed light on future and ongoing events such as COVID-19.","Huang, C Derrick; Baghersad, Milad; Behara, Ravi S; Zobel, Christopher W",Risk anal,,308

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, screening was offered to health-care workers in the Capital Region of Denmark, including medical, nursing, and other students who were associated with hospitals in the region. Screening included point-of-care tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Test results and participant characteristics were recorded.

And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015) The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19","Herat, Manel",Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Open,,308

517946,Edge modes without edge modes,2021-04-20,"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread, thousands of scientists around the globe have changed research direction to understand better how the virus works and to find out how it may be tackled. The number of manuscripts on preprint servers is soaring and peer-reviewed publications using mass spectrometry-based proteomics are beginning to emerge. To facilitate proteomic research on SARS-CoV-2, this report presents deep-scale proteomes (10,000 proteins; >130,000 peptides) of common cell line models, notably Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, and ACE2-A549 that characterize their protein expression profiles including viral entry factors such as ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Using the 9 kDa protein SRP9 and the breast cancer oncogene BRCA1 as examples, we show how the proteome expression data can be used to refine the annotation of protein-coding regions of the African green monkey and the Vero cell line genomes. Monitoring changes of the proteome upon viral infection revealed widespread expression changes including transcriptional regulators, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in innate immunity. Based on a library of 98 stable-isotope labeled synthetic peptides representing 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we developed PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) assays for nano-flow and micro-flow LC-MS/MS. We assessed the merits of these PRM assays using supernatants of virus-infected Vero E6 cells and challenged the assays by analyzing two diagnostic cohorts of 24 (+30) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 28 (+9) negative cases. In light of the results obtained and including recent publications or manuscripts on preprint servers, we critically discuss the merits of mass spectrometry-based proteomics for SARS-CoV-2 research and testing.","Zecha, Jana; Lee, Chien-Yun; Bayer, Florian P; Meng, Chen; Grass, Vincent; Zerweck, Johannes; Schnatbaum, Karsten; Michler, Thomas; Pichlmair, Andreas; Ludwig, Christina; Kuster, Bernhard",Mol. cell. proteomics,,308

The antibody response in infected patients remains largely unknown, and the clinical value of antibody testing has not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (nâ =â 535) collected during hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with disease progress were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM, and IgG were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might be due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion times for Ab, IgM, and then IgG were days 11, 12, and 4, respectively. The presence of antibodies wasâ <40% among patients within 1 week of onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) by day 15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detection significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (Pâ <â .001), even in the early phase of 1 week from onset (Pâ =â .007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (Pâ =â .006). CONCLUSIONS: Antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Fu, Yang; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng",Clin Infect Dis,,308

Face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) can act as barriers that prevent the spread of these viruses. However, IAV and SARS-CoV-2 are stable for hours on various materials, which makes frequent and correct disposal of these PPE important. Metal ions embedded into PPE may inactivate respiratory viruses, but confounding factors such as adsorption of viruses make measuring and optimizing the inactivation characteristics difficult. Here, we used polyamide 6.6 (PA66) fibers containing embedded zinc ions and systematically investigated if these fibers can adsorb and inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and IAV H1N1 when woven into a fabric. We found that our PA66-based fabric decreased the IAV H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 titer by approximately 100-fold. Moreover, we found that the zinc content and the virus inactivating property of the fabric remained stable over 50 standardized washes. Overall, these results provide insights into the development of reusable PPE that offer protection against RNA virus spread.","Gopal, Vikram; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; French, Hollie; Siegers, Jurre Y; Yung, Wai-Shing; Hardwick, Matthew; Te Velthuis, Aartjan J W",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,308

522363,Note from the Editors – March 2021,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has subjected healthcare workers (HCWs) to high risk of infection through direct workplace exposure, coupled with increased workload and psychological stress. This review aims to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and formulate recommendations for future action. METHODS: A systematic review was performed between 31st December 2019 and 17th June 2020 through Ovid Medline and Embase databases (PROSPERO ID CRD42020181204). Studies were included for review if they investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health outcomes of hospital-based HCWs and used validated psychiatric scoring tools. Prevalence of ICD-10 classified psychiatric disorders was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: The initial search returned 436 articles. Forty-four studies were included in final analysis, with a total of 69,499 subjects. Prevalence ranges of six mental health outcomes were identified: depression 13.5%-44.7%; anxiety 12.3%-35.6%; acute stress reaction 5.2%-32.9%; post-traumatic stress disorder 7.4%-37.4%; insomnia 33.8%-36.1%; and occupational burnout 3.1%-43.0%. Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 patients was the most common risk factor identified for all mental health outcomes except occupational burnout. Nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs with low social support and fewer years of working experience reported the worst outcomes. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of HCWs. Frontline staff demonstrate worse mental health outcomes. Hospitals should be staffed to meet service provision requirements and to mitigate the impact onmental health. This can be improved with access to rapid-response psychiatric teams and should be continually monitored throughout the pandemic and beyond its conclusion.","Sanghera, Jaspinder; Pattani, Nikhil; Hashmi, Yousuf; Varley, Kate F; Cheruvu, Manikandar Srinivas; Bradley, Alex; Burke, Joshua R",J Occup Health,,308

This study aimed to explore determinants affecting adherence to protective measures against COVID-19 infection among rural and semi-urban settings of Maharashtra, India. Methods: A cross-sectional telephonic survey among 1,016 adults from randomly selected households was conducted between June 5 and July 16, 2020. The data were explored for knowledge, awareness, practices related to protective measures, and self-risk perception. Socio-demographic and attitudinal correlates of failure to use protective measures against COVID-19 were measured. Results: In the survey, 72% of the participants were men. The mean age was 46 years (SD: 13.8). The main source of information was television (91%); however, information from healthcare providers (65%) and mass media announcements (49%) was trustworthy. Washing hands immediately with soap after returning from outdoors was reported by 95% of the respondents, always using a mask while outdoors by 94%, never attended social gatherings by 91%, always using hand sanitizer while outside by 77%, and 68% of the respondents followed all protective measures. The knowledge score [mean score 20.3 (SD: 2.4) out of 24] was independently associated with the risk of not using protective measures, with each unit increase in knowledge score, the risk of not using protective measures reduced by 16%. No source of income was independently associated with not using protective measures [AOR 1.5 95% CI (1.01–2.3)]. Conclusions: The COVID-19 public health interventions and behavior change communication strategies should be specifically directed towards the low socio-economic populations through trusted sources. The association between knowledge and practices demonstrates the importance of accurate public health communication to optimally follow preventive measures, such as structural interventions to address poverty and employment policies to address the unemployment crisis are required.

In this study, recombinant baculovirus vAcS and vAcME were constructed to express the S protein and the M and E proteins of SARS CoV, respectively. Electron microscope analysis demonstrated the formation of VLPs in vAcME and vAcS coinfected insect cells. Mice immunized four times with VLPs developed high antibody titres against SARS CoV. In addition, VLPs elicited cell-mediated immunity as demonstrated by enhanced interferon-γ and interleukin-4 production. VLPs also conferred protective immunity against the infection of Spike protein pseudotyped murine leukaemia virus. Our findings demonstrate that SARS CoV VLPs are immunogenic and can elicit strong SARS CoV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.

Several nucleoside/nucleotide analogs have shown promising effects against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, their in vivo efficacy is limited. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are often formed as ester prodrugs to improve pharmacokinetics (PK) performance. After entering cells, the prodrugs undergo several enzymatic metabolism steps to form the active metabolite triphosphate nucleoside (TP-Nuc); prodrug activation is therefore associated with the abundance and catalytic activity of the corresponding activating enzymes. Having the activation of nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs occur at the target site of action, such as the lung, is critical for anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Herein, we conducted an absolute quantitative proteomics study to determine the expression of relevant activating enzymes in human organs related to the PK and antiviral efficacy of nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs, including the lung, liver, intestine, and kidney. The protein levels of prodrug-activating enzymes differed significantly among the tissues. Using catalytic activity values reported previously for individual enzymes, we calculated prodrug activation profiles in these tissues. The prodrugs evaluated in this study include nine McGuigan phosphoramidate prodrugs, two cyclic monophosphate prodrugs, two l-valyl ester prodrugs, and one octanoate prodrug. Our analysis showed that most orally administered nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs were primarily activated in the liver, suggesting that parenteral delivery routes such as inhalation and intravenous infusion could be better options when these antiviral prodrugs are used to treat COVID-19. The results also indicated that the l-valyl ester prodrug design can plausibly improve drug bioavailability and enhance effects against SARS-CoV-2 intestinal infections. This study further revealed that an octanoate prodrug could provide a long-acting antiviral effect targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections in the lung. Finally, our molecular docking analysis suggested several prodrug forms of favipiravir and GS-441524 that are likely to exhibit favorable PK features over existing prodrug forms. In sum, this study revealed the activation mechanisms of various nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs relevant to COVID-19 treatment in different organs and shed light on the development of more effective anti-COVID-19 prodrugs.","Li, Jiapeng; Liu, Shuhan; Shi, Jian; Wang, Xinwen; Xue, Yanling; Zhu, Hao-Jie",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855276/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.1c00016,308
600317,Role of Human Polyomaviruses in Respiratory Tract Disease in Young Children,2008-11-11,"A novel clustering method is proposed to classify genes or genomes. This method uses a natural representation of genomic data by binary indicator sequences of each nucleotide (adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)). Afterwards, the discrete Fourier transform is applied to these indicator sequences to calculate spectra of the nucleotides. Mathematical moments are calculated for each of these spectra to create a multidimensional vector in a Euclidean space for each gene or genome sequence. Thus, each gene or genome sequence is realized as a geometric point in the Euclidean space. Finally, pairwise Euclidean distances between these points (i.e. genome sequences) are calculated to cluster the gene or genome sequences. This method is applied to three sets of data. The first is 34 strains of coronavirus genomic data, the second is 118 of the known strains of Human rhinovirus (HRV), and the third is 30 bacteria genomes. The distance matrices are computed based on the three sets, showing the distances from each point to the others. We used the complete linkage clustering algorithm to build phylogenetic trees to indicate how the distances among these sequence correspond to the evolutionary relationship among these sequences. This genome representation provides a powerful and efficient method to classify genomes and is much faster than the widely acknowledged multiple sequence alignment method.","Zhao, Bo; Duan, Victor; Yau, Stephen S.-T.",J Theor Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311001755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21443881/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519311001755; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.03.029,308

MicroRNAs are effector molecules of gene silencing in RNAi, and their modulation can lead to a wide response in cells. Enoxacin was reported as the first and unique small-molecule enhancer of microRNA (SMER) maturation. Herein, the biological activity of enoxacin as SMER is discussed to shed light on its innovative mode of action, its potential in treating different diseases, and the feasibility of using enoxacin as a chemical template for inspiring medicinal chemists.

In chronic cases, it induces malnutrition that severely stunts growth. Bile acid diarrhea (BAD), caused by malabsorption of bile acid (BA), is a rare form of chronic diarrhea seldom observed in pediatric patients. Here, we present a clinical report on a novel case of chronic BAD, with severe stunting in an infant, induced by a homozygous mutation of SLC10A2. METHODS: We performed DNA extraction, whole‐exome sequencing analysis, and mutation analysis of SLC10A2 to obtain genetic data on the patient. We subsequently analyzed the patient's clinical and genetic data. RESULTS: The patient's clinical manifestations were chronic diarrhea with increased BAs in the feces and extreme stunting, which was diagnosed as BAD. A homozygous mutation of SLC10A2 at the c.313T>C (rs201206937) site was detected. CONCLUSION: Our report reveals the youngest case illustrating the characteristics of BAD induced by genetic variant at 313T>C, and the second case entailing a clear association between a SLC10A2 genetic mutation and the onset of BAD. Our findings expand the mutant spectrum of the SLC10A2 gene and contribute to the refinement of the genotype–phenotype mapping of severe stunting induced by pediatric BAD. Moreover, they highlight the value of molecular genetic screening for diagnosing BAD in young patients.","Qie, Di; Zhang, Yulin; Gong, Xue; He, Yunru; Qiao, Lina; Lu, Guoyan; Li, Yifei",Mol Genet Genomic Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/mgg3.1740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192422/,308

603046,A multimodal deep learning-based drug repurposing approach for treatment of COVID-19,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the fourth country in the world to authorize the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, which it rolled out on December 17, 2020 and first targeted at healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assesses vaccine uptake among this group during the first month of its availability. METHODS: A national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs’ information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Of the 1058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not enrolled. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those >40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with uptake were being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95 %CI = 1.363–2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95 %CI = 1.083–2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital (aOR = 1.867, 95 %CI = 1.380–2.525, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40 years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey provides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination campaigns targeting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.","Barry, Mazin; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Aljamaan, Fadi; Saddik, Basema; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Alenezi, Shuliweeh; Alamro, Nurah; Alhuzaimi, Abdullah N; Alhaboob, Ali; Alhasan, Khalid; Alsohime, Fahad; Alaraj, Ali; Halwani, Rabih; Jamal, Amr; Temsah, Omar; Alzamil, Fahad; Somily, Ali; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21011312; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.083; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21011312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481700/,308

The standard IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL), originally designed for transmitting scalar data traffic of IoT applications, should be customized in order to deal with IoMT applications which pose new challenges and requirements in terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) and the user’s Quality of Experience (QoE). For this purpose and thanks to the flexibility and adaptability of RPL, we propose, in this paper, a multipath version of RPL, not defined in the RPL specification RFC 6550, named MP-RPL. MP-RPL leverages the multiparent feature offered by RPL in order to construct multiples end-to-end paths of different qualities based on radio link quality measurements. It is intended to improve the video traffic delivery for IoMT based WMSN applications by simultaneously using the built paths while taking into account the video traffic differentiation as per priority levels. Compared to the traditional single-path RPL, the results obtained from simulations when considering the influence of video characteristics, show that our proposal provides feasible and acceptable QoS and QoE performance metrics for multimedia applications, while maintaining RPL compliance.","Bidai, Zahia",Wirel Pers Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465945/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-08999-8,308

606294,Human vaccine research in the European Union,2009-01-29,"BACKGROUND: The bacteraemia prediction is relevant because sepsis is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacteraemia prognosis primarily depends on a rapid diagnosis. The bacteraemia prediction would shorten up to 6 days the diagnosis, and, in conjunction with individual patient variables, should be considered to start the early administration of personalised antibiotic treatment and medical services, the election of specific diagnostic techniques and the determination of additional treatments, such as surgery, that would prevent subsequent complications. Machine learning techniques could help physicians make these informed decisions by predicting bacteraemia using the data already available in electronic hospital records. OBJECTIVE: This study presents the application of machine learning techniques to these records to predict the blood culture’s outcome, which would reduce the lag in starting a personalised antibiotic treatment and the medical costs associated with erroneous treatments due to conservative assumptions about blood culture outcomes. METHODS: Six supervised classifiers were created using three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours, on the electronic health records of hospital patients. The best approach to handle missing data was chosen and, for each machine learning technique, two classification models were created: the first uses the features known at the time of blood extraction, whereas the second uses four extra features revealed during the blood culture. RESULTS: The six classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset of 4357 patients with 117 features per patient. The models obtain predictions that, for the best case, are up to a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.9%, a sensitivity of 87.4% and an AUC of 0.93. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide cutting-edge metrics of interest in predictive medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in specific types of bacteraemia. Additionally, the consistency of results is reasserted because the three classifiers’ importance ranking shows similar features that coincide with those that physicians use in their manual heuristics. Therefore, the efficacy of these machine learning techniques confirms their viability to assist in the aims of predictive and personalised medicine once the disease presents bacteraemia-compatible symptoms and to assist in improving the healthcare economy.","Garnica, Oscar; Gómez, Diego; Ramos, Víctor; Hidalgo, J.

At the same time, concerns are voiced that as a consequence of neoliberal regimes of research governance, innovative research becomes impeded. In this paper, I suggest that to gain a better understanding of these dynamics, it is indispensable to scrutinise current demands for innovativeness as a distinct way of ascribing worth to research. Drawing on interviews and focus groups produced in a close collaboration with three research groups from the crop and soil sciences, I develop the notion of a project-innovation regime of valuation that can be traced in the sphere of research. In this evaluative framework, it is considered valuable to constantly re-invent oneself and take ‘first steps’ instead of ‘just’ following up on previous findings. Subsequently, I describe how these demands for innovativeness relate to and often clash with other regimes of valuation that matter for researchers’ practices. I show that valuations of innovativeness are in many ways bound to those of productivity and competitiveness, but that these two regimes are nevertheless sometimes in tension with each other, creating a complicated double bind for researchers. Moreover, I highlight that also the project-innovation regime as such is not always in line with what researchers considered as a valuable progress of knowledge, especially because it entails a de-valuation of certain kinds of long-term epistemic agendas. I show that prevailing pushes for innovativeness seem to be based on a rather short-sighted temporal imaginary of scientific progress that is hardly grounded in the complex realities of research practices, and that they can reshape epistemic practices in potentially problematic ways.","Falkenberg, Ruth I.",Minerva,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121774/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11024-021-09447-4,308

609136,Reflektiert und respektvoll im Umgang,2021-06-23,"The lack of consensual measures to monitor core change in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or response to interventions leads to difficulty to prove intervention efficacy on ASD core symptoms. There are no universally accepted outcome measures developed for measuring changes in core symptoms. However, the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) is one of the outcomes recommended in the EMA Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of ASD. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on the response definition for CARS among individuals with ASD. The aim of this elicitation process was to determine an appropriate definition of a response on the CARS2 scale for interventions in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An elicitation process was conducted following the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF). Five experts in the field of ASD and two experts in expert knowledge elicitation participated in an 1-day elicitation workshop. Experts in ASD were previously trained in the SHELF elicitation process and received a dossier of scientific evidence concerning the topic. The response definition was set as the mean clinically relevant improvement averaged over all patients, levels of functioning, age groups ***and clinicians. Based on the scientific evidence and expert judgment, a normal probability distribution was agreed to represent the state of knowledge of this response with expected value 4.03 and standard deviation 0.664. Considering the remaining uncertainty of the estimation and the available literature, a CARS-2 improvement of 4.5 points has been defined as a threshold to conclude to a response after an intervention. A CARS-2 improvement of 4.5 points could be used to evaluate interventions' meaningfulness in indivudals. This initial finding represents an important new benchmark and may aid decision makers in evaluating the efficacy of interventions in ASD.

The sudden need to navigate this “new normal” has compromised the mental health of many people. Coping flexibility, defined as the astute deployment of coping strategies to meet specific situational demands, is proposed as an adaptive quality during this period of upheaval. The present study investigated the associations between coping flexibility and two common mental health problems: COVID-19 anxiety and depression. The respondents were 481 Hong Kong adults (41% men; mean age = 45.09) who took part in a population-based telephone survey conducted from April to May 2020. Self-report data were assessed with the Coping Flexibility Interview Schedule, COVID-19-Related Perception and Anxiety Scale, and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Slightly more than half (52%) of the sample met the criteria for probable depression. Four types of COVID-19 anxiety were identified: anxiety over personal health, others' reactions, societal health, and economic problems. The results consistently revealed coping flexibility to be inversely associated with depression and all four types of COVID-19 anxiety. More importantly, there was a significant interaction between perceived likelihood of COVID-19 infection and coping flexibility on COVID-19 anxiety over personal health. These findings shed light on the beneficial role of coping flexibility in adjusting to the “new normal” amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Cecilia; Wang, Hsin-yi; Ebrahimi, Omid V.",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815166/,308

Favipiravir is an orally administrable antiviral drug whose mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A preliminary trial in COVID-19 patients reported significant improvements across a multitude of clinical parameters, but these findings have not been confirmed in an adequate well-controlled trial. We conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in patients with moderate pneumonia not requiring oxygen therapy. METHODS: COVID-19 patients with moderate pneumonia (SpO(2) ≥ 94%) within 10 days of onset of fever (temperature ≥ 37.5 °C) were assigned to receive either placebo or favipiravir (1800 mg twice a day on Day 1, followed by 800 mg twice a day for up to 13 days) in a ratio of 1:2. An adaptive design was used to re-estimate the sample size. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome defined as the time to improvement in temperature, oxygen saturation levels (SpO(2)), and findings on chest imaging, and recovery to SARS-CoV-2-negative. This endpoint was re-examined by the Central Committee under blinded conditions. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were randomized. The median time of the primary endpoint was 11.9 days in the favipiravir group and 14.7 days in the placebo group, with a significant difference (p = 0.0136). Favipiravir-treated patients with known risk factors such as obesity or coexisting conditions provided better effects. Furthermore, patients with early-onset in the favipiravir group showed higher odds ratio. No deaths were documented. Although adverse events in the favipiravir group were predominantly transient, the incidence was significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested favipiravir may be one of options for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. However, the risk of adverse events, including hyperuricemia, should be carefully considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.jp number: JapicCTI-205238.

611000,Archetypes of the pandemic,2021-07-07,"INTRODUCTION: The National Health Service for England Long Term Plan identifies respiratory disease as one of its priority workstreams. To assist with earlier and more accurate diagnosis of lung disease they recommend improvement in delivery of quality-assured spirometry. However, there is a likelihood that patients will present with abnormal gas exchange when spirometry results are normal and therefore there will be a proportion of patients whose time to diagnosis is still protracted. We wished to determine the incidence rate of this occurring within our Trust. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients attending the lung function laboratory for their first pulmonary function assessment from June 2006 to December 2020 was undertaken. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC) >−1.64 standardised residual (SR) was used to confirm no obstructive lung function abnormality and FVC >−1.64 SR to confirm no suggestion of a restrictive lung function abnormality. Lung gas transfer for carbon monoxide (TLCO) and transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide (KCO) <−1.64 SR confirmed the presence of a gas exchange abnormality. Spirometry and gas transfer reference values generated by the Global Lung Initiative were used to determine normality. RESULTS: Of 12 835 eligible first visits with normal FEV(1)/FVC and FVC, 4856 (37.8%) were identified as having an abnormally low TLCO and 3302 (25.7%) presenting with an abnormally low KCO. Of 3494 with FEV(1)/FVC SR <−1.64, 3316 also had a ratio of <0.70, meaning 178 (5%) of patients in this cohort would have been misclassified as having obstructive lung disease using the 0.70 cut-off recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease for diagnosing obstructive lung disease. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, to assist with ensuring more accurate and timely diagnosis of lung disease and enhance patients’ diagnostic pathway, we recommend the performance of lung gas transfer measurements alongside spirometry in all healthcare settings. To assess and monitor gas transfer at the earliest opportunity we recommend this is implemented into new models being developed within community hubs. This will increase the identification of lung function abnormalities and provide patients with a definitive diagnosis earlier.","Sylvester, Karl P; Youngs, Luke; Rutter, M A; Beech, Ross; Mahadeva, Ravi",BMJ Open Respir Res,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-001012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312255/,308

Bacterial and Fungal co-infections increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. AIM: To study the bacterial profile in patients with COVID-19 who needed admission to receive treatment in the main centres concerned with managing COVID-19 disease in the Kingdom of Bahrain. METHODS: The study was a retrospective observational analysis of the bacterial profile and the bacterial resistance in patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease who needed admission to receive treatment in the main centres assigned to manage patients with COVID-19 disease in the Kingdom of Bahrain from February to October 2020. We used the electronic patients’ records and the microbiology laboratory data to identify patients’ demographics, clinical data, microbial profile, hospital or community-acquired, and the outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 1380 patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease during the study period. 51% were admitted from February to June, and 49% were admitted from July to October 2020, with a recurrence rate was 0.36%. There was a significant increase in bacterial and fungal co-infection in the second period compared to the first period. The most common isolated organisms were the gram-negative bacteria (mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli), the gram-positive bacteria (mainly coagulase negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and fungaemia (Candida galabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida parapsilosis, Aspergillus niger). The hospital-acquired infection formed 73.8%, 61.6%, 100% gram-negative, gram-positive and fungaemia. Most of the hospital-acquired infection occurred in the second period with a higher death rate than community-acquired infections. CONCLUSION: Bacterial and fungal co-infections in patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease pose higher morbidity and mortality risks than those without co-infections. We should perform every effort to minimize these risks.","Saeed, Nermin Kamal; Al-Khawaja, Safaa; Alsalman, Jameela; Almusawi, Safiya; Albalooshi, Noor Ahmed; Al-Biltagi, Mohammed",World J Virol,https://doi.org/10.5501/wjv.v10.i4.168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367932/,308

614600,Meeting report: the 2020 FSHD International Research Congress,2020-12-08,"Background Engineering controls are a necessity for minimising aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet so far, little attention has been given to such interventions. High flow local extraction (HFLE) is a standard in other industries that deal with airborne contaminants. This study provides a quantitative evaluation of an HFLE concept feasible to implement in most real clinical settings. Method A unique combined experimental model of Laser sheet illumination videography paired with continuous nanoparticle counts was used to quantitatively assess the impact of HFLE in an operating theatre. Propylene Glycol was aerosolised via a customised physiological lung simulator and dispersion was measured in 3 dimensions. Cumulative probability heat maps were generated to describe aerosol behaviour. Continuous particle counts were made at 15 locations throughout the room to validate laser assessments. Results HFLE effectively reduced dispersion of simulated exhaled aerosols to undetectable levels. With the HFLE in operation and optimally positioned, the aerosol plume was tightly controlled. Particle counts remained at baseline when HFLE was active. HFLE becomes less effective with increasing distance from source. Plume behaviour in the absence of HFLE was highly variable and unpredictable. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates great potential for HFLE to have a significant impact in reducing aerosol transmission. Simple HFLE devices can be easily engineered and could be widely deployed without impacting on the safe delivery of care.

In developed countries, basic social amenities to support these are taken for granted; this is not the case in West African countries. Instead, those suggested safeguards against contracting COVID-19 have exposed the infrastructural deficit in West African countries. In addition, and more profoundly, these safeguards against the disease have distorted the traditional community-individuality balance. The enforcement of social distancing, self-isolation, and lockdown has made it impossible for West Africans to drift to their ancestral homes and villages, as is usually the case in times of crisis, with attendant consequences for communal life and traditional burial rites.

This paper describes the protocol for a systematic review of the literature that aims to identify the reported costs and resources available for the provision of critical care and the forms of critical care provision in Tanzania. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases (MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health) will be searched to identify articles that report the forms of critical care, resources used in the provision of critical care in Tanzania, their availability and the associated costs. The search strategy will be developed from four key concepts; critical care provision, critical illness, resource use, Tanzania. The articles that fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed for quality using the Reference Case for Estimating the Costs of Global Health Services and Interventions checklist. The extracted data will be summarised using descriptive statistics including frequencies, mean and median of the quantity and costs of resources used in the components of critical care services, depending on the data availability.

617970,Will regional economic integration influence carbon dioxide marginal abatement costs? Evidence from Chinese panel data,2018-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. METHODS: Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS: Disease itself multitude by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children's usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. CONCLUSION: For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.","Dubey, Souvik; Biswas, Payel; Ghosh, Ritwik; Chatterjee, Subhankar; Dubey, Mahua Jana; Chatterjee, Subham; Lahiri, Durjoy; Lavie, Carl J.",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301545; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301545?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32526627/,308

This research project aimed to explore the experiences of parents of adults with ID in relation to remote support provided by public support agencies. In a qualitative study, the authors used semistructured individual interviews with caregivers of people with ID. Data analysis distinguished the following categories: parents as therapists, organization difficulties, material problems, lack of social contacts, positive solutions, and difficult behavior. The results show the difficulties of parents in balancing professional, domestic, and supporting tasks. The study was the first in Poland to report on the qualitative assessment of remote support for people with ID during COVID‐19.

Initially, infection presented with a broad spectrum of symptoms which typically included muscle aches, fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE2 receptors which are abundant throughout the respiratory tract. However, there is evidence that these receptors are abundant throughout the body, and just as abundant in cholangiocytes as alveolar cells, posing the question of possible direct liver injury. While liver enzymes and function tests do seem to be deranged in some patients, it is questionable if the injury is due to direct viral damage, drug-induced liver injury, hypoxia, or microthromboses. Likely, the injury is multifactoral, and management of infected patients with pre-existing liver disease should be taken into consideration. Ultimately, a vaccine is needed to aid in reducing cases of SARS-CoV-2 and providing immunity to the general population. However, while considering the types of vaccines available, safety concerns, particularly of RNA- or DNA-based vaccines, need to be addressed.","Morgan, Katie; Samuel, Kay; Vandeputte, Martin; Hayes, Peter C.; Plevris, John N.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486188/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9060430,308

The model quantifies the potential impact of physical/social distancing and population density on the disease burden. Results reveal that with no fatalities and no infected entrants, the reproduction numbers associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic cases are inversely proportional to; the habitat area size, and the efforts employed in tracing and hospitalising these cases. The critical habitat area below which the disease dies out is directly proportion to the time taken to identify and hospitalise infected individuals. Results also show that disease persistence in the community is guaranteed even with minimal admission of infected individuals. Our results further show that as the level of compliance to standard operating procedures (SOPs) increases, then the disease prevalence peaks are greatly reduced and delayed. Therefore, proper adherence to SOPs such as use of masks, physical distancing measures and effective contact tracing should be highly enforced in crowded settings if COVID-19 is to be mitigated.","Ssematimba, A.; Nakakawa, J.

Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical staff enjoyed a lower quality of life of in surrounding areas of Wuhan than that of non-medical staff, and female medical staff even lower, which should arouse social concern.","Liu, Z.; Mu, J.; Fan, W.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.15.20158725v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.20158725,308
623136,Letter from the Editor-in-Chief,2020-04-30,"Situational awareness is especially important to decision-making in health care. Comprehending the situation is crucial for anticipating any change in the environment and delivering optimal care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a training to increase situational awareness and mutual care designed for health care workers (FoCo) in a randomized controlled trial with additional qualitative analysis. We also investigated the perception of the training for the COVID-19 pandemic moment, in May 2020, almost 6 months after we finished the data collection at the Emergency Care Unit, which became a COVID-19 treatment reference for the care of a population depending on the public health system, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We conclude that FoCo training can be an important instrument for health care professionals both in times of pandemic and “normal times,” to increase situational awareness, the culture of mutual care and decrease the possibility of occupational injuries and illnesses.","Kozasa, Elisa H.; Lacerda, Shirley S.; Polissici, Monica Aparecida; Coelho, Roseli da Silva; Farias, Gedeon da Silva; Chaves, Patrícia; Leão, Eliseth R.",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324250/,308
624291,An analecta of visualizations for foodborne illness trends and seasonality,2020-10-13,"The immune response plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from protection to tissue damage. This is observed in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome when elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines are detected. Several cells of the immune response are implied in this dysregulated immune response including innate immune cells and T and B cell lymphocytes. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract, able to rapidly release different inflammatory mediators following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but little is known about their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3), and decreased serotonin levels in their serum. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, while serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that mast cells are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID-19, might represent targets for therapeutic intervention.","Soria-Castro, R.; Meneses-Preza, Y.

624456,Measuring Measurement – What is Metrology and why does it matter?,2020-09-04,"SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because many transmissions occur during the pre-symptomatic phase of infection. Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R(0)) and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person (serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually contagious for fewer than one day congruent with peak viral load several days after infection, and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1–2 additional weeks of viral shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to prevent secondary transmission.","Goyal, Ashish; Reeves, Daniel B.; Cardozo-Ojeda, E.

However, IFN is produced in infected macrophages, microglia, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). To begin to understand why IFN is produced in infected macrophages, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and as a control, bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.","Zhou, Haixia; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20978536/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00219-10,308

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted of 40 consecutive patients presenting with epistaxis referred to our tertiary otolaryngology unit. A group of 40 age-matched controls were also included. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Symptoms of fever, cough and anosmia were noted in the study group. RESULTS: The mean age was 66.5 ± 22.4 years in the study group. There were 22 males (55 per cent) and 18 females (45 per cent). The mean age in the control group was 66.3 ± 22.4 years (p = 0.935). There were six positive cases for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (15 per cent) in the epistaxis group and one case (2.5 per cent) in the control group.

626171,Using Updated PubMed: New Features and Functions to Enhance Literature Searches,2021,"Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has always been controversial and highly politicized. Here, using a social identity approach, we review evidence that trauma and its aftermath are fundamentally linked to social position, sociopolitical capital, and power. We begin this contribution by demonstrating how a person's group memberships (and the social identities they derive from these memberships) are inherently linked to the experience of adversity. We then go on to consider how it is through group memberships that individuals are defined by their trauma risk and trauma histories—that is, a person's group memberships and their trauma are often inherently linked. Considering the importance of group memberships for understanding trauma, we argue that it is important to see these, and group processes more generally, as more than just “demographic” risk factors. Instead, we argue that when groups are defined by their trauma history or risk, their members will often derive some sense of self from this trauma. For this reason, attributes of group memberships are important in developing an understanding of adjustment and adaptation to trauma. In particular, groups' status, their recourse to justice, and the level of trust and solidarity within the group are all central to the impact of traumatic events on individual‐level psychological resilience. We review evidence that supports this analysis by focusing on the exacerbating effects of stigma and social mistrust on post‐traumatic stress, and the value of solidarity and strong identities for resilience. We conclude that because of these group‐related processes, trauma interweaves the personal with the political and that post‐traumatic stress is fundamentally about power, positionality, and politics.","Muldoon, Orla T.; Lowe, Robert D.; Jetten, Jolanda; Cruwys, Tegan; Haslam, S.

We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition may affect metabolic adaptation/fuel selection in response to an acute decrease in voluntary activity. Using mice fed short‐term high‐fat diet (HFD) compared to low‐fat diet (LFD)‐fed mice, we evaluated whole‐body fuel utilization by metabolic cages before and 3 days after omitting a voluntary running wheel in the cage. Short‐term (24–48 h) HFD was sufficient to increase energy intake, fat oxidation, and decrease carbohydrate oxidation. Running wheel omission did not change energy intake, but resulted in a significant 50% decrease in total activity and a ~20% in energy expenditure in the active phase (night‐time), compared to the period with wheel, irrespective of the dietary composition, resulting in significant weight gain. Yet, while in LFD wheel omission significantly decreased active phase fat oxidation, thereby trending to increase respiratory exchange ratio (RER), in HFD it diminished active phase carbohydrate oxidation. In conclusion, acute decrease in voluntary activity resulted in positive energy balance in mice on both diets, and decreased oxidation of the minor energy (macronutrient) fuel source, demonstrating that dietary macronutrient composition determines fuel utilization choices under conditions of acute changes in energetic demand.","Bhandarkar, Nikhil S.; Lahav, Rotem; Maixner, Nitzan; Haim, Yulia; Wong, G.

Not only does this vaccination effort represent an unprecedented scientific and technological breakthrough, moving us from the rapid analysis of viral genomes to design, manufacture, clinical trial testing, and use authorization within the time frame of less than a year, but it also highlights rapid progress in the implementation of nanotechnology to assist vaccine development. These advances enable us to deliver nucleic acid and conformation-stabilized subunit vaccines to regional lymph nodes, with the ability to trigger effective humoral and cellular immunity that prevents viral infection or controls disease severity. In addition to a brief description of the design features of unique cationic lipid and virus-mimicking nanoparticles for accomplishing spike protein delivery and presentation by the cognate immune system, we also discuss the importance of adjuvancy and design features to promote cooperative B- and T-cell interactions in lymph node germinal centers, including the use of epitope-based vaccines. Although current vaccine efforts have demonstrated short-term efficacy and vaccine safety, key issues are now vaccine durability and adaptability against viral variants. We present a forward-looking perspective of how vaccine design can be adapted to improve durability of the immune response and vaccine adaptation to overcome immune escape by viral variants. Finally, we consider the impact of nano-enabled approaches in the development of COVID-19 vaccines for improved vaccine design against other infectious agents, including pathogens that may lead to future pandemics.","Nel, André E.; Miller, Jeff F.",ACS Nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c01845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793189/,308

Until now there has been limited research focusing on the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors in COVID-19 patients and their relatives. The objective of our study was to assess psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives 30 days after hospital discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study at two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals we included consecutive adult patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 for a proven COVID-19 and their relatives. Psychological distress was defined as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), i.e., a score of ≥8 on the depression and/or anxiety subscale. We further evaluated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined as a score of ≥1.5 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: Among 126 included patients, 24 (19.1%) had psychological distress and 10 (8.7%) had symptoms of PTSD 30 days after hospital discharge. In multivariate logistic regression analyses three factors were independently associated with psychological distress in patients: resilience (OR 0.82; 95%CI 0.71 to 0.94; p = 0.005), high levels of perceived stress (OR 1.21; 95%CI 1.06 to 1.38; p = 0.006) and low frequency of contact with relatives (OR 7.67; 95%CI 1.42 to 41.58; p = 0.018). The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. Among 153 relatives, 35 (22.9%) showed symptoms of psychological distress, and 3 (2%) of PTSD. For relatives, resilience was negatively associated (OR 0.85; 95%CI 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.007), whereas perceived overall burden caused by COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological distress (OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.31 to 2.25; p<0.001). The overall model also had good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.87. CONCLUSION: A relevant number of COVID-19 patients as well as their relatives exhibited psychological distress 30 days after hospital discharge. These results might aid in development of strategies to prevent psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives.","Beck, Katharina; Vincent, Alessia; Becker, Christoph; Keller, Annalena; Cam, Hasret; Schaefert, Rainer; Reinhardt, Thomas; Sutter, Raoul; Tisljar, Kai; Bassetti, Stefano; Schuetz, Philipp; Hunziker, Sabina",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951085/,308

It examined the frequency of words used in Korean and Japanese tweets regarding COVID-19 and the corresponding changes in their interests. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed Twitter posts (Tweets) from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 to determine public opinion of the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea and Japan. We collected data from Twitter (https://twitter.com/), a major social media platform in Korea and Japan. Python 3.7 Library was used for data collection. Data analysis included KR-WordRank and frequency analyses in Korea and Japan, respectively. Heat diagrams, word clouds, and rank flowcharts were also used. RESULTS: Overall, 1,470,673 and 4,195,457 tweets were collected from Korea and Japan, respectively. The word trend in Korea and Japan was analyzed every 5 days. The word cloud analysis revealed “COVID-19”, “Shinchonji”, “Mask”, “Daegu”, and “Travel” as frequently used words in Korea. While in Japan, “COVID-19”, “Mask”, “Test”, “Impact”, and “China” were identified as high-frequency words. They were divided into four categories: social distancing, prevention, issue, and emotion for the rank flowcharts. Concerning emotion, “Overcome” and “Support” increased from February in Korea, while “Worry” and “Anxiety” decreased in Japan from April 1. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the trend, people’s interests in the economy were high in both countries, indicating their reservations on the economic down-turn. Therefore, focusing policies toward economic stability is essential. Although the interest in prevention increased since April in both countries, the general public’s relaxation regarding COVID-19 was also observed.","Lee, Hocheol; Noh, Eun Bi; Choi, Sea Hwan; Zhao, Bo; Nam, Eun Woo",Healthc Inform Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190468/; https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2020.26.4.335,308

Protein microarrays have been shown to be a powerful method in biomarker discovery and the identification of novel protein–protein interaction networks, suggesting that this technique could also be very useful in studies of infectious RNA viruses. However, to date, the amount of genetic material required to produce protein arrays, as well as the time- and labor-intensive procedures typically needed, have limited their more widespread application. Here, we introduce a method, protein microarray fabrication through gene synthesis (PAGES), for the rapid and efficient construction of protein microarrays particularly for RNA viruses. Using dengue virus as an example, we first identify consensus sequences from 3,604 different strains and then fabricate complete proteomic microarrays that are unique for each consensus sequence. To demonstrate their applicability, we show that these microarrays can differentiate sera from patients infected by dengue virus, related pathogens, or from uninfected patients. We anticipate that the microarray and expression library constructed in this study will find immediate use in further studies of dengue virus and that, more generally, PAGES will become a widely applied method in the clinical characterization of RNA viruses.","Qi, Huan; Zhou, Huiqiong; Czajkowsky, Daniel Mark; Guo, Shujuan; Li, Yang; Wang, Nan; Shi, Yi; Lin, Lifeng; Wang, Jingfang; Wu, De; Tao, Sheng-Ce",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m116.064873; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1535947620324439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965274/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620324439,308

We argue that systems Human Factors and Ergonomics methods can assist in understanding and optimizing the return from lockdown. To demonstrate, we used work domain analysis to develop an abstraction hierarchy model of a generic “return from lockdown restrictions” system. The model was assessed to identify (a) issues preventing a successful return from lockdown; and (b) leverage points that could be exploited to optimize future processes. The findings show that the aim of continuing to suppress virus transmission conflicts with the aims of returning to pre‐virus economic and social activity levels. As a result, many functions act against each other, ensuring that the system cannot optimally achieve all three of its primary aims. Potential leverage points include modifying the goals and rules of the system and enhancing communications and feedback. Specifically, it is argued that moderating economic aims and modifying how social and community activities are undertaken will result in longer term suppression of the virus.","Salmon, Paul M.; Stevens, Nicholas; McLean, Scott; Hulme, Adam; Read, Gemma J.

Although the origin(s) of these viruses are still unknown and their occurrences in nature are mysterious, some general patterns of their pathogenesis and epidemics are noticeable. Both viruses utilize the same receptor—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—for invading human bodies. Both epidemics occurred in cold dry winter seasons celebrated with major holidays, and started in regions where dietary consumption of wildlife is a fashion. Thus, if bats were the natural hosts of SARS-CoVs, cold temperature and low humidity in these times might provide conducive environmental conditions for prolonged viral survival in these regions concentrated with bats. The widespread existence of these bat-carried or -released viruses might have an easier time in breaking through human defenses when harsh winter makes human bodies more vulnerable. Once succeeding in making some initial human infections, spreading of the disease was made convenient with increased social gathering and holiday travel. These natural and social factors influenced the general progression and trajectory of the SARS epidemiology. However, some unique factors might also contribute to the origination of SARS in Wuhan. These factors are discussed in different scenarios in order to promote more research for achieving final validation.","Sun, Zhong; Thilakavathy, Karuppiah; Kumar, S.

Some patients with severe COVID-19 experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or a cytokine storm—elevated levels of hyperactivated immune cells—and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. This severe inflammatory response can lead to organ damage/failure and even death. The inflammasome is an intracellular immune complex that is responsible for the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in various human diseases.

We find significant and predominant infection in cortical astrocytes in both primary and organoid cultures, with minimal infection of other cortical populations. Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a cross-sectional survey of public and private intensive care units (ICUs) in Nigeria at the instance of the Intensive and Critical Care Society of Nigeria. Structured questionnaires were sent and collated over a 4-month period. Information on the institutions, ICU equipment and personnel were collected and analyzed using SPSS version 21(Chicago, Illinois). Data are presented in numbers, percentages, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. RESULTS A total of 30 ICUs spread within all the six geo-political zones in Nigeria took part in this survey. Majority (63.3%) of them were located in teaching hospitals. The median number of ICU beds and equipment in hospitals surveyed were beds, 5(4-6), ventilators, 3 (1-4); multiparameter monitor, 4 (3-5.25) and arterial blood gas machine, 0(0-1). The anaesthetists led in running 90% of the units. CONCLUSION This survey showed a low ICU bed capacity and deficits in basic and advanced haemodynamic monitoring equipment. There is also shortage of trained ICU Physicians.","Ogunbiyi, Obashina; Sanusi, Arinola; Osinaike, Babatunde; Yakubu, Saidu; Rotimi, Muyiwa; Fatungase, Oluwabunmi",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2021.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330559/,308

A week later, a new coronavirus was isolated in these patients, initially designated as 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. This is a new virus that is much closer genetically to the coronavirus of bats than to human SARS. The new virus infects and replicates in the lung parenchyma pneumocytes and macrophages in which the ACE-2 cell receptor resides. He has now infected many more people than his predecessors (>85,000). From the clinical point of view, those infected have an average age of 55 years; the main symptoms are fever, dry cough, lymphopenia, dyspnea, and pneumonia in its severe form. The overall lethality rate is 2-3% in China and 0.1% in cases detected outside of this country. The incubation period has been set at about 3 days (0-24 days). There are no specific antivirals or vaccines.","Reina, J.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2445146020300042?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2445146020300042,308
636975,The Future of Livestock Management: A Review of Real-Time Portable Sequencing Applied to Livestock,2020-12-09,"Multiplex network theory is widely introduced to deepen the understanding of the dynamical interplay between self-protective behavior and epidemic spreading. Most of the existing studies assumed that all infected individuals can transmit disease- related information or can be perceived by their neighbors. However, owing to lack of distinct symptoms for patients in the initial stage of infection, the disease information cannot be transmitted in the population, which may lead to the wrong perception of infection risk and inappropriate behavior response. In this work, we divide infected individuals into Exposed-state (without obvious clinical symptoms) individuals and Infected-state (with evident clinical symptoms) individuals, both of whom can spread disease, but only Infected-state individuals can diffuse disease information. Then, in this work we establish UAU-SEIS (Unaware–Aware–Unaware–Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Susceptible) model in multiplex networks and analyze the effect of asymptomatic infection and the isolation of Infected-state individuals on the density of infection and the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, we extend the UAU-SEIS model by taking the individual heterogeneity into consideration. Combined Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo Simulations, we find that asymptomatic infection has an effect on the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold, and the extent of the effect is influenced by whether Infected-state individuals are isolated or treated. In addition, results show that the individual heterogeneity can lower the density of infected individuals, but cannot enhance the epidemic threshold.","Shi, Tianyu; Long, Ting; Pan, Yaohui; Zhang, Wensi; Dong, Chao; Yin, Qiuju",Physica A,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437119306405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288109/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.04.266; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437119306405,308

This trial is to observe the likelihood of efficacy and safety of Indomethacin in treating RT-PCR positive Covid patients Materials and Methods The study was done in two groups. In the first group of the study, where mild and moderate patients were involved, Propensity Score Matching was used as a methodology to compare Indomethacin and paracetamol based treatments in addition to the standard protocol for treating covid-19 patients.. Blood chemistry was collected before and after the treatment. The patients were monitored every day for clinical parameters. In this part, a patient developing hypoxia was the end point. In the second group, severe patients admitted with hypoxia were treated with Indomethacin in addition to Remdesivir, and the end point was the requirement of mechanical ventilation/admission to ICU. Results It was observed that patients treated with Indomethacin had a reduction in the number of days to become afebrile, reduction in cough and myalgia by half compared to the paracetamol set. Only one out of 72 patients in the Indomethacin arm of the first group required supplementary oxygen while 28 of the 72 patients required supplementary oxygen in the paracetamol arm. No one in the second group deteriorated enough to require mechanical ventilation. There wea no evidence of adverse reaction to indomethacin or deterioration of renal or liver function. Conclusion Indomethacin, along with standard care, seems to provide faster symptomatic relief and prevent progression of pneumonia in Covid-19 patients. It should be considered to replace paracetamol when there is no contraindication for its use.","Ravichandran, R.; Purna, P.; Vijayaragavan, S.; Kalavakollu, R.

All viruses rely extensively on host machinery for replication; therefore, it is not surprising that viruses connect to the ubiquitin pathway at many levels. Viral involvement with ubiquitin occurs either adventitiously because of the unavoidable usurpation of cellular processes, or for some specific purpose selected for by the virus to enhance viral replication. Here, we review current knowledge of how the ubiquitin pathway alters viral replication and how viruses influence the ubiquitin pathway to enhance their own replication.","Isaacson, Marisa K.; Ploegh, Hidde L.",Cell Host Microbe,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312809001796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19527883/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2009.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312809001796,308

641958,Epidemic spreading and control strategies in spatial modular network,2020-11-26,"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitously expressed cellular protein and involves in diverse pathological conditions, including infection and inflammation. CypA acts as a key factor in the replication of several viruses. However, little is known about the role of CypA in the replication of the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV). In the present report, grouper CypA (GF-CypA) was cloned from the grouper fin cell line (GF-1) derived from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Sequence analysis found that GF-CypA open reading frame (ORF) of 495 bp encodes a polypeptide of 164 amino acids residues with a molecular weight of 17.4 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highly conserved regions with CypA of other animal species, showing that GF-CypA is a new member of Cyclophilin A family. We observed that GF-CypA was up-regulated in the GF-1 cells infected with RGNNV. Additionally, overexpression of CypA could significantly inhibit the replication of RGNNV in GF-1 cells. By contrast, when the GF-CypA was knock-downed by siRNA in GF-1 cells, the replication of RGNNV was enhanced. Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-2, TNF-α, IL-1b, and ISG-15, were increased in GF-CypA transfected GF-1 cells challenged with RGNNV, indicating that GF-CypA might be involved in the regulation of the host pro-inflammatory factors. Altogether, we conclude that GF-CypA plays a vital role in the inhibitory effect of RGNNV replication that might be modulating the cytokines secretion in GF-1 cells during RGNNV infection. These results will shed new light on the function of CypA in the replication of RGNNV and will pave a new way for the prevention of the infection of RGNNV in fish.","Asim, Muhammad; Sarath Babu, V.; Qin, Zhendong; Zhao, Lijuan; Su, Jianguo; Li, Jun; Tu, Jiagang; Kou, Hongyan; Lin, Li",Fish Shellfish Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176008/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464819306394; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.05.064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464819306394,308

This recognition has fueled efforts for the discovery of effective therapeutics. While recent progress in drug discovery has been encouraging, there are presently no acceptably effective parasite-specific drugs for the disease. The urgent need for new drug discovery or drug repurposing has also increased the need for refined animal models of clinical disease for therapeutic efficacy evaluation. Here, we describe an acute model of cryptosporidiosis using newborn calves to evaluate well-defined clinical and parasitological parameter outcomes, including the effect on diarrhea severity and duration, oocyst numbers produced, and multiple measures of clinical health.

As urban renewal projects lead to improvements in the long-neglected built environments of such neighborhoods, accompanying gentrification processes may lead to the displacement of or exclusion of underprivileged residents from benefiting from new amenities and improvements. In addition, gentrification processes may be instigated by various drivers. We aimed to discuss the implications of specific types of gentrification, by driver, for health equity. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent articles find differential effects of gentrification on the health of underprivileged residents of gentrifying neighborhoods compared to those with greater privilege (where sociodemographic dimensions such as race or socioeconomic status are used as a proxy for privilege). Generally, studies show that gentrification may be beneficial for the health of more privileged residents while harming or not benefiting the health of underprivileged residents. Very recent articles have begun to test hypothesized pathways by which urban renewal indicators, gentrification, and health equity are linked. Few public health articles to date are designed to detect distinct impacts of specific drivers of gentrification. SUMMARY: Using a case example, we hypothesize how distinct drivers of gentrification—specifically, retail gentrification, environmental gentrification, climate gentrification, studentification, tourism gentrification, and health care gentrification—may imply specific pathways toward reduced health equity. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by researchers in assessing the health impacts of gentrification.","Cole, Helen V.

While it is well-known that older individuals with certain comorbidities are at highest risk for complications related to COVID-19 including hospitalization and death, we lack tools to identify communities at highest risk with fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Information collected at a county level obscures local risk and complex interactions between clinical comorbidities, the built environment, population factors, and other social determinants of health. Methods. We develop a robust COVID-19 Community Risk Score (C-19 Risk Score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on their basis for association with risk for COVID complications, such as death. We mapped the C19 Risk Score onto neighborhoods in New York City and associated the score with C-19 related death. Last, we predict the C-19 Risk Score using satellite image data to map the built environment in C-19 Risk. Results. The C-19 Risk Score describes 85% of variation in co-occurrence of 15 diseases that are risk factors for COVID complications among 26K census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts: 4,091). The C-19 Risk Score is associated with a 40% greater risk for COVID-19 related death across NYC (April and September 2020) for a 1SD change in the score (Risk Ratio for 1SD change in C19 Risk Score: 1.4, p < .001). Satellite imagery coupled with social determinants of health explain nearly 90% of the variance in the C-19 Risk Score in the United States in held-out census tracts (R2 of 0.87). Conclusions.

We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: IL-18, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IFN-λ1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-λ1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to activation of fundamentally different innate immune pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection, and emphasize drivers of severe COVID-19 to focus both mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.","Karaba, Andrew H; Zhou, Weiqiang; Hsieh, Leon L; Figueroa, Alexis; Massaccesi, Guido; Rothman, Richard E; Fenstermacher, Katherine Z J; Sauer, Lauren; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Blair, Paul W; Robinson, Matthew L; Leung, Sherry; Wesson, Russell; Alachkar, Nada; El-Diwany, Ramy; Ji, Hongkai; Cox, Andrea L",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013339/,308

We analyzed 706 responses to an online survey and used a factor-based Partial Least Squares algorithm (PLSF) to estimate the relationships between each type of self-medication and possible predictors. Our results show that self–medication is strongly predicted by non-cognitive behavioral factors such as habits and similarity of symptoms, while cognitive determinants such as knowledge and understanding of potential risks are not significantly associated with self-medication behaviors.

The impact of the pandemic is likely to be more pronounced on cancer survivors living in resource-limited settings, such as in Southeast Asia. As health care systems in the region try to streamline resources and accommodate the influx of patients from COVID-19, many in the cancer community have experienced severe disruptions in their care. The delays and disruption of timely access to cancer care could lead to patients presenting with worsened conditions and at more advanced cancer stages in which treatment options tended to be costlier. Similar to countries around the world, the various forms of movement restrictions that were enforced have aggravated the rates of unemployment, loss of wages and the limited access to support from family or friends around Southeast Asia. The economic impact of COVID-19 hits even harder on the large proportion of the population in the region that works in the informal sector, who are often one paycheque or one episode of illness away from financial catastrophe. More worryingly, the lack of a robust social security system in many Southeast Asian countries, especially in terms of income protection, could ultimately force many cancer survivors to choose between paying for their treatments, or to forego treatments, and feed their families. Early identification of cancer patients experiencing financial toxicity following the pandemic will enable timely and appropriate interventions to be undertaken by various stakeholders, potentially averting a cascade of other economic fallouts that may last for years after cancer treatment.","Kong, Yek-Ching; Sakti, Veni-Venusha; Sullivan, Richard; Bhoo-Pathy, Nirmala",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281926/,308
650175,The European Legislation on AI: a Brief Analysis of its Philosophical Approach,2021-06-03,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with Convalescent Plasma (CCP) via the Expanded Access Program (EAP) and the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), leading to the use of CCP in some 500,000 patients during the first year of the pandemic. We tracked the number of CCP units dispensed to hospitals by blood banking organizations and correlated that usage with hospital admission and mortality data over the course of the year. CCP usage per admission peaked after issuance of the EUA, with more than 40% of inpatients estimated to have received CCP between late September and early November 2020. However, following reports of randomized controlled trials that failed to show clear benefit from CCP, usage/admissions declined steadily to a nadir of less than 10% in March 2021. We found a strong inverse correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of −0.5176 with P = 0.00242) between CCP usage/hospital admission and deaths occurring two weeks after admission, and this finding was robust to examination of deaths taking place one, two or three weeks after admission. Changes in the number of hospital admissions, prevalence of variants, and age of patients could not explain these findings. We estimate that the retreat from CCP usage, a phenomenon we termed ‘plasma hesitancy’, might have resulted in 29,000 to 36,000 excess deaths in the period from mid-November 2020 to February 2021. These results highlight the need for additional studies to ascertain the variables associated with efficacy and/or provide other explanations for the robust relationships observed in this study.","Casadevall, A; Dragotakes, Q; Johnson, PW; Senefeld, JW; Klassen, SA; Wright, RS; Joyner, MJ; Paneth, N; Carter, R",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.21255089; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.07.21255089v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851186/,308

The aim of this study was to establish a combined in silico and in vitro approach to assess feline leukocyte production of IFN-γ in response to selected peptides of the nucleocapside protein (N) of FCoVs. To this aim, we designed, through a bioinformatic approach, 8 potentially immunogenic peptides from the protein N corresponding to sequences of residues 14, 182, 198 detected only in FCoVs from FIP cats (virulent strains), only in FCoVs from healthy cats (avirulent strains) and both in FIP and in healthy cats (mixed strains). The peptides or a sham solution were incubated with whole blood from 16 cats (7 healthy and 9 with chronic diseases other than FIP) and IFN-γ concentration was measured on plasma using an ELISA system. RT-PCR expression of IFN-γ mRNA was also evaluated after incubation of the peptides or a sham solution with whole blood from 4 clinically healthy cats. The mean plasma concentration of IFN-γ in samples incubated with peptides decreased and the expression of IFN-γmRNA did not change compared with the sham solution, except for some cats with chronic diseases (which probably have a “pre-activated” immune response). These cats responded to “avirulent” or “mixed” peptides by increasing the concentration of IFN-γ and the expression of IFN-γ mRNA. The combined approach employed in this study allowed us to identify potentially immunogenic peptides of FCoV N protein that can modulate the production of IFN-γ especially in cats with a “pre-activated” cell mediated response.","Rossi, G.; Cornaro, C.; Battilani, M.; Pocacqua, V.; Paltrinieri, S.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21376481/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511000691; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.02.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511000691,308

We prospectively collected fecal samples from 50 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 9 SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, and 34 uninfected subjects seen by the hospital with unrelated respiratory medical conditions (controls). 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR analysis was performed on fecal DNA/RNA. The fecal microbial composition was found to be significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls (PERMANOVA FDR-P = .004), independent of antibiotic exposure. Peptoniphilus, Corynebacterium and Campylobacter were identified as the three most significantly enriched genera in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Actively infected patients were also found to have a different gut microbiota than recovered patients (PERMANOVA FDR-P = .003), and the most enriched genus in infected patients was Campylobacter, with Agathobacter and Faecalibacterium being enriched in the recovered patients. No difference in microbial community structure between recovered patients and uninfected controls was observed, nor a difference in alpha diversity between the three groups. 24 of the 50 COVID-19 patients (48%) tested positive via RT-qPCR for fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A significant difference in gut microbial composition between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples was observed, with Klebsiella and Agathobacter being enriched in the positive cohort. No significant associations between microbiome composition and disease severity was found. The intestinal microbiota is sensitive to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, with increased relative abundance of genera (Campylobacter, Klebsiella) associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disease.

Accordingly, these models of both health and disease hold great promise for improving fundamental research, drug development, personalized medicine, and testing of pharmaceuticals, food substances, pollutants etc. Cells within the body are exposed to biomechanical stimuli, the nature of which is tissue specific and may change with disease or injury. These biomechanical stimuli regulate cell behavior and can amplify, annul, or even reverse the response to a given biochemical cue or drug candidate. As such, the application of an appropriate physiological or pathological biomechanical environment is essential for the successful recapitulation of in vivo behavior in OOC models. Here we review the current range of commercially available OOC platforms which incorporate active biomechanical stimulation. We highlight recent findings demonstrating the importance of including mechanical stimuli in models used for drug development and outline emerging factors which regulate the cellular response to the biomechanical environment. We explore the incorporation of mechanical stimuli in different organ models and identify areas where further research and development is required. Challenges associated with the integration of mechanics alongside other OOC requirements including scaling to increase throughput and diagnostic imaging are discussed. In summary, compelling evidence demonstrates that the incorporation of biomechanical stimuli in these OOC or microphysiological systems is key to fully replicating in vivo physiology in health and disease.","Thompson, Clare L.; Fu, Su; Knight, Martin M.; Thorpe, Stephen D.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.602646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33363131/,308

This protocol paper details a study to examine the feasibility of a multicomponent intervention to involve patients and/or carers in patient safety in primary care in the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a two-phase, non-randomised feasibility mixed methods pragmatic study of a patient safety guide for primary care (PSG-PC). 8 general practices will recruit 120 patient and/or carer participants. All patient and/or carer participants will receive the PSG-PC. It will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the PSG-PC in primary care settings in patients aged 18 years or older who attend appointments at general practice with health professionals four or more times per year as either patients or carers. It will identify secondary outcomes for improving patient safety, health status and patient empowerment, and reducing health service utilisation over 6 months between baseline and 6-month follow-ups. The findings will inform whether a main effectiveness trial is feasible and, if so, how it should be designed, and how many patients and practices will be needed. The study will be undertaken between January 2020 and September 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Service London-West London and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee Research Ethics Committee (reference: 19/LO/1289). Research findings will be disseminated with participating general practices and shared in a range of different ways to engage different audiences, including presenting at international and national conferences, publishing in open-access, peer-reviewed journals and facilitating dissemination workshops within local communities with patients, carers and healthcare professionals.

651961,Usefulness of virtual reality-based training to diagnose strabismus,2021-03-15,"The ambient conditions surrounding liquid droplets determine their growth or shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies are critical. Here we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical view by William F. Wells (1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour puff to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model correctly predicts super-saturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.","Ng, C. S.; Chong, K.

Inflammatory responses have a significant impact on MERS-CoV pathogenesis and disease outcome. However, CD4(+) T-cell induced immune responses during acute MERS-CoV infection are barely detectable, with potent inhibition of effector T cells and downregulation of antigen presentation. The local pulmonary immune response, particularly the Th1 and Th2-related immune response during acute severe MERS-CoV infection is not fully understood. In this study, we offer the first insights into the pulmonary gene expression profile of Th1 and Th2-related cytokines/chemokines (Th1 & Th2 responses) during acute MERS-CoV infection using RT(2) Profiler PCR Arrays. We also quantified the expression level of primary inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Our results showed a downregulation of Th2, inadequate (partial) Th1 immune response and high expression levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β and the neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8) in the lower respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected patients. Moreover, we identified a high viral load in all included patients. We also observed a correlation between inflammatory cytokines, Th1, and Th2 downregulation and the case fatality rate. Th1 and Th2 response downregulation, high expression of inflammatory cytokines, and high viral load may contribute to lung inflammation, severe infection, the evolution of pneumonia and ARDS, and a higher case fatality rate. Further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the Th1 and Th2 regulatory pathways will be vital for active vaccine development and the identification of novel therapeutic strategies.","Alosaimi, Bandar; Hamed, Maaweya E.; Naeem, Asif; Alsharef, Ali A.; AlQahtani, Saeed Y.; AlDosari, Kamel M.; Alamri, Aref A.; Al-Eisa, Kholoud; Khojah, Taghreed; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Enani, Mushira A.",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466619303242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31706200/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154895; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466619303242,308

Such apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as second waves of COVID-19 are raging, these apps are playing a less important role than anticipated. We argue that this is because most countries have opted for app configurations that cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Mathematical modelling suggests that differently configured apps have the potential to do this. These require, however, that some pseudonymised data be stored on a central server, which privacy advocates have cautioned against. We contend that their influential arguments are subject to two fallacies. First, they have tended to one-sidedly focus on the risks that centralised data storage entails for privacy, while paying insufficient attention to the fact that inefficient contact tracing involves ethical risks too. Second, while the envisioned system does entail risks of breaches, such risks are also present in decentralised systems, which have been falsely presented as ‘privacy preserving by design’. When these points are understood, it becomes clear that we must rethink our approach to digital contact tracing in our fight against COVID-19.","White, Lucie; van Basshuysen, Philippe",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419939/,308
653191,Vaccination in a two-group epidemic model,2021-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in representation learning have enabled large strides in natural language understanding; However, verbal reasoning remains a challenge for state-of-the-art systems. External sources of structured, expert-curated verb-related knowledge have been shown to boost model performance in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where accurate handling of verb meaning and behaviour is critical. The costliness and time required for manual lexicon construction has been a major obstacle to porting the benefits of such resources to NLP in specialised domains, such as biomedicine. To address this issue, we combine a neural classification method with expert annotation to create BioVerbNet. This new resource comprises 693 verbs assigned to 22 top-level and 117 fine-grained semantic-syntactic verb classes. We make this resource available complete with semantic roles and VerbNet-style syntactic frames. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of the new resource in boosting model performance in document- and sentence-level classification in biomedicine. We apply an established retrofitting method to harness the verb class membership knowledge from BioVerbNet and transform a pretrained word embedding space by pulling together verbs belonging to the same semantic-syntactic class. The BioVerbNet knowledge-aware embeddings surpass the non-specialised baseline by a significant margin on both tasks. CONCLUSION: This work introduces the first large, annotated semantic-syntactic classification of biomedical verbs, providing a detailed account of the annotation process, the key differences in verb behaviour between the general and biomedical domain, and the design choices made to accurately capture the meaning and properties of verbs used in biomedical texts. The demonstrated benefits of leveraging BioVerbNet in text classification suggest the resource could help systems better tackle challenging NLP tasks in biomedicine.","Majewska, Olga; Collins, Charlotte; Baker, Simon; Björne, Jari; Brown, Susan Windisch; Korhonen, Anna; Palmer, Martha",J Biomed Semantics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-021-00247-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266499/,308

Tetradenia riparia extract is one of the plant extracts that have been deployed and claimed to manage and control COVID-19 by some communities in Tanzania and other African countries. The active compounds isolated from T. riparia are known to possess various biological properties including antimalarial and antiviral. However, the underlying mechanism of the active compounds against SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Results in the present work have been interpreted from the view point of computational methods including molecular dynamics, free energy methods, and metadynamics to establish the related mechanism of action. Among the constituents of T. riparia studied, luteolin inhibited viral cell entry and was thermodynamically stable. The title compound exhibit residence time and unbinding kinetics of 68.86 ms and 0.014 /ms, respectively. The findings suggest that luteolin could be potent blocker of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

Mobile and telemental healthcare are a vital component of increasing access for veterans. The Veteran’s Healthcare Administration is making efforts to further broaden how veterans receive their care through VA Video Connect, which allows veterans to connect with their provider from their residence or workplace. In this mixed-methods study, successes and challenges associated with the rapid implementation of VA Video Connect telemental health appointments are examined through (1) administrative data and (2) qualitative interviews at one medical center. Within 1 year of the telehealth initiative, the number of providers experienced with telemental health increased from 15% to 85%, and telehealth appointments increased from 5376 to 14,210. Provider reported barriers included administrative challenges and concerns regarding care. Having an implementation model of telehealth champions and a team of experienced mental health providers allowed for rapid adoption of telehealth. Utilizing a similar model in other settings will further enable more veterans with depression and anxiety to have access to evidence-based psychotherapy, regardless of location or national crisis. With the dramatic increase in both training for providers as well as veteran use of telemental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic response, future research should aim to better understand which teams were able to switch to telehealth easily versus those which struggled, along with examining system-wide and provider-level factors that facilitated continued use of telehealth after social distancing requirements related to COVID-19 were relaxed.

In this study, degradation of three selected GCs in soil has been investigated using citric acid (CA)–modified Fenton-like processes (H(2)O(2)/Fe(III)/CA and CaO(2)/Fe(III)/CA treatments). The results showed that GCs in soil can be removed by modified Fenton-like processes (removal efficiency gt; 70% for 24 h). CaO(2)/Fe(III)/CA was more efficient than H(2)O(2)/Fe(III)/CA at low oxidant dosage (< 0.28–0.69 mmol/g) for long treatment time (> 4 h). Besides the chemical assessment with GC removal, effects of Fenton-like processes were also evaluated by biological assessments with bacteria and plants. CaO(2)/Fe(III)/CA was less harmful to the richness and diversity of microorganisms in soil compared to H(2)O(2)/Fe(III)/CA. Weaker phytotoxic effects were observed on GC-contaminated soil treated by CaO(2)/Fe(III)/CA than H(2)O(2)/Fe(III)/CA.

Indeed, the inflammatory response during COVID-19 is likely the cause for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with mild symptoms also show significant changes on pulmonary CT-scan suggestive of severe inflammatory involvement. HYPOTHESIS: The overall hypothesis is that HBO(2) is safe and reduces the inflammatory response in COVID-19 pneumonitis by attenuation of the innate immune system, increase hypoxia tolerance and thereby prevent organ failure and reduce mortality. EVALUATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: HBO(2) is used in clinical practice to treat inflammatory conditions but has not been scientifically evaluated for COVID-19. Experimental and empirical data suggests that HBO(2) may reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19. However, there are concerns regarding pulmonary safety in patients with pre-existing viral pneumonitis.

We conducted a gaze-contingent experiment in virtual reality in order to test how the perceived roles of central and peripheral visions translated to more natural settings. The use of everyday scenes in virtual reality allowed us to study visual attention by implementing a fairly ecological protocol that cannot be implemented in the real world. Central or peripheral vision was masked during visual search, with target objects selected according to scene semantic rules. Analyzing the resulting search behavior, we found that target objects that were not spatially constrained to a probable location within the scene impacted search measures negatively. Our results diverge from on-screen studies in that search performances were only slightly affected by central vision loss. In particular, a central mask did not impact verification times when the target was grammatically constrained to an anchor object. Our findings demonstrates that the role of central vision (up to 6 degrees of eccentricities) in identifying objects in natural scenes seems to be minor, while the role of peripheral preprocessing of targets in immersive real-world searches may have been underestimated by on-screen experiments.","David, Erwan Joël; Beitner, Julia; Võ, Melissa Le-Hoa",J Vis,https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.21.7.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251433/,308
663615,Preventing masks from becoming the next plastic problem,2021-02-28,"Thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1), a 28-amino acid peptide, was first described and characterized from calf thymuses in 1977. This peptide can enhance T-cell, dendritic cell (DC) and antibody responses, modulate cytokines and chemokines production and block steroid-induced apoptosis of thymocytes. Due to its pleiotropic biological activities, Tα1 has gained increasing interest in recent years and has been used for the treatment of various diseases in clinic. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for the production of this peptide. So far, Tα1 used in clinic is synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis. Here, we summarize the genetic engineering methods to produce Tα1 using prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression systems. The effectiveness of these biological products in increasing the secretion of cytokines and in promoting lymphocyte proliferation were investigated in vitro studies. This opens the possibility for biotechnological production of Tα1 for the research and clinical applications.","Li, Juan; Liu, Chun Hui; Wang, Feng Shan",Peptides,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978110003384; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2010.07.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699109/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978110003384,308

664900,Epidemic spreading on hierarchical geographical networks with mobile agents,2013-09-13,"SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate and shows frequent mutations, thus making vaccine development an arduous task. However, researchers around the globe are working hard to find a solution e.g. synthetic vaccine. Here, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes to extract the potential conserved regions for identifying peptide based synthetic vaccines, viz. epitopes with high immunogenicity and antigenicity. In this regard, different multiple sequence alignment techniques are used to align the SARS-CoV-2 genomes separately. Subsequently, consensus conserved regions are identified after finding the conserved regions from each aligned result of alignment techniques. Further, the consensus conserved regions are refined considering that their lengths are greater than or equal to 60nt and their corresponding proteins are devoid of any stop codons. Subsequently, their specificity as query coverage are verified using Nucleotide BLAST. Finally, with these consensus conserved regions, T-cell and B-cell epitopes are identified based on their immunogenic and antigenic scores which are then used to rank the conserved regions. As a result, we have ranked 23 consensus conserved regions that are associated with different proteins. This ranking also resulted in 34 MHC-I and 37 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 16 and 19 unique HLA alleles and 29 B-cell epitopes. After ranking, the consensus conserved region from NSP3 gene is obtained that is highly immunogenic and antigenic. In order to judge the relevance of the identified epitopes, the physico-chemical properties and binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Sharma, Nikhil; Saha, Indrajit; Saha, Sudipto",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920337437; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107276; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920337437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385714/,308

As SARS-CoV-2 spreads across the planet, speculations remain about the range of human cells that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from two cases of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada. We determined the genomic sequences of the two isolates and identified single nucleotide changes in representative populations of our virus stocks. More importantly, we tested a wide range of human immune cells for productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm that human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor single nucleotide polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine viral genotype and phenotype using in vitro and in vivo infection models.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Nasir, Jalees A.; Budylowski, Patrick; Yip, Lily; Aftanas, Patryk; Christie, Natasha; Ghalami, Ayoob; Baid, Kaushal; Raphenya, Amogelang R.; Hirota, Jeremy A.; Miller, Matthew S.; McGeer, Allison J.; Ostrowski, Mario; Kozak, Robert A.; McArthur, Andrew G.; Mossman, Karen; Mubareka, Samira",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.037382,308

The aim of this study was to utilize modern tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as wellbeing and life changes in pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, where no lockdown has been in place. Data from the Mom2B, a national ongoing mobile application-based study of pregnant and newly-delivered women were utilized. Participants (n= 1345) filled out self-report screeners of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Questions about COVID symptoms and effects on life and health care were added from March 2020. Movement data was collected using the phone's GPS sensor. Mood scores were compared with throughout the months of 2020 and to the levels of a previous collected material. Highest levels of depression and anxiety were evident in April and October 2020. Symptoms were higher among those feeling socially isolated, but not for those infected or with symptomatic family members. Wellbeing and mobility were strongly positively correlated and were lowest in April. Women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and worry about their partners being absent from the delivery. The Mom2B application enabled gathering information at a national level in real-time as the pandemic has been evolving. Levels of perinatal affective symptoms and low wellbeing were elevated compared with previous years as well as with months with fewer cases of SARS-Cov-2.

667453,Profession,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized zoonotic coronavirus. Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. METHODS: Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0–2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1–0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15–44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","Degnah, Afnan A.; Al-amri, Sawsan S.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Almasoud, Abdulrahman S.; Mousa, Manar; Almahboub, Sarah A.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Mirza, Ahmed A.; Hindawi, Salwa I.; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Azhar, Esam I.; Hashem, Anwar M.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32005618/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120300010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120300010,308

Narcolepsy has a negative influence on quality of life, with daily functioning being affected by concomitant cognitive, behavioral, and social problems. In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged worldwide, causing the severe respiratory disease COVID-19. In the Netherlands, a partial lockdown was implemented that included the closure of schools. Here we present 3 illustrative case reports that teach important lessons for the treatment of pediatric narcolepsy. We observed significant consequences of the partial lockdown measures on daytime functioning, well-being, and school performance, both negative and positive. The consequences of the lockdown led to valuable insights for further treatment, substantiating the importance of personalizing education.

Our system was based on a knowledge base about drugs, enriched by supervised machine learning (ML) models trained on patients reporting data. To train our models, we selected all cases of ADRs reported by patients to a French Pharmacovigilance Centre through a national web‐portal between March 2017 and March 2019 (n = 2,058 reports). We tested both conventional ML models and deep‐learning models. We performed an external validation using a dataset constituted of a random sample of ADRs reported to the Marseille Pharmacovigilance Centre over the same period (n = 187). Here, we show that regarding area under the curve (AUC) and F‐measure, the best model to identify ADRs was gradient boosting trees (LGBM), with an AUC of 0.93 (0.92–0.94) and F‐measure of 0.72 (0.68–0.75). This model was run for external validation showing an AUC of 0.91 and a F‐measure of 0.58.

There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production. Moreover, we have evaluated two of these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model and found both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.","Weston, Stuart; Coleman, Christopher M.; Haupt, Rob; Logue, James; Matthews, Krystal; Frieman, Matthew",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.008482,308

It is generally assumed that the way in which readers pronounce nonwords reflects their long-term knowledge of spelling–sound correspondences that exist in the writing system. The present study found considerable variability in how the same adults read the same 50 nonwords across five sessions. This variability was not all random: Nonwords that consisted of graphemes that had multiple possible pronunciations in English elicited more intraparticipant variation. Furthermore, over time, shifts in participants’ responses occurred such that some pronunciations became used more frequently, while others were pruned. We discuss possible mechanisms by which session-to-session variability arises and implications that our findings have for interpreting snapshot-based studies of nonword reading.

At present, there is no study to systematically analyse the features of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH) in COVID-19 patients with different ages, clinical types and outcomes. Methods: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, alpha-HBDH test results and outcomes of 131 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. Results: The alpha-HBDH value in greater than or equal to 61 years old group, severe group and critical group, death group all increased at first and then decreased, while no obvious changes were observed in other groups. And there were significant differences of the alpha-HBDH value among different age groups, clinical type groups and outcome groups. The optimal scale regression model showed that alpha-HBDH value and age were related to clinical type. Conclusions: alpha-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in greater than or equal to 61 years old, death and critical group, indicating that patients in these three groups suffer from more serious tissues and organs damage, higher alpha-HBDH value and risk of death. The obvious difference between death and survival group in early stage may provide a approach to judge the prognosis. The accuracy of the model to distinguish severe/critical type and other types is 85.84%, suggesting that alpha-HBDH could judge the clinical type of COVID-19 patients accurately. In brief, alpha-HBDH is an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","Zhu, H.; Qu, G.; Yu, H.; Huang, G.; Chen, L.; Zhang, M.; Wan, S.; Pei, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.29.20222612v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222612,308

678252,Noncontact Respiratory Monitoring Using Depth Sensing Cameras: A Review of Current Literature,2021-02-06,"A mannose-binding lectin (Narcissus tazetta lectin [NTL]) with potent antiviral activity was isolated and purified from the bulbs of the Chinese daffodil Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis, using ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose, affinity chromatography on mannose-agarose and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC)-gel filtration on Superose 12. The purified lectin was shown to have an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa by gel filtration and 13 kDa by SDS-PAGE, indicating that it is probably a dimer with two identical subunits. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of NTL as determined by molecular cloning also reveals that NTL protein contains a mature polypeptide consisting of 105 amino acids and a C-terminal peptide extension. Three-dimensional modelling study demonstrated that the NTL primary polypeptide contains three subdomains, each with a conserved mannose-binding site. It shows a high homology of about 60%–80% similarity with the existing monocot mannose-binding lectins. NTL could significantly inhibit plaque formation by the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with an IC(50) of 2.30 µg/ml and exhibit strong antiviral properties against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1) and influenza B viruses with IC(50) values ranging from 0.20 µg/ml to 1.33 µg/ml in a dose-dependent manner. It is worth noting that the modes of antiviral action of NTL against RSV and influenza A virus are significantly different. NTL is effective in the inhibition of RSV during the whole viral infection cycle, but the antiviral activity of NTL is mainly expressed at the early stage of the viral cycle of influenza A (H1N1) virus. NTL with a high selective index (SI=CC(50)/IC(50)≥141) resulting from its potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity demonstrates a potential for biotechnological development as an antiviral agent.","Ooi, Linda S.

680469,Breakthrough in breast reconstruction in the context of COVID-19: safety and efficiency of endoscopic breast reconstruction at a day surgery center.,2021-08-01,"Vaccines play a crucial role in improving global public health, with the ability to stem the spread of infectious diseases and the potential to eradicate them completely. Compared with pharmaceuticals that treat disease, however, preventative vaccines have received less attention from both biomedical researchers and innovation scholars. This neglect has substantial human and financial costs, as vividly illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the large number of ``missing'' vaccines is likely due to more than lack of scientific opportunities. Two key aspects of vaccines help account for their anemic development pipeline: (1) they are preventatives rather than treatments; and (2) they are generally durable goods with long-term effects rather than products purchased repeatedly. We explain how both aspects make vaccines less profitable than repeat-purchase treatments, even given comparable IP protection. We conclude by arguing that innovation policy should address these market distortions by experimenting with larger government-set rewards for vaccine production and use. Most modestly, policymakers should increase direct funding—including no grants and public-private partnerships—and insurance-based market subsidies for vaccine development. We also make the case for a large cash prize for any new vaccine made available at low or zero cost.","Xue, Qiwei Claire; Ouellette, Lisa Larrimore",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733687/,308
681231,Expedition into Exosome Biology: A Perspective of Progress from Discovery to Therapeutic Development,2021-03-08,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are two poultry pathogens affecting the respiratory tract of chickens, and cause major economic losses in the industry. Rapid detection of these viruses is crucial to inform implementation of appropriate control measures. The objective of our study is developing a simple, rapid and field applicable recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)–nucleic acid lateral flow (NALF) immunoassay for detection of NDV and IBV. Isothermal amplification of the matrix protein (M) gene of NDV and the nucleoprotein (N) gene of IBV was implemented via recombinase polymerase amplification at 38 °C for 40 min and 20 min, respectively using modified labeled primers. NALF device used in this study utilizes antibodies for detection of labeled RPA amplicons. The results revealed that RPA-NALF immunoassays can detect both viruses after 40 min at 38 °C and only NDV after 20 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 genomic copies/RPA reaction. The assays results on clinical samples collected from diseased chicken farms demonstrated a good performance in comparison with quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The assays established in this study can facilitate rapid, on-site molecular diagnosis of suspected cases of ND and IB viral infections as the results can be detected by the naked eye without the need for measuring fluorescence. Furthermore, the NALF device could be adapted to detect other infectious agents.","El-Tholoth, Mohamed; Branavan, Manoharanehru; Naveenathayalan, Angel; Balachandran, Wamadeva",Mol Biol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-05085-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549369/,308

A 30-year-old previously healthy male diagnosed 11 days earlier with COVID-19 presented with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. The patient was found to have an acute left carotid thrombus with embolic multifocal infarcts throughout the left cerebral hemisphere. He was treated acutely with intravenous heparin however developed gastrointestinal bleeding, prompting discontinuation of anticoagulation. Follow up CT angiography 12 days following his stroke demonstrated complete resolution of the thrombus. Since discharge, the patient has been managed with antiplatelet therapy alone with complete neurologic recovery. Large vessel strokes amongst young patients have been a growing concern during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The use of acute therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation is based on risk assessment. Albeit, the utility of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients remains undetermined. Prevention of stroke recurrence is a clinical priority for providers treating large vessel stroke patients.

681741,Life Imitates Art: The Physician in a Time of Plague,2020-04-11,"SARS-CoV-2 spreads quickly in dense populations, with serious implications for universities, workplaces, and other settings where exposure reduction practices are difficult to implement. Rapid screening has been proposed as a tool to slow the spread of the virus; however, many commonly used diagnostic tests (e.g., RT-qPCR) are expensive, difficult to deploy (e.g., require a nasopharyngeal specimen), and have extended turn-around times. We evaluated testing regimes that combined diagnostic testing using qPCR with high-frequency screening using a novel reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP, herein LAMP) assay. We used a compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate screening of a university population. We also developed a Shiny application to allow administrators and public health professionals to develop optimal testing strategies given site-specific assumptions about testing investment, target population, and cost. The frequency of screening, especially when pooling samples, was more important for minimizing epidemic size than test sensitivity, behavioral compliance, contact tracing capacity, and time between testing and results. Our results suggest that when testing budgets are limited, it is safer and more cost-effective to allocate the majority of funds to screening. Rapid, cost-effective, and scalable screening tests, like LAMP, should be viewed as critical components of SARS-CoV-2 testing in high-density populations.","Rogers, W.; Ruiz-Aravena, M.; Hansen, D.; Sonoma, W.

682042,Past and projected growth of Australia’s older migrant populations,2020-08-05,"Abstract Three transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) defective RNAs were selected by serial undiluted passage of the PUR46 strain in ST cells. These RNAs of 22, 10.6, and 9.7 kb (DI-A, DI-B, and DI-C, respectively) were detected at passage 30, remained stable upon further passage in cell culture, and significantly interfered with helper mRNA synthesis. RNA analysis from purified virions showed that the three defective RNAs were efficiently packaged. Virions of different densities containing either full-length or defective RNAs were sorted in sucrose gradients, indicating that defective and full-length genomes were independently encapsidated. DI-B and DI-C RNAs were amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. DI-B and DI-C genomes are formed by three and four discontinuous regions of the wild-type genome, respectively. DI-C contains 2144 nucleotides (nt) from the 5′-end of the genome, two fragments of 4540 and 2531 nt mostly from gene 1b, and 493 nt from the 3′ end of the genome. DI-B and DI-C RNAs include sequences with the pseudoknot motif and encoding the polymerase, metal ion binding, and helicase motifs. DI-B RNA has a structure closely related to DI-C RNA with two main differences: it maintains the entire ORF 1b and shows heterogeneity in the size of the 3′ end deletion. This heterogeneity maps at the beginning of the S gene, where other natural TGEV recombination events have been observed, suggesting that either a process of template switching occurs with high frequency at this point or that the derived genomes have a selective advantage.","MÉNDEZ, ANA; SMERDOU, CRISTIAN; IZETA, ANDER; GEBAUER, FÁTIMA; ENJUANES, LUIS",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682296901440; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682296901440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8610441/,308

This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: >= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P > 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P > 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.","Zhao, Zeyu; Zhu, Yuan-Zhao; Xu, Jing-Wen; Hu, Qing-Qing; Lei, Zhao; Rui, Jia; Liu, Xingchun; Wang, Yao; Luo, Li; Yu, Shan-Shan; Li, Jia; Liu, Ruo-Yun; Xie, Fang; Su, Ying-Ying; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Benhua; Chen, Tianmu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849,308

In this study, we explored the feasibility of using tracking data from a football match to assess interpersonal contact between individuals by calculating two measures of respiratory exposure. The dynamic tracking positioning of all players and referees during one international football match was analyzed. For each individual, two measures of respiratory exposure were calculated, based on the 2 m interpersonal distance recommendations for contact tracing for COVID-19 control. Overall, individuals spent a median of 0:12 mm:ss (IQR = 0:45 mm:ss) exposed to interpersonal contact of fewer than 2 m from others. The highest value of exposure was observed between two players of opposing teams (6:35 mm:ss). The results suggest that tracking data can be used to assess respiratory exposure to interpersonal contact in team sports, such as football. The measures of exposure calculated can be used to the prompt identification of high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases during a match or a training session, but also the risk stratification of different sports and physical activities.","Gonçalves, Bruno; Mendes, Romeu; Folgado, Hugo; Figueiredo, Pedro; Travassos, Bruno; Barros, Henrique; Campos-Fernandes, Adalberto; Beckert, Paulo; Brito, João",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20216163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138115/,308

Although evidence suggests postinfection immunity can be achieved, there have been reported cases of reinfection with similar or milder symptoms. Information on severe disease manifestation during reinfection is not known. We present a case of reinfection with a more severe presentation as compared with the initial infection. CASE REPORT: We describe a white male patient from a nursing home who was reinfected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with severe disease manifesting as dyspnea, fevers, and encephalopathy with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, elevated inflammatory markers, and lung infiltrates on imaging, after initially testing positive with mild symptoms 2 months prior to presentation. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies were detected, which indicated this was a coronavirus disease 2019 reinfection. After treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, he was subsequently extubated and discharged home after 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: It is not clear whether an initial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and recovery provides prolonged immunity beyond 2 months. Furthermore, even if antibodies are present, it does not guarantee an attenuated course during reinfection. Therefore, vaccination plays an important role in prevention.

The virus containing an expressed HE protein (A59-DE-HE) was generated by infecting cells with MHV-A59, which does not express HE, and transfecting thein vitro-transcribed DI RNA containing the HE gene. A similar virus (A59-DE-CAT) expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used as a control. These viruses were inoculated intracerebrally into mice, and the role of the HE protein in viral pathogenesis was evaluated. Results showed that all mice infected with parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT succumbed to infection by 9 days postinfection (p.i.), demonstrating that inclusion of the DI did not by itself alter pathogenesis. In contrast, 60% of mice infected with A59-DE-HE survived infection. HE- or CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs were detected in the brains at days 1 and 2 p.i. but not later, indicating that the genes in the DI vector were expressed only in the early stage of viral infection. No significant difference in virus titer or viral antigen expression in brains was observed between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice, suggesting that virus replication in brain was not affected by the expression of HE. However, at day 3 p.i. there was a slight increase in the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. Surprisingly, virus titers in the livers of A59-DE-HE-infected mice were 3 log10lower than that of the A59-DE-CAT-infected mice at day 6 p.i. Also, substantially less necrosis and viral antigen were detected in the livers of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. This may account for the reduced mortality of these mice. The possible contribution of the host immune system to this difference in pathogenesis was analyzed by comparing the expression of four cytokines. Results showed that both tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 mRNAs increased in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice at day 2 p.i., whereas interferon-γ and interleukin-1α mRNAs were similar between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. These data suggest that the transient expression of HE protein enhances an early innate immune response, possibly contributing to the eventual clearance of virus from the liver. This study indicates the feasibility of the DI expression system for studying roles of viral proteins during MHV infection.","Zhang, Xuming; Hinton, David R.; Park, Sungmin; Parra, Beatriz; Liao, Ching-Len; Lai, Michael M.C.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501044/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297989935; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297989935,308

The chirality of these flavonolignans is also discussed in terms of their analysis, preparative separation and chemical reactions. We demonstrated the specific activities of the respective diastereomers of flavonolignans and also the enantiomers of their 2,3-dehydro derivatives in the 3D anisotropic systems typically represented by biological systems. In vivo, silymarin flavonolignans do not act as redox antioxidants, but they play a role as specific ligands of biological targets, according to the “lock-and-key” concept. Estrogenic, antidiabetic, anticancer, antiviral, and antiparasitic effects have been demonstrated in optically pure flavonolignans. Potential application of pure flavonolignans has also been shown in cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes and modulation of multidrug resistance activity by these compounds are discussed in detail.
