Case Report,2021-02-05,"Energy, water, and food shortages, along with irreversible environmental damage and climate changes, are bound to happen within a decade if the current course of action is maintained, preparing the “perfect storm”–a chain of interrelated events that could lead to major stress on the global system. Energy plays a central role in the complex balance between humankind and the planet: poor strategies for the energy system will lead to disaster; but immediate, radical action can still mitigate what will otherwise be an unprecedented crisis. Reduction of the carbon intensity at the level of primary energy demand is one of the most impactful strategies. Current actions toward this goal, however, including the Nationally Determined Contributions (i.e., the climate actions pledged by the countries that ratified the Paris Agreements), are far from being adequate, and a much stronger effort is required. In this perspective, we draw inspiration from a visionary scientist of the past century, who pioneered the idea of a society powered by solar energy, and show, by a critical presentation of energy and carbon emission data, how this vision is now coming true. We focus our attention in particular to photovoltaics and analyze the factors that make it one of the key energy sources for the short and for the long term: economical convenience, the opening of very large markets, and the push by key players of the energy system.","Fermeglia, Maurizio; Lughi, Vanni; Massi Pavan, Alessandro",MRS Energy & Sustainability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7851505/,739

59365,Games supporting organ donation: an interview with Dr Ka-foon Chau.,2020-06-01,"Within the context of scientific research, patient and public involvement (PPI) is defined as research performed “with” or “by” patients and members of the public, rather than “to,” “about”, or “for” them. When carried out systematically and thoughtfully, PPI has the potential to strengthen the quality and impact of research by fostering accountability, transparency, and relevance. There exist numerous guidelines, frameworks and tools for supporting PPI, however, these do not account for the unique challenges faced in psychedelic research. This paper describes the co-design of guidance intended to help build, evaluate and improve PPI in psychedelic research. A steering group was formed to design and run a co-design workshop alongside public collaborators. Insights from this workshop were analyzed and refined into a comprehensive and readily usable guide for planning PPI specific to the field of psychedelic research. Core values emerging from the process focused on the essential importance of trust, learning, purpose and inclusivity. It is hoped that this guidance will be a starting point for incorporating PPI in future psychedelic research, so that it can grow and adapt as this burgeoning field of research progresses.","Close, James B.; Bornemann, Julia; Piggin, Maria; Jayacodi, Sandra; Luan, Lisa Xiaolu; Carhart-Harris, Robin; Spriggs, Meg Jo",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514741/,739
59367,"[Thoughts and suggestions on arrangement, analysis and summary of medical data during COVID-19 epidemic].",2020-04-01,"Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease that can cause bleeding in severe cases. Although available published data do not associate the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) with the risk of developing thrombocytopenia, the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine has raised concerns about its potential link with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. We would like to clarify whether the BNT162b2 vaccine administration may interfere with pre-existing conditions and whether it may cause a risk of thrombocytopenia. Herein, we report three cases of post-vaccine thrombocytopenia among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); one case in which a causal relationship cannot be ruled out with the BNT162b2 vaccine was officially announced. Furthermore, we reviewed reports of adverse events and death cases with a focus on thrombocytopenia and hemorrhages, following vaccination with BNT162b2 in Japan between February 17, 2021 and July 16, 2021, as reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare within the general population. The three cases in this report share the common features of old age, RA, chronic renal failure or hypertension, and pre-existing mild thrombocytopenia at baseline. A total of 746 death cases were reported during this time period, with death by bleeding accounting for 8.8% of the total deaths, of which 84.8% were cranial and statistically higher in young women than among elderly women. The risk-benefit ratio of the vaccine needs to be reconsidered based on high- and low-risk population types and ethnicity. To do so, the expansion of the pharmacovigilance system for BNT162b2 vaccination is urgently required worldwide.","Okada, Yusuke; Sakai, Ryota; Sato-Fitoussi, Marie; Nodera, Marika; Yoshinaga, Shoichi; Shibata, Akiko; Kurasawa, Takahiko; Kondo, Tsuneo; Amano, Koichi",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514746/,739
61395,[Discussion on diagnosis and treatment of hepatobiliary malignancies during the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia].,2020-02-28,"BACKGROUND Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) continues to evolve. This study investigated the feasibility and outcome of performing localized sigmoidectomy in its entirety via NOTES. METHODS A survival study of five male minipigs (mean weight, 30 kg) was conducted. After anesthesia, a gastrotomy was created by a per os double-channel endoscope, and full peritoneoscopy was performed. A Berci needle then was inserted transparietally to allow maintenance and monitoring of the pneumoperitoneum. Using a transanal probe to facilitate intestinal retraction, the mesentery was dissected with instruments worked through the channels of the transgastric endoscope. The anvil of a circular stapler then was passed per anum into the colon above the point of intended transection. A penetrating transrectal trocar was placed to allow entry of a linear stapler into the peritoneum through a colotomy, and the sigmoid was cross-stapled proximally. The strut of the anvil then was snugged into a colotomy made at this staple line. The specimen was delivered via the anus by a ""pull-through"" technique. The distal sigmoidal margin was cross-stapled extracorporeally, ensuring that the colotomy was included within the specimen. Retrograde passage of the circular stapler head per anus allowed colocolonic reanastomosis by its mating with the anvil already in situ. The gastrotomy was closed with a previously validated prosthesis. Postoperatively, all the animals were recovered and monitored for well-being during convalescence. Endoscopy (gastroscopy and sigmoidoscopy), laparoscopy, and laparotomy were performed on postoperative day 14 as follow-up measures. RESULTS Each operation was satisfactorily completed. The mean operative time was 76 min (range, 44-95 min). All the animals prospered postoperatively. Follow-up examination showed full healing of all anastomoses and gastrotomy sites. There was no evidence of luminal stricturing, peritonitis, or intraabdominal sepsis in any animal. CONCLUSIONS Using this experimental model, colonic resection and reanastomosis can be performed safely within the NOTES format.","Leroy, Joel; Cahill, Ronan A; Perretta, Silvana; Forgione, Antonello; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-0102-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18814015/,739
62354,Perils of pandemic waves in COVID-19.,2021-02-02,"Despite the massive toll in human suffering imparted by degenerative lung disease, including COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS, the scientific community has been surprisingly agnostic regarding the potential of lung tissue, and in particular the alveoli, to regenerate. However, there is circumstantial evidence in humans and direct evidence in mice that ARDS triggers robust regeneration of lung tissue rather than irreversible fibrosis. The stem cells responsible for this remarkable regenerative process has garnered tremendous attention, most recently yielding a defined set of cloned human airway stem cells marked by p63 expression but with distinct commitment to differentiated cell types typical of the upper or lower airways, the latter of which include alveoli-like structures in vitro and in vivo. These recent advances in lung regeneration and distal airway stem cells and the potential of associated soluble factors in regeneration must be harnessed for therapeutic options in chronic lung disease.","Xian, Wa; McKeon, Frank",Cell cycle,https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.11.5.19328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22333577/,739
62972,"[The medical research of ""chicken blood therapy""].",2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE T-helper type 17 (Th17) cells produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and help to protect against inflammation and infection in periodontal disease. Furthermore, while follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein (FDC-SP) may be involved in the inflammation of periodontal tissue, the biological role of FDP-SP in periodontal disease is still unknown. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the expression of IL-17 and FDC-SP in experimental periodontitis in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seven-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into baseline control, sham and test groups. Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing a ligature in the mesiopalatal area, and untreated rats served as a baseline control group. Morphological changes in alveolar bone were investigated 7, 14 and 28 d after treatment. Expression of the Rankl, osteoprotegerin (Opg) and Il17 genes was analyzed 5 and 7 d after the induction of experimental periodontitis. RESULTS Alveolar bone resorption progressed in the test group for 7 d, but not thereafter. At 5 d after the induction of periodontitis, the Rankl/Opg mRNA ratio and the expression of IL-17 in the test group were significantly increased compared with the respective values in the baseline control group; however, there were no significant differences between the test and control groups at 7 d. The expression of FDC-SP was significantly decreased in the test group compared with the baseline control group at 5 and 7 d after the induction of periodontitis, and this value had returned to normal levels at 14 and 28 d. CONCLUSION These results suggest that both IL-17 and FDC-SP could be involved in the inflammatory response, and FDC-SP in the junctional epithelium might play an important role in the Th17 cell-related immune response.","Takahashi, S; Fukuda, M; Mitani, A; Fujimura, T; Iwamura, Y; Sato, S; Kubo, T; Sugita, Y; Maeda, H; Shinomura, T; Noguchi, T",Journal of periodontal research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jre.12118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23869744/,739
63678,[Strengthening basic and clinical research on ocular infection caused by coronavirus].,2020-04-11,"OBJECTIVES No hearing-related quality of life (QL) questionnaire currently exists for children < 7 years. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the construct validity and reliability of a new parent-proxy Preschool Hearing Environments and Reflection on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL) questionnaire. METHODS Parents of children 2 to 6 years old with any hearing loss (HL) were recruited from multiple sites. To evaluate the new measure's construct validity, participants completed a 70-item preschool HEAR-QL and validated questionnaires measuring hearing and communication functioning (Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children), generic pediatric QL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Parent Report, PedsQL), family functioning (PedsQL Family Impact Module), and parent well-being (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Adult Global Report). Participants completed the preschool HEAR-QL 2 weeks later to measure test-retest reliability. Exploratory principal components analysis was used to reduce the number of items and determine the underlying HEAR-QL factor structure. Analysis of variance examined HEAR-QL differences by HL. RESULTS Among 205 parents, 144 had children with bilateral HL, 50 had children with unilateral HL, 10 had children with normal hearing (NH), and one child's hearing status was unspecified. The 70-item questionnaire was reduced to 23 items with five underlying factors: Behavior and Attention, Hearing Environments, New Social Situations, Social Interactions, and Communication. Cronbach's alpha for each factor ranged from 0.80 to 0.91. Test-retest reliability was 0.93. Moderate-to-strong correlations (r > .300) were observed between each Preschool HEAR-QL factor and previously validated measures. Hearing Environments scores differed significantly between children with NH and any HL. CONCLUSION Preschool HEAR-QL correlations with other measures supported its construct validity. Discriminant validity testing requires a larger sample of children with NH.

AIM We evaluated if in-hospital administration of heparin improved survival in a large cohort of Italian COVID-19 patients. METHODS In a retrospective observational study, 2,574 unselected patients hospitalised in 30 clinical centres in Italy from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were analysed. The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received heparin (low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH)) with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores. RESULTS Out of 2,574 COVID-19 patients, 70.1% received heparin. LMWH was largely the most used formulation (99.5%). Death rates for patients receiving heparin or not were 7.4 and 14.0 per 1,000 person-days, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found a 40% lower risk of death in patients receiving heparin (HR=0.60; 95%CI: 0.49 to 0.74; E-value=2.04). This association was particularly evident in patients with a higher severity of disease or strong coagulation activation. CONCLUSIONS In-hospital heparin treatment was associated with lower mortality, particularly in severely ill COVID-19 patients and in those with strong coagulation activation. The results from randomised clinical trials are eagerly awaited to provide clear-cut recommendations.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto Filippo; Costanzo, Simona; Iacoviello, Licia",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1347-6070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412596/,739

METHODS The data were collected from the Obesity Surgery Registry at Førde Central Hospital and consists of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between April 2001 and February 2013. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of sickness absence and disability pension. RESULTS The sample consisted of 576 patients (63.9 % females) with a mean (range, SD) age of 41.7 (18-66, 10.6) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 47.7 (32.5-80.8, 7.7). Patients working full- or part-time comprised 55.6 % of the sample and 29.7 % received a disability pension; only 46.4 % of the sample received an income from paid work without additional benefits. Having a BMI above 50, lower levels of education, and suffering from four or more comorbidities were significant predictors of sickness absence. Female gender, psychiatric disorders, lower levels of education, asthma, heart failure and suffering from four or more comorbidities were significant predictors of disability pension. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of the work participation and disability pension among this morbidly obese population is of substantial concern, as work participation has proven important for the health-related quality of life. This, combined with the fact that these patients are significantly less educated than the general population, can potentially have grave socioeconomic consequences. Increased knowledge of obesity development and the work history of these patients are needed to implement policies that ensure increased rates of work participation.","Hernæs, Ulrikke J V; Andersen, John R; Norheim, Ole F; Våge, Villy",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1333-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980085/,739
68681,[Consideration and prevention for the aerosol transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus].,2020-03-14,"BACKGROUND Early diagnosis and supportive treatments are essential to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, the current study aimed to determine different patterns of syndromic symptoms and sensitivity and specificity of each of them in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study . METHODS In this study, the retrospective data of 1,539 patients suspected of COVID-19 were obtained from a local registry under the supervision of the officials at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was carried out on syndromic symptoms, and the associations of some risk factors and latent subclasses were accessed using one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test. RESULTS The LCA indicated that there were three distinct subclasses of syndromic symptoms among the COVID-19 suspected patients. The age, former smoking status, and body mass index were associated with the categorization of individuals into different subclasses. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of class 2 (labeled as ""High probability of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]+"") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 67.43% and 76.17%, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of class 3 (labeled as ""Moderate probability of PCR+"") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 75.92% and 50.23%, respectively.

Subsequently, we evaluated the frequency of recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention. METHODS Data from 622 consecutive patients undergoing VATS lobectomy from January 2009 to December 2011 were registered prospectively in an institutional database. Data included age, gender, lobe(s) resected, bleeding and duration of surgery. Follow-up was 30 days from discharge. All complications requiring pleurocentesis or reinsertion of a chest tube, and all readmissions were registered. Twenty-three patients were excluded due to missing data, in-hospital mortality and loss to follow-up, leaving 599 for final analysis. Our primary outcome was the number of patients requiring reintervention due to recurrent pleural effusion. Secondary outcomes included time of chest tube removal and time to discharge. The incidence of recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention was compared between three groups according to the postoperative day (POD) of chest tube removal (Day 0-1, 2-3 and ≥4, respectively) using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Pleural effusion after chest tube removal required reintervention in 17 patients (2.8%). Of these, 7 needed readmission. Median time from surgery to chest tube removal was 2 days, and median time from surgery to discharge was 4 days. No statistically significant association was found between the incidence of reinterventions due to recurrent pleural effusion and the POD of chest tube removal (P=0.50). The median time from chest tube removal to discharge was 1 day in all groups. Of the patients who needed reintervention, none had complications regarding this, except one who developed pneumothorax after pleurocentesis. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that chest tube removal after VATS lobectomy is safe despite volumes of serous fluid production up to 500 ml/day. The proportion of patients who developed pleural effusion necessitating reintervention was low (2.8%), and a complication of the reintervention was seen in only 1 patient.","Bjerregaard, Lars S; Jensen, Katrine; Petersen, Rene Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezt376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872457/,739
72354,[Clinical characteristics and outcomes of 112 cardiovascular disease patients infected by 2019-nCoV].,2020-03-02,"Considering the high prevalence of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA), it is expected that many patients with the disorder are traveling to altitude. However, this may expose them to the risk of pronounced hypoxemia, exacerbation of nocturnal breathing disturbances by frequent central apneas, impaired daytime performance, and high blood pressure. Recently, randomized studies specifically investigated the effects of altitude (1630-2590 m) in OSA patients and the optimal treatment in this setting. The results indicate that patients should continue to use continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) when sleeping at altitude. Since CPAP alone does not control central sleep apnea emerging at altitude, combined treatment with acetazolamide and CPAP should be considered, in particular, in patients with severe OSA and co-morbidities. Supplemental oxygen combined with CPAP might be advantageous in patients with OSA and concomitant cardiopulmonary disease by preventing hypoxemia and central sleep apnea. In patients unable to use CPAP or if electrical power is not available, an optimally fitted mandibular advancement device might be an alternative treatment option that can be combined with acetazolamide during altitude sojourns. Acetazolamide alone is also beneficial and better than no treatment at all, since it improves oxygen saturation, breathing disturbances, and the excessive blood pressure elevation in OSA patients traveling to altitude.","Latshang, Tsogyal D; Bloch, Konrad E",High altitude medicine & biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/ham.2011.1055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22206552/,739

METHODS Physical and haematological information was obtained from clinical records. White blood cell counts, and percentages of neutrophilic granulocytes and neutrophilic lymphocytes were measured. The service department of the hospital provided information about daily use of protective materials. Differences in clinical symptoms between probable and suspected SARS cases were tested by Fisher's exact test. Non-linear mixed modelling was used to test for differences between the haematological patterns for probable and suspected cases. Risk factors for dying among probable SARS cases were tested by logistic regression. RESULTS The SARS outbreak started with a patient from Beijing on 15 April 2003, and spread quickly among the healthcare workers and in-patients in the hospital. In total 90 probable and 21 suspected cases were reported, with 17 deaths among them (case fatality rate 15%). Haematological patterns were significantly different between probable and suspected cases, whereas the percentages with certain clinical symptoms showed no apparent difference. Death of probable SARS cases was only significantly associated with high age and use of a respiratory machine (mainly for the most severe cases), whereas e.g. co-morbidity and steroid treatment showed no impact in multivariate analysis. Stringent control measures, including distribution of huge numbers of protective materials, started on 20 April, which soon lead to a strong decrease in the incidence of new cases. After the last SARS case left the hospital on 6 June, protective materials were dispensed at substantially lower rates, but not to zero, as was the case during the first days of the outbreak. CONCLUSION The working definition of probable SARS used during the epidemic appeared to have been fairly accurate. Many valuable lessons were learned regarding prevention of hospital spread of infection, especially the need to have sufficient protective supplies available and to implement these rigidly and at an early stage of an (threatening) epidemic.","Wei, Mao-Ti; de Vlas, Sake J; Yang, Zhen; Borsboom, Gerard J J M; Wang, Lihong; Li, Haiying; Li, Yuming; Zhang, Zhilun; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Wang, Shi-Xin",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02347.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19814762/,739

The literature is scarce regarding the effects of obesity on laparoscopic rectal surgery. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effect of an increased body mass index (BMI) on outcome of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic rectal resection were allocated to one of three groups according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obese (BMI ≥ 30). These three groups were compared with each other in terms of patient demographics, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications and histopathological data. RESULTS There were 100 patients operated on for rectal cancer. The median BMI of the patients was 27 (range 18.5-40) kg/m(2), and 43, 43 and 14 patients were classified as normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively. The conversion rate was 4.7% in the overweight group and 0% in the other groups. The proportion of complications and oncological outcomes between the groups showed no significant difference (p > 0.05).

Although, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic pathways of VC are not fully known, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and the suppression of parathyroid hormone activity are central to the development of vessel mineralization and, consequently, bone demineralization. In addition to preventive measures, such as the modification of atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors, current treatment strategies include the use of calcium-free phosphate binders, vitamin D analogs, and calcium mimetics that have shown promising results, albeit in small patient cohorts. The impact of intimal and medial VC on the safety and effectiveness of endovascular devices to treat symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains poorly defined. The absence of a generally accepted, validated vascular calcium grading scale hampers clinical progress in assessing the safety and utility of various endovascular devices (e.g., atherectomy) in treating calcified vessels. Accordingly, we propose the peripheral arterial calcium scoring system (PACSS) and a method for its clinical validation. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and the development of optimal medical and endovascular treatment strategies are crucial as the population ages and presents with more chronic comorbidities.","Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Zeller, Thomas; Jaff, Michael R",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.25387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402839/,739

In this study, we characterize the effect of high-fat diet on the mouse corneal neuroimmune phenotype, including changes to corneal nerve density and resident immune cells, alongside the clinical assessment of corneal thickness and endothelial cell density. METHODS Male C57Bl6/J mice, aged 10 weeks, were fed a high-fat diet (60 kcal% fat, 5.2 kcal/g) or control diet (10 kcal%, 3.8 kcal/g) for 16 weeks. At the study endpoint, metabolic parameters (HbA1c, weight, fasting glucose, body fat) were measured to confirm metabolic disturbance. Clinical imaging of the anterior segment was performed using optical coherence tomography to measure the corneal epithelial and stromal thickness. Corneal sensory nerves were visualized using flatmount immunostaining and confocal microscopy. The topographical distribution and density of sensory nerves (BIII-tubulin+), intraepithelial CD45+ and MHC- II+ cells, stromal macrophages (IBA1+CD206+) and endothelial cells (ZO-1+) were analysed using FIJI. RESULTS High-fat diet mice had significantly higher blood HbA1c, higher body weight, a higher percentage of body fat and elevated fasting glucose compared to the control diet mice. Corneal epithelial and stromal thickness was similar in both groups. The sum length of the basal nerve plexus was lower in the central and peripheral cornea of mice fed a high-fat diet. In contrast, the sum length of superficial nerve terminals was similar between groups. Epithelial immune cell density was two-fold higher in the central corneas of high-fat diet mice compared to control diet mice. IBA1+CD206+ macrophage density was similar in the anterior stroma of both groups but was significantly higher in the posterior stroma of the peripheral cornea in the high-fat diet mice compared to controls. The percentage of nerve-associated MHC-II+ cells in the epithelium and stroma was higher in HFD mice compared to controls. Endothelial cell density was similar in the corneas of high-fat diet mice compared to controls. CONCLUSION Together with corneal neuropathy, corneal immune cells in mice fed a high-fat diet were differentially affected depending on their topographical distribution and location within cornea, and appeared in closer proximity to epithelial and stromal nerves, suggesting a local neuroimmune disruption induced by systemic metabolic disturbance.","Jiao, Haihan; Lim, Alicia Sl; Fazio Coles, Therese E; McQuade, Rachel M; Furness, John B; Chinnery, Holly R",Experimental eye research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2020.108298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069696/,739

While knowing the full range of host species is important, a seasonal investigation into the use of non-crop plants adjacent to cropping systems provide key insights into some of the factors determining local population dynamics. This study investigated the infestation of non-crop plants by the invasive Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), a pest of numerous economically important stone and small fruit crops, by sampling fruit-producing non-crop hosts adjacent to commercial plantings weekly from June through November in central New York over a two-year period. We found D. suzukii infestation rates (number of flies emerged/kg fruit) peaked mid-August through early September, with Rubus allegheniensis Porter and Lonicera morrowii Asa Gray showing the highest average infestation in both years. Interannual infestation patterns were similar despite a lower number of adults caught in monitoring traps the second year, suggesting D. suzukii host use may be density independent.","Elsensohn, Johanna E; Loeb, Gregory M",Insects,https://doi.org/10.3390/insects9010005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29301358/,739

It is challenging and potentially time-consuming. We aimed to identify preoperative patient characteristics predictive of a successful SI-LAGB. Demographic and anthropometric data were prospectively collected. Primary endpoint was operating time. Adequate operating time (AOT) was determined using a historic consecutive of 100 subjects undergoing multi-port LAGB. The cutoff for AOT was defined as mean + 1 SD of the historic cohort. Binary logistic regression analysis was used in univariate and multivariate modeling to identify independent preoperative variables associated with AOT. From February 2009 to October 2010, 79 patients (71 female) underwent SI-LAGB, with no conversions to multi-port laparoscopy. Mean operating time was 61 ± 27 min. The cohort was divided into two groups: AOT (n = 53) and excessive operating time, (EOT, n = 26) based on cutoff value of 69 min. On univariate analysis, preoperative BMI had significant (p = 0.03) counterintuitive effect on operative time (AOT 44.2 ± 6.2 kg/m(2) versus EOT 42.1 ± 4.2 kg/m(2)). Hiatal hernia was also significant predictor of EOT (19.2% versus 3.7%; p = 0.001) and remained an independent predictor of EOT in multivariate logistic regression after adjusting for covariates, increasing the chance for EOT by 5.9 times (odd ratio 5.9; 95% CI 1.1-31.1; p = 0.04). SI-LAGB can be performed safely and timely. Concomitant hiatal hernia could be successfully repaired during a SI-LAGB but at the cost of significant additional operating time.","Cheregi, John R; Tiesenga, Fred; Torquati, Alfonso; Lutfi, Rami",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-011-0552-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22116594/,739

The current COVID-19 pandemic has left the world in a unique state of crisis. The aim of this analysis was to explore whether Google searches can be used to retrospectively retrace the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and to detect local outbreaks by reflecting public interest in the virus. METHODS Google Trends was used to explore the relative search volume (RSV) related to ""coronavirus"" from January 2020 to July 2020 in Germany. The RSV ranging between 0-100 was compared to new SARS-CoV-2 infections per day on a national level and to the cumulative infection numbers on a state level, as well as to important infectiological and political events. RESULTS The most striking search peaks occurred after the first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany (January 27), during a major local outbreak in Heinsberg (February 25), after school closings (March 13) and the largest peak after nationwide contact restrictions (March 22) were announced. On a state level, peaks in RSV were observed after the first reported infection in each respective state. In addition, a higher RSV was recorded in states with higher numbers of infections (r=0,6, p=0,014) such as in Bavaria (RSV=96, 391 infections/100,000 inhabitants) and Baden-Württemberg (RSV=98, 340 infections/100,000 inhabitants). The lowest RSV (n=83) and lowest number of infections (50 infections/100,000 inhabitants) was observed in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Since the end of May, SARS-CoV-2 related RSV remained at low level even when numbers of infections were temporarily rising due to local outbreaks such as the outbreak in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia. CONCLUSION RSV related to ""coronavirus"" precisely reflected public interest during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As public interest has strongly declined, information distribution regarding the newest developments over the entire course of the pandemic will be a major public health challenge. ZIEL DER STUDIE Während Pandemien ist die gesamte Gesellschaft zur gleichen Zeit mit derselben Erkrankung konfrontiert, was zu großem öffentlichen Interesse führt. Die aktuelle COVID-19 Pandemie hat die ganze Welt in einen einmaligen Ausnahmezustand versetzt. Ziel dieser Studie war es zu untersuchen ob das Pandemiegeschehen in Deutschland anhand von Google Suchanfragen retrospektiv rekonstruiert werden kann und ob lokale Ausbrüche mithilfe von Google Daten detektiert werden können. METHODIK Das relative Google Suchvolumen (RSV) zum Thema ""Coronavirus"" wurde für den Zeitraum von Januar bis Juli 2020 mit Google Trends analysiert. Das RSV, das zwischen 0 und 100 betragen kann, wurde auf Bundesebene mit den täglich neu gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2 Infektionszahlen und auf Länderebene mit den kumulativen Infektionszahlen pro Bundesland sowie wichtigen infektiologischen und politischen Ereignissen verglichen. ERGEBNISSE Höchstwerte im Google Suchvolumen nach der ersten gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektion in Deutschland (27. Januar), während des lokalen Ausbruchs in Heinsberg (25. Februar), nach den Schulschließungen (13. März) sowie, der absolute Höchstwert, nach Verkündung der bundesweiten Kontaktbeschränkungen (22. März) verzeichnet worden. Auf Bundesländerebene wurde immer dann ein Anstieg im Suchvolumen beobachtet, wenn die erste SARS-CoV-2 Infektion im jeweiligen Bundesland gemeldet wurde. Zudem wurde ein höheres RSV in Bundesländern mit mehr gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen registriert (r=0,6, p=0,014), wie z. B. in Bayern (RSV=96, 391 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) und Baden-Württemberg (RSV=98, 340 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner). Das niedrigste RSV (n=83) und die niedrigste Anzahl an Infektionen (50 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) wurde in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern beobachtet. Seit Ende Mai ist das RSV bezüglich SARS-CoV-2 konstant gering, obwohl die Zahl an Neuinfektionen zwischenzeitlich aufgrund lokaler Ausbrüche gestiegen war wie z. B. der lokale Ausbruch in Gütersloh, Nordrhein-Westfalen. SCHLUßFOLGERUNG: Das RSV zum Thema ""Coronavirus"" bildeten das öffentliche Interesse während der ersten Monate der COVID-19 Pandemie präzise ab. Da das öffentliche Interesse jedoch stark nachgelassen hat, könnte es eine zentrale Herausforderung im weiteren Verlauf der Pandemie darstellen, die Bevölkerung weiterhin über neueste Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen informiert zu halten.","Schuster, Barbara; Tizek, Linda; Schielein, Maximilian C; Ziehfreund, Stefanie; Rothe, Kathrin; Spinner, Christoph D; Biedermann, Tilo; Zink, Alexander",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1398-5417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33862647/,739

The present study aimed to obtain further information regarding the effects of these toxins on neurodevelopment by investigating the responses of murine subventricular zone (SVZ) neural progenitors to STXs. An in vitro neonatal mouse SVZ explant model was exposed to different concentrations of toxic cyanobacterial extracts to evaluate the migration and differentiation of SVZ-derived progenitor cells. To test the ability of STX to cross the placental barrier, pregnant mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of STXs (7.5 μg/kg body weight) on gestational day fifteen. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect proliferating and differentiating progenitors, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). It was found that specific proliferation of OPCs was significantly increased, but there was no corresponding increase in the number of differentiated oligodendrocytes, which may indicate a negative effect on the maturation process of these cells. Additionally, the data showed that STXs crossed the placental barrier. Thus, STXs can be considered a potential risk to fetal neurodevelopment.","Lima-Filho, Cesar Macedo; Nogaroli, Luciana; Hedin-Pereira, Cecilia; Azevedo, Sandra M F O; Soares, Raquel M",Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.10.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069750/,739

We therefore hypothesise that targeting IFN directly to the intended site of action in the liver would reduce exposure in blood and peripheral tissue and hence improve the safety and tolerability of IFNα therapy. Furthermore we investigated whether directing IFN to the reservoir of infection in the liver may improve antiviral efficacy by increasing local concentration in target organs and tissues. Our previous results show that the mIFNα2 fused to an ASGPR specific liver targeting antibody, DOM26h-196-61, results in a fusion protein which retains the activity of both fusion partners when measured in vitro. In vivo targeting of the liver by mIFNα2-DOM26h-196-61, hereafter referred to as targeted mIFNα2, was observed in microSPECT imaging studies in mice. In this study we show by pharmacokinetic analysis that antibody mediated liver-targeting results in increased uptake and exposure of targeted mIFNα2 in target tissues, and correspondingly reduced uptake and exposure in systemic circulation, clearance organs and non-target tissues. We also show that cytokine activity and antiviral activity of liver-targeted IFN is observed in vivo, but that, contrary to expectations, liver-targeting of mIFNα2 using ASGPR specific dAbs actually leads to a reduced pharmacodynamic effect in target organs and lower antiviral activity in vivo when compared to non-targeted mIFNα2-dAb fusions.","Rycroft, Daniel; Sosabowski, Jane; Coulstock, Edward; Davies, Marie; Morrey, John; Friel, Sarah; Kelly, Fiona; Hamatake, Robert; Ovečka, Milan; Prince, Rob; Goodall, Laura; Sepp, Armin; Walker, Adam",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25689509/,739

The effects of two herbal medicines namely Zingiber officinale and Echinacea on alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate of suspected COVID-19 outpatients were examined. METHODS A clinical trial with 100 suspected COVID-19 outpatients as participants was conducted. The participants were allocated randomly to two groups of 50 members. The intervention group received concurrent Zingiber officinale (Tablet Vomigone 500 mg II tds) and Echinacea (Tablet Rucoldup I tds) for seven days in addition to the standard treatment. The control group only received the standard treatment (Hydroxychloroquine). After seven days, alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate were examined. In addition, 14 days after treatment, the hospitalization was assessed again by telephone follow up. RESULTS The two groups were identical in terms of basic characteristics. Improvement level as to coughing, dyspnea, and muscle pain was higher in the intervention group (p value <0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the other symptoms.

METHOD In a telephone survey post-migration living difficulties and psychopathological symptoms were investigated, particularly post-traumatic thoughts and nightmares, anxiety, depression, feelings of tension and irritability, other sleep problems, as well as COVID-19 related fears. Psychopathological changes during the lockdown were detected and rated by clinicians. Rates of treatment discontinuation and reasons why were also recorded. RESULTS Of 103 eligible patients, 81 answered the phone call and were included in the study. Mental symptoms were frequent but not as severe as expected. About 32% of patients in psychopharmacological treatment and almost 52% of patients in psychotherapy had discontinued treatment. Patients who were globally considered to have worsened if compared to their pre-coronavirus mental health conditions had in fact higher scores on several mental symptoms but mild specific fears about coronavirus issues, similar to those of patients improved or stable. Worsening was significantly associated with unemployment, lack of VISA, and treatment discontinuation. Shifting the way of providing psychotherapy into a web-based modality was significantly more frequent in stable/improved patients.

Real-world data outside of published studies are limited. The aim of this study was a detailed analysis of the outcomes of colonoscopic eFTR in different hospitals from different care levels in correlation with the number of endoscopists performing eFTR. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case series, the data of all patients who underwent eFTR between November 2014 and June 2019 (performed by a total of 22 endoscopists) in 7 hospitals were analyzed retrospectively regarding rates of technical success, R0 resection, and procedure-related complications. RESULTS Colonoscopic eFTR was performed in 229 patients (64.6% men; average age 69.3 ± 10.3 years) mainly on the basis of the following indication: 69.9% difficult adenomas, 21.0% gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, and 7.9% subepithelial tumors. The average size of the lesions was 16.3 mm. Technical success rate of eFTR was achieved in 83.8% (binominal confidence interval 78.4-88.4%). Overall, histologically complete resection (R0) was achieved in 77.2% (CI 69.8-83.6%) while histologically proven full-wall excidate was confirmed in 90.0% (CI 85.1-93.7%). Of the resectates obtained (n = 210), 190 were resected en bloc (90.5%). We did not observe a clear improvement of technical success and R0 resection rate over time by the performing endoscopists. Altogether, procedure-related complications were observed in 17.5% (mostly moderate) including 2 cases of acute gangrenous appendicitis requiring operation.

This reveals a need for more attention to political aspects of health outcome inequities. As advocates for health equity, nurses can join in recent scholarship and activism concerning the political determinants of health. In this paper, we examine recent work on the political determinants of health with an aim to add two things. First, we seek to build further on the notion of ""political"" determinants of health by distinguishing policy and governance structures from dynamics of politicization through appeal to critical disabilities studies. Second, we seek to apply this further nuanced approach to challenge rhetorical uses of ""vulnerable populations,"" where this phrase serves to misrecognize systemic institutionalized forces that actively exploit and marginalize people and groups.

Yet, insufficient information on transmission dynamics has been presented to elucidate the precise risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 in this group. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we investigated association between questionnaire answers on potential exposure situations and SARS-CoV-2-positivity. Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Skåne University Hospitals in Malmö and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact). In health care workers, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with work in a designated COVID-19-unit (OR 5.7 (95CI 2.1-16)) and caring for COVID-19-patients during the majority of shifts (OR 5.4 (95CI 2.0-15)). In all participants, SARS-CoV-2-positivity was associated with a confirmed COVID-19 case (OR 10 (95CI 2.0-45)) in the household. CONCLUSION Our study confirmed previous findings of elevated risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers in COVID-19-units, despite exclusion of units with known outbreaks. Interestingly, health care workers in non-COVID-19-units had similar risk as University employees. Further measures to improve the safety of health care workers might be needed.KEY POINTSPrevious findings of elevated risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers with COVID-19 patient contact was confirmed, despite exclusion of wards with known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

METHODS We used data from surveys of Canadian hospitals in 1993 and 2007 on routine maternity care practices and policies, including interventions in labour and birth. RESULTS The response rate of hospitals in 1993 was 91% (523/572), and in 2007 it was 92% (323/353). In 1993, 65% of hospitals (335/516) had a policy that all women should have initial electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, and in 2007, 74% (235/319) had such a policy. In 1993, 55% of hospitals (284/516) used epidural anaesthesia as one of the methods for pain control, and in 2007, 87% of hospitals (278/318) did so. In 1993, 37% of hospitals (193/521) had a ""no enema/suppository"" policy on admission, and in 2007, 88% (282/322) did. In 1993, 87% of hospitals (450/516) had a policy encouraging the presence of both the woman's partner and other labour support people in the room during the course of labour; in 2007, 80% (259/323) did. In 1993, hospitals estimated that 62% of primiparous women and 44% of multiparous women had an episiotomy in their units. In 2007, the episiotomy rate, irrespective of parity, was 17%. In 1993, 20% of hospitals (98/498) had a policy specifying the length of the second stage of labour, and in 2007, 33% (101/307) had such a policy. CONCLUSION Positive and negative trends in adherence to best practices were seen in policies and practices of routine interventions during labour and birth in Canadian hospitals between 1993 and 2007.","Levitt, Cheryl; Hanvey, Louise; Bartholomew, Sharon; Kaczorowski, Janusz; Chalmers, Beverley; Heaman, Maureen; Li, Xiaoke",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1701-2163(16)35104-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166274/,739

Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review on all consecutive oncological patients treated for a gynecologic and/or breast cancers who presented for the first time to the Gynecologic Oncology Department of Filantropia Hospital, Bucharest, Romania, between January 2016 and December 2020. Results: A total of 1 895 patients diagnosed with ovarian, cervical, endometrial or breast cancers were admitted to hospital for systemic therapy during the mentioned period. Among these, only four patients (two patients with breast cancers, one cervical cancer and one endometrial carcinoma) were chronic carriers of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg positive). Patients received a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens including corticosteroids, gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin, taxanes and anthracyclines. We report one reactivation that occurred in one occult carrier of hepatitis B virus diagnosed with breast cancer (HBsAg negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive - HBcAb), initially excluded from this study, as being screened negative for HBV, treated with taxanes-based chemotherapy and corticosteroids. Conclusion: HBV reactivation had a low incidence in our population of patients diagnosed with gynecologic or breast cancer who received systemic chemotherapy. The HBV reactivation risk was positively correlated with breast cancer and to taxanes-based regimens and glucocorticoids. Further studies to identify additional risk factors of HBV infection reactivation in gynecologic oncology patients and possible risk reducing measures are warranted.","Daia, Mihail Tiberiu; Median, Dragos; Buinoiu, Natalia Florina; Ciocarlan, Maria; Iancu, George; Panaitescu, Anca Maria; Peltecu, Gheorghe; Streinu-Cercel, Adrian",Maedica,https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2021.16.2.189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621337/,739

Due to these psychological changes resulting from the stress produced by the disease, we sought to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on the university student community. MATERIAL AND METHODS 1,283 students were surveyed, of which 1,149 students were selected. The majority of the subjects were female, and the overall average age was of 20 years. They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections; looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales; and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population. RESULTS We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47.08%) and anxiety (27.06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point. There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students. CONCLUSIONS Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses. Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is a red flag that shows the need to upgrade mental health programmes in universities and to validate virtual instruments.","García-Espinosa, Patricio; Ortiz-Jiménez, Xóchitl; Botello-Hernández, Edgar; Aguayo-Samaniego, Rebeca; Leija-Herrera, Jorge; Góngora-Rivera, Fernando",Revista colombiana de psiquiatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158169/,739

We describe a new developing strategy for robotic transperitoneal aortic lymphadenectomy without relocating the robotic column or the patient. METHODS Patients with histologically confirmed cervical cancer, early ovarian cancer, or endometrial carcinoma with suspected risk factors indicating aortic lymphadenectomy were eligible for the robotic transperitoneal aortic lymphadenectomy using the Da Vinci robotic system as part of the surgical treatment of gynecologic malignancies. RESULTS The mean operating time was 224 min (range 160-300 min), and the mean console time for aortic lymphadenectomy was 43 min (range 30-75). The median hemoglobin fall was 1.3 g/dL range (0.8-2 g/dL), the median number of removed aortic lymph nodes was 12.5 (range 7-17), and the median length of the hospital stay was 2 days (range 1-4 days). We experienced an intraoperative complication, but no conversion to laparotomy was necessary. No patients received a blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS This initial experience demonstrates the feasibility of robotic aortic lymphadenectomy with good accuracy and safety without relocating the robotic column or the patient.","Vizza, Enrico; Mancini, Emanuela; Baiocco, Ermelinda; Vicenzoni, Cristina; Patrizi, Lodovico; Saltari, Maria; Cimino, Monica; Sindico, Stefano; Corrado, Giacomo",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-012-2411-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22644509/,739

METHODS Matched breast MRI data from The Cancer Imaging Archive and gene expression profile from The Cancer Genome Atlas of 70 invasive breast cancers were analyzed. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed according to the BI-RADS MRI lexicon of mass morphology. The cancers were divided into 2 groups of gene clustering by gene set enrichment an alysis. Clinicopathologic and imaging characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The luminal subtype was predominant in the group 1 gene set and the triple-negative subtype was predominant in the group 2 gene set (55 of 56, 98.2% vs. 9 of 14, 64.3%). Internal enhancement descriptors were different between the 2 groups; heterogeneity was most frequent in group 1 (27 of 56, 48.2%) and rim enhancement was dominant in group 2 (10 of 14, 71.4%). In group 1, the gene sets related to mammary gland development were overexpressed whereas the gene sets related to mitotic cell division were overexpressed in group 2. CONCLUSION We identified intuitive imaging features of breast MRI associated with distinct gene expression profiles using the standard imaging variables of BI-RADS. The internal enhancement pattern on MRI might reflect specific gene expression profiles of breast cancers, which can be recognized by visual distinction.","Kim, Ga Ram; Ku, You Jin; Cho, Soon Gu; Kim, Sei Joong; Min, Byung Soh",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2017.93.1.18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706887/,739
157718,Management of an incidental finding of right internal jugular vein agenesis.,2017,"The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) matrices is extensively used to modulate the biodegradation, drug loading and release, mechanical properties, and chemical stability of the original system. Multiple parameters, including the molecular weight, relative concentration, polarity, and solubility, affect the physicochemical properties of the polymer blend. Here, molecular dynamics simulations with the united-atom 2016H66 force field are used to model the behavior of PLGA and PEG chains and thus predict the overall physicochemical features of the resulting blend. First, the model accuracy is validated against fundamental properties of pure PLGA and PEG samples. In agreement with previous experimental and theoretical observations, the PLGA solubility results to be higher in acetonitrile than in water, with Flory parameters νACN = 0.63 ± 0.01 and νW = 0.21 ± 0.02, and the Young's modulus of PLGA and PEG equal to Y = 2.0 ± 0.43 and 0.32 ± 0.34 GPa, respectively. Next, four PEG/PLGA blending regimes are identified by varying the relative concentrations and molecular weights of the individual polymers. The computational results demonstrate that at low PEG concentrations (<8% w/w), homogeneous blends are generated for both low and high PEG molecular weights. In contrast, at comparable PEG and PLGA concentrations (∼50% w/w), short PEG chains are only partially miscible whereas long PEG chains segregate within the PLGA matrix. This behavior has been confirmed experimentally via differential scanning calorimetry and is in agreement with previous observations. Finally, the computed Young's modulus of PLGA/PEG blends is observed to decrease with the PEG content returning the lowest values for the partial and fully segregated regimens (Y ≈ 1.3 GPa). This work proposes a computational scheme for predicting the physicochemical properties of PLGA/PEG blends paving the way toward the rational design of polymer mixtures for biomedical applications.","Pannuzzo, Martina; Horta, Bruno A C; La Rosa, Carmelo; Decuzzi, Paolo",Macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c00110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831403/,739

Existing high-dimensional optical imaging techniques that record space and polarization cannot detect the photon's time of arrival owing to the limited speeds of the state-of-the-art electronic sensors. Here, we overcome this long-standing limitation by implementing stereo-polarimetric compressed ultrafast photography (SP-CUP) to record light-speed high-dimensional events in a single exposure. Synergizing compressed sensing and streak imaging with stereoscopy and polarimetry, SP-CUP enables video-recording of five photon tags (x, y, z: space; t: time of arrival; and ψ: angle of linear polarization) at 100 billion frames per second with a picosecond temporal resolution. We applied SP-CUP to the spatiotemporal characterization of linear polarization dynamics in early-stage plasma emission from laser-induced breakdown. This system also allowed three-dimensional ultrafast imaging of the linear polarization properties of a single ultrashort laser pulse propagating in a scattering medium.","Liang, Jinyang; Wang, Peng; Zhu, Liren; Wang, Lihong V",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19065-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067438/,739

In this article we draw on intersectional theory and in-depth interview data to understand the experiences, challenges faced by, and related choice-making processes of students during the height of the pandemic period. In the wake of the lockdown and implementation of a study from home university policy, the 27 students interviewed uncovered a new variation of the classic dilemma faced by young people living in rural areas: should I stay or should I go? Drawing on existing insights about student choice in higher education, we analyse mobility decision-making in relation to the participants’ classed, gendered and locational identities. We find that although the pandemic impacted upon all of the participants, their experiences differed significantly and were stratified across existing lines of inequalities related particularly to their access to financial resources and practical assistance. We ultimately contend that while the pandemic and resulting public health measures provide an extraordinary context, they nevertheless highlight some of the key challenges and vulnerabilities faced by RRR students who are unable to quickly marshal financial, emotional and practical support when crises occur, providing insights whose utility persists beyond the pandemic.

Medical masks have the potential to contain pathogenic microbial populations that attack the human respiratory system. On the other hand, microbes themselves are a group of organisms that are susceptible to mutation. Management of medical mask waste that does not comply with B3 waste management standards will have an impact on the emergence of new problems in the future. The purpose of this study was to identify the distribution of microorganism populations in mask waste samples taken randomly from household waste disposal sites. The medical mask waste sample will then be isolated and identified to determine the medical mask waste sample’s microbiome variations.

185825,Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD209 (DC-SIGN) promoter with SARS severity.,2010,"One of the most likely routes of transmission of COVID-19 is through the saliva droplets that are produced while speaking, coughing or sneezing by infected people. The expelled droplets, measuring between 0.4 and 450 μm, follow trajectories determined, mainly, by the gravitational, and air frictional forces. We solve numerically the equations of motion in which the linear and quadratic velocity terms in the drag force are considered. In order to model the virus load expelled during respiratory events, we assume log-log Gaussian distributions, with peaks around 10 μm, and analyze four size ranges: the aerosol (0.4–5 μm), the small (5.1–10 μm), the middle (10.1–100 μm), and big (100.1–450 μm) droplet size regimes. In the aerosol regime, the frictional forces quickly stop the droplets in their horizontal movement and they fall extremely slowly pulled down by the gravitational force. The residence time, in a calm environment, goes from 3.83 days to 33.3 min. More massive droplets take shorter times and hit the ground meters away from the source. By assuming a constant density of virions per milliliter, we estimate the expelled amount into the environment. The middle and small size droplets contain the highest amount but since the aerosol droplets remain in the air such a long time, they represent also a high risk for infection. We emphasize the importance of face protection to minimize COVID-19, transmission.","Calles, A.; Morán-López, J. L.",Journal of Physics Communications,https://doi.org/10.1088/2399-6528/ac21a4,739

To this end the enzyme was synthesized in a homologous, cell-free transcription- translation system. In this system, synthesis occurred in an essentially membrane-free environment leading to the formation of lactose permease aggregates, which were resistant to protease digestion and detergent solubilization. However, if inverted membrane vesicles from E. coli were included in the synthesis reaction, most de novo- synthesized lactose permease could be recovered from a membrane- containing subfraction (enriched in leader [signal] peptidase activity). This membrane association of lactose permease was Na2CO3 resistant, detergent sensitive, and yielded a distinct pattern of proteolytic cleavage peptides. Moreover, membrane vesicles when present cotranslationally during synthesis of lactose permease, acquired the capability to accumulate lactose, strongly suggesting a correct in vitro assembly of the enzyme. Because of the extensive aggregation of lactose permease synthesized in the absence of membranes, only low amounts originating from the soluble enzyme pool integrated posttranslationally into the membrane vesicles. Unlike the translocation of the outer membrane protein LamB into membrane vesicles, integration of lactose permease was found to be independent of the H+-motive force.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115569/,739

Weight loss is recommended as part of the overall management plan for obese patients diagnosed with OSA. OBJECTIVE To determine whether surgically induced weight loss is more effective than conventional weight loss therapy in the management of OSA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A randomized controlled trial of 60 obese patients (body mass index: >35 and <55) with recently diagnosed (<6 months) OSA and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 20 events/hour or more. These patients had been prescribed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy to manage OSA and were identified via accredited community sleep clinics. The trial was conducted between September 2006 and March 2009 by university- and teaching hospital-based clinical researchers in Melbourne, Australia. Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, previous bariatric surgery, contraindications to bariatric surgery, or significant cardiopulmonary, neurological, vascular, gastrointestinal, or neoplastic disease were excluded. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to a conventional weight loss program that included regular consultations with a dietitian and physician, and the use of very low-calorie diets as necessary (n = 30) or to bariatric surgery (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding; n = 30). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was baseline to 2-year change in AHI on diagnostic polysomnography scored by staff blinded to randomization. Secondary outcomes were changes in weight, CPAP adherence, and functional status. RESULTS Patients lost a mean of 5.1 kg (95% CI, 0.8 to 9.3 kg) in the conventional weight loss program compared with 27.8 kg (95% CI, 20.9 to 34.7 kg) in the bariatric surgery group (P < .001). The AHI decreased by 14.0 events/hour (95% CI, 3.3 to 24.6 events/hour) in the conventional weight loss group and by 25.5 events/hour (95% CI, 14.2 to 36.7 events/hour) in the bariatric surgery group. The between-group difference was -11.5 events/hour (95% CI, -28.3 to 5.3 events/hour; P = .18). CPAP adherence did not differ between the groups. The bariatric surgery group had greater improvement in the Short Form 36 physical component summary score (mean, 9.3 [95% CI, 0.5 to 18.0]; P = .04). CONCLUSION Among a group of obese patients with OSA, the use of bariatric surgery compared with conventional weight loss therapy did not result in a statistically greater reduction in AHI despite major differences in weight loss.

METHODS Tracer gas (perfume of plant oil) was emitted to the bathroom of wards when SARS index patient lived. Six different experimental situations were designed to control the status of exhaust fan in bathrooms, exhaust fan in the top of building and fresh air exchange system. The concentration of perfume was separately measured by 4 groups of lab workers and recorded blindly by the scores of ""tenth degree"". RESULTS Tracer gas was detected from the wards of 8th to 13th floor. CONCLUSION Architecture and ventilation system of the inpatient building in the hospital contributed to the aerodynamic condition of SARS nosocomial infection through airborne transmission. The distribution of tracer gas in the wards was associated with SARS patients in this building. It was possible that SARS could have been transmitted to for distance by aerosol or other carriers.","He, Yao; Xing, Yu-bin; Ni, Bin; Jiang, Yong; Suo, Ji-jiang; Zhong, Guang-lin; Chang, Qing; Jiang, Bin",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15921591/,739

Open reading frames that might encode the viral replicases (ORFs 1a and 1b), membrane-associated proteins (ORFs 2 to 6) and the nucleocapsid protein (ORF7) have been identified. Sequence comparisons have indicated that LV is distantly related to the coronaviruses and toroviruses and closely related to lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV). A 3' nested set of six subgenomic RNAs is produced in LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages. These subgenomic RNAs contain a leader sequence, which is derived from the 5' end of the viral genome. Altogether, these data show that LV is closely related evolutionarily to LDV and EAV, both members of a recently proposed family of positive-stranded RNA viruses, the Arteriviridae.","Meulenberg, J J; Hulst, M M; de Meijer, E J; Moonen, P L; den Besten, A; de Kluyver, E P; Wensvoort, G; Moormann, R J",Archives of virology.

In previous seasons, representative specimens for sequencing were chosen because of cost and time restrictions associated with reliance on Sanger-based sequencing technology. The effect of this specimen prioritization for sequencing has not been previously examined in the respiratory surveillance program. Here, specimen prioritization was simulated by iteratively subsetting sequencing data sets from 1 October 2013 through 15 March 2017 to determine how prioritizing affects common metrics of genetic diversity. Prioritization of specimens did not meaningfully affect calculations of average influenza genetic diversity within seasons or subtypes. Because of the high genetic diversity of influenza, prioritizing resulted in fewer unique viruses and less accurate measures of geographic relationships although it still provided relevant estimates. Given the advent of cost-effective next-generation sequencing approaches, all programs should carefully consider how best to prioritize influenza sequencing to recover meaningful information on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus.","Fries, Anthony C; Gruner, William; Hanson, James",MSMR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141959/,739

Its short N-terminal ectodomain was found to elicit strong humoral responses in half of the patients who had recovered from SARS. The ectodomain-specific antibodies from the convalescent-phase plasma readily recognized and induced destruction of 3a-expressing cells in the presence of the human complement system, demonstrating their potential ability to provide immune protection by recognizing and eliminating SARS coronavirus-infected cells that express the target protein. In addition, when coupled to a carrier protein, the ectodomain peptide elicited 3a-specific antibodies in mice and rabbit at high titres. These results showed that the N terminus of the 3a protein is highly immunogenic and elicits potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients. Therefore, the short extracellular domain may be a valuable immunogen in the development of a vaccine for infectious SARS.","Zhong, Xiaofen; Guo, Zufeng; Yang, Huanghao; Peng, Lisheng; Xie, Yong; Wong, Tin-Yau; Lai, Sik-To; Guo, Zhihong",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16432024/,739

To get insight into the biological effects of NSP4, production of large quantities of this protein is necessary. We first tried to produce the protein in Escherichia coli, but the nsp4 gene proved to be unstable. The capacity of the generally regarded as safe organism Lactococcus lactis to produce NSP4 either intra- or extracellularly was then investigated by using the nisin-controlled expression system. Production of recombinant NSP4 (rNSP4) was observed in L. lactis for both locations. In spite of a very low secretion efficiency, the highest level of production was obtained with the fusion between a lactococcal signal peptide and rNSP4. Cultures of the rNSP4-secreting strain were injected into rabbits, and a specific immune response was elicited. The anti-rNSP4 antibodies produced in these rabbits recognized NSP4 in MA104 cells infected by rotavirus. We showed that L. lactis is able to produce antigenic and immunogenic rNSP4 and thus is a good organism for producing viral antigens.","Enouf, V; Langella, P; Commissaire, J; Cohen, J; Corthier, G",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11282586/,739

SAMPLE POPULATION Feces from 120 dogs. PROCEDURE Fresh fecal specimens were screened for bacteria and bacterial toxins via bacteriologic culture and ELISA, parvovirus via ELISA, canine coronavirus via nested polymerase chain reaction assay, protozoal cysts and oocysts via a direct fluorescent antibody technique, and parasite ova and larvae via microscopic examination of direct wet mounts and zinc sulfate centrifugation flotation. RESULTS Salmonella enterica and Brachyspira spp were not common, whereas other pathogens such as canine coronavirus and Helicobacter spp were common among the dogs that were surveyed. Only intestinal parasites and Campylobacterjejuni infection were significant risk factors for diarrhea by univariate odds ratio analysis. Giardia lamblia was significantly underestimated by fecal flotation, compared with a direct fluorescent antibody technique. Spatial analysis of case specimens by use of GIS indicated that diarrhea was widespread throughout the entire shelter, and spatial statistical analysis revealed no evidence of spatial clustering of case specimens. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study provided an epidemiologic overview of diarrhea and interacting diarrhea-associated pathogens in a densely housed, highly predisposed shelter population of dogs. Several of the approaches used in this study, such as use of a spatial representation of case specimens and considering multiple etiologies simultaneously, were novel and illustrate an integrated approach to epidemiologic investigations in shelter populations.","Sokolow, Susanne H; Rand, Courtney; Marks, Stanley L; Drazenovich, Niki L; Kather, Elizabeth J; Foley, Janet E",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16008226/,739

Conventional radiography showed extensive heterotopic ossifications. Retrospectively, alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated. It is likely that local and systemic factors contribute to the development of heterotopic ossifications. Early diagnosis is important to provide complementary non-pharmacological interventions (gentle passive mobilization) and medication (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin). If pain and limited joint mobility remain present, surgical removal of ectopic bone could be considered.

Here, we describe the localization of these sites by testing the antigenicity of protein fragments and prokaryotic expression products of E2 gene fragments, and by sequencing of MAb-resistant (mar) mutants. Partial proteolysis of purified E2 protein allowed the isolation of a 28K fragment recognized by both site A- and site C-specific MAbs. An antiserum against this fragment bound to a synthetic peptide containing residues 1 to 18 and to an expression product containing residues 1 to 325. The same expression product was recognized by site C-specific MAbs. These data indicate that residues within the sequence 1 to 325 contribute to site C and possibly also to site A. Sequencing of mar mutants that escaped neutralization by site A-specific MAbs indicated that residues 538 and 543 also belong to site A. The binding of site-specific MAbs to expression products led directly to the localization of sites B and D, between residues 1 to 325 and 379 to 529, respectively.

Nevertheless, the peculiarities of bone marrow T cells in comparison with those in lymphoid periphery are still largely unknown. In this report, we show for the first time that bone marrow CD8 T cells are in a different activation state than those in peripheral lymphoid organs. Firstly, we observed that mouse bone marrow contains a significantly higher percentage of blasts within the CD8 T cells than either spleen or lymph nodes, yet such enrichment is not due to recent antigenic stimulation. Secondly, when we challenged bone marrow CD8 T cells from immunized mice with their antigen in vitro, they displayed a faster response than those from the spleen. Thus, we suggest that the bone marrow could be a preferential source of CD8 T cells for adoptive therapies in those cases in which highly active effectors are required.","Di Rosa, Francesca; Santoni, Angela",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12115606/,739

METHODS Intravenous drip with oxygen-enriched liquids was given to 6 cases suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and 3 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the course of treatment for 1 to 5 days, 500-700 ml per day. RESULTS For all the 9 SARS cases, their hypoxemia was gradually corrected to normal in 20 minutes' or 4 hours' intravenous drip with oxygen-enriched liquid. Respiratory rate decreased from 29-49 breath/min to 18-22 breath/min, heart rate decreased from 89-145 beats/min to 60-79 beats/min, two faint patients regained consciousness, hypoxemia was redressed, partial pressure of oxygen in artery increased from 56 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa) to 87 mm Hg, saturation of oxygen increased from 0.89 to 0.96. CONCLUSION Intravenous drip of the oxygen-enriched liquid effectively helped correct the hypoxemia of SARS and other infectious diseases cases by bypassing the diseased alveoli through which oxygen would not pass into the blood by conventional oxygen inhalation. This therapy of oxygen-enriched liquid infusion could be quite life-saving in the combined treatment for SARS and other infectious diseases.","He, Qing; Xu, Cheng; Wang, Song; Cui, Jian-jun; Duan, Gang; Ye, Tao-sheng; Yang, Da-guo; Zhou, Bo-ping; Zhao, Lian-san",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15132793/,739
195810,Determination of the functions of the putative metal-binding domain of the SCV helicase.,2009,"Chagas' heart disease (CHD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most common form of myocarditis in Central America and South America. Some humans and experimental animals develop both humoral and cell-mediated cardiac-specific autoimmunity during infection. Benznidazole, a trypanocidal drug, is effective at reducing parasite load and decreasing the severity of myocarditis in acutely infected patients. We hypothesized that the magnitude of autoimmunity that develops following T. cruzi infection is directly proportional to the amount of damage caused by the parasite. To test this hypothesis, we used benznidazole to reduce the number of parasites in an experimental model of CHD and determined whether this treatment altered the autoimmune response. Infection of A/J mice with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi leads to the development of severe inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, and parasitosis in the heart accompanied by vigorous cardiac myosin-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and antibody production at 21 days postinfection. Mice succumbed to infection within a month if left untreated. Treatment of infected mice with benznidazole eliminated mortality and decreased disease severity. Treatment also reduced cardiac myosin-specific DTH and antibody production. Reinfection of treated mice with a heart-derived, virulent strain of T. cruzi or immunization with myosin led to the redevelopment of myosin-specific autoimmune responses and inflammation. These results provide a direct link between the levels of T. cruzi and the presence of autoimmunity and suggest that elimination of the parasite may result in the reduction or elimination of autoimmunity in the chronic phase of infection.","Hyland, Kenneth V; Leon, Juan S; Daniels, Melvin D; Giafis, Nick; Woods, LaKitta M; Bahk, Thomas J; Wang, Kegiang; Engman, David M",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17485457/,739

The spike envelope glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, the main determinant of SARS-CoV tropism, was isolated and used to pseudotype a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vector. Spike-pseudotyped HIV vector was generated and evaluated in vitro on well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells and bronchial explants and in vivo in murine airways. The spike envelope was less efficient at promoting HIV vector transduction of murine airway epithelium than an optimized deletion mutant of the Zaire ebolavirus envelope glycoprotein (NTD6L), which was used as a benchmark. However, spike-pseudotyped HIV vector was substantially more efficient than NTD6L-pseudotyped vector on human airway epithelium as demonstrated by lacZ gene transfer in primary cultures of epithelial cells and bronchial explants. In addition, this study shows that spike-pseudotyped HIV -based vector can efficiently transduce human dendritic cells and epithelial cells of the esophagus, which may have implications in investigating mechanisms of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Spike-pseudotyped HIV-based vector is a novel lung-directed gene transfer vehicle that holds promise for the treatment of genetic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency.","Kobinger, Gary P; Limberis, Maria P; Somanathan, Suri; Schumer, Gregory; Bell, Peter; Wilson, James M",Human gene therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17518614/,739

Moreover, a multidisciplinary group including critical care specialists has been created in order to provide indications about supporting measures and the use of steroids. A new grading scale has been proposed to help patients' stratification according to the severity of the respiratory conditions. Lastly, a collaborating group with immunologists and rheumatologists has been built with the aim of providing some guidance about the use of tocilizumab, a promising option for the treatment of the hyperinflammatory state occurring in most patients affected by COVID-19.","Lombardy Section Italian Society Infectious And Tr, -",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275256/,739

However, a large number of patients remain at risk for OIs because they are diagnosed at late stages of HIV disease, fail to stay in treatment, or fail to maintain viral suppression. Clinicians should remain vigilant for OIs and for changes in recommended management strategies. Issues that often arise in this regard include how to interpret polymerase chain reaction diagnostic results in individuals with HIV infection; whether primary prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex is still needed; whether clinicians should screen asymptomatic patients for cryptococcal antigen; and need for amphotericin B in treatment regimens for cryptococcal meningitis.

197725,Epidemiology of coronavirus-associated respiratory tract infections and the role of rapid diagnostic tests: a prospective study.,2012,"PURPOSE (90)Y-radioembolization (RE) is a promising technique for delivering high doses of radiation to liver tumors but may result in compromise of liver function. To gain further perspective, we evaluated the toxicity rates of sequential lobar versus ""whole liver"" (90)Y-radioembolization. METHODS Thirty-four patients with liver malignancy in noncirrhotic livers were included; (90)Y-radioembolization was performed as either whole liver or sequential lobar treatment in 17 patients each. Standard clinical and liver specific laboratory parameters as well as MR imaging before treatment and at follow-up (6 and 12 weeks) after radioembolization were evaluated for toxicity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Volumetry of the liver, tumor, and spleen and measurement of portal vein diameter also were performed. RESULTS Three months after whole liver RE, 14 liver-related grade 3/4 events were recorded versus 2 events after sequential lobar treatment (P < 0.05). Three patients treated with whole liver RE suffered from radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD). Pathological increases in bilirubin at 3 months were observed for the whole liver group only (52.3 vs. 18.7 μmol/l, P = 0.012). Total liver volume did not change significantly in either group, but shrinkage of the initially treated hepatic lobe with compensatory hypertrophy of the subsequently treated lobe was observed in the sequential lobar group (P < 0.05). Portal vein diameter increased significantly in whole liver-treated patients only (+17% vs. +6.6%, P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS Noncirrhotic patients undergoing sequential lobar radioembolization had less hepatic toxicity compared to whole liver embolization. The sequential approach should be the preferred strategy.","Seidensticker, Ricarda; Seidensticker, Max; Damm, Robert; Mohnike, Konrad; Schütte, Kerstin; Malfertheiner, Peter; Van Buskirk, Mark; Pech, Maciej; Amthauer, Holger; Ricke, Jens",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037709/,739
197726,Reducing the impact of the next influenza pandemic using household-based public health interventions.,2009,"OBJECTIVE We describe the presentation, treatment and outcome of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome with COVID-19 (MIS-C) in Mumbai metropolitan area in India. METHODS This is an observational study conducted at four tertiary hospitals in Mumbai. Parameters including demographics, symptomatology, laboratory markers, medications and outcome were obtained from patient hospital records and analyzed in patients treated for MIS-C (as per WHO criteria) from 1 May, 2020 to 15 July, 2020. RESULTS 23 patients (11 males) with median (range) age of 7.2 (0.8-14) years were included. COVID19 RT PCR or antibody was positive in 39.1% and 30.4%, respectively; 34.8% had a positive contact. 65% patients presented in shock; these children had a higher age (P=0.05), and significantly higher incidence of myocarditis with elevated Troponin, NT pro BNP and LV dysfunction, along with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, as compared to those without shock. Coronary artery dilation was seen in 26% patients overall. Steroids were used most commonly for treatment (96%), usually along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (65%). Outcome was good with only one death. CONCLUSION Initial data on MIS-C from India is presented.

197764,Respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria triggering severe asthma exacerbation in children.,2013,"PURPOSE Physiological uptake in the uncinate process or pancreatic head has been described with Ga-labeled PET tracers for somatostatin receptor imaging. In-DTPA-octreotide is the only registered radiopharmaceutical for the imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. We studied the uptake in this region of the pancreatic head on somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using In-DTPA-octreotide in a large group of patients. Furthermore, known physiological and clinical characteristics are discussed in an attempt to elucidate this phenomenon. METHODS Four hundred seven patients underwent SRS using In-DTPA-octreotide in our department in 2014. After excluding patients with a known malignancy in or close to the pancreas, as well as all scans without SPECT/CT of the upper abdomen, we reviewed 178 scans in total. The uptake was graded on a 4-point scale that correlates the uptake in the pancreatic head to physiological uptake in the liver. RESULTS Uptake in the region of the pancreatic head, including the uncinate process, was seen in 46 (26%) of 178 patients on SPECT/CT and in 12 patients (7%) on planar imaging. On SPECT/CT, uptake was lower than the liver in 26 patients (15%), equal to the liver in 17 patients (10%), and higher than the liver in 3 patients (2%). In patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the incidence of uptake in the pancreatic head was 50% on SPECT/CT. CONCLUSIONS Physiological uptake in the pancreatic head is seen on SPECT/CT with In-DTPA-octreotide in 26% of patients, and the incidence is doubled in patients with DM. Previous case reports showed uptake in the pancreatic head due to histologically proven pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cell hyperplasia. Also, patients with DM have elevated serum PP concentrations, which is likely due to PP cell hyperplasia. Because 90% of PP cells are present in the pancreatic head, PP cell hyperplasia is the most likely explanation for visualization of the pancreatic head on SRS in a substantial number of patients.","Brabander, Tessa; Teunissen, Jaap; Kwekkeboom, Dik",Clinical nuclear medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775943/,739
198081,Replication and pathogenesis of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in polarised human bronchial and alveolar epithelium.,2013,"AIM Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair is the most frequently performed procedure for inguinal hernioplasty. In the past surgery aimed to control recurrences. Nowadays it is important to avoid postoperative chronic pain and thus several studies have examined the potential role of meshes in causing postoperative pain. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the early and long-term results after Lichtenstein tension-free repair using a self-adhesive mesh (Parietex ProgripTM - Covidien, Germany) in a single center. METHODS The study enrolled 211 patients, 199 males (94.3%) and 12 females (5.7%), mean age 62 years (28-90 years), between January 2008 and December 2011. Of these, 206 had primary inguinal hernias while 5 were recurrences following previous tension repair. Ten different general surgeons, including residents, performed Lichtenstein hernia repair using a 12 x 8-cm Parietex ProgripTM mesh. In 88.1% of patients no additional fixation was used, while in 11.9% a single 2-0 polypropylene stitch was placed on the pubic bone. A 1-10 visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess postoperative pain, evaluating it at 1 week, 1 month and 12, 24 and 36 months. Local paresthesia was assessed at same intervals. Any pain sensation lasting longer than 3 months postoperatively, or requiring injection of analgesics was defined as chronic pain. RESULTS Mean operating time was 64.1 minutes (SD ± 21.14). There were no intraoperative complications. Early postoperative complications included hematoma-seroma (5.7% cases), superficial wound infection (1%), urinary retention (0.5%), and scrotal swelling (1%). The main follow-up period was 3 years, although patients operated between 2009 and 2011 underwent a shorter follow-up. At one-year follow-up, 17 patients reported groin discomfort, but did not require analgesics. Three patients reported moderate pain, requiring occasional use of oral analgesics, and 2 of these described a discontinuous pain mainly during movement. One patient reported severe pain requiring local injection of analgesics. At 2-year follow-up, 3 patients reported groin discomfort. Five of the 17 patients who reported discomfort at 1 year were lost to the 2-year follow-up. One patient kept reporting a high VAS score (6), though slightly reduced from the previously reported at 1-year follow-up. Recurrence was observed in 0.5% at 1 year and in 2.4% at 2 years. At 3 years only half of the patients (102) were still on follow-up. Of these, 1 reported mild discomfort and 3 developed hernia recurrence. Globally a decrease in pain and local discomfort was observed. No cases of seroma, testicular complications or mesh infection were reported at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Self-gripping mesh for inguinal hernia repair is a good and safe option, easy to handle and with a low incidence of chronic pain (<3%). A sutureless fixation seems to prevent the development of postoperative chronic pain, without increasing recurrence rates. Using a self-adhesive mesh also slightly reduce operating times, and costs are lower when compared to biological glue used to fix the mesh. In conclusion, our experience with the self-gripping mesh is limited but positive, randomized clinical trials are warranted to confirm our results.","Tarchi, P; Cosola, D; Germani, P; Troian, M; De Manzini, N",Minerva chirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736447/,739

The vaccination strategy is expressed as a state delayed feedback which is related to the current and previous state of the epidemic model, and makes the model become a linear system in new coordinates. For the presence and absence of vaccination control, we investigate the nonnegativity and boundedness of the model, respectively. We obtain some sufficient conditions for the eigenvalues of the linear system such that the nonnegativity of the epidemic model can be guaranteed when the vaccination strategy is applied. In addition, we study the stability of disease-free equilibrium when R 0 < 1 and the persistent of disease when R 0 > 1 .

Aim of our analysis is to provide a better understanding of the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Italy, using commuting data at a high spatial resolution, characterizing the territory in terms of vulnerability. We used a Susceptible-Infectious stochastic model and we estimated a municipality-specific infection contact rate () to capture the susceptibility to the disease. We identified in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions (52% of all Italian cases) significant clusters of high , due to the simultaneous presence of connections between municipalities and high population density. Local simulated spreading in regions, with different levels of infection observed, showed different disease geographical patterns due to different values and commuting systems. In addition, we produced a vulnerability map (in the Abruzzi region as an example) by simulating the epidemic considering each municipality as a seed. The result shows the highest vulnerability values in areas with commercial hubs, close to the highest populated cities and the most industrial area. Our results highlight how human mobility can affect the epidemic, identifying particular situations in which the health authorities can promptly intervene to control the disease spread.","Savini, Lara; Candeloro, Luca; Calistri, Paolo; Conte, Annamaria",,,739

COVID-19-related measures of these three individual differences were each significantly associated with adherence even after controlling for demographics and pandemic beliefs although beliefs about the severity of the virus and the benefits of containment measures also significantly related to adherence. Beliefs were associated with the individual difference measures and political orientation. Moral disengagement, the strongest individual difference predictor, was associated with lower support for each pandemic containment precaution (e.g., mask wearing).

This is a highly professional job that involves many parts, such as identifying personal information, collecting related evidence, and making a final insurance report. Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the previous offline insurance assessment has to be conducted online. However, for the junior assessor often lacking practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such a complex online procedure, yet this is important as the insurance company needs to decide how much compensation the claimant should receive based on the assessor's feedback. In order to promote assessors' work efficiency and speed up the overall procedure, in this paper, we propose a dialogue-based information extraction system that integrates advanced NLP technologies for medical insurance assessment. With the assistance of our system, the average time cost of the procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes, and the total human resources cost is saved 30% compared with the previous offline procedure.

This study performed a multidimensional association analysis to explore the correlation between the GHS Index and COVID-19-associated morbidity, mortality, and disease increase rate (DIR) in 178 countries (regions). METHODS: The GHS Index and COVID-19 pandemic data - including total cases per million (TCPM), total deaths per million (TDPM), and daily growth rate - were extracted from online databases. The Spearman correlation coefficient was applied to describe the strength of the association between the GHS Index, sociological characteristics, and the epidemic situation of COVID-19. DIRs were compared, and the impact of the GHS Index on the DIR by the time of ""lockdown"" was visualized. RESULTS: The overall GHS Index was positively correlated with TCPM and TDPM, with coefficients of 0.34 and 0.41, respectively. Countries categorized into different GHS Indextiers had different DIRs before implementing lockdown measures. However, no significant difference was observed between countries in the middle and upper tiers after implementing lockdown measures. The correlation between GHS Index and DIR was positive five days before lockdown measures were taken, but it became negative 13 days later.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is one of the most important antigens for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, while the analysis of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in preclinical studies using mouse models is critical for evaluating vaccine efficacy. Here, we immunized C57BL/6 wild-type mice and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein to evaluate the IFN-γ-producing T cells in the splenocytes of the immunized mice using an overlapping peptide pool by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay and flow cytometry.

242555,[Clinical characteristics and outcomes of 112 cardiovascular disease patients infected by 2019-nCoV],2020,"BACKGROUND: Keeping and improving work engagement among physicians fighting COVID-19 is important to healthy medical systems. In line with the job demands-resources model, optimism was expected to positively relate with job resources, leading to higher work engagement. However, the underlying mechanism between optimism, autonomy and work engagement has not been explored. AIMS: To examine whether optimism has a positive impact on work engagement via autonomy among physicians fighting COVID-19 in China. METHODS: This study was conducted among physicians in March 2020. A convenience sample was used to recruit physicians from the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. One hundred and four Chinese physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic completed a survey measuring levels of autonomy, optimism and work engagement. The PROCESS macro (model 4) was used to test hypotheses about mediation. RESULTS: This current study found that optimism was related to increased autonomy, and autonomy was related to increased work engagement. The results of the bias-corrected bootstrap method suggested the indirect effect of optimism on work engagement via autonomy (Effect = 0.16, SE = 0.08, lower level confidence interval = 0.04, upper level confidence interval = 0.37), indicating a mediated relationship, in which autonomy is one mechanism to explain the link between optimism and increased work engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study follows an observational design, with in-depth analysis of the relationship between optimism, autonomy and work engagement. When management implements strategies to improve work engagement among physicians working in the COVID-19 epidemic, the mediating impact of autonomy on the association between optimism and work engagement should be considered.","Zhang, H; Zhao, Y; Zou, P; Liu, Y; Gan, L",Occup. med,,739
246545,Evaluating intervention strategies in controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in care homes: An agent-based model - CORRIGENDUM,2021,"Public policies implemented to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections created unprecedented challenges for social movements. Most striking was the de facto temporary suspension of the right to assembly. Using the case of pro-migrant mobilizations in Germany as an example, we analyse how social movements are affected by and respond to this exceptional context. Instead of a breakdown, we find evidence for a proliferation of mobilization. This is surprising since COVID-19 related restraints were particularly accentuated for pro-migrant mobilizations. We argue that this puzzle can be explained by looking at the particular framing strategies and the hybrid online and offline protest practices used by activists. Integrating empirical insights of social movements in times of crisis, theoretical approaches to boundary spanning, intersectional frame bridging, and hybrid combinations of online and offline protest, our article provides an analysis of pro-migrant mobilizations in times of pandemic. It also sketches-out avenues for future research on plural alliance formation in diverse societies.","Zajak, Sabrina; Stjepandić, Katarina; Steinhilper, Elias",Eur. Soc.,,739
247956,[Risk factors for the development of liver cancer in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis treated with long-term nucleos(t)ide analogues],2020,"The COVID-19 disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is highly infective within the human population. The virus is widely disseminated to almost every continent with over twenty-seven million infections and over ninety-thousand reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA virus, comprising three main viral proteins; membrane, spike and envelope. The clinical features of COVID-19 disease can be classified according to different degrees of severity, with some patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be fatal. In addition, many infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild symptoms. As there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 there is considerable endeavour to raise a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in addition to engineering neutralizing antibody interventions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, movement controls of varying stringencies have been imposed. Whilst enforced lockdown measures have been effective, they may be less effective against the current strain of SARS-CoV-2, the G614 clade. Conversely, other mutations of the virus, such as the &#916;382 variant could reduce the clinical relevance of infection. The front runners in the race to develop an effective vaccine focus on the SARS-Co-V-2 Spike protein. However, vaccines that produce a T-cell response to a wider range of SARS-Co-V-2 viral proteins, may be more effective. Population based studies that determine the level of innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2, from prior exposure to the virus or to other coronaviruses, will have important implications for government imposed movement control and the strategic delivery of vaccination programmes.","Salvamani, S; Tan, H Z; Thang, W J; Ter, H C; Wan, M S; Gunasekaran, B; Rhodes, A",Br J Biomed Sci,,739

We find that regional policy coordination is critical to mitigate and isolate the pandemic shock. It is important to identify the pandemic events early to flatten the pandemic curve at the national and regional level. This supports a recent study by the World Bank (2020), which highlights the importance of early mitigation policies during the pandemic shock. The cost of the pandemic and economic shocks will increase significantly when several countries in the region experience the pandemic shock concurrently. In this case, flattening the regional pandemic curve becomes important. The results also indicate the need for greater coordination in East Asia to mitigate the pending economic shock in terms of unemployment, corporate bankruptcy and financial market fragility. The paper also highlights that the stability of the GVC network is critical during the pandemic in terms of hedging the risk of disruptions to the procurement of critical medical and health products as well as maintaining service linkages to manufacturing, such as the logistics sector. Regional policy coordination and the stability of GVC will be valuable in the post-pandemic recovery of the region.","Kimura, Fukunari; Thangavelu, Shandre Mugan; Narjoko, Dionisius; Findlay, Christopher",Asian Econ.

253523,Saliva and its potential in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cannot be ignored: A point of view,2021,"Immunization with an inactivated virus is one of the strategies currently being tested towards developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. Although gamma-rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modelled the impact of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. We show that gamma-rays produce significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induce less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope is sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.","Francis, Ziad; Incerti, Sebastien; Zein, Sara A.; Lampe, Nathanael; Guzman, Carlos A.; Durante, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06201v1.pdf,739

Despite the potentially beneficial effects of colchicine, there is no consensus on the appropriate dosage regimen and numerous schemes are currently used.In this study, simulations were performed to identify the ability of dosage regimens to attain plasma levels in CVOID-19 patients, known to be generally safe and efficacious. Since renal and hepatic impairment, as well as, drug-drug interactions have been identified to be the most significant factors increasing colchicine toxicity, the impact of these interactions was assessed in the simulations.Some dosage regimens lead to high colchicine concentrations, while others result in sub-therapeutic levels. Additional dosage schemes were proposed in this study aiming to be applied in patients with clearance insufficiency. Colchicine administration of 0.5 mg twice daily, can be considered safe and effective. In cases of clearance impairment, doses as low as 0.25 mg thrice or twice daily should be applied.Colchicine is a narrow therapeutic index drug and dosage regimens tailored to patients' needs should be designed.","Karatza, Eleni; Ismailos, George; Karalis, Vangelis",Xenobiotica,,739

Whether and how a newcomer can better engage in the community has attracted great interest due to its application in many scenarios. Although some prior works that explore early socialization have obtained salient achievements, they are focusing on sociological surveys based on the small group. To help individuals get through the early socialization period and engage well in online conversations, we study a novel task to foresee whether a newcomer's message will be responded to by other participants in a multi-party conversation (henceforth \textbf{Successful New-entry Prediction}). The task would be an important part of the research in online assistants and social media. To further investigate the key factors indicating such engagement success, we employ an unsupervised neural network, Variational Auto-Encoder (\textbf{VAE}), to examine the topic content and discourse behavior from newcomer's chatting history and conversation's ongoing context. Furthermore, two large-scale datasets, from Reddit and Twitter, are collected to support further research on new-entries. Extensive experiments on both Twitter and Reddit datasets show that our model significantly outperforms all the baselines and popular neural models.

Drawing upon the concept of cognitive destination image and through an online self-administered survey, the effects of four factors including trust, crisis management, healthcare system, and solidarity on travel behavioral intention are compared based on tourists’ prior experience of a given destination. To achieve this aim, ten countries with different coping strategies, numbers of positive cases and mortality rate were studied. A total number of 518 useable questionnaires were collected from the prospect international tourists who followed news related to COVID-19 for one of the selected countries and plan to travel in the future. Partial least squares – structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis were used to test the model and hypotheses. The results showed the high predictive power of the model on post COVID-19 travel behavioral intention.

266173,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment versus mycobacterial infections: Better safe than sorry?,2021,"The growing popularity of e-scooters and their rapid expansion across urban streets has attracted widespread attention. A major policy question is whether e-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left by them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing on their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results from an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The supply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit and bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes to transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and save some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19 pandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main driver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we find that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services to underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of e-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services. Future research may combine the big-data-based analysis presented here with traditional methods to further shed light on the interactions between e-scooter services, bikesharing, and public transit.","Yan, Xiang; Yang, Wencui; Zhang, Xiaojian; Xu, Yiming; Bejleri, Ilir; Zhao, Xilei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09060v1.pdf,739

The main point of the present paper is to convincingly establish this assertion while providing a warning that the results and analysis of such mathematical models should not be taken at face value and need to be used with great caution by policy makers.","Dhar, Abhishek",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05373v1.pdf,739

269730,[Clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 in infants and young children],2020,"On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Soon after, the first studies began documenting the impacts of the pandemic on children's adaptation in Europe and Asia. In Quebec, Canada, few published studies, to date, report on the adaptation of children living in the context of a pandemic. This studies' objectives are to: (a) describe the level of exposure to the pandemic;(b) present a portrait of the psychosocial adaptation and the mental health of children aged 6 to 17;(c) assess whether the experience of the pandemic influences their adaptation;and (d) evaluate whether children with mental health vulnerabilities are doing worse than those without such vulnerabilities in this particular life context. Statistical analyses reveal that the majority of children do not present difficulties in terms of overall adaptation in the context of the pandemic (65.8%). During confinement, boys present more attentional difficulties and aggressive behaviors than girls. Furthermore, the advancing age of children is positively associated with the presence of withdrawal/depression symptoms. Children who are more knowledgeable about the pandemic have more internalized behaviors. Finally, children who had mental health vulnerabilities prior to the pandemic present more difficulties in overall coping during the pandemic than other youth. Although the results are consistent with other studies and reveal that youth can cope adequately, the fact remains that some children are experiencing difficulties that need to be addressed.","Baudry, C.; Pearson, J.; Masse, L.; Ouellet, G.; Begin, J.

Whether exposure is also decreased in adult patients is not known. This study evaluated the exposure of LPV/RTV in adult patients after administration of crushed LPV/RTV tablets. METHODS: Blood samples were drawn from patients with COVID-19 who were receiving crushed LPV/RTV 400/100 mg tablets twice daily. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations for 11 patients with COVID-19 (eight men, mean age 62.6 years) were included. The measured plasma concentrations of LPV were substantially higher than reported for patients with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: There is adequate exposure from crushed LPV/RTV tablets, but because of limited experience, therapeutic drug monitoring is still advised.","Mohsenian Naghani, Shaghayegh; Jansen, Mark Mpm; Jaspers, Tessa; Bastiaans, Diane; Burger, David",,,739
278355,Infectivity of healthcare workers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) approximately 2 weeks after onset of symptoms: A cross-sectional study,2021,"The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human networks. Here, the real-space urban life of people is modeled as a scale-free network with constraints. A scale-free network has been adopted for modeling on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of infections according to the result.","Ohsawa, Yukio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09372v2.pdf,739

In this article, we explore how PC innovations during COVID-19 could transform the PC consult to address workforce shortages and expand access to PC services during and beyond the pandemic. We propose a 3-pronged strategy of bolstering inpatient telepalliative care services, expanding electronic consults, and increasing training and educational tools for providers to help meet the increased need for PC services in the future.","Ganeshan, S.; Humphreys, J.; Judson, T.",American Journal of Managed Care,,739

Flat connections on the affine line with a logarithmic singularity at the origin are equivalent to representations of a groupoid associated to the exponentiated action of $\mathbb{C}$. We show that such representations admit a canonical Jordan-Chevalley decomposition and use this to give a functorial classification. Flat connections on a complex manifold with logarithmic singularities along a hypersurface are equivalent to representations of a twisted fundamental groupoid. Using a Morita equivalence, whose construction is inspired by Deligne's notion of paths with tangential basepoints, we prove a van Kampen type theorem for this groupoid. This allows us to show that the category of representations of the twisted fundamental groupoid can be localized to the normal bundle of the hypersurface. As a result, we obtain a functorial Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for logarithmic connections in terms of generalized monodromy data.","Bischoff, Francis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03685v1.pdf,739

299251,Managing humidity support in intubated ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal specialists who attempt to discuss the connection between mental health (thoughts and emotions) and physical health (symptom intensity and activity tolerance) with patients, may fear that they risk offending those patients. In a search for language that creates comfort with difficult conversations, some specialists favor a biomedical framework, such as central sensitization, which posits abnormal central neuron activity. Without addressing the relative accuracy of mind- or brain-based conceptualizations, we addressed crafted and practiced communication strategies as conversation starters that allow specialists to operate within a biopsychosocial framework without harming the relationship with the patient. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We measured (1) patient resonance with various explanations of the mind-body connection, including examples of both mind- and brain-based communication strategies, and (2) factors associated with resonance and emotional reactions to the explanations. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all adult new and returning patients who were literate in English and who attended several musculoskeletal specialty offices were invited to complete questionnaires addressing reactions to one of seven explanations of the mind-body connection assigned using a random number generator. Acknowledging that the relative accuracy of mind-based and nerve- or brain-based strategies are speculative, we developed the following conversation starters: two explanations that were cognitively framed (""the mind is a great story teller""; one positively framed and one negatively framed), two emotionally framed explanations (""stressed or down""; one positively framed and one negatively framed), one mentioning thoughts and emotions in more neutral terms (""mind and body work together thoughts and emotions affect the way your body experiences pain""), and two biomedical neurophysiology-based explanations (""nerves get stuck in an over-excited state"" and ""overstimulated nerves""), all crafted with the assistance of a communication scholar. It was unusual for people to decline (although the exact number of those who did was not tracked) and 304 of 308 patients who started the questionnaires completed them and were analyzed. In this sample, 51% (155 of 304) were men, and the mean ± SD age was 49 ± 17 years. Reactions were measured as resonance (a 1 to 5 Likert scale regarding the degree to which the stated concept aligns with their understanding of health and by inference is a comfortable topic of discussion) and self-assessment manikins using circled figurines to measure feelings of happiness (frowning to smiling figures), stimulation/excitement (a relaxed sleepy figure to an energized wide-eyed figure), and security/control (small to large figures). These are commonly used to quantify the appeal and emotive content of a given message. Patients also completed surveys of demographics and mental health. Multilevel multivariable linear regression models were constructed to assess factors associated with resonance, happiness, excitement, and control. RESULTS: Controlling for potential confounding variables such as demographics and mental health measures, a relatively neutral biopsychosocial explanation (""mind and body work together"") had the greatest mean resonance (4.2 ± 0.8 versus 3.8 ± 0.9 for the other explanations; p < 0.01) and the largest regression coefficient for resonance (0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.15]). The next-most-resonant explanations were biomedical (""excitable nerves"", ""over-excited state""). Biopsychosocial explanations that mention stress, distress, or cognitive bias (""mind is a great storyteller"") had lower resonance. People with greater unhealthy cognitive bias regarding pain (more catastrophic thinking) were less comfortable with all the explanations (lower resonance, regression coefficient -0.03 [95% CI -0.06 to -0.01]). Emotional reactions were relatively comparable with the exception that people felt less control and security with specific explanations such as ""excitable nerves"" and ""mind is a great storyteller."" CONCLUSION: Crafted communication strategies allow musculoskeletal specialists to address health within the biopsychosocial paradigm without harming their relationship with the patient. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Musculoskeletal specialists may be the first clinicians to notice mental health opportunities. It may be helpful for them to develop and practice effective communication strategies that make mental health a comfortable topic of discussion.","Gonzalez, Amanda I; Kortlever, Joost T P; Brown, Laura E; Ring, David; Queralt, Mark",,,739

While it was initially regarded as a strictly respiratory illness, the impact of COVID-19 on multiple organs is increasingly recognized. The brain is among the targets of COVID-19, and it can be impacted in multiple ways, both directly and indirectly. Direct brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 may occur via axonal transport via the olfactory nerve, eventually infecting the olfactory cortex and other structures in the temporal lobe, and potentially the brain stem. A hematogenous route, which involves viral crossing of blood-brain barrier, is also possible. Secondary mechanisms involve hypoxia due to respiratory failure, as well as aberrant immune response leading to various forms of encephalopathy, white matter damage, and abnormal blood clotting resulting in stroke. Multiple neurological symptoms of COVID-19 have been described. These involve anosmia/ageusia, headaches, seizures, mental confusion and delirium, and coma. There is a growing concern that in a number of patients, long-term or perhaps even permanent cognitive impairment will persist well after the recovery from acute illness. Furthermore, COVID-19 survivors may be at increased risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases years or decades later. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, it will take months or even years to characterize the exact nature, scope, and temporal extent of its long-term neurocognitive sequelae. To that end, rigorous and systematic longitudinal follow-up will be required. For this effort to succeed, appropriate protocols and patient registries should be developed and put in place without delay now.","Bougakov, Dmitri; Podell, Kenneth; Goldberg, Elkhonon",Mol.

In a murine heterosubtypic influenza challenge model, we demonstrate that protective lung T cell responses derive from both in situ activation of TRMs and the enhanced generation of effector T cells from the local lung draining mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs). Primary infection fortified the medLNs with an increased number of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) that mediate enhanced priming of T cells, including those specific for newly encountered epitopes; cDC depletion during the recall response diminished medLN T cell generation and heterosubtypic immunity. Our study shows that during a protective recall response, cDCs in a fortified LN environment enhance the breadth, generation, and tissue migration of effector T cells to augment lung TRM responses.","Paik, Daniel H; Farber, Donna L",J. exp. med,,739

This study aims to assess Internet use characteristics and objectively examine the potential psychological factors associated with Internet addiction (IA) during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported survey was conducted among Chinese children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old. Participants completed questionnaires containing Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and questions regarding demographic information and Internet use characteristics. Results: A total of 2050 participants (mean age:12.34 ± 4.67 years old, female: 48.44%) were enrolled. Fifty-five (2.68%) participants met the criterion for addictive Internet use (IAT≥70), while 684 (33.37%) participants were classified as problematic Internet users (69≥IAT≥40). Internet usage had grown during the COVID-19 epidemic, including the frequency and duration of recreational Internet use, and the frequency of stay-up Internet use. A linear regression analysis showed female gender (β=-0.091, p&lt;0.001), age (β=0.066, p=0.001), depression (β=0.257, p&lt;0.001), and stress (β=0.323, p&lt;0.001) were significantly correlated with the IAT total scores (R=0.539, R 2 =0.291, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: We observed excessive Internet use among Chinese children and adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19.

It is important to assess their effectiveness in a real-world setting. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 136,532 individuals in the Mayo Clinic health system (Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin) with PCR testing data between December 1, 2020 and April 20, 2021. We compared clinical outcomes for a vaccinated cohort of 68,266 individuals who received at least one dose of either vaccine (nBNT162b2 = 51,795; nmRNA-1273 = 16,471) and an unvaccinated control cohort of 68,266 individuals propensity-matched based on relevant demographic, clinical, and geographic features. We estimated real-world vaccine effectiveness by comparing incidence rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and COVID-19 associated hospitalization and ICU admission starting 7 days after the second vaccine dose. Findings: The real-world vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 86.1% (95% CI: 82.4-89.1%) for BNT162b2 and 93.3% (95% CI: 85.7-97.4%) for mRNA-1273. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were 88.8% (95% CI: 75.5-95.7%) and 86.0% (95% CI: 71.6-93.9%) effective in preventing COVID-19 associated hospitalization.

An old-time problem,2021,"Vaccines against COVID-19 (and its emerging variants) are an essential global intervention to control the current pandemic situation. Vaccines often cause adverse events; however, the vast majority of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are a consequence of the vaccine stimulating a protective immune response, and not allergic in etiology. Anaphylaxis as an AEFI is uncommon, occurring at a rate of less than 1 per million doses for most vaccines. However, within the first days of initiating mass vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, there were reports of anaphylaxis from the UK and USA. More recent data implies an incidence of anaphylaxis closer to 1:125,000 doses with respect to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In this position paper, we discuss the background to reactions to the current COVID-19 vaccines and relevant steps to mitigate against the risk of anaphylaxis as an AEFI. We propose a global surveillance strategy led by allergists in order to understand the potential risk and generate data to inform evidence-based guidance, and thus provide reassurance to public health bodies and members of the public.","Turner, Paul J; Ansotegui, Ignacio J; Campbell, Dianne E; Cardona, Victoria; Ebisawa, Motohiro; El-Gamal, Yehia; Fineman, Stanley; Geller, Mario; Gonzalez-Estrada, Alexei; Greenberger, Paul A; Leung, Agnes S Y; Levin, Michael E; Muraro, Antonella; SÁnchez Borges, Mario; Senna, Gianenrico; Tanno, Luciana K; Yu-Hor Thong, Bernard; Worm, Margitta",World Allergy Organ J,,739

The main objective is to unveil the evolution of the number of real infected people, and consequently to predict the peak of the epidemic and subsequent evolution. For this purpose, an original nonlinear model relating the raw data with the time-varying geometric ratio of infected people is elaborated, and a Kalman Filter is used to estimate the involved state variables. A hypothetical simulated case is used to show the adequacy and limitations of the proposed method. Then, several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA, are tested to illustrate its behavior when real-life data are processed. The results obtained clearly show the beneficial effect of the severe lockdowns imposed by many countries worldwide, but also that the softer social distancing measures adopted afterwards have been almost always insufficient to prevent the second virus wave.","Gomez-Exposito, Antonio; Rosendo-Macias, Jose A; Gonzalez-Cagigal, Miguel A",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

The extremely rapid international spread of the disease with significant morbidity and mortality made finding possible therapeutic interventions a global priority. While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients. Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment. Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies. While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rationalise the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","Hashem, Anwar M; Alghamdi, Badrah S; Algaissi, Abdullah A; Alshehri, Fahad S; Bukhari, Abdullah; Alfaleh, Mohamed A; Memish, Ziad A",Travel Med Infect Dis,,739

In general, a large number of training samples are required to improve the reconstruction performance of a certain model. However, in real clinical applications, it is difficult to obtain tens of thousands of raw patient data to train the model since saving k-space data is not in the routine clinical flow. Therefore, enhancing the generalizability of a network based on small samples is urgently needed. In this study, three novel applications were explored based on parallel imaging combined with the GAN model (PI-GAN) and transfer learning. The model was pre-trained with public Calgary brain images and then fine-tuned for use in (1) patients with tumors in our center; (2) different anatomies, including knee and liver; (3) different k-space sampling masks with acceleration factors (AFs) of 2 and 6. As for the brain tumor dataset, the transfer learning results could remove the artifacts found in PI-GAN and yield smoother brain edges. The transfer learning results for the knee and liver were superior to those of the PI-GAN model trained with its own dataset using a smaller number of training cases. However, the learning procedure converged more slowly in the knee datasets compared to the learning in the brain tumor datasets. The reconstruction performance was improved by transfer learning both in the models with AFs of 2 and 6. Of these two models, the one with AF=2 showed better results. The results also showed that transfer learning with the pre-trained model could solve the problem of inconsistency between the training and test datasets and facilitate generalization to unseen data.","Lv, Jun; Li, Guangyuan; Tong, Xiangrong; Chen, Weibo; Huang, Jiahao; Wang, Chengyan; Yang, Guang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08175v1.pdf,739

Could Vitamin D, which modulates IL-6, be more effective than currently deployed IL-6 antagonists, including tocilizumab, thereby presenting a useful therapeutic option in COVID-19? A narrative review of published trials examining the effect of Vitamin D administration in COVID-19 patients was conducted, and the theoretical basis for the use of tocilizumab as an IL-6 antagonist was compared with the immunomodulatory effect of Vitamin D on IL-6 production. Four of the six included studies reported a positive effect of Vitamin D on outcomes. While tocilizumab non-selectively blocks both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory actions of IL-6, Vitamin D lowers immune cell IL-6 production, potentially reducing pro-inflammatory effects, but does not specifically target IL-6 receptors, avoiding any deleterious effect on the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-6. Vitamin D may have advantages over tocilizumab as an IL-6 immunomodulator, and, given that it is safe if administered under clinical supervision, there is a strong rationale for its use.","Silberstein, Morry",Eur J Pharmacol,,739

The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey was administered anonymously via social media (WeChat). It was completed by 10 545 adults in all of mainland China's 31 provinces. The survey consisted of 74 items covering sociodemographic characteristics, preventive measures for COVID-19, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related outcomes during the period of quarantine. Regression models examined associations among study variables. Diabetes was associated with a six-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 infection among respondents or their family members. Among people with diabetes, individuals who rarely wore masks had double the risk of suspected COVID-19 infection compared with those who always wore masks, with an inverse J-shaped relationship between face mask wearing and suspected COVID-19 infection. People with diabetes tended to have both poor knowledge of COVID-19 and poor compliance with preventive measures, despite perceiving a high risk of personal infection (40.0% among respondents reporting diabetes and 8.0% without diabetes). Only 54-55% of these respondents claimed to consistently practice preventive measures, including wearing face masks. Almost 60% of those with diabetes experienced food or medication shortages during the quarantine period, which was much higher than those without diabetes. Importantly, respondents who experienced medication shortages reported a 63% higher COVID-19 infection rate. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of self-reported personal and family member COVID-19 infection, which is mitigated by consistent use of face masks.","Shi, Zumin; Yan, Alice; Zimmet, Paul; Sun, Xiaoming; Cristina do Vale Moreira, Nayla; Cheskin, Lawrence J; Wang, Liming; Qu, Weidong; Yan, Hong; Hussain, Akhtar; Wang, Youfa",Horm Metab Res,,739

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on blood transfusion therapy (BTT) of thalassemia patients and suggest ways to ensure safe and reliable blood supplies amid such health crises. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 (before COVID-19) to July 2020 (during COVID-19) based on the data provided by a thalassemia center, named Help International Welfare Trust, Karachi, Pakistan. SPSS version 24.0 was used for the data analysis. Data were described in the form of means and percentages. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the consumption of PRBCs bags after the emergence of COVID-19 (P=0.002). Moreover, the number of thalassemia patients receiving BTT was dropped by 10.56% during the pandemic. There was a strong negative correlation observed between the rising cases of COVID-19 in Pakistan and the number of patients missing their therapy sessions (r=-0.914, P=0.030). A considerable decline in the reserves of all Rhesus-negative blood groups amid the COVID-19 outbreak was also observed. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the already suboptimal care catered to thalassemia patients in Karachi, Pakistan. The fear of the virus contraction coupled with the lockdown and restricted mobility has disrupted the entire transfusion chain from donor to the recipient. Collaborated efforts by the government and healthcare authorities are essential to ensure sufficient blood for thalassemia patients amid the pandemic.","Arshad Ali, S; Azim, D; Hassan, H M; Iqbal, A; Ahmed, N; Kumar, S; Nasim, S",Transfus. clin. biol,,739

Understanding the complex intersectionality of vulnerability and reaching those in most critical need of healthcare lies at the heart of fostering and sustaining resilient healthcare systems. Harnessing the long-recognised value of Community and Informal Care Providers (CICPs) is instrumental to Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The present COVID-19 context serves as a poignant example of where access to formal healthcare services by many has become increasingly difficult. Here, the value of informal or volunteer-led health services has been a lifeline for many. For several decades, formal reportage has evidenced the established role of CICPs, particularly across Sub-Saharan Africa with quantifiable efficacy across a number of domains, such as, maternal and child health, neglected tropical disease prevention, tuberculosis care and malaria control. CICPs have been sustainable and effective as a conduit between the formal and informal health sectors, and between health facilities and the remotest of communities. Maximising the function of CICPs relies on socio-culturally, geographically sensitive, and bespoke support;psychosocial, practical, and logistical capacitation coupled with situationally and culturally appropriate monitoring and evaluation. The Astana Declaration highlights the centrality of building on existing knowledge, insight and resource.

364003,Pre-labor anorectal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pregnant patients: is it time to think about it?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy can be stressful for women and families, so the life satisfaction of pregnant women may face significant challenges. This study aimed to identify the relationship among anxiety symptoms, perceived social support and life satisfaction, and to further explore whether perceived social support can play a mediating role. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from June to September in Shenyang City, China in 2019. 290 effective questionnaires were collected. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) as well as demographic variables were included in each questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to explore the mediating role of perceived social support in the relationship between anxiety symptoms and life satisfaction. Then the mediation model was examined by the PROCESS macro for SPSS. RESULTS: After adjusting control variables, anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with life satisfaction and explained 14.7% of the variance. Higher level of perceived social support was related to higher level of life satisfaction, explaining 21.0% of the variance. Perceived social support partly mediated the relationship between anxiety symptoms and life satisfaction for pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived social support played a mediating role between anxiety symptoms and life satisfaction among pregnant women. Strategies and measures to improve perceived social support may be expected to buffer the impact of anxiety symptoms on pregnant women's life satisfaction.","Yu, Mingli; Qiu, Tian; Liu, Chunli; Cui, Qi; Wu, Hui",Health Qual Life Outcomes,,739

Restricted therapeutic and early-stage vaccination still renders social exclusion through lockdown as the key containment mode.To understand the dynamics, we propose PHIRVD, a mechanistic infection propagation model that Machine Learns (Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo) the evolution of six infection stages, namely healthy susceptible (H), predisposed comorbid susceptible (P), infected (I), recovered (R), herd immunized (V) and mortality (D), providing a highly reliable mortality prediction profile for 18 countries at varying stages of lockdown. Training data between 10 February to 29 June 2020, PHIRVD can accurately predict mortality profile up to November 2020, including the second wave kinetics. The model also suggests mortality-to-infection ratio as a more dynamic pandemic descriptor, substituting reproduction number. PHIRVD establishes the importance of early and prolonged but strategic lockdown to contain future relapse, complementing futuristic vaccine impact.","Chattopadhyay, Amit K; Choudhury, Debajyoti; Ghosh, Goutam; Kundu, Bidisha; Nath, Sujit Kumar",Sci Rep,,739
365337,A Rare Coincidence-a Second Trimester Ectopic Pregnancy Following Early Medical Abortion: a Case Report,2021,"Faced with the health and economic consequences of the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the biomedical community came together to identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat the novel disease at breathtaking speeds. The field advanced from a publicly available viral genome to a commercialized globally scalable diagnostic biomarker test in less than 2 months, and first-in-human dosing with vaccines and repurposed antivirals followed shortly thereafter. This unprecedented efficiency was driven by three key factors: 1) international multistakeholder collaborations, 2) widespread data sharing, and 3) flexible regulatory standards tailored to meet the urgency of the situation. Learning from the remarkable success achieved during this public health crisis, we are proposing a biomarker-centric approach throughout the drug development pipeline. Although all therapeutic areas would benefit from end-to-end biomarker science, efforts should be prioritized to areas with the greatest unmet medical needs, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic disorders, and malignant neoplasms. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Faced with the unprecedented threat of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, the biomedical community collaborated to develop a globally scalable diagnostic biomarker (viral DNA) that catalyzed therapeutic development at breathtaking speeds. Learning from this remarkable efficiency, we propose a multistakeholder biomarker-centric approach to drug development across therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs.","Fader, Kelly A; Zhang, Jiangwei; Menetski, Joseph P; Thadhani, Ravi I; Antman, Elliott M; Friedman, Gary S; Ramaiah, Shashi K; Vaidya, Vishal S",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,739

METHODS: This scoping study was based on a ""Google Form"" covering three constituents of the response plan against COVID-19: responders, activities and crisis communication. The attitudes of health professionals who are working in Tunisia and Algeria were measured through the Likert scale with four propositions, grouped in pairs, during the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 280 health professionals, 170 of whom are Tunisians along with 110 Algerians. The medians of age and that of professional seniority are, respectively, 37 and 10 years. The role of ""health workers"", ""Mass Media"" and ""civil society associations"" was found to be satisfactory according, respectively, to 92%, 71%, and 55% of the respondents. As far as 72% of health professionals are concerned, the ""barrier measures"" were respected by the population. Approximately, seven in ten respondents were satisfied with the quality of communication occuring between the Ministries of Health and its epidemiological structures. CONCLUSION: Health professionals of the Maghreb working in Tunisia and Algeria had a generally positive perception of the role of population responders, community engagement, and the quality of official communication in regards to the response plan against COVID- 19. This perception would be a prerequisite for the success of community participation and multisectoral action as well as essential in the strategy of prevention and control of this pandemic and of possible other health emergencies.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Ben Abdelaziz, Islem; Yahia, Faten; Barhoumi, Tarek; Soulimane, Abdelkrim",Tunis Med,,739

Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. METHODS: We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics. RESULTS: A classifier is trained on the MEDLINE dataset that can automatically annotate text, such as scientific articles, news articles or medical reports with relevant concepts from the MeSH thesaurus. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed text classifier shows promising results in the evaluation of health-related news. The application of the developed classifier enables the exploration of news and extraction of health-related insights, based on the MeSH thesaurus, through a similar workflow as in the usage of PubMed, with which most health researchers are familiar.","Pita Costa, Joao; Rei, Luis; Stopar, Luka; Fuart, Flavio; Grobelnik, Marko; Mladenic, Dunja; Novalija, Inna; Staines, Anthony; Pääkkönen, Jarmo; Konttila, Jenni; Bidaurrazaga, Joseba; Belar, Oihana; Henderson, Christine; Epelde, Gorka; Gabaráin, Mónica Arrúe; Carlin, Paul; Wallace, Jonathan",Artif Intell Med,,739
388162,Potential drawbacks of frequent asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing,2020,"This paper describes how the health surveillance protocols adopted in hospitals and nursing homes have changed in response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its risks. These changes concern assessments that must be performed with urgency, to detect potential cases and symptoms that may indicate contagion and to protect vulnerable and hypersensitive workers. Besides, these changes have been implemented in order to regulate how the appointed occupational physician should perform everyday tasks, particularly in regard to preventive visits, periodic visits, office visits, and visits meant to authorize one's return to the workplace. This paper recommends that both preventive visits and periodic visits should include rapid antigen swab tests to screen for SARS-CoV-2 (which, if positive, should be confirmed by molecular tests) and serologic tests to detect IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Since this phase involves great risks for healthcare facilities, this paper proposes that swab testing should be performed every month and that serologic testing should be performed every three months (depending on whether the first test detects the presence of IgG antibodies). By combining antigen and molecular swab tests, healthcare professionals can diagnose workers with SARS-CoV-2 and identify positive asymptomatic cases. Because of its costs and its long turnaround times for results, molecular swab testing is recommended only when one needs to confirm a positive antigen swab test result. Serologic testing should be used alongside swab testing, to acquire data concerning the immunity of workers.","Saretto, G.; Bozzi, C.",G Ital Med Lav Ergon,,739

Vengono presentate le modificazioni al protocollo di sorveglianza sanitaria resesi necessario per la gestione del rischio SARS-CoV-2 in operatori di strutture ospedaliere e sanitarie-assistenziali. Le modifiche hanno riguardato gli accertamenti da effettuare con carattere di necessità ed urgenza al fine di intercettare possibili casi e sintomi sospetti di contagio e di proteggere gli operatori fragili e ipersensibili. Sono state necessarie anche per gestire l’attività ordinaria del Medico Competente, all’interno delle visite mediche preventive, periodiche, su richiesta e di ritorno al lavoro. Si propone l’introduzione del tampone antigenico rapido per screening SARS-CoV-2 (confermato in caso di positività dal tampone molecolare) e la ricerca sierologica IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 sia in fase di visita preventiva che di visita periodica. La periodicità degli accertamenti per SARS-CoV-2 è modulata a seconda della gravità dei dati epidemiologici del territorio di riferimento, della comparsa di un focolaio interno alla Struttura e/o della presenza di un reparto Covid, della positività o meno dell’operatore per IgG SARS-CoV-2. Si passa così da una frequenza di un tampone alla volta alla settimana nelle situazioni valutate gravi ad un tampone al mese in quelle a basso rischio. La presenza di IgG nell’operatore consente di dilazionare leggermente la periodicità dei tamponi, riducendo il numero dei controlli e l’impegno organizzativo ed economico richiesto per realizzarli. Il test rapido sierologico da polpastrello per ricerca IgG e IgM deve essere effettuato ogni 3 mesi per tutti i lavoratori. La combinazione tampone antigenico e molecolare consente di diagnosticare i casi SARS-CoV-2 e di individuare gli eventuali operatori asintomatici positivi. L’impiego del tampone molecolare, in considerazione del costo che ha l’esame e del tempo lungo necessario per acquisire l’esito, viene limitato alle sole situazioni in cui si renda necessario confermare la positività del tampone antigenico, nonché al controllo nelle attività ad alto rischio quali quelle di operatore in reparto Covid-19 o di operatore inserito in struttura in cui si è verificato un focolaio. L’impiego dell’esame sierologico dopo prelievo venoso, in considerazione dell’elevato costo che ha l’accertamento, viene limitato alla visita preventiva e a casi particolari in cui si renda necessario, su scelta del Medico Competente, un approfondimento in tal senso.","Saretto, G.; Bozzi, C.",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,,739

An embedded multiple case study design was used to track adaptations made to a vestibular and bilateral integration (VBI) protocol-traditionally delivered in-person-that was implemented via teletherapy in a pediatric outpatient clinic. The ""Modification and Adaptation Checklist"" was used to track protocol adaptations. Data were examined through descriptive analyses; 63 adaptations were made to the VBI protocol. The most frequently noted adaptation was ""Repeating protocol activities,"" whereas the ""Integrating another treatment approach with the VBI protocol"" was the least common adaptation. The FRAME may be useful for tracking adaptations and evaluating how adaptations influence intervention effectiveness.","Piller, Aimee; Juckett, Lisa A; Hunter, Elizabeth G",OTJR (Thorofare N J),,739

403422,Filtration evaluation and clinical use of expired elastomeric P-100 filter cartridges during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Breastfeeding is critical to maternal and child health and survival, and the benefits persist until later in life. Inappropriate marketing of breastmilk substitutes (BMS), feeding bottles, and teats threatens the enabling environment of breastfeeding, and exacerbates child mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition, especially in the context of COVID-19. These tactics also violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. This study identified marketing tactics of BMS companies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by reviewing promotional materials and activities from 9 companies in 14 countries, and the official Code reporting data from the Philippines. Eight qualitative themes emerged that indicate companies are capitalizing on fear related to COVID-19 by using health claims and misinformation about breastfeeding. Other promotional tactics such as donations and services were used to harness the public sentiment of hope and solidarity. Past studies show that these tactics are not new, but the pandemic has provided a new entry point, helped along by the unprecedented boom in digital marketing. There was a sharp increase of reported violations in the Philippines since the pandemic: 291 during the first months of the outbreak compared with 70 in all of 2019, corroborating the thematic findings. A lack of public awareness about the harm of donations and inadequate Code implementation and enforcement have exacerbated these problems. Proposed immediate action includes using monitoring findings to inform World Health Assembly (WHA) actions, targeted enforcement, and addressing misinformation about breastfeeding in the context of COVID-19. Longer-term action includes holding social media platforms accountable, raising public awareness on the Code, and mobilizing community monitoring.","Ching, Constance; Zambrano, Paul; Nguyen, Tuan T; Tharaney, Manisha; Zafimanjaka, Maurice Gerald; Mathisen, Roger",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,739

406426,You better watch out: US COVID-19 wave dynamics versus vaccination strategy,2020-12-22,"Purpose: The goal of these recommendations is to provide guidance on the optimal care of children with glomerular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with glomerular diseases are known to be more susceptible to infection. Risk factors include decreased vaccine uptake, urinary loss of immunoglobulins, and treatment with immunosuppressive medications. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) recently published guidelines on the care of adult glomerulonephritis patients. This guideline aims to expand and adapt those recommendations for programs caring for children with glomerular diseases. Sources of information: We used the CSN COVID-19 Rapid Response Team adult glomerulonephritis recommendations, published in the Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease, as the foundation for our guidelines. We reviewed documents published by nephrology and non-nephrology societies and health care agencies focused on kidney disease and immunocompromised populations. Finally, we conducted a formal literature review of publications relevant to pediatric and adult glomerular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and immunosuppression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The leadership of the Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists (CAPN), which is affiliated with the CSN, identified a team of clinicians and researchers with expertise in pediatric glomerular diseases. The aim was to adapt Canadian adult glomerulonephritis guidelines to make them applicable to children and discuss pediatric-specific considerations. The updated guidelines were peer-reviewed by senior clinicians with expertise in the care of childhood glomerular diseases. Key findings: We identified a number of key areas of glomerular disease care likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) visit types, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) blood work and imaging, (5) home monitoring, (6) immunosuppression, (7) other medications, (8) immunizations, (9) management of children with suspected COVID-19, (10) renal biopsy, (11) patient education and support, and (12) school and child care. Limitations: There are minimal data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in adult or pediatric glomerular disease patients, as well as the efficacy of strategies to prevent infection transmission within these populations. Therefore, the majority of these recommendations are based on expert opinion and consensus guidance. To expedite the publication of these guidelines, an internal peer-review process was conducted, which may not have been as rigorous as formal journal peer-review. Implications: These guidelines are intended to promote optimal care delivery for children with existing or newly diagnosed glomerular diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of modified care delivery, altered immunosuppression strategies, and limited access to existing resources remain uncertain.","Robinson, Cal; Ruhl, Michelle; Kirpalani, Amrit; Alabbas, Abdullah; Noone, Damien; Teoh, Chia Wei; Langlois, Valerie; Phan, Veronique; Lemaire, Mathieu; Chanchlani, Rahul",Can J Kidney Health Dis,,739

The complexity of inpatient glycemic management has led to the emergence of inpatient diabetes management service (IDMS), a multidisciplinary team approach to glycemic management. OBJECTIVE: To review recent literature on the financial and clinical impact of IDMS in hospital settings. METHODS: We searched PubMed using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms to describe the concept of IDMS and combined the search terms with a comparative effectiveness filter for costs and cost analysis developed by the National Library of Medicine. FINDINGS: In addition to several improved clinical endpoints such as glycemic management outcomes, IDMS implementation is associated with hospital cost savings through decreased length of stay, preventing hospital readmissions, hypoglycemia reduction, and optimizing resource allocation. There are other downstream potential cost savings in long-term patient health outcomes and avoidance of litigation related to suboptimal glycemic management. CONCLUSION: IDMS may play an important role in helping both academic and community hospitals to improve the quality of diabetes care and reduce costs. Clinicians and policymakers can utilize existing literature to build a compelling business case for IDMS to hospital administrations and state legislatures in the era of value-based healthcare.","Haque, Waqas Zia; Demidowich, Andrew Paul; Sidhaye, Aniket; Golden, Sherita Hill; Zilbermint, Mihail",Curr Diab Rep,,739

DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: 194 member states of the World Health Organization. POPULATION: Target populations for covid-19 vaccination based on country specific characteristics and vaccine objectives (maintaining essential core societal services; reducing severe covid-19; reducing symptomatic infections and stopping virus transmission). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Size of target populations for covid-19 vaccination. Estimates use country specific data on population sizes stratified by occupation, age, risk factors for covid-19 severity, vaccine acceptance, and global vaccine production. These data were derived from a multipronged search of official websites, media sources, and academic journal articles. RESULTS: Target population sizes for covid-19 vaccination vary markedly by vaccination goal and geographical region. Differences in demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers lead to highly variable estimates of target populations at regional and country levels. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (63.0 million, 8.9%) and people with underlying conditions (265.9 million, 37.4%); these two categories are essential in maintaining societal functions and reducing severe covid-19, respectively. In contrast, South East Asia has the highest share of healthy adults (777.5 million, 58.9%), a key target for reducing community transmission. Vaccine hesitancy will probably impact future covid-19 vaccination programmes; based on a literature review, 68.4% (95% confidence interval 64.2% to 72.6%) of the global population is willing to receive covid-19 vaccination. Therefore, the adult population willing to be vaccinated is estimated at 3.7 billion (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 4.1 billion). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of target groups at country and regional levels highlights the importance of designing an equitable and efficient plan for vaccine prioritisation and allocation. Each country should evaluate different strategies and allocation schemes based on local epidemiology, underlying population health, projections of available vaccine doses, and preference for vaccination strategies that favour direct or indirect benefits.","Wang, Wei; Wu, Qianhui; Yang, Juan; Dong, Kaige; Chen, Xinghui; Bai, Xufang; Chen, Xinhua; Chen, Zhiyuan; Viboud, Cécile; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie",BMJ,,739

Therefore, we compared cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses between severe and mild COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from their first and third weeks of illness. Severe pneumonia was defined as an oxygen saturation &#8804;93% at room air. Expressions of molecules related to T-cell activation and functions were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The population dynamics of T cells at the first week were not different between the two groups. However, total numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells tended to be lower in the severe group at the third week of illness. Expressions of Ki-67, PD-1, perforin, and granzyme B in CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group at the third week. In contrast to the mild group, the levels of their expression did not decrease in the severe group. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 had a higher degree of proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity of T-cells at the late phase of illness without cytotoxic T-cell contraction, which might contribute to the development of severe COVID-19.","Kang, Chang Kyung; Han, Gi-Chan; Kim, Minji; Kim, Gwanghun; Shin, Hyun Mu; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Park, Wan Beom; Kim, Eu Suk; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Nam-Joong; Kim, Hang-Rae; Oh, Myoung-Don",Int J Infect Dis,,739

Evidence on risk factors may support early detection, but is inconclusive. Our aim was to identify risk factors for postpartum depression and anxiety, before, during and after pregnancy. METHODS: We used data from 1406 mothers of the intervention arm of the Post-Up study. Risk factors were collected at 3 weeks and 12 months postpartum. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured in the first month postpartum by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and 6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), respectively. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify relevant risk factors. RESULTS: Of the mothers, 8.0% had EPDS-scores &#8805;9 and 14.7% STAI-6-scores &#8805;42. Factors associated with higher risk of depression were: foreign language spoken at home, history of depression, low maternal self-efficacy and poor current health of the mother. No initiation of breastfeeding was associated with lower risk of depression, no breastfeeding at 3 weeks postpartum increased the risk. Factors associated with higher risk of anxiety were: higher educational level, history of depression, preterm birth, negative experience of delivery and first week postpartum, excessive infant crying, low maternal self-efficacy, low partner support and poor current maternal health. LIMITATIONS: Use of a self-report instrument, potential bias by postpartum mood status, and no inclusion of emerging depression cases after one month postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: The shared and separate risk factors for postpartum depression and anxiety may help professionals in identifying mothers at increased risk and provide opportunities for preventive interventions and treatment.","van der Zee-van den Berg, Angarath I; Boere-Boonekamp, Magda M; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G M; Reijneveld, Sijmen A",J Affect Disord,,739

This study was performed to evaluate the pattern of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea considering the potential impact of policy interventions on transmission rates. METHODS: A SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model with a breakpoint that allows a change in transmission rate at an unknown point was established. Estimated trajectories of COVID-19 from SIR models with and without a breakpoint were compared. RESULTS: The proposed model with a break fitted the actual series of infection cases much better than the classic model. The estimated breakpoint was March 7, 2020 and the transmission rate dropped by 0.23 after the breakpoint. A counterfactual study based on our estimate indicated that the number of infected could have reached 2 500 000 compared to the peak of 8000 in the observed series. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to consider a change in the transmission rate to evaluate the trajectory of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Our estimation and counterfactual experiments indicate that public health interventions may play a role in determining the pattern of spread of infectious diseases.","Kim, Young-Joo; Seo, Myung Hwan; Yeom, Hyun-E",Int J Infect Dis,,739

Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. This is a chart review with the objective to analyse the results achieved with transplantation of children kidneys ( 2 years) in the HCFMRP-USP from 1998 to 2000. A total of 5 pacients received en bloc renal transplants from donors aged 9 months to 2 years old, weighthing between 8 and 14 kg. Results: Only one patient lost the allograft within 8 days of transplantation due to allograft trombosis. Two patients had ureteral complications, one with ureteral necrosis and urinary fistula and the other with total ureterovesical anastomosis disrupture. Both were successfully repaired. Intra operatory complication was experienced in one pacient, with arterial anastomosis rupture. In loco reperfusion and repair was made. Another patient had inferior renal pole rupture, treated with polar nefrectomy at the 4º PO. Despite such problems, mean follow up of 20,7 months showed serum creatinine ranging from 0,9 to 2 mg/100ml, with no serious complications. Conclusion: Our data support the use of en bloc child cadaveric kidneys, even from infant donors less than two year of age, when the organ necessity supplant the higher rates of complications.","Rodrigues, A.A.Jr; Souza, R.V.S.; Suaid, H.

482986,Using an air purifier as a supplementary protective measure in dental clinics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,2020,"To maintain the sustainable development of a platform’s economy, e-commerce platforms put forward various subsidy programs to retailers selling on them during COVID-19. This paper investigates an e-commerce platform’s decision on subsidizing a retailer selling on it with logistics constraints during an epidemic scenario, with a focus on the role of power structure and altruistic preference. By constructing two Stackelberg game models, the research obtains the optimal subsidy under two power structures (i.e., the dominant platform and the weaker platform), respectively. The comparison between them shows that the conditions of the dominant platform giving subsidies (both altruistic preference and logistics constraints should be higher enough) are stricter than the weaker platform. Considering the same altruistic preference and logistics constraints, the optimal subsidy provided by the weaker platform should always be not less than the dominant platform. However, the weaker platform, surprisingly, can get more utility by lowering its altruistic preference voluntarily when the commission fee is low. No matter what the power structure is, the optimal subsidy increases with the logistics service coefficient and altruistic preference, and the dominant member’s profit/utility is not less than the weaker one, which confirms “the first mover advantage”. Finally, more managerial implications to the platform-retailer systems are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Telemedicine could be an alternative to the routine clinical care in this difficult period. We aimed to investigate in a cohort of LT recipients the access to remote consultation and the attitude towards Telemedicine using an internet-based survey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We invited LT recipients from the Liver Transplant Follow-up Center of the University Hospital of Salerno to access remote consultation. A subgroup of them also participated in a self-administered, internet-based survey evaluating demographics; LT data and immunosuppressive therapy; comorbidities; attitudes towards COVID-19 infection; their perceptions of the need for health care, and their approach to telemedicine. RESULTS: Seventy-four/one hundred and fifty-three (48.3%) LT recipients were unable to access remote consultation. They showed a significantly higher mean age and a higher percentage of low school degree compared to those who accessed it (pâ¯=â¯0.03 and pâ¯=â¯0.001, respectively). Among the remaining LT recipients, 50/79 (63.3%) responded to the survey; mean time from liver transplantation was 12â¯±â¯7 years; 94% of the sample reported at least one comorbidity; 44% of LT recipients declared to be ""very much/much"" worried because of COVID-19 infection, and 64% considered themselves more vulnerable than the general population. Forty percent of responders refused the routine follow-up visit, and 62% were very interested in using Telemedicine. CONCLUSION: LT recipients were anxious because of COVID-19 infection and considered themselves more vulnerable than the general population, refusing the routine clinical visit. For continuing services during the COVID-19 era, new strategies are needed and telemedicine shows promise.","Santonicola, Antonella; Zingone, Fabiana; Camera, Silvia; Siniscalchi, Monica; Ciacci, Carolina",Clin. res. hepatol. gastroenterol,,739

Methods: We draw on survey data from a diverse national sample collected in September 2020 and employ multivariate analysis to explore how Covid-19 has uniquely affected the attitudes and life experiences of American parents. Results: We find that Covid-19 has been unusually burdensome for parents as they are more likely to have experienced negative physical and mental health outcomes and suffer more negative financial impacts. Despite the challenges parents face, they also remain cautious about in-person school and vaccinations. Although mothers have been the focus of much news coverage, we find that both mothers and fathers have been similarly and negatively impacted by Covid-19. Conclusion: American parents are suffering at distinctively high levels during this pandemic. In order to recover, policymakers will need to target outreach and support tailored to the needs and issues facing parents.","Elder, Laurel; Greene, Steven",Social science quarterly,,739

Subsequently, data has emerged showing a significant CV benefit in patients treated with SGLT2i regardless of diabetes status. Renal protection has been initially evaluated in CV randomized trials only as secondary endpoints; nonetheless, the positive results gained have rapidly led to the evaluation of nephroprotection as primary outcome in the CREDENCE trial. Different renal and vascular mechanisms can account for the CV and renal benefits enlightened in recent literature. As clinical guidelines rapidly evolve and the role of SGLT2i appears to become pivotal for CV, T2DM, and kidney disease management, in this review, we analyze the renal effects of SGLT2, the benefits derived from its inhibition, and how this may result in the multiple CV and renal benefits evidenced in recent clinical trials.","Margonato, Davide; Galati, Giuseppe; Mazzetti, Simone; Cannistraci, Rosa; Perseghin, Gianluca; Margonato, Alberto; Mortara, Andrea",Heart fail. rev,,739

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 3351 college students from China were surveyed through questionnaires about their sociodemographic and COVID-19 characteristics, the needs of school support, and their experiences with anxiety and depression. RESULTS Anxiety and depression were reported by 6.88% and 10.50% of students, respectively. Married, higher education, non-medical, and urban students had significantly higher risks of anxiety or depression. Additionally, symptoms such as cough and fever, especially when following a possible contact with suspected individuals, quarantine history of a personal contact, going out 1-3 times a week, not wearing a mask, and spending 2-3 hours browsing COVID-19-related information were significantly associated with the occurrence of anxiety or depression. Those who used methods to regulate their emotional state, used a psychological hotline, and who had visited a psychiatrist showed higher anxiety or depression. Those who used online curricula and books, used preventive methods for COVID-19, and who had real-time information about the epidemic situation of the school showed lower anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19-related aspects, students' needs for psychological assistance and information from schools were also associated with anxiety and depression among college students.","Meng, Na; Liu, Zheng; Wang, Ya; Feng, Yan; Liu, Qin; Huang, Junqiang; Li, Xiaolin",Med Sci Monit,,739

METHODS: A retrospective case note review of all patients and staff present in the ED of The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia in the 24 h period of Sunday 5 April 2020. The primary outcome of PPE estimates was generated from identifying the number of patient contacts and aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) performed per patient as well as the number of staff on shift. RESULTS: One hundred patients attended the ED (50% of usual) and all were included in the study. For a low-risk community environment allocating PPE per patient contact required 48 face shields, 382 surgical masks, 48 N95 masks and 430 gowns for the day, increasing to 430 face shields, 331 surgical masks, 430 N95 masks and 761 gowns in a high-risk community environment. Allocating PPE using zoning reduces the requirement to 48 face shields, 192 surgical masks, 48 N95 masks and 204 gowns, increasing to 196 face shields, 96 surgical masks, 196 N95 masks and 292 gowns per day in a high-risk community environment.

We propose that use of the factory-calibrated Dexcom G6 CGM system would improve glycemic control in this cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized crossover trial in young people with type 1 diabetes (16-24 years old) comparing the Dexcom G6 CGM system and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Participants were assigned to the interventions in random order during two 8-week study periods. During SMBG, blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was worn by each participant for 10 days at the start, week 4, and week 7 of the control period. HbA1c measurements were drawn after enrollment and before and after each treatment period. The primary outcome was time in range 70-180 mg/dL. RESULTS: Time in range was significantly higher during CGM compared with control (35.7 ± 13.5% vs. 24.6 ± 9.3%; mean difference 11.1% [95% CI 7.0-15.2]; P < 0.001).

Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of the virus, and DAXX over-expression further restricted infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites of viral replication and led to its degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX is a potent restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and that the virus has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.","Kain, Alice Mac; Maarifi, Ghizlane; Aicher, Sophie-Marie; Arhel, Nathalie; Baidaliuk, Artem; Vallet, Thomas; Tran, Quang Dinh; Hardy, Alexandra; Chazal, Maxime; Porrot, Françoise; OhAinle, Molly; Carlson-Stevermer, Jared; Oki, Jennifer; Holden, Kevin; Simon-Lorière, Etienne; Bruel, Timothée; Schwartz, Olivier; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Nisole, Sébastien; Vignuzzi, Marco; Roesch, Ferdinand",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.442916,739

We assessed the impact of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of Covid-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-March 2020. Here we show that Covid-19 growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 C, and specific humidity of 4-6 g/m3 during the outbreak period, while they were lower both in warmer/wetter and colder/dryer regions. Relationships between Covid-19 and climate were robust to the potential confounding effects of air pollution and socio-economic variables, including population size, density and health expenditure. The strong relationship between local climate and Covid-19 growth rates suggests the possibility of seasonal variation in the spatial pattern of outbreaks, with temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere becoming at particular risk of severe outbreaks during the austral autumn-winter.","Ficetola, Gentile Francesco; Rubolini, Diego",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20040501,739

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on breastfed, term, Filipino infants less than six months old who were seen at local health centers and clinics in an urban area. The serum 25(OH)D levels of these infants and their mothers were determined, and their demographic data, nutritional status, sun exposure behavior, and maternal vitamin D intake were analyzed for correlation using regression models. RESULTS: Among the 131 infants, 101 (77%) had vitamin D deficiency (VDD), which was defined as having 25(OH)D levels <37.5 nmol/L, and 13 (10%) had vitamin D insufficiency (VDI), with levels >37.5–50 nmol/L. Conversely, maternal VDD with levels <50 nmol/L was seen in 31 (24%) mothers and maternal VDI with levels 50–75 nmol/L, in 63 (48%) mothers. Infant age and maternal 25(OH)D status were independent predictors of infant VDD. Infants less than three months old were found to have a six-time increased risk of infant VDD (p=0.004). Infants who had mothers with VDD had a six-time increased risk, whereas those with maternal VDI had a four-time increased risk of infant VDD (p=0.049 and p=0.020, respectively). CONCLUSION: Both infant and maternal VDD and VDI were seen to be highly prevalent in this tropical, urban community. Young infants and maternal VDD/VDI independently increased the risk of infant VDD, whereas lack of sun exposure of the mothers increased the risk for maternal VDI.","Parian-de los Angeles, Emaluz; Retoriano, Katherine; Arnaldo, Hazel; Ronquillo-Nolasco, Maria Estela; Urtula, Randy",Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316475/; https://doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2021.24.4.403,739

One way both of these goals can be achieved more easily, even with a small team of researchers, is to utilize group testing. In this paper, we evaluate the results from a novel tablet application developed for the Resilience in Education and Development (RED) Study. The RED-app includes 12 cognitive tasks designed for groups of children aged 7 to 13 to independently complete during a 1-h school lesson. The quality of the data collected was high despite the lack of one-on-one engagement with participants. Most outcomes from the tablet showed moderate or high reliability, estimated using internal consistency metrics. Tablet-measured cognitive abilities also explained more than 50% of variance in teacher-rated academic achievement. Overall, the results suggest that tablet-based, group cognitive assessments of children are an efficient, reliable, and valid method of collecting the large datasets that modern psychology requires.

Furthermore, COVID‐19 may also increase sympathetic discharge, through changes in blood gases (chronic intermittent hypoxia, hyperpnea), angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE)1/ACE2 imbalance, immune/inflammatory factors, or emotional distress. Nevertheless, the potential role of the sympathetic nervous system has not yet been considered in the pathophysiology of COVID‐19.

Despite growing evidence supporting the effectiveness of MBC for depression and other mental health conditions, many physicians and mental health clinicians have yet to adopt MBC practice. In part, this is due to individual and organizational barriers to implementing MBC in busy clinical settings. In this paper, we briefly review the evidence for the efficacy of MBC focusing on pharmacological management of depression and provide example clinical scenarios to illustrate its potential clinical utility in psychiatric settings. We discuss the barriers and challenges for MBC adoption and then address these by suggesting simple solutions to implement MBC for depression care, including recommended outcome scales, monitoring tools, and technology solutions such as cloud-based MBC services and mobile health apps for mood tracking. The availability of MBC tools, ranging from paper-pencil questionnaires to mobile health technology, can allow psychiatrists and clinicians in all types of practice settings to easily incorporate MBC into their practices and improve outcomes for their patients with depression.","Hong, Ran Ha; Murphy, Jill K; Michalak, Erin E; Chakrabarty, Trisha; Wang, Zuowei; Parikh, Sagar V; Culpepper, Larry; Yatham, Lakshmi N; Lam, Raymond W; Chen, Jun",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s283731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469295/,739
645368,"Resolvin D1, therapeutic target in acute respiratory distress syndrome",2021-11-15,"Today, the increasing rate of cancer-related mortality, has rendered cancer a major global challenge, and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Conventional approaches in the treatment of cancer mainly include chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, these approaches still come with certain disadvantages, including drug resistance, and different side effects such as gastrointestinal (GI) irritation (e.g., diarrhea, mucositis). This has encouraged scientists to look for alternative therapeutic methods and adjuvant therapies for a more proper treatment of malignancies. Application of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy in the clinical management of cancer appears to be a promising strategy, with several notable advantages, e.g., increased safety, higher tolerance, and negligible GI side effects. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses have indicated the active role of yeast probiotics in mitigating the rate of cancer cell proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis through regulating the expression of cancer-related genes and cellular pathways. Strain-specific anti-cancer activities of yeast probiotics strongly suggest that their administration along with the current cancer therapies may be an efficient method to reduce the side effects of these approaches. The main purpose of this article is to evaluate the efficacy of yeast probiotics in alleviating the adverse effects associated with cancer therapies.","Sambrani, Roshanak; Abdolalizadeh, Jalal; Kohan, Leila; Jafari, Behboud",Mol Biol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389533/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-06110-1,739

For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable, and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a multiscale, spatiotemporal-continuous, and easy-to-implement measurement. The proposed PCI, established and demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10% penetration in the US population) and Facebook’s social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong state boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay effect, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of a contagious disease (e.g., COVID-19), and 2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choices. The methodological and contextual knowledge of PCI, together with the launched visualization platform and data sharing capability, is expected to support research fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.","Li, Zhenlong; Huang, Xiao; Ye, Xinyue; Jiang, Yuqin; Yago, Martin; Ning, Huan; Hodgson, Michael E.; Li, Xiaoming",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564697/,739

Some interventions used to give oxygen therapy are aerosol generating procedures. Staff delivering such interventions require PPE and are exposed to a significant viral load resulting in sick days and even death. We aim to reduce this risk using an augmented-reality communication device: The HoloLens by Microsoft. OBJECTIVES: In a tertiary centre in London we aim to implement HoloLens technology, allowing other medical staff to remotely join the consulting clinician when in a high-risk patient area delivering oxygen therapy. The study primary outcome was to reduce the exposure to staff and demonstrate non-inferiority staff satisfaction when compared to not using the device. Our secondary outcome was to reduce extrapolated PPE costs when using the device. METHODS: Our study was conducted in March and April 2020, within a respiratory unit delivering aerosolising oxygen therapies (High flow nasal oxygen, Continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation) to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported questionnaires to assess satisfaction in key areas of patient care. An infrared people counting device was also used to assess staff in and out of the unit. MAIN RESULTS: Mean self-reported time in the high-risk zone was less when using HoloLens (2.69 hours) compared to usual practice (3.96 hours) although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3657). HoloLens showed non-inferiority when compared to usual practice in staff satisfaction score for all domains. Furthermore, mean staff satisfaction score encouragingly improved when using HoloLens. Self-reported PPE counts from this study showed 12 staff members changing PPE 25.8 times per shift, almost double the 13.5 times in the HoloLens count. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated HoloLens can reduce the number of staff exposed to aerosol generating areas in a novel infectious disease. Our results show it did not impair communication, medical staff availability or end of life care. HoloLens technology may also reduce the use of PPE, which has equipment availability and cost benefits. This study provides grounding for further use of the HoloLens device by bringing a bedside experience to experts remote to the situation.","Cafferkey, J. J.; Hampson, D. O.; Ross, C.; Kooner, A.

The highest efficacy in virus inhibiting was shown for compounds 2a–e with cage moieties bound by aliphatic linkers. The therapeutic index (selectivity index) for 2b exceeded that for reference compounds amantadine, deitiforin and rimantadine almost 10-fold. As shown by structure–activity analysis, the length of the linker has a dramatic effect on the toxicity of compounds. Compound 2e with –C(12)H(24)– linker exhibited the lowest toxicity (CTD(50) = 2216 μM). Derivatives of camphor, therefore, can be considered as prospective antiinfluenza compounds active against influenza viruses resistant to adamantane-based drugs.","Sokolova, Anastasiya S.; Yarovaya, Оlga I.; Korchagina, Dina V.; Zarubaev, Vladimir V.; Tretiak, Tatiana S.; Anfimov, Pavel M.; Kiselev, Oleg I.; Salakhutdinov, Nariman F.",Bioorg Med Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089614001448; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2014.02.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089614001448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631360/,739

671869,"Increased rates of secondary bacterial infections, including Enterococcus bacteremia, in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)",2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: Viral load is a major contributor to outcome in patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), with high values leading to a fatal outcome. Evidence from the 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak indicated that different genotypes of the virus can have different phenotypes in patients. Additionally, due to the error-prone nature of viral RNA synthesis in an individual patient, the EBOV genome exists around a dominant viral genome sequence. The minor variants within a patient may contribute to the overall phenotype in terms of viral protein function. To investigate the effects of these minor variants, blood samples from patients with acute EVD were deeply sequenced. RESULTS: We examine the minor variant frequency between patients with acute EVD who survived infection with those who died. Non-synonymous differences in viral proteins were identified that have implications for viral protein function. The greatest frequency of substitution was identified at three codon sites in the L gene—which encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recapitulating this in an assay for virus replication, these substitutions result in aberrant viral RNA synthesis and correlate with patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings support the notion that in patients who survived EVD, in some cases, the genetic variability of the virus resulted in deleterious mutations that affected viral protein function, leading to reduced viral load. Such mutations may also lead to persistent strains of the virus and be associated with recrudescent infections.","Dong, Xiaofeng; Munoz-Basagoiti, Jordana; Rickett, Natasha Y.; Pollakis, Georgios; Paxton, William A.; Günther, Stephan; Kerber, Romy; Ng, Lisa F.

Participants also reported on their level of burnout, psychological distress, and intentions to quit. Results revealed that HCPs perceived the most useful personal resource to be family support; the most useful hospital resources were a safe environment, personal protective equipment, and support from colleagues; the most useful system resources were job protection, and clear communication and information about COVID. Moreover, HCPs who perceived having more available hospital resources also reported lower levels of psychological distress symptoms, burnout, and intentions to quit. Finally, although training and counseling services were perceived as useful to reduce stress, training was not perceived as widely available, and counseling services, though reported as being available, were underutilized.
