226,226,226,Detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using isothermal amplification of target DNA sequences,9.132422,8.710482,2009-02-02,"BACKGROUND: The most common method of GMO detection is based upon the amplification of GMO-specific DNA amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here we have applied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify GMO-related DNA sequences, 'internal' commonly-used motifs for controlling transgene expression and event-specific (plant-transgene) junctions. RESULTS: We have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in GMO studies. Results show that detection of 0.01% GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using LAMP. CONCLUSION: This work shows that GMO detection can be carried out using LAMP for routine screening as well as for specific events detection. Moreover, the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets, even with a high background of DNA, here demonstrated, highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for GMO detection.","Lee, David; La Mura, Maurizio; Allnutt, Theo R; Powell, Wayne",BMC Biotechnol,116,1

However, current identification tools are far from being satisfactory for both reliable diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. A rapid, simple, and highly efficient molecular based method for identification of agents of black grain eumycetoma is introduced, aiming to improve diagnostic in endemic areas. Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) uses species-specific padlock probes and isothermal DNA amplification. The tests were based on ITS sequences and developed for Falciformispora senegalensis, F. tompkinsii, Madurella fahalii, M. mycetomatis, M. pseudomycetomatis, M. tropicana, Medicopsis romeroi, and Trematosphaeria grisea. With the isothermal RCA assay, 62 isolates were successfully identified with 100% specificity and no cross reactivity or false results. The main advantage of this technique is the low-cost, high specificity, and simplicity. In addition, it is highly reproducible and can be performed within a single day.","Ahmed, Sarah A.; van den Ende, Bert H. G. Gerrits; Fahal, Ahmed H.; van de Sande, Wendy W. J.; de Hoog, G.

2894,2894,2894,Development and evaluation of a rapid molecular diagnostic test for Zika virus infection by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification,9.11679,8.537312,2017-10-18,"The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease caused an enormous number of infections in Central and South America, and the unusual increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection aroused global concern. Here, we developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay using a portable device for the detection of ZIKV. The assay specifically detected ZIKV strains of both Asian and African genotypes without cross-reactivity with other arboviruses, including Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The assay detected viral RNA at 14.5 TCID(50)/mL in virus-spiked serum or urine samples within 15 min, although it was slightly less sensitive than reference real time RT-PCR assay. We then evaluated the utility of this assay as a molecular diagnostic test using 90 plasma or serum samples and 99 urine samples collected from 120 suspected cases of arbovirus infection in the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco, Brazil in 2016. The results of this assay were consistent with those of the reference RT-PCR test. This portable RT-LAMP assay was highly specific for ZIKV, and enable rapid diagnosis of the virus infection. Our results provide new insights into ZIKV molecular diagnostics and may improve preparedness for future outbreaks.","Kurosaki, Yohei; Martins, Danyelly Bruneska Gondim; Kimura, Mayuko; Catena, Andriu dos Santos; Borba, Maria Amélia Carlos Souto Maior; Mattos, Sandra da Silva; Abe, Haruka; Yoshikawa, Rokusuke; de Lima Filho, José Luiz; Yasuda, Jiro",Sci Rep,116,28

It was eventually proved to be caused by parvovirus after pathogen isolation and identification. As the genomic sequence analysis showed, this pathogen shared 90.8–94.6% of nucleotide identity with goose parvovirus (GPV), and it was called duck-origin novel goose parvovirus (N-GPV). In this study, a quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) assay was developed for the rapid diagnosis of N-GPV. A set of four specific primers, two inner and two outer, were designed targeting at VP3 gene, which could be completed within 60 min at 65°C in water bath or on a real-time PCR instrument for quantitative analysis. Specificity test of LAMP assay showed that there was no cross-reactivity between N-GPV and other duck pathogens, and the detection limit of qLAMP assay was 1.0 × 10(2) copies/μL. The repeatability of this method was confirmed by inter-assay and intra-assay tests with variability ranging from 0.74 to 2.25%. The results have indicated that the qLAMP assay was a simple, rapid, accurate, sensitive, and specific method for detecting N-GPV, especially on field detection.","Yang, Jing; Chen, Hao; Wang, Zhenzhong; Yu, Xianglong; Niu, Xiaoyu; Tang, Yi; Diao, Youxiang",Front Microbiol,116,1

More recently, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was successfully designed for field use in the grape powdery mildew pathosystem; however, false negatives or false positives were prevalent in grower-conducted assays due to the difficulty in perceiving the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate at low DNA concentrations. A quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) assay using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe was assessed by grape growers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Custom impaction spore samplers were placed at a research vineyard and six commercial vineyard locations, and were tested bi-weekly by the lab and by growers. Grower-conducted qLAMP assays used a beta-version of the Smart-DART handheld LAMP reaction devices (Diagenetix, Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA), connected to Android 4.4 enabled, Bluetooth-capable Nexus 7 tablets for output. Quantification by a quantitative PCR assay was assumed correct to compare the lab and grower qLAMP assay quantification. Growers were able to conduct and interpret qLAMP results; however, the Erysiphe necator inoculum quantification was unreliable using the beta-Smart-DART devices. The qLAMP assay developed was sensitive to one spore in early testing of the assay, but decreased to >20 spores by the end of the trial. The qLAMP assay is not likely a suitable management tool for grape powdery mildew due to losses in sensitivity and decreasing costs and portability for other, more reliable molecular tools.","Thiessen, Lindsey D.; Neill, Tara M.; Mahaffee, Walter F.",PeerJ,116,1

While feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) manipulates the host early innate immune response in many different ways, the host could activate the antiviral response to counteract it through some unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which serve as a class of regulatory factors in the host, participate in the regulation of the host innate immune response against virus infection. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-26a were significantly upregulated upon FHV-1 infection. Furthermore, FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a via a cGAS-dependent pathway, and knockdown of cellular cGAS significantly blocked the expression of miR-26a induced by poly (dA:dT) or FHV-1 infection. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-26a during viral infection. miR-26a was able to increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 and promote type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting viral replication. The mechanism study showed that miR-26a directly targeted host SOCS5. Knockdown of SOCS5 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and enhanced the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and overexpression of suppressor of the cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5) decreased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and inhibited the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. Meanwhile, with the knockdown of SOCS5, the upregulated expression of phosphorylated STAT1 and the anti-virus effect induced by miR-26a were significantly inhibited. Taken together, our data demonstrated a new strategy of host miRNAs against FHV-1 infection by enhancing IFN antiviral signaling.","Zhang, Jikai; Li, Zhijie; Huang, Jiapei; Yin, Hang; Tian, Jin; Qu, Liandong",Viruses,116,28

In this framework, we study an axiomatic decision model and prove a representation theorem. Resulting decision criteria aggregate partial evaluations consisting of (i) the conditional expected utility associated with the analyzed part of the decision, and (ii) the best and worst consequences of its non-analyzed part. The representation theorem is consistent with a wide variety of decision criteria, which allows for expressing various degrees of knowledge on ([Formula: see text]) and various types of attitude toward ambiguity and uncertainty. This diversity is taken into account by specific models already existing in the literature. We exploit this fact and propose some particular forms of our model incorporating these models as sub-models and moreover expressing various types of beliefs concerning the relative plausibility of the analyzed and the non-analyzed events ranging from probabilities to complete ignorance that include capacities.","Jaffray, Jean-Yves; Jeleva, Meglena",Theory Decis,116,1
5549,5549,5549,Rapid and sensitive detection of PRRSV by a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,8.97314,8.68454,2011-08-17,"The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, which binds the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), is a potent vasoconstrictor. On a pathophysiological basis, both ACE I/D and AT1R A1166C polymorphism lead to an enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis, thereby possibly contributing to circulatory disturbances. A mutually facilitatory effect may be presumed between the two polymorphisms. We examined whether this synergistic effect is involved in the evolution of different types of ischemic stroke. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. The ACE D allele combined with the AT1R 1166C allele did not yield a risk of ischemic stroke. However, the co-occurrence of the homozygous ACE D/D and at least one AT1R 1166C allele was more frequent in the ischemic stroke group than in the control group (22.4 vs 11%, p<0.005, OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.46–3.7). After specific subgroup analysis, this synergistic association was even stronger for small-vessel ischemic stroke (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.9–6.24; p<0.0005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data confirmed this association (adjusted OR, 3.54, 95% CI, 1.88–7.16; p<0.0005). Our results demonstrate that ACE D/D and AT1R 1166C polymorphism were associated with the development of small-vessel ischemic stroke through a mutually facilitatory interplay between them. Genetic interactions might contribute to the altered functional network in renin-angiotensin system in vascular disorders.","Szolnoki, Zoltán; Maasz, Anita; Magyari, Lili; Horvatovich, Katalin; Farago, Bernadett; Somogyvari, Ferenc; Kondacs, Andras; Szabo, Mihaly; Fodor, Lajos; Bodor, Anita; Hadarits, Ferenc; Melegh, Bela",Neuromolecular Med,116,1

We showed that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have high levels of circulating progranulin and that its depletion in a mouse model by a monoclonal antibody aggravates MS-like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, unexpectedly, progranulin-deficient mice (Grn(−/−)) were resistant to EAE, and this resistance was fully restored by wild-type bone marrow transplantation. FACS analyses revealed a loss of MHC-II-positive antigen-presenting cells in Grn(−/−) mice and a reduction in the number of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells along with a strong increase in the number of scavenger receptor class B (CD36+) phagocytes, suggesting defects in antigen presentation along with a compensatory increase in phagocytosis. Indeed, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Grn(−/−) mice showed stronger uptake of antigens but failed to elicit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. An increase in the number of CD36+ phagocytes was associated with increased local inflammation at the site of immunization, stronger stimulation-evoked morphological transformation of bone marrow-derived macrophages to phagocytes, an increase in the phagocytosis of E. coli particles and latex beads and defects in the clearance of the material. Hence, the outcomes in the EAE model reflect the dichotomy of progranulin-mediated immune silencing and autoimmune mechanisms of antigen recognition and presentation, and our results reveal a novel progranulin-dependent pathway in autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","Schmitz, Katja; Wilken-Schmitz, Annett; Vasic, Verica; Brunkhorst, Robert; Schmidt, Mirko; Tegeder, Irmgard",Cell Mol Immunol,116,20

These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016–2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (~94%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.","Cardenas, Nicolas Cespedes; Pozo, Pilar; Lopes, Francisco Paulo Nunes; Grisi-Filho, José H.

Quality and coherence with prenatal health promotion best practices depend on an individual class instructor. The objective of our study was to document the experiences, practices, and perceptions of our diverse Ottawa, Canada community of prenatal educators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quantitative, mixed methods e-survey conducted in Ottawa, Canada, prenatal educators were asked to describe their prenatal class settings, delivery formats, content, perceptions of pregnant women, and recommendations. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included public health nurses and a diverse group of “allied childbirth educators” (ACE). Topics related to pregnancy, labor, and postpartum issues were well addressed; however, established and emerging risks to pregnancy were omitted. Nurses were more likely to discuss lifestyle risks to pregnancy and general prenatal health promotion, whereas ACE respondents emphasized informed consent and individualized counseling. Women marginalized by social exclusion including Indigenous women, immigrants, and women with disabilities were perceived as missing from prenatal educational settings. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of prenatal education provides opportunities for collaboration; however, established and emerging risk factors to pregnancy are neglected topics. Addressing the needs of diverse communities of pregnant women requires timely, evidence-based, inclusive, and culturally safe delivery of prenatal health promotion.","Terrell, Rowan M.; Soucy, Nura L.; Chedid, Rebecca A.; Phillips, Karen P.",J Educ Health Promot,116,28

Nevertheless, mutual relationships between the individual bioactive substances contained in these plants remain poorly elucidated. In this work, phytochemical composition of extracts from the aerial and underground parts of five Papaveraceae species (Chelidonium majus L., Corydalis cava (L.) Schweigg. and Körte, C. cheilanthifolia Hemsl., C. pumila (Host) Rchb., and Fumaria vaillantii Loisel.) were examined using LC-ESI-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole analyzer. Large differences in the quality and quantity of all analyzed compounds were observed between species of different genera and also within one genus. Two groups of metabolites predominated in the phytochemical profiles. These were isoquinoline alkaloids and, in smaller amounts, non-phenolic carboxylic acids and phenolic compounds. In aerial and underground parts, 22 and 20 compounds were detected, respectively. These included: seven isoquinoline alkaloids: protopine, allocryptopine, coptisine, berberine, chelidonine, sanguinarine, and chelerythrine; five of their derivatives as well as non-alkaloids: malic acid, trans-aconitic acid, quinic acid, salicylic acid, trans-caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol; and vanillin. The aerial parts were much richer in phenolic compounds regardless of the plant species. Characterized extracts were studied for their antimicrobial potential against planktonic and biofilm-producing cells of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. The impact of the extracts on cellular metabolic activity and biofilm biomass production was evaluated. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of the extracts introduced to the polymeric carrier made of bacterial cellulose was assessed. Extracts of C. cheilanthifolia were found to be the most effective against all tested human pathogens. Multiple regression tests indicated a high antimicrobial impact of quercetin in extracts of aerial parts against planktonic cells of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans, and no direct correlation between the composition of other bioactive substances and the results of antimicrobial activity were found.

This study aims to evaluate a new feasible and safe intracorporeal anastomosis technique after laparoscopic left-sided colon or rectum resection in a pig model. METHODS The technique was evaluated in 5 pigs. The OrVil device (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was inserted into the anus and advanced proximally to the rectum. A 0.5-cm incision was made in the sigmoid colon, and the 2 sutures attached to its delivery tube were cut. After the delivery tube was evacuated through the anus, the tip of the anvil was removed through the perforation. The sigmoid colon was transected just distal to the perforation with an endoscopic linear stapler. The rectosigmoid segment to be resected was removed through the anus with a grasper, and distal transection was performed. A 25-mm circular stapler was inserted and combined with the anvil, and end-to-side intracorporeal anastomosis was then performed. RESULTS We performed the technique in 5 pigs.

Preliminary evidence suggests AFDAS has a lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities and higher incidence of insular cortex involvement than AF known to exist before stroke occurrence (KAF). This favours a neurogenic AF substrate (autonomic dysregulation) in which the presence of underlying heart disease is not necessary for AF to occur. The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities and echocardiographic abnormalities in patients with AFDAS, KAF and no AF (NAF). Secondary objectives are to compare the proportion with insular cortex involvement, stroke recurrence and death in the three rhythm groups. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a systematic review including cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies and clinical trials involving ≥18 years patients, with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack published between inception and 31 December 2020 in any language, and reporting the proportion of patients with AFDAS, KAF and NAF. We will search PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus by applying predefined search terms.

Research on LSG outcomes among adolescents assessed a narrow range of anthropometric, nutritional, or cardiometabolic parameters, leading to an incomplete picture of these changes. We examined a wide variety of anthropometric, nutritional, and cardiometabolic parameters among adolescents before and after LSG. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of all obese adolescents who underwent LSG at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar, between January 2011 and June 2015 (N = 102). We assessed preoperative levels and postoperative changes in 4 anthropometric, 15 nutritional, and 10 cardiometabolic parameters. RESULTS The study sample comprised 79 patients with complete information (36 males, mean age 15.99 ± 1.1 years). At a mean of 24.2 months post-LSG, we observed (1) significantly reduced mean weight and body mass index by 51.82 ± 28.1 kg and 17 ± 6.24 kg/m2, respectively; (2) the highest prevalence of post-LSG deficiencies pertained to vitamin D, albumin, and ferritin (89.3, 38, and 33.3%, respectively); (3) low hemoglobin levels (29.3%) only in females; (4) trace elements were not deficient; (4) significant reductions in percentage of adolescents with elevated low-density lipoprotein (from 66.1 to 38.9%), alanine aminotransferase (from 45.3 to 10.9%), and aspartate aminotransferase (from 24.1 to 8.6%) levels; (5) 100% remission of prediabetes cases; and (6) 80% remission of type 2 diabetes cases. CONCLUSIONS LSG achieved significant weight loss and improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors among adolescents. However, the slight worsening of preexisting nutritional deficiencies warrants careful preoperative surveillance and appropriate postoperative nutritional supplementation.","Elhag, Wahiba; El Ansari, Walid; Abdulrazzaq, Sama; Abdullah, Ali; Elsherif, Mohamed; Elgenaied, Israa",Obesity surgery,116,31

Obviously, this will be done using a variety of analytical methods and using different antigens, including peptides. In this work, we compare three method variations for detecting specific immunoglobulins directed against peptides of approximately 15-aa of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These linear peptide epitopes were selected using antigenicity algorithms, and were synthesized with an additional terminal cysteine residue for their bioconjugation. In two of the methods, constructs were prepared where the peptide (F, function) is attached to a negatively charged hydrophilic spacer (S) linked to a dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine residue (L, lipid) to create a function-spacer-lipid construct (FSL). These FSLs were easily and controllably incorporated into erythrocytes for serologic testing or in a lipid bilayer deposited on a polystyrene microplate for use in an enzyme immunoassays (EIA). The third method, also an EIA, used polyacrylamide conjugated peptides (peptide-PAA) prepared by controlled condensation of the cysteine residue of the peptide with the maleimide-derived PAA polymer which were immobilized on polystyrene microplates by physisorption of the polymer. In this work, we describe the synthesis of the PAA and FSL peptide bioconjugates, design of test systems, and comparison of the bioassays results, and discuss potential reasons for higher performance of the FSL conjugates, particularly in the erythrocyte-based serologic assay.","Ryzhov, Ivan M; Tuzikov, Alexander B; Nizovtsev, Alexey V; Baidakova, Ludmila K; Galanina, Oxana E; Shilova, Nadezhda V; Ziganshina, Marina M; Dolgushina, Nataliya V; Bayramova, Guldana R; Sukhikh, Gennady T; Williams, Eleanor C; Nagappan, Radhika; Henry, Stephen M; Bovin, Nicolai V",Bioconjugate chemistry,116,5

However, the efficiency of universal LS screening in elderly populations has not been well studied. Objective To compare the performance of age-restricted and universal LS screening using reflex mismatch repair (MMR) immunohistochemistry (IHC) of CRC tumors. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting A large, diverse, community-based health care system. Participants 3891 persons with newly diagnosed CRC who had LS screening between 2011 and 2016. Measurements Diagnostic yield of different LS screening strategies. Results Sixty-three LS cases (diagnostic yield, 1.62%) were identified by universal screening, with only 5 (7.9%) detected after age 70 years and 1 (1.6%) detected after age 80 years. When all patients with CRC who had universal screening were used as the denominator, 58 LS cases (diagnostic yield, 1.49% [95% CI, 1.13% to 1.92%]) were identified in patients with CRC diagnosed at or before age 70 years, 60 LS cases (diagnostic yield, 1.54% [CI, 1.18% to 1.98%]) were identified in those with CRC diagnosed at or before age 75 years, and 62 LS cases (diagnostic yield, 1.59% [CI, 1.22% to 2.04%]) were identified in those with CRC diagnosed at or before age 80 years. Using 75 years as the upper age limit for screening missed 3 of 63 (4.8%) LS cases but resulted in 1053 (27.1%) fewer cases requiring tumor MMR IHC. Using 80 years as the upper age limit missed 1 of 63 (1.6%) LS cases and resulted in 668 (17.2%) fewer cases requiring tumor MMR IHC. Limitation Persons who were eligible for but did not complete germline analysis were excluded from calculations of performance characteristics. Conclusion The incremental diagnostic yield decreased substantially after age 70 to 75 years. Stopping reflex CRC screening for LS after age 80 years may be reasonable because of very low efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings, but this merits further investigation. Studies evaluating the effect of diagnosing LS in elderly persons on their family members are needed.

Lack of a relevant animal model is one barrier toward better understanding its pathophysiology. Our objective is to demonstrate that grafting split-thickness human skin onto nude mice results in survival of engrafted human skin and murine scars that are morphologically, histologically, and immunohistochemically consistent with human HSc. Twenty nude mice were xenografted with split-thickness human skin. Animals were euthanized at 30, 60, 120, and 180 days postoperatively. Eighteen controls were autografted with full-thickness nude mouse skin and euthanized at 30 and 60 days postoperatively. Scar biopsies were harvested at each time point. Blinded scar assessment was performed using a modified Manchester Scar Scale. Histologic analysis included hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, toluidine blue, and picrosirius red staining. Immunohistochemistry included anti-human human leukocyte antigen-ABC, α-smooth muscle actin, decorin, and biglycan staining. Xenografted mice developed red, shiny, elevated scars similar to human HSc and supported by blinded scar assessment. Autograft controls appeared morphologically and histologically similar to normal skin. Xenografts survived up to 180 days and showed increased thickness, loss of hair follicles, adnexal structures and rete pegs, hypercellularity, whorled collagen fibers parallel to the surface, myofibroblasts, decreased decorin and increased biglycan expression, and increased mast cell density. Grafting split-thickness human skin onto nude mice results in persistent scars that show morphologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical consistency with human HSc. Therefore, this model provides a promising technique to study HSc formation and to test novel treatment options.","Momtazi, Moein; Kwan, Peter; Ding, Jie; Anderson, Colin C; Honardoust, Dariush; Goekjian, Serge; Tredget, Edward E",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,116,12

We aimed to assess the results of a conservative approach of OAGB compared with the original OAGB and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a 1-year follow-up study. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted based on prospectively maintained data in a cohort of patients who underwent either RYGB with a Roux limb of a 150 cm and a BPL of 50 cm (n = 145), OAGB with a 200-cm BPL (n = 272), or OAGB with a 160-cm BPL (n = 383), from March 2013 to 2017 at three university hospitals by a single surgical team. RESULTS Groups were comparable regarding age and sex. Mean preoperative body mass indexes of the RYGB, OAGB-160, and OAGB-200 groups were 44.5 ± 5.8, 45.6 ± 6.3, and 46.7 ± 6.4 kg/m2, respectively. One-year follow-up rates were 83.4%, 85.3%, and 82.5% for the RYGB, OAGB-200, and OAGB-160 groups, respectively. One-year percent total weight loss values were 33.8 ± 6.7 after OAGB-160 and 35.3 ± 6.9 after OAGB-200 (P = 0.056), which were significantly greater compared with 30.9 ± 8.9 after RYGB (P < 0.001). All groups were comparable regarding remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Mean operative time was longer with RYGB than with either OAGB techniques. Groups were comparable for postoperative complications except for the incidence of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM), occurring in 11 patients (4.7%) after OAGB-200, 7 of whom required revisional surgery, in one patient (0.3%) after OAGB-160 who responded to parenteral alimentation, but in no patients after RYGB. CONCLUSION After 1 year, OAGB with a 160-cm BPL was as effective as OAGB with a 200-cm BPL and RYGB, but safer than OAGB-200. This approach also avoided the need for revisional surgery following postoperative malnutrition.","Khalaj, Alireza; Mousapour, Pouria; Motamedi, Mohammad Ali Kalantar; Mahdavi, Maryam; Valizadeh, Majid; Hosseinpanah, Farhad; Barzin, Maryam",Obesity surgery,116,27

For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture the authoritarian-conservatism motivation and the dominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N1 = 3,132; N2 = 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world.","Lin, Chujun; Alvarez, R Michael",PloS one,116,7

The current meta-analysis aimed to explore these comparisons. METHOD Following the Preferred Reporting Items or Systematic Reviews Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we identified empirical studies that compared maladaptive and/or adaptive perfectionism scores in those diagnosed with AN and either a non-clinical comparison group, people diagnosed with a non-AN ED, or people diagnosed with another psychological disorder (i.e., other DSM diagnoses). In total, we identified 23 studies, comprising 3,561 participants who were all female. Comparison groups extracted from the studies were a non-clinical group, bulimia nervosa (BN) diagnosis group, and another psychological diagnostic group. RESULTS When AN maladaptive perfectionism levels were compared against the comparison groups, the results showed that those diagnosed with AN were more perfectionistic compared to the non-clinical group (g = 1.00), and the other psychiatric diagnosis group (g = 0.41). People diagnosed with AN also had higher levels of adaptive perfectionism levels compared to the non-clinical group (g = 1.24). Comparisons between those diagnosed with AN and BN were statistically non-significant for maladaptive perfectionism.

In this study, we investigated ampicillin's ability, which is commonly used in dairy cattle disease treatment, to induce Cronobacter sakazakii into the VBNC state. After treatment with ampicillin, the counts of culturable cells decreased from 108 CFU/mL to an undetected level 7-30 days post-treatment. Meanwhile, viable cells were still approximately 104-105 cells/mL, and could be resuscitated under appropriate conditions. Fluorescence microscopy showed that VBNC cell maintained apparent cellular integrity, but that the morphology of VBNC cells differed visibly from that of normal cells. Moreover, the respiratory chain activity of VBNC cells were confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, suggesting that cells in a VBNC state were physiologically active. Finally, transcriptomics analysis and real-time PCR (qPCR) validation were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of VBNC cell formation. Over-expression of relA, lon, ppx, and ppk in the toxin-antitoxin (TA) trigger system contributed to VBNC cell formation. In the TA trigger system, RelA and exopolyphosphatases/guanosine pentaphosphate phosphohydrolases (PPX/GPPA) synthesize ppGpp, which activates polyphosphate kinase (PPK), the cellular enzyme that accumulates plyphosphate (PolyP). PolyP combines with and stimulates Lon to degrade the antitoxins, thereby activating the toxins that induce a VBNC state. The results of our research will facilitate a better understanding of the survival strategies that bacteria develop to deal with ampicillin pressure and the health risks associated with VBNC Cronobacter sakazakii induced by antibiotics.","Zhang, Jingfeng; Wang, Li; Shi, Lei; Chen, Xun; Chen, Chuxin; Hong, Zicheng; Cao, Yong; Zhao, L",International journal of food microbiology,116,12

However, there is a need for a full picture of mental health problems with comprehensive analysis among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to systematically identify the mental health problems among healthcare workers in various countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed of the following databases: PubMed, Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, MEDLINE Complete, and SocINDEX. The last date of our search was November 2, 2020. We included all cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and used the Joanna Briggs Institute tool to assess their quality. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the pooled prevalence of mental health problems using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic and Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS A total of 38 studies were identified that reported the mental health problems of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of healthcare workers analyzed in this review included 27.9% doctors, 43.7% nurses, and 7.0% allied health workers. The pooled prevalence of mental health problems for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and distress was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22-75%), 40% (95% CI: 29-52%), 37% (95% CI: 29-45%), and 37% (95% CI: 25-50%), respectively. CONCLUSION This review yielded evidence that estimated the global prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of this study was to perform a linguistic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the PCFS for people infected with COVID-19 for the Chilean population. METHODS It corresponds to a cross-sectional study of the scale validation. The study was performed in two phases: 1. Forward-translation, reverse-translation. 2. Apparent cross-validity adaptation. For the apparent validity analysis, 29 people who had been hospitalized in HDS with a COVID-19 infection diagnosis and at the time of the interview were in their homes. RESULTS In phase 1 forward-translation, an item required semantical changes. The reverse-translation versions were similar, and the most relevant doubts were resolved in a consensus meeting.

The first report in humans was in 2010 and research has focused only on disease-associated human sample detection. The only HuACyV (CyCV-ChileNPA1, HuACyV10) reported in the Chilean population was in children (3.3%) with an acute respiratory infection. Its detection in respiratory samples from adults, with/without respiratory disease remains unknown. The aim of this study was to detect HuACyV10 in adults with and without respiratory disease. HuACyV10 was studied in nasopharyngeal swabs from 105 hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 104 adults without respiratory symptoms. Total nucleic acids were extracted, and viral rep and cp gene fragments were amplified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. HuACyV10 was detected in 19.05% adults with CAP and in 0.96% asymptomatic adults, being significantly higher in adult CAP than asymptomatic (n = 1) ones (p = 0.0001). Ct values were between 26.7 and 39.6, and the median was 34.1 for rep and 33.8 for the CAP in adults CAP (p = 0.68), and 35.7 and 36.0, respectively, in the asymptomatic case. HuACyV10 detection in CAP adults concentrated in the Autumn-Winter season of the Southern hemisphere. The only asymptomatic adult with HuACyV10 was detected in the Spring-Summer period. In this first report of HuACyV10 in respiratory samples from adults, detection was significantly higher in CAP than in asymptomatic adults. As the sensitivity of both rep and cp genes was similar, both can be applied for detecting HuACyV10. It would be advisable to investigate the pathogenic role of HuACyV10 in adult respiratory infections. ​.","Prades, Yara; Pizarro, Rolando; Ruiz, Mauricio; Moreno, Cristian; Avendaño, Luis F; Luchsinger, Vivian",Journal of medical virology,116,16

Though Fenton reactions are commonly used in wastewater treatment, their mechanisms and the active species involved remain obscure due to their mechanistic complexity. In this work, the mechanism of an electro-Fenton reaction, in which a FeLaO3 catalyst was entrapped in a sol-gel matrix, was studied in the presence of azo dyes as the model for toxic compounds. Increased knowledge about this important mechanism will confer greater control over related processes and enable a more efficient and green degradation method. DFT calculations showed that in the presence of Fe(IV), OH are formed under acidic conditions and that both the iron and hydroxyl species function as oxidation reagents in the degradation process. The structure of the formed Fe(IV) embedded in the solid matrix was not the typical tetravalent structure. Entrapment in the sol-gel matrix stabilized the catalyst, enhanced its efficiency and enabled it to be recycled. Sol-gel matrices constitute a simple method for the degradation of stable and toxic compounds under extreme pH conditions. The findings of this study are highly significant for the treatment of typically acidic wastewaters.","Biton Seror, Shira; Shamir, Dror; Albo, Yael; Kornweitz, Haya; Burg, Ariela",Chemosphere,116,31

Contemporary aesthetic eyelid and periorbital rejuvenation has undergone a paradigm shift from an excisionally based surgical approach to one that prioritizes volume preservation and/or augmentation. The development of fat grafting to the eyelids and periorbita has given the eyelid surgeon a viable surgical alternative to prevent postoperative volume depletion, maintain the smooth transition of the lower eyelid to the cheek, and aid in restoring the youthful appearance desired after surgery. This article will focus of periorbital fat grafting and touch upon fat preservation techniques as primary restorative procedures or as surgical adjuncts.","Massry, Guy G; Azizzadeh, Babak",Facial plastic surgery : FPS,116,11

The podcast was initially used to highlight the scholarship and humanity of fellow human biologists through interviews about ""how the sausage is made"" in research-that is, the nuts and bolts that go into our publications. However, we soon realized there is much more a weekly podcast can do to help colleagues in our interrelated fields. METHODS Here we introduce the different contributions to this #Hackdemics special issue. Through #Hackademics, we address under-discussed topics in academia such as work-life integration, hostile academic environments, decolonization of research and teaching, and science communication, among others. RESULTS The feedback received from listeners for the #Hackademics series reinforced a need for more tools for navigating the academic side of our disciplines. Furthermore, there was a need to decentralize what is often termed ""institutional knowledge"" by sharing it in a more authoritative medium-a special issue of peer-reviewed articles in our Association's esteemed journal. This special issue's contributions also elevate diverse voices with multiple authors at different career stages. CONCLUSIONS Using the institutional credibility of peer-review to legitimize these topics, this issue's articles can be a resource for those looking to initiate conversations or change within their departments or institutions with the hope of creating a kinder, more respectful, collaborative, equitable, and accessible academic environment.","Ocobock, Cara; Owens, Caroline; Holdsworth, Elizabeth; Gildner, Theresa; Lynn, Christopher",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,116,1

However, the role of these 3 gene polymorphisms in modulating cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors with varying hormonal receptor expression is not clear at present. To explore the effects of genetic polymorphisms in BDNF, APOE, and COMT on the regulation of prospective memory impairments induced by chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with various expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 232 patients with breast cancer (113 with ER-/PR- and 119 with ER+/PR+) were evaluated before and after chemotherapy for cognitive function, including prospective memory. Following previously published sequencing procedures, we assessed 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including BDNF (rs6265), APOE (rs429358, rs7412), and COMT (rs165599, rs4680, rs737865). RESULTS The patients showed poorer prospective memory scores after chemotherapy than before chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ER-/PR- group showed poorer event-based prospective memory (EBPM) scores than the ER+/PR+ group (z=-7.831, p<0.01) after chemotherapy. The patients with the COMT rs737865G/G genotype, compared with those with the A/A and A/G genotypes, showed a linear EBPM performance (ß=1.499, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.017~2.211) and were less likely to have memory impairment. In contrast, APOE and BDNF polymorphisms did not influence cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS The patterns of hormonal receptor expression may be related to prospective memory impairments induced by chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the COMT polymorphism (rs737865) was linearly related to the extent of deficits in EBPM and may represent a potential genetic marker of risk for cognitive deficits triggered by chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.","Li, Wen; Zhao, Jingjing; Ding, Ke; Chao, Herta H; Li, Chiang-Shan R; Cheng, Huaidong; Shen, Li",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,116,27

Here, we consider how COVID-induced job search anxiety-feeling anxious about one's job search due to issues imposed by the pandemic-has the potential to affect adaptive, goal-directed efforts, and maladaptive, goal-avoidant reactions. We theorize that this anxiety can prompt job seekers to engage in problem-solving pondering and affect-focused rumination, with these experiences relating to whether job seekers engage in various forms of search-related efforts the following week. In particular, we consider whether job seekers are engaging in dream job search effort (i.e., effort toward pursuing one's dream job), as well as focused (i.e., effort toward a selection of carefully screened jobs), exploratory (i.e., effort toward a wide swath of jobs in a broad manner), and haphazard (i.e., effort toward applying for any job without a clear plan) job search effort. Further, we consider how stable beliefs relevant to the pandemic (i.e., belief in conspiracy theories; belief in COVID-19 being a public health crisis) affect the aforementioned relationships. Using a weekly study of 162 new labor market entrants, results indicated that COVID-induced job search anxiety positively related to problem-solving pondering and affect-focused rumination; problem-solving pondering promoted dream, focused, and exploratory job search effort the following week, whereas affect-focused rumination hindered dream job search effort. Finally, the detrimental effects of COVID-induced job search anxiety via affect-focused rumination were amplified for those who held higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs.

This cross-sectional study was designed to appraise the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers towards COVID-19 and find out their understanding about clinical aspects of the infection. METHODOLOGY A total number of 1023 of healthcare workers responded to an online questionnaire and provided their data between February and March, 2020 in Jeddah city, Western province, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was distributed to physicians, nurses, pharmacists, technical staff and administrative staff working in clinical settings. RESULTS Results revealed that mean scores for knowledge and attitude were 20.793 ± 2.436 and 4.744 ± 0.297 respectively. More than 88% of participants displayed positive knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. Knowledge data showed that social media and the workplace, were the main sources of information for the majority of respondents. Approximately 99.12% of respondents were aware of the viral pandemic, and the causative agent. Statistically significant association was found when compared the demographic characteristics with the mean knowledge while no statistical signiﬁcance was observed when compared demographic characteristics with the mean attitude score except with marital status. CONCLUSION This study showed that healthcare workers had sufficient knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19. However, hospital staff should be periodically given sufficient training to effectively cope with such outbreaks in the future.","Qadah, Talal",Journal of infection in developing countries,116,22

However, less attention has been paid to circumstances that unfold continuously over time, inhibiting theoretical testing and leading to possible erroneous conclusions about how stressors are dynamically appraised across time. Because stressor novelty, predictability, and patterns are central components of appraisal theories, we use the COVID-19 crisis as a context to illustrate how variation in the phenomenon's patterns of change (specifically, total cases [average level] but also the rate of linear [velocity] and nonlinear growth [acceleration] in cases) influence anxiety. We also show the implications of anxiety for next-day functioning at work. These effects are tested in data drawn from a sample of employed adults in a daily diary study conducted in four overlapping waves. The data span the emergence, exponential rise, and initial tapering of the virus in the United States (February 10, 2020 to April 28, 2020). Our results show that although the impact of level of COVID-19 cases on anxiety decreases over time, the effect of change in cases (velocity and acceleration) increases over time. Anxiety is then associated with next-day work functioning (engagement, performance, and emotional exhaustion).

It creates DNA double-strand breaks causing cell death in highly replicating tumour cells. However, tumours can develop acquired resistance to therapy. The efficiency of radiation treatment has been increased by means of combining it with other approaches such as chemotherapy, molecule-targeted therapies and, in recent years, immunotherapy. Cancer-cell apoptosis after radiation treatment causes an immunological reaction that contributes to eradicate the tumour via antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. On the other hand, radiotherapy also contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive environment that hinders the efficacy of the therapy. Innate immune cells from myeloid and lymphoid origin show a very active role in both acquired resistance and anti-tumorigenic mechanisms. Therefore, many efforts are being made in order to reach a better understanding of the innate immunity reactions after radiation therapy and the design of new combinatorial immunotherapy strategies focused in these particular populations.","Gómez, Valentí; Mustapha, Rami; Ng, Kenrick; Ng, Tony",British journal of clinical pharmacology,116,1

However, SILS is technically difficult because of the limited movement. An organ retractor is an instrument that has the potential to overcome these limitations. Presentation of case An 85-year-old woman with hematochezia was referred to our hospital. Emergency endoscopy showed diverticulosis of the entire colon and active bleeding from the ascending colon. Despite endoscopic clipping, the bleeding continued. SILS total colectomy using an organ retractor was performed due to uncontrollable diverticular bleeding. A 3-cm incision was placed in the umbilicus, and three conventional ports were inserted into the single umbilical incision. An organ retractor was used for hepatocolic ligament transection, transection of the ileocolic vessels, and transection of the mesentery of the sigmoid colon. For each transection, the tension was adjusted to provide a good operative view. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion An organ retractor was effective for SILS total colectomy to maintain an adequate operative view, which enabled safe dissection.","Ishimaru, Kazuhide; Tominaga, Tetsuro; Nonaka, Takashi; Hisanaga, Makoto; Fukuda, Akiko; Yoshimoto, Takafumi; Takei, Daiki; Hidaka, Shigekazu; Sawai, Terumitsu; Nagayasu, Takeshi",Annals of medicine and surgery,116,25

This technique is associated with increased staff/patient contact and patient discomfort. We examined the correlation of the capillary blood glucose results obtained by the POCT device (Accuchek Inform II) with the serum glucose values obtained by the hospital laboratory and with the glucose readings obtained by the FDA-waived for in-patient use (because of COVID-19 pandemic) Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Methods: For this prospective cohort study fifty-two adult participants who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and admitted to non-critical units were recruited. Among them, 41 (79%) were male, 50 (96%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. CGMS sensors were placed on patients' arms, POCT and serum glucose measurements were taken as ordered. Descriptive statistics were calculated and linear mixed models were used to determine correlation. Results: There were a total of 467 Accuchek-Libre pairs with a highly statistically significant association between pairs, p<0.0001. There were also 44 serum glucose -Libre pairs, with a highly statistically significant association, p<0.0001. On average, for each unit increase in Libre glucose level, there was a 0.92 unit increase in Accuchek glucose level as well as a 1.05 unit increase in serum glucose level. Conclusion: These findings indicate excellent correlation between the standard POCT and the CGMS as well as between serum glucose and the CGMS values. Because of the advantages of the CGMS glucose readings over blood capillary glucose testing (reduced patient discomfort and reduced staff exposure to patients during the pandemic) hospitals should consider replacing capillary blood glucose testing with CGMS.","Murray-Bachmann, R.; Ziskovich, K.; Sarbanes, M.; Leung, T.

For medical personnel faced with treating unprecedented numbers of critically ill patients under conditions of personal threat, COVID-19 has most recently accelerated the subjective perception of time. For millions of others, social isolation has decelerated our lives. For all of us, at least in the short term, the future has become more uncertain. Theoretical physicists tell us, however, that under any conditions, the human perception of the flowing of time is only a result of our blurred, limited, macroscopic vision. As the quantum physicist Carlo Rovelli writes, therefore, “[t]o understand ourselves is to reflect on time” (2018: 179). Potentially caused by humans’ failed interactions with wild animals, the contemporary global pandemic, as well as previous outbreaks such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus) or the bird flu, has led to calls to reevaluate humans’ relationships with nonhuman life, with the natural environment that includes us, in the epoch that may soon be named for our very failure – the Anthropocene. In an era in which our usual, day-to-day certainties and desire for human control have been upended, not only by the current medical crisis but also by the continuing existential threat to terrestrial life that is climate change, a rethinking of the category of the human, a new conceptualization of the entangled (human and nonhuman) material relationships on our planet and beyond, requires reflecting on time.

Based on the VG model, the closed-form solutions are performed for pricing mortgage default and prepayment options. It solves the options pricing equations explicitly and illustrates numerical results for both mortgage default and prepayment options’ prices. Furthermore, the study enables researchers to monitor the default probability of mortgagors. Analyzing the effect of risks on default and prepayment options using simulations shows that the VG model captures the systematic and systemic (idiosyncratic) risks of default and prepayment options prices with closed-form solutions and computes the mortgage default probabilities. Therefore, it allows lenders a more advanced decision process compared to the standard option-based mortgage valuation method.","Yilmaz, Bilgi Hekimoglu A. Alper Selcuk-Kestel A.

There are many metrics that are available but not desired by a practitioner. This paper recommends in a plausible reasoning manner an easy-to-understand method to construct desired distance-like measures: to fuse easy-to-obtain (or easy to be coined by practitioners) pseudo-semi-metrics, pseudo-metrics, or metrics by making full use of well-known t-norms, t-conorms, aggregation operators, and similar operators (easy to be coined by practitioners). The simple reason to do this is that data for a real world problem are sometimes from multiagents. A distance-like notion, called weak interval-valued pseudo-metrics (briefly, WIVP-metrics), is defined by using known notions of pseudo-semi-metrics, pseudo-metrics, and metrics;this notion is topologically good and shows precision, flexibility, and compatibility than single pseudo-semi-metrics, pseudo-metrics, or metrics. Propositions and detailed examples are given to illustrate how to fabricate (including using what “material”) an expected or demanded WIVP-metric (even interval-valued metric) in practical problems, and WIVP-metric and its special cases are characterized by using axioms. Moreover, some WIVP-metrics pertinent to quantitative logic theory or interval-valued fuzzy graphs are constructed, and fixed point theorems and common fixed point theorems in weak interval-valued metric spaces are also presented.

Results Accreditation has a positive impact on patient satisfaction and other quality dimensions, overarching structural and procedural quality in primary healthcare facilities under the public sector in Kerala. Conversely, accreditation has not improved the quality dimensions in secondary healthcare facilities and, thereby, the satisfaction of patients. Conclusions It cannot be assumed that accreditation is always associated with quality care in primary healthcare facilities. The implementation process must be systematic and must be regularly monitored to make it useful. Mere structural transformation through accreditation alone cannot guarantee patient satisfaction.

In order to meet both patient and family members' emotional need and decrease patient/family anxiety, prior the Covid pandemic, our PACU usually offer a brief family visitation without disrupting PACU workflow. Literature shows that the highest need from both patient and family perioperatively is the information and communication from healthcare provider. During the Covid pandemic, the PACU visitation has become highly restricted. Therefore, the timely PACU family update via texting message or voice/video call has been becoming crucial to reduce patient/family's anxiety. Does education on strengthening communication between PACU nurses and patient's family during the Covid pandemic would impact timely PACU family update and patient/family's satisfaction? The purpose of this project is to enhance RN initiated family update during the Covid pandemic. All data were collected monthly from April 2020 to July 2020, which matched to baseline and 3 post data sets. Each month thirty surgical cases were randomly selected from three working days and nurses were recommended to follow a special time frame - texting family within 30 mins PACU arrival and phone/video call within 60 mins PACU arrival. A variety of focused RN education was conducted monthly. The QI data on patient/family satisfaction was retrieved from the hospital data dashboard quarterly. Through a variety of educational implementations, the PACU family update either via texting or voice call was significantly increased from pre-implementation month 46.7% to 66.7%, 86.7% and 86.7% post-implementation months consecutively and the update within time frame was improved from pre-month 20.0% to post-months 36.7%, 30.0% and 33.3% consecutively. The survey result on patient/family satisfaction was improved from 50% to 62.5%. RN initiated in time family update is an important way to enhance communication with patient's family and improve patient care during the Covid pandemic. With actively update family via texting message and voice/video call, continuing staff education and multidiscipline team coordination, we could strengthen nurse and family communication, decrease patient/family postoperative anxiety, optimize PACU patient care and increase patient/family's satisfaction.","Wang, Xiao",Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing,116,1

However, accessibility and adherence to PR is sub-optimal. Arts in Health interventions also improve health outcomes for people living with long term conditions. Playing the harmonica with COPD could be clinically beneficial. However, little is known about the patient experiences of playing the harmonica. Methods A qualitative, interpretivist, phenomenological study was undertaken, exploring COPD patient experiences of harmonica playing with a group of others living with chronic respiratory disease. Semi-structured interviews were completed, transcribed, and reflexive inductive thematic analysis performed. Results Eight people with COPD were interviewed. Thematic analysis generated five themes. Themes included Hard in the beginning, Holding the condition, Breathing control, Gives you a high and Needing the Zoom class. Playing the harmonica with COPD is difficult at first, particularly drawing a breath through the harmonica. With practice, experience in a fun activity, and quality teaching, individuals were able to become more attuned and embodied with their breathing. As breathing became easier the songs, rather than breathing, became the focus, and participants were able to escape living with respiratory disease when playing. The group was a priority in the weekly lives of participants, even though the buzz of being part of a group was lost. Discussion Playing the harmonica requires a different way of breathing and offers a breathing control strategy. Participants also reported the harmonica helped airway clearance and enabled a continued, regular social interaction through COVID-19. The results of this study compliment previous quantitative results and are relevant to physiotherapy. Further mechanistic studies and randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the biopsychosocial benefits of playing the harmonica with COPD.","Lewis, A.; Conway, J.; Middleton, J.; Startup, C.; Wyatt, J.",,116,20

It is often confused with child murder, neonaticide, filicide or even genderside. Each of these concepts has to be defined clearly in order to be understood. Through time reasons for infanticide have evolved depending on multiple factors such as culture, religion, beliefs system, or attempts to control the population. It was once seen as a moral virtue. So what has changed? SUBJECTS AND METHODS Between January 2020 and May 2020, a literature search based on electronic bibliographic databases as well as other sources of information (grey literature) was conducted in order to investigate the most recent data on infanticide and child murder, especially the newest socio-economic and psychiatric considerations as well as the different reasons why a mother or a father ends up killing their own child and the Irish situation. RESULTS Recent works on the subject demonstrate how some new socio economic factors and family considerations impact on infanticide. Mental illness, especially depression and psychosis, is often part of the picture and represent a very high risk factor to commit infanticide and filicide. Fathers and mothers do not proceed the same way nor for the same reasons when they kill their offspring. Neonaticide and infanticide are almost always committed by women. A recent case in Ireland (2020) proves how filicide remains an actual problem. CONCLUSIONS Filicide is a relatively rare event, and therefore particularly impact both the public and the press when it occurs. Infanticide does not result from a unique cause, but from multiple factors (some being well known, some remaining hypothetical). Psychopathological and socio-economical parameters associated to peculiar family grounds are currently prevalent. To help and prevent infanticide, screening for psychiatric disorders and risk factors and treating or offering assistance to parents at risk should be implemented.","Naviaux, Anne-Frederique; Janne, Pascal; Gourdin, Maximilien",Psychiatria Danubina,116,1

Owing to the recent ongoing clinical trials of some candidate anti-SARS vaccines, this study aims to assess, via mathematical modelling, the potential impact of a SARS vaccine, assumed to be imperfect, in curtailing future outbreaks. A relatively simple deterministic model is designed for this purpose. It is shown, using Lyapunov function theory and the theory of compound matrices, that the dynamics of the model are determined by a certain threshold quantity known as the control reproduction number (R(v)). If R(v) =/< 1, the disease will be eliminated from the community; whereas an epidemic occurs if R(v) > 1. This study further shows that an imperfect SARS vaccine with infection-blocking efficacy is always beneficial in reducing disease spread within the community, although its overall impact increases with increasing efficacy and coverage. In particular, it is shown that the fraction of individuals vaccinated at steady-state and vaccine efficacy play equal roles in reducing disease burden, and the vaccine must have efficacy of at least 75% to lead to effective control of SARS (assuming R(0) = 4). Numerical simulations are used to explore the severity of outbreaks when R(v) > 1.","Gumel, A B; McCluskey, C Connell; Watmough, James",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,116,1

Here, we report that the highly lethal 1918 virus is susceptible to immune protection by a preventive vaccine, and we define its mechanism of action. Immunization with plasmid expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA) elicited potent CD4 and CD8 cellular responses as well as neutralizing antibodies. Antibody specificity and titer were defined by a microneutralization and a pseudotype assay that could assess antibody specificity without the need for high-level biocontainment. This pseudotype inhibition assay can define evolving serotypes of influenza viruses and facilitate the development of immune sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help contain pandemic influenza. Notably, mice vaccinated with 1918 HA plasmid DNAs showed complete protection to lethal challenge. T cell depletion had no effect on immunity, but passive transfer of purified IgG from anti-H1(1918) immunized mice provided protective immunity for naïve mice challenged with infectious 1918 virus. Thus, humoral immunity directed at the viral HA can protect against the 1918 pandemic virus.","Kong, Wing-Pui; Hood, Chantelle; Yang, Zhi-Yong; Wei, Chih-Jen; Xu, Ling; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Tumpey, Terrence M; Nabel, Gary J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,116,3

Since there is direct association between electrocardiography (ECG) data and the prognosis of cardiovascular disease, a systematic literature review was performed in the present study to address this association and make a conclusive agreement on the early diagnostic and prognostic values of ECG in patients with COVID-19. Methods Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Ovid, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for ""COVID-19"" and ""ECG"" using all their equivalents and similar terms as search words. Afterwards, the records were limited to English articles and irrelevant documents, as well as articles that reported drug-induced cardiac dysfunction or patients with previous history of cardiovascular complications were excluded. Results Overall, 31 articles with 2379 patients were found and used for qualitative data extraction. Findings showed that there is a significant association between COVID-19 infection and ECG findings. Also, ST-segment changes, T wave inversions, QT prolongation, and atrial fibrillation were found to be early indicators of cardiac involvement of COVID-19, which were associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion It is recommended to use ECG as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool for cardiac evaluation of patients with COVID-19.","Nemati, Reza; Ganjoo, Mahasty; Jadidi, Faezeh; Tanha, Ahmad; Baghbani, Reza",Archives of academic emergency medicine,116,20

Due to the significant differences between X-ray images of an infected and non-infected person, artificial intelligence techniques can be used to identify the presence and severity of the infection. We propose a classification model that can analyze the chest X-rays and help in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Our methodology classifies the chest X-rays into four classes viz. normal, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. Further, the X-rays indicating COVID-19 are classified on a severity-basis into mild, medium, and severe.

Monocytes play an important role in the initiation and resolution of inflammation, and their diverse functions can be attributed to specific cellular subsets: pro-inflammatory or classical monocytes (Ly6cHi) and pro-reparative or non-classical monocytes (Ly6cLo). We hypothesized that inherent differences in Ly6cHi classical monocytes and Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes determine susceptibility to perinatal hepatic inflammation in late gestation fetuses and neonates. We found an anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile expressed by Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes, and a physiologic abundance of these cells in the late gestation fetal liver. Unlike neonatal pups, late gestation fetuses proved to be resistant to rhesus rotavirus (RRV) mediated liver inflammation. Furthermore, neonatal pups were rendered resistant to RRV-mediated liver injury when Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes were expanded. Pharmacologic inhibition of Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes in this setting restored susceptibility to RRV-mediated disease. These data demonstrate that Ly6cLo monocytes promote resolution of perinatal liver inflammation in the late gestation fetus, where there is a physiologic expansion of non-classical monocytes, and in the neonatal liver upon experimental expansion of these cells. Therapeutic strategies directed towards enhancing Ly6cLo non-classical monocyte function may mitigate the detrimental effects of perinatal liver inflammation.","Alkhani, Anas; Levy, Claire S; Tsui, Margaret; Rosenberg, Katherine A; Polovina, Katya; Mattis, Aras N; Mack, Matthias; Van Dyken, Steven; Wang, Bruce M; Maher, Jacquelyn J; Nijagal, Amar",Sci Rep,116,16

However, when considering higher dimensions, the proposed methods are only asymptotically equivalent to their classical counterparts and enjoy greater flexibility in the body of the distribution. For their estimation, the latent path representation of inhomogeneous Markov models is exploited.

In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the ""lockdown"" on March 8, 2020. METHODS: The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (N = 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (N = 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (N = 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21.According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9-15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (p < 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.0001).

The pandemic is increasing difficulties in the management of the frailest people and their isolation is actually even more tangible than it was in the past. The social restrictions and the lockdown of many activities are putting the system of care provided by informal caregivers on the edge of collapse. We incite the scientific community to face these concerns and provide clinicians clear indications for assisting and supporting caregivers in the care of their relatives during this period. We suggest that e-health programs could become the ideal ""environment"" to favor the continuity of care for patients with neurodegenerative conditions and guarantee the required support to their caregivers, both directly in terms of psychological management and indirectly for helping them in disease management.","Ortelli, P.; Ferrazzoli, D.; Versace, V.; Saltuari, L.; Sebastianelli, L.",Alzheimer&#039;s &amp; Dementia : Translational Research &amp; Clinical Interventions,116,1

Given the recent success in machine learning, it is interesting to investigate how we can leverage deep learning to filter out application layer attack requests. There are challenges in adopting deep learning solutions due to the ever-changing profiles, the lack of labeled data, and constraints in the online setting. Offline unsupervised learning methods can sidestep these hurdles by learning an anomaly detector $N$ from the normal-day traffic ${\mathcal N}$. However, anomaly detection does not exploit information acquired during attacks, and their performance typically is not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that utilize both the historic ${\mathcal N}$ and the mixture ${\mathcal M}$ traffic obtained during attacks, consisting of unlabeled requests. We also introduce a machine learning optimization problem that aims to sift out the attacks using ${\mathcal N}$ and ${\mathcal M}$. First, our proposed approach, inspired by statistical methods, extends an unsupervised anomaly detector $N$ to solve the problem using estimated conditional probability distributions. We adopt transfer learning to apply $N$ on ${\mathcal N}$ and ${\mathcal M}$ separately and efficiently, combining the results to obtain an online learner. Second, we formulate a specific loss function more suited for deep learning and use iterative training to solve it in the online setting. On publicly available datasets, our online learners achieve a $99.3\%$ improvement on false-positive rates compared to the baseline detection methods. In the offline setting, our approaches are competitive with classifiers trained on labeled data.","Tann, Wesley Joon-Wie; Wei, Jackie Tan Jin; Purba, Joanna; Chang, Ee-Chien",,116,20

This is especially true for caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumors based on the rapid progression of disease, including physical and cognitive debilitation. Informal social network resources such as friends and family can provide social support to caregivers, which lowers caregiver burden and improves overall quality of life. However, barriers to obtaining needed social support exist for caregivers. To address this need, our team developed and is assessing a multi-component caregiver support intervention that uses a blend of technology and personal contact to improve caregiver social support. METHODS: We are currently conducting a prospective, longitudinal 2-group randomized controlled trial which compares caregivers who receive the intervention to a wait-list control group. Only caregivers directly receive the intervention, but the patient-caregiver dyads are enrolled so we can assess outcomes in both. The 8-week intervention consists of two components: (1) The electronic Social Network Assessment Program, a web-based tool to visualize existing social support resources and provide a tailored list of additional resources; and (2) Caregiver Navigation, including weekly phone sessions with a Caregiver Navigator to address caregiver social support needs. Outcomes are assessed by questionnaires completed by the caregiver (baseline, 4-week, 8-week) and the cancer patient (baseline, and 8-week). At 8 weeks, caregivers in the wait-list condition may opt into the intervention. Our primary outcome is caregiver well-being; we also explore patient well-being and caregiver and patient health care utilization. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes a study testing a novel social support intervention that pairs a web-based social network visualization tool and resource list (eSNAP) with personalized caregiver navigation. This intervention is responsive to a family-centered model of care and calls for clinical and research priorities focused on informal caregiving research.

The box-counting fractal dimensions obtained are subjected to ANOVA tests for statistical significance. Results show that the SARS-nCoV particles could not statistically be resolved by their shape on the basis of the fractal dimension values, but they could be distinguished from the earlier SARS-CoV particles. MANOVA test results require interaction of factors used for classifying virions into different types. The topological entropies, a measure of randomness in a system, measured for the images of varying size show correlation with the fractal dimensions. Spectral analyses of our data show a departure from power-law self-similarity, suggesting an apparent scaling of surface roughness over a band of maximum an order of magnitude. The spectral crossover that corresponds to characteristic length scale may represent average viral size. Our results may be useful in inferring the nature of surface-contact between the viral and human cell, causing infection and also in providing clues for new drugs, although it is too early to say. In addition, limitations of this study, including possible ways to avoid the bias in scaling exponents due to the use of different techniques are discussed.","Padhy, Simanchal; Dimri, Vijay P",Physica D,116,15

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Fifty-nine patients with COVID-19 admitted to Bazhong Central Hospital and Dazhou Central Hospital from January 27th to February 9th, 2020 were selected as the subjects. The data of demography, epidemiology, laboratory examination, chest CT and related clinical treatment were collected. According to the severity of the disease, the patients were divided into three types: mild, general and severe types, and the differences of the above indices among different clinical types were compared. RESULTS: (1) General information and epidemiology: 31 cases (52.5%) were male, 28 cases (47.5%) were female, the average age was (42.0±16.4) years old, and the patients over 40 years old accounted for the largest proportion (35 cases, 59.3%). The proportion of clinical type was 72.9% (43 cases) in general type, and 62.7% (37 cases) were imported type. With the increase of disease severity, the average age of patients also showed a significant increase trend [the age of the mild, general and severe patients were (30.9±13.6), (42.7±15.3), (55.8±18.9) years old, P < 0.01]. The proportion of patients with more than one basic disease in severe patients was significantly higher than those in mild and general patients [66.7% (4/6) vs. 20.0% (2/10), 9.3% (4/43), both P < 0.05]. In the distribution of clinical symptoms, the proportion of severe patients with chest distress/dyspnea was significantly higher than those in mild and general patients [66.7% (4/6) vs. 10.0% (1/10), 11.6% (5/43), both P < 0.05]. (2) Laboratory examination index: the total number of white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils count (NEU), C-reactive protein (CRP) in severe patients were higher than those in mild patients and general patients [WBC (×109/L): 7.21±4.35 vs. 5.85±1.69, 5.43±2.04; NEU (×109/L): 6.09±4.43 vs. 3.95±1.45, 3.54±1.83; CRP (mg/L): 16.00 (8.20, 46.43) vs. 5.00 (0.00, 16.13), 15.00 (3.13, 28.58)], the albumin (Alb) level in severe patients was lower than those in mild and general patients (g/L: 38.00±5.35 vs. 49.23±5.27, 39.81±2.15, both P < 0.05), while the hemoglobin (Hb) level in mild patients was higher than that in severe and general patients (g/L: 155.2±12.1 vs. 141.3±6.8, 131.1±11.7, both P < 0.05). (3) Chest imaging: the CT manifestations of typical cases were single or multiple ground glass shadows. With the progress of the disease, the focus gradually increased, the scope gradually expanded, and multiple solid shadows of lung lobes were involved. (4) Treatment: all patients received at least 2 kinds of antiviral therapy, and the application rate of Interferon and Ribavirin in severe patients were higher than those in mild and general patients [100.0% (6/6) vs. 80.0% (8/10), 97.7% (42/43); 83.3% (5/6) vs. 0% (0/10), 20.9% (9/43); all P < 0.05]. (5) Prognosis: until March 6th 2020, 50 patients (84.8%) were discharged from the hospital after rehabilitation, and the remaining 9 patients were still under treatment, none deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of severe patients with chest distress/dyspnea is higher, the older the patients are and the more basic diseases are, the more likely they are to develop into severe type. High resolution chest CT could be considered for suspected cases or even fever patients, which may show the progress of the disease.","Li, Biliang; Zhang, Shiguo; Luo, Shilin; Liu, Chun; Jia, Weijun; Jiang, Huating; Dai, Qian",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,116,1

We also discuss the rationale and risks associated with the use of common sedative agents specifically within the context of COVID-19 and provide evidence-based management strategies to help manage sedation and analgesia in such patients. Recent Findings: A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care and mechanical ventilation, thus requiring sedation and analgesia. These patients tend to require higher doses of sedative medications and often for long periods of time. Most of the commonly used sedative and analgesic agents carry unique risks that should be considered within the context of the unique pathophysiology of COVID-19, the logistical issues the disease poses, and the ongoing drug shortages. Summary: With little attention being paid to sedation practices specific to patients with COVID-19 in critical care literature and minimal mention in national guidelines, there is a significant gap in knowledge.

However, the performance of these tests in non-clinical settings and among one of the main target populations in schools-asymptomatic children-is unclear. To address this gap, we examined the positive and negative concordance between the BinaxNOW&#8482; rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay and an RT-PCR test among children at a community-based Covid-19 testing site. METHODS: We conducted rapid antigen (BinaxNOW&#8482;) and oral fluid RT-PCR (Curative Labs) tests on children presenting at a walk-up testing site in Los Angeles County from November 25, 2020 to December 9, 2020. Positive concordance was determined as the fraction of RT-PCR positive participants that were also antigen positive. Negative concordance was determined as the fraction of RT-PCR negative participants that were also antigen negative. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between positive or negative concordance and participant age, race-ethnicity, sex at birth, symptoms and Ct values. RESULTS: 226 children tested positive on RT-PCR; 127 children or 56.2% (95% CI: 49.5% to 62.8%) of these also tested positive on the rapid antigen test. Positive concordance was higher among symptomatic children (64.4%; 95% CI: 53.4% to 74.4%) compared to asymptomatic children (51.1%; 95% CI: 42.5% to 59.7%). Positive concordance was negatively associated with Ct values and was 93.8% (95% CI: 69.8% to 99.8%) for children with Ct values less than or equal to 25. 548 children tested negative on RT-PCR; 539 or 98.4% (95% CI: 96.9% to 99.2%) of these also tested negative on the rapid antigen test. Negative concordance was higher among asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid antigen testing can successfully identify most COVID infections in children with viral load levels likely to be infectious. Serial rapid testing may help compensate for limited sensitivity in early infection.","Sood, Neeraj; Shetgiri, Rashmi; Rodriguez, Anna; Jimenez, Dianna; Treminino, Sonia; Daflos, Amanda; Simon, Paul",PLoS One,116,16

However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors. CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population. Conversely, current literature does not definitively clarify whether PD patients are more susceptible to get infected. The potential protective role of vitamin D and amantadine is intriguing but deserves further investigation.","Artusi, Carlo Alberto; Romagnolo, Alberto; Ledda, Claudia; Zibetti, Maurizio; Rizzone, Mario Giorgio; Montanaro, Elisa; Bozzali, Marco; Lopiano, Leonardo",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),116,20

Data describing post-hospital discharge outcomes may provide insight into disease course. Studies describing post-hospitalization outcomes of adults following COVID-19 infection are limited to electronic medical record review, which may underestimate the incidence of outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine 30-day post-hospitalization outcomes following COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Quaternary referral hospital and community hospital in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 infected patients discharged alive from the emergency department (ED) or hospital between March 3 and May 15, 2020. MEASUREMENT: Outcomes included return to an ED, re-hospitalization, and mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-day follow-up data were successfully collected on 94.6% of eligible patients. Among 1344 patients, 16.5% returned to an ED, 9.8% were re-hospitalized, and 2.4% died. Among patients who returned to the ED, 50.0% (108/216) went to a different hospital from the hospital of the index presentation, and 61.1% (132/216) of those who returned were re-hospitalized. In Cox models adjusted for variables selected using the lasso method, age (HR 1.01 per year [95% CI 1.00-1.02]), diabetes (1.54 [1.06-2.23]), and the need for inpatient dialysis (3.78 [2.23-6.43]) during the index presentation were independently associated with a higher re-hospitalization rate. Older age (HR 1.08 [1.05-1.11]) and Asian race (2.89 [1.27-6.61]) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients discharged alive following their index presentation for COVID-19, risk for returning to a hospital within 30 days of discharge was substantial. These patients merit close post-discharge follow-up to optimize outcomes.","Kingery, Justin R; Bf Martin, Paul; Baer, Ben R; Pinheiro, Laura C; Rajan, Mangala; Clermont, Adrienne; Pan, Sabrina; Nguyen, Khoi; Fahoum, Khalid; Wehmeyer, Graham T; Alshak, Mark N; Li, Han A; Choi, Justin J; Shapiro, Martin F; McNairy, Margaret L; Safford, Monika M; Goyal, Parag",J Gen Intern Med,116,1

Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of administering the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery screening module (NAB-S) to patients with aSAH, assessed its value in predicting the ability to return to work and characterized clinical as well as neuropsychological recovery over the period of 24 months. METHODS: A total of 104 consecutive patients treated for aSAH were recruited. After acute treatment, follow up visits were conducted at 3, 12 and 24 months after the hemorrhage. NAB-S, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and physical examination were performed at each follow up visit. RESULTS: The NAB-S could be administered to 64.9, 75.9 and 88.9% of the patients at 3, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Moderate impairment of two or more neuropsychological domains (e.g speech, executive function, etc.) significantly correlated with inability to return to work at 12 and 24 months as well as poor outcome assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at 3, 12 and 24 months. The number of patients with favorable outcomes significantly increased from 25.5% at discharge to 56.5 and 57.1% at 3 and 12 months, respectively, and further increased to 74.1% after 24 months. CONCLUSION: The NAB-S can be administered to the majority of patients with aSAH and can effectively detect clinically relevant neuropsychological deficits. Clinical recovery after aSAH continues for at least 24 months after the hemorrhage which should be considered in the design of future clinical trials.","Walter, Johannes; Grutza, Martin; Vogt, Lidia; Unterberg, Andreas; Zweckberger, Klaus",BMC Neurol,116,24

Despite its broad therapeutic use, the effects of electrical stimulation on brain cells is not fully understood. Here, we examine the effects of electrical stimulation on neural stem and progenitor cells (collectively neural precursor cells; NPCs) C57BLJ/6 mice found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult forebrain. Previous work has demonstrated that adult-derived NPCs are electro-sensitive and undergo rapid and directed migration in response to application of clinically relevant electric fields. We examine NPC proliferation kinetics and their differentiation profile following electric field application using in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro direct current electrical stimulation of 250 mV/mm is sufficient to elicit a 2-fold increase in the neural stem cell pool and increases neurogenesis and oligogenesis. In vivo, asymmetric biphasic electrical stimulation similarly increases the size of the NPC pool and alters neurogenesis. These findings provide insight into the effects of electrical stimulation on NPCs and suggest its potential use as a regenerative approach to neural repair.Significance Statement Electrical stimulation promotes neural precursor cell migration. In this study we demonstrate that electrical stimulation in addition to cell migration can also expand the size of the NPC pool and enhance neurogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo Using electrical stimulation to activate neural stem cells could be a powerful tool to promote tissue repair.","Sefton, Elana; Iwasa, Stephanie N; Morrison, Taylor; Naguib, Hani E; Popovic, Milos R; Morshead, Cindi M",ENeuro,116,22

To reasonably anticipate major consequences according to the available evidence, we hereby review the literature for studies that have explored the health impacts of several weeks of a reduction in physical activity and daily step-count combined with modified eating habits. These studies identify as main metabolic consequences increases in insulin resistance, total body fat, abdominal fat and inflammatory cytokines. All these factors have been strongly associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, which in turn increases the risk of multiple chronic diseases. A plausible mechanism involved in these impacts could be a positive energy balance promoted by maintaining usual dietary intake while reducing energy expenditure. This means that just as calorie intake restriction could help mitigate the deleterious impacts of a bout of physical inactivity, overeating under conditions of home confinement is very likely to exacerbate these consequences. Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been identified as potential risk factors for more severely ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, adequate control of metabolic disorders could be important to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.","Martinez-Ferran, María; de la Guía-Galipienso, Fernando; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabián; Pareja-Galeano, Helios",Nutrients,116,24

While some data suggest significant differences in biological responses, dissimilarities in the clinical course and characteristics between SARS-COV-2 and influenza pneumonia remain unknown. We evaluated differences in clinical predictors of outcomes and early clinical subphenotypes in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients hospitalized for &gt; 24 hours, requiring oxygen support, at Barnes-Jewish Hospital with COVID-19 (March-July 2020) or influenza (Jan 2012-Dec 2018). In-hospital mortality or hospice discharge was the primary outcome. First, supervised machine learning classifier models (XGBoost) were trained using bootstrap replications of each viral cohort to predict the primary outcome. 28 candidate predictor variables among the most extreme vital signs and laboratory values within 24 hours of hospitalization were preselected, excluding highly correlated variables. We compared each model's internal discrimination to its performance in the alternate cohort and evaluated differences in variable importance between the two viral pneumonia models. Next, we evaluated differences in clinical subphenotypes in two ways: 1) a previously-validated algorithm to group patients into four distinct subphenotypes based on temperature trajectories within 72 hours of hospitalization;2) latent class analysis (LCA) to identify unmeasured subgroups within each viral cohort based on the predictor variables described above. In both analyses, we compared frequency of subphenotype membership and each subphenotype's primary outcome between viral cohorts. Results: We evaluated 321 unique hospitalizations with COVID-19 and 535 with influenza. The primary outcome was experienced in 23% and 9.5% of patients, respectively. Influenza predictor model discriminated outcomes worse in COVID-19 than on internal evaluation (Panel A), suggesting prognostic variables differ between the viral pneumonias. Only one of the top five contributory variables was shared between the two models (Panel B). Prevalences of temperature trajectory subphenotype also differed significantly between viral pneumonias. All COVID-19 temperature trajectory subphenotypes experienced the primary outcome more frequently than their influenza counterparts (Panel C). LCA identified two distinct classes in each cohort, with each viral pneumonia's minority class experiencing worse outcomes than the majority class. Of each model's top 5 classdefining variables, only 2 were shared (Panel D). Conclusions: COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia differ markedly in predictors of outcome and in clinical subphenotypes. These findings emphasize observable pathogen-specific differential responses in viral pneumonias and suggest that distinct management approaches should be investigated for these diseases.

We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC). FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52-66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77% of predicted (IQR 67-87) at 3 months, 76% of predicted (68-90) at 6 months, and 88% of predicted (78-101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 8·61 [95% CI 2·83-26·2; p=0·0002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (1·36 [1·13-1·62]; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION: In most patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, dyspnoea scores and exercise capacity improved over time; however, in a subgroup of patients at 12 months we found evidence of persistent physiological and radiographic change. A unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 is required.

The biological results reveal that our compounds showed excellent cytotoxicity toward three common human cancer cell lines (SW620, PC-3 and NCI-H23) with IC50 values ranging from 0.09 to 0.007 µM. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was equipotent or even up to 10-times more potent than adriamycin and up to 205-times more potent than SAHA. Among the series of N- hydroxypropenamides, compounds 10a-d were the most potent HDAC inhibitors as well as cytotoxicity toward the cell lines tested. In addition, the strong inhibitory activites toward HDAC of our compounds were observed with IC50 values of below-micromolar range. Especially, compound 4a inhibited HDAC6 with an IC50 value of 29-fold lower than that against HDAC2 isoform. Representative compounds 4a and 7a were found to significantly arrest SW620 cells at G0/G1 phase. Compounds 7a and 10a were found to strongly induce apoptosis in SW620 cells. Docking studies revealed some important features affecting the selectivity against HDAC6 isoform. The results clearly demonstrate the potential of the indirubin-hydroxamic acid hybrids and these compounds should be very promising for further development.","Anh, Duong Tien; Hai, Pham-The; Dung, Do Thi Mai; Dung, Phan Thi Phuong; Huong, Le-Thi-Thu; Park, Eun Jae; Jun, Hye Won; Kang, Jong Soon; Kwon, Joo-Hee; Tung, Truong Thanh; Han, Sang-Bae; Nam, Nguyen-Hai",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,116,16

Understanding why some people are willing to be vaccinated and others are not is a critical step to develop efficient implementation strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a theory-based content analysis based on the capability, opportunity, motivation-behavior (COM-B) model to characterize the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines mentioned on the Twitter platform. METHODS: We collected tweets posted in English from November 1-22, 2020, using a combination of relevant keywords and hashtags. After excluding retweets, we randomly selected 5000 tweets for manual coding and content analysis. We performed a content analysis informed by the adapted COM-B model. RESULTS: Of the 5000 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets that were coded, 4796 (95.9%) were posted by unique users. A total of 97 tweets carried positive behavioral intent, while 182 tweets contained negative behavioral intent. Of these, 28 tweets were mapped to capability factors, 155 tweets were related to motivation, 23 tweets were related to opportunities, and 74 tweets did not contain any useful information about the reasons for their behavioral intentions (&#954;=0.73). Some tweets mentioned two or more constructs at the same time. Tweets that were mapped to capability (P<.001), motivation (P<.001), and opportunity (P=.03) factors were more likely to indicate negative behavioral intentions.

For this purpose, we have made use of a single country's computable general equilibrium model and formulated two alternative scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic). While the baseline already shows a worrying food situation, our results suggest that the pandemic of Covid-19 contributes to a worsening of food security. First, the food deficit of poor rural and urban households worsens. Second, even if their food consumption decreases, the urban non-poor households seem to be resilient to the Covid-19 pandemic. The severity of food insecurity is increasing among poor households in rural and urban areas, whereas the non-poor rural households are likely to fall into the category of vulnerable people. Third, the negative impacts on food security can be explained by the combination of several factors such as a rise in food prices, a decrease in households' incomes and remittances. Finally, the negative impact on food security seems permanent, as the deviation from the baseline persists over 10 years (2020-2030).","Zidouemba, Patrice Rélouendé; Kinda, Somlanare Romuald; Ouedraogo, Idrissa Mohamed",Eur J Dev Res,116,14

It affects between 1-5% of children and young people (CYP) most often presenting in early-mid childhood.Pharmacological treatment can be considered in CYP if certain criteria are met, where licensed medications include methylphenidate, dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine and guanfacine. Stimulant and non-stimulant medications require frequent physical health monitoring due to their side effects including an increase in blood pressure and/or heart rate, loss of appetite, growth restriction and tics.MethodStandards and criteria were derived from the NICE guidance (2018), whilst local trust policies were reviewed, demonstrating discrepancies. Standards were expected to be met for 100% of patients.Electronic patient records were reviewed retrospectively from a representative cohort of CYP reviewed by clinicians in a community CAMHS service during March-November 2020. Data were entered manually into a spreadsheet for evaluation.ResultA total of 27 CYP records were reviewed, average age 13yo, on a range of stimulant/non-stimulant preparations.5 (19%) had height checked every 6 months, with 4 delayed to 7-8 months.For those &gt;10yo, only 5 (19%) had weight checked every 6 months.Only 2 (7%) had their height and weight plotted on a growth chart and reviewed by the healthcare professional responsible for treatment.Just 4 (15%) had heart rate and blood pressure recorded before and after each dose change, whilst similarly only 4 (not the same) had these parameters recorded every 6 months.17 patients were reviewed by telephone/video call, where 5 patients provided physical health parameters (measured at home).ConclusionAcross all parameters, standards are not being met for the required physical health monitoring for CYP on ADHD medication.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the working conditions for community teams, impacting face to face reviews, creating challenges for physical health monitoring.Our ongoing implementations for change include the use of a proforma for physical health measurements, improving psychoeducation for families, exploring potential barriers with senior colleagues and collaborating with pharmacy colleagues to update local guidelines in accordance with the latest NICE recommendations.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single professional singers from the Bavarian Radio Chorus were asked to sing in different head positions, with different articulation patterns and different masks after inhaling the basic liquid of an e-cigarette. The vapor cloud was segmented and tracked over time. RESULTS: Consonants and exaggeration of diction enhanced the distance reached by the impulse dispersion. Furthermore, the greatest dispersion was reached for a neutral head position. All protection masks stopped the initial jet of the aerosols but the FFP2 masks were the most effective.

Patients who were admitted in the ICU were significantly older (age over 60 years) (38.1% vs 14.9%, p = 0.016). 23 (21.1%) patients reached to composite outcome and these patients were significantly older (age over 60 years) (39.1% vs. 13.9%; p = 0.004), and had lower serum albumin (3.4 g/dl [2.9-3.8] vs. 3.8 g/dl [3.5-4.1], p = 0.002), higher serum ferritin (679 µg/L [184-2260] vs. 331 µg/L [128-839], p = 0.048), and lower lymphocyte counts (700/µl [460-950] vs. 860 /µl [545-1385], p = 0.018). Multivariable analysis identified presence of ischemic heart disease and initial serum creatinine levels as independent risk factors for mortality, whereas age over 60 years and initial serum creatinine levels were independently associated with ICU admission. On analysis for predicting secondary outcome, age above 60 and initial lymphocyte count were found to be independent variables in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Over the age of 60, ischemic heart disease, lymphopenia, poor graft function were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 in this patient group. Whereas presence of ischemic heart disease and poor graft function were independently associated with mortality.","Oto, Ozgur Akin; Ozturk, Savas; Turgutalp, Kenan; Arici, Mustafa; Alpay, Nadir; Merhametsiz, Ozgur; Sipahi, Savas; Ogutmen, Melike Betul; Yelken, Berna; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza; Gorgulu, Numan; Tatar, Erhan; Ozkan, Oktay; Ayar, Yavuz; Aydin, Zeki; Dheir, Hamad; Ozkok, Abdullah; Safak, Seda; Demir, Mehmet Emin; Odabas, Ali Riza; Tokgoz, Bulent; Tonbul, Halil Zeki; Sezer, Siren; Ates, Kenan; Yildiz, Alaattin",BMC Nephrol,116,16

Chlorpromazine (CPZ), an antipsychotic from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and has antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The aim of this in-vitro study was to test CPZ against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey and human cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monkey VeroE6 cells and human alveolar basal epithelial A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of various concentrations of CPZ. Supernatants were harvested at day 2 and analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cell viability was assessed in non-infected cells. RESULTS: CPZ was found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey VeroE6 cells, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8.2 µM, half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 13.5 µM, and selectivity index (SI) of 1.65. In human A549-ACE2 cells, CPZ was also found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with IC50 of 11.3 µM, CC50 of 23.1 µM and SI of 2.04. DISCUSSION: Although the measured SI values are low, the IC50 values measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosages used in routine clinical practice because of the high biodistribution of CPZ in lungs and saliva. Also, the distribution of CPZ in brain could be of interest for treating or preventing neurological and psychiatric forms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical findings support clinical investigation of the repurposing of CPZ, a drug with mild side effects, in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Plaze, Marion; Attali, David; Prot, Matthieu; Petit, Anne-Cécile; Blatzer, Michael; Vinckier, Fabien; Levillayer, Laurine; Chiaravalli, Jeanne; Perin-Dureau, Florent; Cachia, Arnaud; Friedlander, Gérard; Chrétien, Fabrice; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Gaillard, Raphaël",Int J Antimicrob Agents,116,24

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients &#8805;18 years old admitted to 17 adult ICUs in Alberta, Canada from January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Data were obtained from a provincial clinical information system and data repository. The primary outcome was incidence of ICU death within 24 h of admission. Secondary outcomes were patient and system factors associated with early death. Variables of interest were identified a priori and examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 19,556 patients admitted to ICU in an 18-month period, 3.3% died within 24 h, representing 29.8% of ICU deaths. Factors associated with early death were age (adjusted-OR 0.99, 95% CI, 0.9-1.0), acuity (adjusted-OR 1.3, 95% CI, 1.3-1.4), admission from the Emergency Department (ED; adjusted-OR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-1.9) and surgical (adjusted-OR 2.27, 95% CI, 1.4-3.6), neurologic (adjusted-OR 4.6, 95% CI, 3.1-6.9) or trauma diagnosis (adjusted-OR 6.1, 95% CI, 2.4-15.6). CONCLUSION: Patients who die within 24 h constitute one third of ICU deaths. Age, acuity, admission from the ED and surgical, neurologic or trauma-related admission diagnosis correlate with early death.","Andersen, Sarah K; Montgomery, Carmel L; Bagshaw, Sean M",J Crit Care,116,16

Here, we discuss the mechanistic basis for the use of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 in a prophylactic setting and in a therapeutic setting, at different stages of the disease. We argue that the clinical effect of prophylactic or therapeutic HCQ treatment in COVID-19 depends on the balance between inhibition of viral replication, immunosuppression, and off-target side effects, and that the outcome is probably dependent on disease stage and disease severity. This is supported by the initial outcomes of the well-designed randomized controlled trials: so far, evidence for a beneficial effect of HCQ treatment for COVID-19 is weak and conflicting.","039, In; t Veld, Aliede E; Jansen, Manon A A; Ciere, Luuk C A; Moerland, Matthijs",J Immunol Res,116,33

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided. RESULTS: There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy. Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy. The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources. CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some. Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19.

However, the identities of the enzymes did not reveal the full biochemical details of this process, as the enzymes do not bear resemblance to those of other luminescence systems, and thus the properties of the enzymes involved in this fascinating process are still unknown. Here, we describe the characteri-zation of the penultimate enzyme in the pathway, hispidin 3-hydroxylase, from the luminescent fungus Mycena chlorophos (McH3H), which catalyzes the con-ver-sion of hispidin to 3-hydroxyhispidin. 3­Hydroxy-hispidin acts as a luciferin substrate in luminescent fungi. McH3H was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromato-graphy with a yield of 100 mg/l. McH3H was found to be a single component monomeric NAD(P)H-dependent FAD-containing monooxygenase having a preference for NADPH. Through site-directed mutagenesis, based on a modeled structure, mutant enzymes were created that are more efficient with NADH. Except for identifying the residues that tune cofactor specificity, these engineered variants may also help in developing new hispidin-based bioluminescence applications. We confirmed that addition of hispidin to McH3H led to the formation of 3-hydroxy-hispidin as sole aromatic product. Rapid kinetic analysis revealed that reduction of the flavin cofactor by NADPH is boosted by hispidin binding by nearly 100-fold. Similar to other class A flavoprotein hydroxylases, McH3H did not form a stable hydro-peroxyflavin intermediate. These data suggest a mechanism by which the hydroxylase is tuned for converting hispidin into the fungal luciferin.","Tong, Yapei; Trajkovic, Milos; Savino, Simone; van Berkel, Willem J H; Fraaije, Marco W",J. biol. chem,116,1

Anosmia and hyposmia, the complete and partial loss of smell, respectively, can result from many causes, most commonly from viral infections, sinonasal disease, and head trauma. Olfactory dysfunction negatively impacts quality of life, because sense of smell is important for flavor perception and the enjoyment of food. Olfaction is also important for the detection of warning smells, such as smoke, natural gas leaks, and spoiled food. Allergists and immunologists frequently encounter anosmia and hyposmia in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and will likely see more infection-induced olfactory dysfunction in the era of COVID-19. Therefore, now more than ever, it is crucial that we understand this impairment, how to evaluate and how to measure it. In this review, we offer a clinically relevant primer for the allergist and immunologist on olfactory dysfunction subtypes, exploring the pathophysiology, appropriate clinical assessment, objective smell testing, and management of this condition. We will also focus on the emerging literature on COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction, its unique features, and its important implications for this pandemic.","Desai, Mauli; Oppenheimer, John",J.

In this strategy, occupants are given a choice of spaces to do their work and personal activities on a day-to-day basis. This paper shows the implementation and testing of the Spacematch platform that was designed to improve the allocation and management of ABW. An experiment was implemented to test the ability to characterize the preferences of occupants to match them with suitable environmentally-comfortable and spatially-efficient flexible workspaces. This approach connects occupants with a catalog of available work desks using a web-based mobile application and enables them to provide real-time environmental feedback. In this work, we tested the ability for this feedback data to be merged with indoor environmental values from Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors to optimize space and energy use by grouping occupants with similar preferences. This paper outlines a case study implementation of this platform on two office buildings. This deployment collected 1,182 responses from 25 field-based research participants over a 30-day study. From this initial data set, the results show that the ABW occupants can be segmented into specific types of users based on their accumulated preference data, and matching preferences can be derived to build a recommendation platform.","Sood, Tapeesh; Janssen, Patrick; Miller, Clayton",,116,13

A recent study found that the rs2011404 variant of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyl-transferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) is a marker of susceptibility to ATDH. The present study aimed to validate this relationship in an Eastern Chinese Han anti-TB treatment population. METHODS: A 1:4 matched case-control study was conducted among anti-TB treatment patients in four regions of Jiangsu. ATDH was diagnosed based on the criteria from the Chinese Society of Hepatology and the updated Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between rs2011404 genotypes and the risk of ATDH using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and smoking, drinking, hepatoprotectant use and liver diseases as covariates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 202 ATDH cases and 808 controls were matched according to age, sex and treatment history. After correcting for potential confounding factors, conditional logistic regression analysis indicated no significant differences in genotypes between the two groups (CC vs. TC: OR = 0.933, 95% CI: 0.457-1.905, p = 0.849). Subgroup analysis suggested that patients carrying the CC genotype at rs2011404 in UGT1A4 were at a reduced risk of moderate or severe liver injury (OR = 0.293, 95% CI: 0.093-0.921, p = 0.036). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Based on a 1:4 individual matched case-control study, possessing the CC genotype at rs2011404 of the UGT1A4 gene reduces the risk of moderate or severe liver injury in Eastern Chinese Han patients receiving anti-TB treatment. Further research is warranted to explain the role of the UGT1A4 gene and its contribution to individual differences in susceptibility to ATDH.","Zhu, Jia; Liu, Wenpei; Zhang, Meiling; Lu, Lihuan; Pan, Hongqiu; He, Xiaomin; Wang, Nannan; Yang, Miaomiao; Yi, Honggang; Tang, Shaowen",J. clin. pharm. ther,116,16

Prior studies have indicated that connections made at meetings and symposia help foster IR interest amongst female medical students. However, due to COVID-19 many events have been canceled thus networking opportunities have decreased. The purpose of this study is to determine if virtual hangout sessions with female medical students, trainees, and attendings is a feasible solution for creating mentorship while in-person events are on hold. Materials and Methods: An anonymous 8-item survey was created consisting of multiple choice, 5-point Likert scale, and free-response questions aimed at assessing factors motivating medical students to pursue a career in IR. The survey was sent to medical students registered for the Women in IR (WIR) Virtual Hangout event. The event was split into eight 1-hour sessions with up to 10 students and 3 or 4 trainees or attendings per session. After the event, an anonymous post-event survey was created and sent to attendees consisting of the same questions as the pre-survey, with additional questions regarding their experience of the event in order to assess changes in the factors that may influence their decision to choose a career in IR. Data was collected and presented as frequencies. Differences between groups assessed via Fisher’s exact test. Results: Of the 79 students who were sent the pre-survey, 53 (67%) responded. Of the 45 students who attended the event and sent the post-survey, 28 (62%) responded. When comparing pre- and post-survey responses, there was a significant statistically significant decrease in concern about limited female mentorship (86.8% to 60.7%, P = 0.01). While not statistically significant, large decreases in concern were noted for radiation exposure (64.1% to 42.9%;P = 0.1) and financial compensation (39.6% to 17.9%;P = 0.051). Furthermore, 78.6% reported an increased likelihood of applying to IR after attending the event, and 96.4% would recommend the event to others. Conclusions: Because of COVID-19, in-person events are no longer feasible at this time, resulting in decreased networking and mentorship events for women. The WIR Virtual Hangout session has shown to be a promising solution, with reported increased likelihood of applying to IR and attending future events. This along with decreases in prevalent concerns such as radiation exposure and perceived limited female mentorship demonstrates that virtual hangout sessions can be effective in recruiting female medical students to pursue IR, thus closing the gender gap.","Raiter, S.; Tanaka, M.; Vo, N.; Salazar, G.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,116,23

(2) In the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, there is less distribution of areas with a higher resilience index, while those with high and medium resilience levels are more distributed. However, the resilience of most cities is low. (3) The resilience index of eastern coastal cities is significantly higher, and the resilience of cities under the COVID-19 scenario presents obvious east-west differentiation. (4) When constructing urban resilience, the individual situation of cities should be taken into account, measures adjusted according to local conditions, reasonable lessons drawn from effective international urban resilience construction, and reasonable planning policies formulated; it is important to give play to the relationship between the whole and the parts of resilience to achieve unified and coordinated development.","Chen, Xiansheng; Quan, Ruisong",Nat Hazards (Dordr),116,1

It has been assumed that the pandemic has brought with it a surge in elder abuse due to individuals ordered to stay at home combined with increased interpersonal stressors. However, empirical evidence is lacking. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of, and risk and resilience factors of elder abuse during the pandemic. METHODS: The survey was conducted via two online platforms during April 23 and May 5, 2020, when all states had stay-at-home orders. The final cohort consisted of a sociodemographically diverse sample of 897 older persons in the United States. The prevalence of elder abuse was evaluated by a validated measure previously used in a population-based study of elder abuse. Pandemic-related factors were examined at the community, relational, and individual contexts. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine determinants of elder abuse. RESULTS: One in five older persons in the study sample (nâ¯=â¯191; 21.3%) reported elder abuse, an increase of 83.6% from prevalence estimates before the pandemic. In the final models, sense of community emerged as a persistent protective factor for elder abuse (odds ratio [OR]: 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.93). At the relational level, physical distancing was associated with reduced risk of elder abuse (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98). At the individual level, financial strain was associated with increased risk of abuse (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14).

For the global post-COVID economic recovery, it is of great significance to explore scientific ways to reopen the borders with consideration of both risk and efficiency. With the development of international travel health certificate or digital travel pass, differentiated inspection and quarantine measures can be implemented to accelerate the recovery of international travel. In this paper, we study a multi-tier inspection queueing system with finite capacity based on a differentiated level of risk classification. A queueing analysis is conducted for the stochastic process of inspecting cross-border travelers under differentiated service for inspection and quarantine. Besides, we develop a computing method to determine the steady-state probability and several performance indices of the proposed queueing system, and an illustrative example is also set to introduce a step-by-step process for the method. Furthermore, we figure out the relationship between the model parameters and system performance of interest by means of a series of numerical experiments. In the data analysis, we also illustrate the monotonic and concave effects on the system performance, which can provide a visualized understanding of the trade-off between safety and efficiency in the studied multi-server queueing system with hierarchical inspection channels and finite capacity.

This study aimed to assess refugee clinician perspectives on mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically access to and delivery of community mental health care services. We utilized a mixed methods design. We surveyed members of a national network of Canadian clinicians caring for refugees and migrants. Seventy-seven clinicians with experience caring for refugee populations, representing an 84% response rate, participated in the online survey, 11 of whom also participated in semi-structured interviews. We report three major themes: exacerbation of mental health issues and inequities in social determinants of health, and decreased access to integrated primary care and community migrant services. Clinicians reported major challenges delivering care during the first 6 months of the pandemic related to access to care and providing virtual care. Clinicians described perspectives on improving the management of refugee mental health, including increasing access to community resources and virtual care. The majority of clinicians reported that technology-assisted psychotherapy appears feasible to arrange, acceptable and may increase health equity for their refugee patients. However, major limitations of virtual care included technological barriers, communication and global mental health issues, and privacy concerns. In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social and health inequities within refugee and migrant populations in Canada and challenged the way mental health care is traditionally delivered. However, the pandemic has provided new avenues for the delivery of care virtually, albeit not without additional and unique barriers.","Benjamen, Joseph; Girard, Vincent; Jamani, Shabana; Magwood, Olivia; Holland, Tim; Sharfuddin, Nazia; Pottie, Kevin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),116,20

Background: Acute encephalopathy in the setting of any infection is associated with severity of the disease process. With this COVID-19 pandemic, we did not find any studies to associate the development of acute encephalopathy with outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study where we examined clinical outcome parameters comprising 'need for critical care services', 'intubation' and '30-day mortality' among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without acute encephalopathy, before and after propensity-score matching. TriNetX, which is a large global COVID-19 database was used to obtain medical record data and their analytics function was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of 12,601 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1092 (8.7%) developed acute encephalopathy. Patients in the acute encephalopathy group were older (67 vs. 61 years) and had higher prevalence of medical co-morbidities including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, COPD, chronic kidney and liver disease among others. Before and after propensity score matching for co-morbidities, patients with acute encephalopathy were more likely to need critical care services (35.6% vs. 16.9%, p < 0.0001), intubation (19.5% vs. 6.0%, p < 0.0001) and had a higher 30-day mortality (24.3% vs. 17.9%, p 0.0002). Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute encephalopathy is common and more likely to occur in patients with medical co-morbidities and are more likely to need critical care, intubation and have a higher 30-day mortality even after adjusting for age and underlying medical co-morbidities.","Arulprakash, N.; Nalleballe, K.; Onteddu, S.; Zaghlouleh, M.

If patients' pulmonary inflammation is severe, they can experience ventilation-perfusion mismatch (V/Q mismatch) where blood flow and gas exchange are mismatched such that oxygen uptake is greatly impaired. In these cases, patients are typically rotated into a prone position to facilitate improved blood flow to segments of the lung that were not previously participating in the gas exchange process. However, proning a patient has a significant risk of complications. The low-cost vest presented in this work is designed to be used as a surrogate to patient proning while also requiring less hospital staff to operate than the proning process. The vest was preliminarily tested on 6 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who experienced ARDS and presumptive V/Q mismatch. The results from this preliminary testing show that 5 out of 6 patients showed a significant increase in ventilation-perfusion similar to the effects of proning. © 2019 by ASME.","Ambrose, A.

The trade in wild meat, and its role in diets, have been brought into focus as a consequence of discussions over the origins of COVID-19. As a result, there have been calls for the closure of China's ""wet markets""; greater scrutiny of the wildlife trade in general; and a spotlight has been placed on the potential risks posed by growing human populations and shrinking natural habitats for animal to human transmission of zoonotic diseases. However, to date there has been little attention given to what the consequences of the COVID-19 economic shock may be for the wildlife trade; the people who rely on it for their livelihoods; and the wildlife that is exploited. In this policy perspective, we argue that the links between the COVID-19 pandemic, rural livelihoods and wildlife are likely to be more complex, more nuanced, and more far-reaching, than is represented in the literature to date. We develop a causal model that tracks the likely implications for the wild meat trade of the systemic crisis triggered by COVID-19. We focus on the resulting economic shockwave, as manifested in the collapse in global demand for commodities such as oil, and international tourism services, and what this may mean for local African economies and livelihoods. We trace the shockwave through to the consequences for the use of, and demand for, wild meats as households respond to these changes. We suggest that understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of wild meat use requires increased collaboration between environmental and resource economics and the ecological and conservation sciences.","McNamara, James; Robinson, Elizabeth J Z; Abernethy, Katharine; Midoko Iponga, Donald; Sackey, Hannah N K; Wright, Juliet H; Milner-Gulland, E J",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),116,20

Background: Status epilepticus (SE) is an emergency neurologic disorder whose outcome is based on rapid diagnosis and treatment With in a 30-minute time frame. Shortening time to diagnosis is based on 1) clinical suspicion and 2) electroencephalographic interpretation consistent with the diagnosis. Standard EEG is deployed by a small staff of technicians who provide 24/7 coverage. The device is space consuming and must be brought into isolation rooms. The after-hours on-call response time may be as long as 3 hours. Thus, meeting time-totreatment windows in community hospitals, with their practical limits on resources, poses an important challenge for treating this neurologic disorder. Design/Methods: We developed a protocol for use of the Ceribell EEG. The staff deploying the device, attending physician, and interpreting neurologist completed evaluation tools for each patient. Data maintained for quality and resource planning of standard EEG ordered for suspected SE were used as controls. Times to diagnosis were compared by Welch-Satterthwaite tests and workforce call-in demands by Fisher's exact T-test. We evaluated qualitative data related to the use of the EEG in COVID-19 isolation rooms, on its technical aspects and acceptance by staff members. Results: The Ceribell EEG reduced diagnosis time (p=0.0000006) and on-call workforce demand (p=0.02). The device can be used any time of day in any hospital care area and has advantages in respiratory isolation rooms. Conclusions: Compared with a standard 18-channel EEG, the Ceribell device allowed earlier diagnosis of SE and non-SE conditions and reduced workforce demands. Due to the ease of its use and its simple components, which can be readily disinfected, it is advantageous for COVID- 19 patients in isolation.","Lamonte, M.",Neurology,116,1

It is characterized by progressive, ascending, symmetrical muscle weakness accompanied by hyporeflexia or areflexia. We describe two cases of GBS associated with COVID-19. 36-year-old Hispanic female presented ten days after diagnosis of COVID-19 with symptoms of headache, bilateral leg and facial weakness, and facial paresthesias for five days. Within 24 hours of admission, she developed areflexia and progressive bulbar and appendicular weakness. Nerve conduction study and electromyography were consistent with demyelinating form of GBS. Due to difficulty with clearing oral secretions, patient was intubated two times during the hospitalization. 79-year-old Caucasian female presented with progressive weakness, weight loss and fevers. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on the day of admission. She had paralysis of all four extremities with dysphagia and required intubation. She was extubated and re-intubated two more times due to worsening hypoxia and stridor which led to placement of a tracheostomy tube. Both our patients developed features of dysautonomia, including hypotension and tachycardia. Severe respiratory muscle weakness and dysphagia led to recurrent intubations. Their CT head and MRI brains were negative for facial nerve enhancement. Lumbar punctures in both revealed albuminocytologic dissociation. Plasma exchange was initiated in both females immediately after first intubation for total duration of five days. Upon outpatient follow up, they had significant improvement in motor function. Common precipitants of GBS are Campylobacter jejuni, EBV, CMV, HIV and Zika virus. Clearly, GBS is an infrequent complication of COVID-19. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 evokes an immune response against peripheral nerve components leading to acute polyneuropathy of heterogenous presentation. Typically, demyelinating and axonal forms of GBS have been described. However, in our cases, both had demyelinating features including symmetric weakness with predominant bulbar symptoms of dysphagia and dysphonia. These cases highlight that GBS is a potential neurological complication of COVID-19 that physicians must be aware of. Thorough daily neurological exam is critical, and early recognition of GBS symptoms may prompt regular evaluation of negative inspiratory force and vital capacity. This may lead to early initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange leading to improvement in motor symptoms thus avoiding ventilatory support. Plasma exchange should be considered as a first line treatment in COVID-19 patients since high concentrations of IVIG can lead to increased blood viscosity in these patients who are already at increased risk for thrombotic complications.","Chaudhary, D.; Norton, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,116,16

DESIGN: A literature review of the historical costs of surgical fellowship interviews and a summary of how the shift to virtual interviews has unintended positive and negative effects on costs for applicants and training programs. RESULTS: Transitioning fellowship interviews to virtual platforms affects expenditures of finances and time. Each fellowship candidate saves close to $6,000 in interview travel expenses. Applicants require less time off from their residency programs during this critical time of need for frontline healthcare workers. However, applicants miss some of the live aspects of interviewing, and training programs invest more effort upfront altering their interviews to virtual formats. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health crisis has had a significant impact on surgical education, including how selection is conducted. Virtual recruitment has the potential for cost savings but should continue to be refined. This is an opportune time to innovate and rethink how to recruit prospective surgical residency and fellowship candidates during the current and forthcoming interview seasons.","Tseng, Jennifer",J Surg Educ,116,4

In this paper, a different approach has been discussed, which is the development of predictive models for the SEIRD variables that have been based on the historical data collected, and the context variables to where this model has been applied to. Particularly, the context variables examined in this paper include total population, number of people over 65 years old, poverty index, morbidity rates, average age, and population density. For the construction of the SEIRD predictive models, this study encompasses a deep analysis of the dependence of these variables and also, their relationship with the context variables. Hence, before the development of predictive models using machine learning techniques, a methodology to analyze the interdependence of the SEIRD variables has been proposed. The dependence with the context variables is also discussed; to avoid the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity problems, leading to better results and the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, several prediction models based on varied machine learning techniques and inputs are considered, these include temporal interdependence, temporal intra-dependence, and dependence with context variables. Each of the predictive models has been studied, as well as their quality of prediction. This paper focuses on the analysis of the quality of this approach, applied in Colombia, obtaining the results about the performance of the predictive models for the SEIRD variables.

With the current global health crisis and government pronouncements prohibiting the conduct of face-to-face classes both in basic education (DepEd) and Higher education (CHED). Isabela State University has decided to roll out and launched its new approach, called telEducation. It has ramped up its efforts in fully implementing flexible remote learning for its students to ease its transition to what might become the new normal for educational institutions. This study utilized a descriptive survey method of investigation to secure adequate and reliable data. The researcher used this design to gather necessary data, assess and determine the challenges facing nursing education in the new normal by the nursing faculty of Isabela State University, College of Nursing. The questionnaires were floated through the use of google forms as a platform. The respondents who participated in this study were 15 nursing faculty comprises of 7 permanent as core faculty and 8 instructors under a contract of service. This study concluded that inadequate instructor training for new normal education;limited time for the preparation of modules, exams, and other related to instruction is due to the limited time of the university administrators or concern authorities to conduct since the summer class has already implemented. The said interventions made it more difficult to conduct due to the implementing community quarantines. Furthermore, there are numerous nursing-related experiences/activities but limited time for implementation;Students find it difficult to comprehend some activities due to the absence of physical contact of the instructor/s;faculty experiencing physical problems (eg. eye strain and frontal headache) due to long hours of exposure on computer monitor or gadgets are noted concerns in relation to the delivery of instructions.

The exponentially increasing numbers of infection and mortality have made preventive measures challenging. India being a highly populated nation has so far effectively counteracted the pandemic outbreak with a significantly lower rate of mortality despite the high infection rates. The genetic architecture of the immune response genes in the Indian population, BCG vaccination, the predominantly young age group of people, and their traditional food habits might contribute to the lower rate of mortality. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) play a vital role in triggering T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells can immediately react to eliminate infected cells. Activation of virus-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells selectively targets the infected cells and strengthens the immunoregulatory system. The checkpoint for NK cell function is the engagement of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) molecules with their respective HLA ligands overexpressed or expressed on the compromised virus-infected cells which have shown polymorphism among different ethnic groups. Here, we explore if certain KIR-HLA motifs grant Indians a survival advantage in terms of the low rate of mortality. Additionally, enhanced immunity through BCG vaccination may favor fruitful eradication of SARS-CoV-2 and provide the way out as in therapeutic intervention and vaccination strategies.","Al-Dayan, Noura; Venugopal, Divya; Dhanasekaran, Sugapriya",Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),116,24

Within a matter of months the virus had spread and become a global pandemic. In addition to international air travel, local travel (e.g. by passenger car) contributes to the geographic spread of COVID-19. We modify the common susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) virus spread model and investigate the extent to which short-term travel associated with driving influences the spread of the virus. We consider the case study of the US state of Minnesota, and calibrated the proposed model with travel and viral spread data. Using our modified SEIR model that considers local short-term travel, we are able to better explain the virus spread than using the long-term travel SEIR model. Short-term travel associated with driving is predicted to be a significant contributor to the historical and future spread of COVID-19. The calibrated model also predicts the proportion of infections that were detected. We find that if driving trips remain at current levels, a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases may be observed in Minnesota, while decreasing intrastate travel could help contain the virus spread.","Levin, Michael W; Shang, Mingfeng; Stern, Raphael",PLoS One,116,24

Herein, we report a novel heterostructure catalyst Co9S8/Cu2S on copper foam (Co9S8/Cu2S/CF) with multistep impregnation and electrodeposition. Due to the strong interfacial interaction, the interfacial electrons transfer from Co sites to S sites, which promote the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates, water molecules, as well as the dissociation of water molecules. Therefore, the heterostructure catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 195 mV for OER and 165 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, it only needs 1.6 V to realize water splitting at 10 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode cell.

Adults aged 18-24 years were least likely to report having received a COVID-19 vaccine and were most likely to report being unsure about getting vaccinated or that they were probably going to get vaccinated. Adults aged 18-39 years with lower incomes, with lower educational attainment, without health insurance, who were non-Hispanic Black, and who lived outside of metropolitan areas had the lowest reported vaccination coverage and intent to get vaccinated. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the primary reported reasons for not getting vaccinated.

Specific primers targeting a highly conserved region of the CaKoV 3D gene were developed. After optimization, the method detected a minimum of 1 × 101 copies/µL with high specificity, stability, and repeatability. Moreover, the entire process only required approximately 1.5 h for completion. Our results were supported by those obtained for clinical samples, in which our developed method was successfully applied. The newly established real-time PCR is a rapid, sensitive, speciï¬c, and repeatable method for the quantitative detection of CaKoV and can, therefore, be used in epidemiological studies.","Wang, Yong; Cui, Yongqiu; Li, Yeqiu; Zhang, Da; Sun, Jianfei; Guo, Xu; Liu, Guangqing; Jiang, Shudong; Li, Yongdong",J Virol Methods,116,9

We aimed to investigate whether secondary administration of HIVST kits, with or without an additional financial incentive, via women receiving antenatal care (ANC) or via people newly diagnosed with HIV (ie, index patients) could improve the proportion of male partners tested or the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: We did a three-arm, open-label, pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial of 27 health centres (clusters), eligible if they were a government primary health centre providing ANC, HIV testing, and ART services, across four districts of Malawi. We recruited women (aged &#8805;18 years) attending their first ANC visit and whose male partner was available, not already taking ART, and not already tested for HIV during this pregnancy (ANC cohort), and people (aged &#8805;18 years) with newly diagnosed HIV during routine clinic HIV testing who had at least one sexual contact not already known to be HIV-positive (index cohort). Centres were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a public selection of computer-generated random allocations, to enhanced standard of care (including an invitation for partners to attend HIV testing services), HIVST only, or HIVST plus a US$10 financial incentive for retesting. The primary outcome for the ANC cohort was the proportion of male partners reportedly tested, as ascertained by interview with women in this cohort at day 28. The primary outcome for the index cohort was the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive people identified per facility within 28 days of enrolment, as measured by observed HIV test results. Cluster-level summaries compared intervention with standard of care by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03705611. FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2018, and May 2, 2019, nine clusters were assigned to each trial arm, resulting in 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort (1447 [31·8%] in the standard care group, 1465 [32·2%] in the HIVST only group, and 1632 [35·9%] in HIVST plus financial incentive group) and 708 eligible patients in the index cohort (234 [33·1%] in the standard care group, 169 [23·9%] in the HIVST only group, and 305 [42·9%] in the HIVST plus financial incentive group). 4461 (98·2%) of 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort and 645 (91·1%) of 708 eligible patients in the index cohort were recruited, of whom 3378 (75·7%) in the ANC cohort and 439 (68·1%) in the index cohort were interviewed after 28 days. In the ANC cohort, the mean proportion of reported partner testing per cluster was 35·0% (SD 10·0) in the standard care group, 73·0% in HIVST only group (13·1, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1·71, 95% CI 1·48-1·98; p<0·0001), and 65·2% in the HIVST plus financial incentive group (11·6, adjusted RR 1·62, 1·45-1·81; p<0·0001). In the index cohort, the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive sexual partners per cluster was 1·35 (SD 1·62) for the standard care group, 1·91 (1·78) for the HIVST only group (incidence rate ratio adjusted for number eligible as an offset in the negative binomial model 1·65, 95% CI 0·49-5·55; p=0·3370), and 3·20 (3·81) for the HIVST plus financial incentive group (3·11, 0·99-9·77; p=0·0440). Four self-resolving, temporary marital separations occurred due to disagreement in couples regarding HIV self-test kits. INTERPRETATION: Although administration of HIVST kits in the ANC cohort, even when offered alongside a financial incentive, did not identify significantly more male patients with HIV than did standard care, out-of-clinic options for HIV testing appear more acceptable to many male partners of women with HIV, increasing test uptake. Viewed in the current context, this approach might allow continuation of services despite COVID-19-related lockdowns.

Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the processes allowing SARS-CoV-2 to multiply, because CTP is in demand for four essential metabolic steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis and it is required for synthesis of dolichol-phosphate, a precursor of viral protein glycosylation. The CCA 3'-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. This unique metabolic setup allowed us to highlight and provide a raison d'être to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.","Ou, Zhihua; Ouzounis, Christos; Wang, Daxi; Sun, Wanying; Li, Junhua; Chen, Weijun; Marlière, Philippe; Danchin, Antoine",Genome Biol Evol,116,20

Nonetheless, looking at this problem from a patient's perspective, it is indisputable that risk factors, considered as associated with the development of the virus disease, include older age, history of smoking, hypertension and heart disease. While several studies have already shown that many of these diseases can also be favored by a protracted exposure to air pollution, there has been recently an insurgence of negative commentary against authors who have correlated the fatal consequences of COVID-19 (also) to the exposition of specific air pollutants. Well aware that understanding the real connection between the spread of this fatal virus and air pollutants would require many other investigations at a level appropriate to the scale of this phenomenon (e.g., biological, chemical, and physical), we propose the results of a study, where a series of the measures of the daily values of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2were considered over time, while the Granger causality statistical hypothesis test was used for determining the presence of a possible correlation with the series of the new daily COVID19 infections, in the period February-April 2020, in Emilia-Romagna. Results taken both before and after the governmental lockdown decisions show a clear correlation, although strictly seen from a Granger causality perspective.

The EU's General Daten Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires controllers to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) where their data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms (Art. 35 GDPR). A DPIA is a structured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of data processing relevant to fundamental rights and describes the measures envisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so. Based on the Standard Data Protection Model (SDM), we present a scientific DPIA which thoroughly examines three published contact tracing app designs that are considered to be the most""privacy-friendly"": PEPP-PT, DP-3T and a concept summarized by Chaos Computer Club member Linus Neumann, all of which process personal health data. The DPIA starts with an analysis of the processing context and some expected use cases. Then, the processing activities are described by defining a realistic processing purpose. This is followed by the legal assessment and threshold analysis. Finally, we analyse the weak points, the risks and determine appropriate protective measures. We show that even decentralized implementations involve numerous serious weaknesses and risks. Legally, consent is unfit as legal ground hence data must be processed based on a law. We also found that measures to realize the rights of data subjects and affected people are not sufficient. Last but not least, we show that anonymization must be understood as a continuous process, which aims at separating the personal reference and is based on a mix of legal, organizational and technical measures. All currently available proposals lack such an explicit separation process.","Bock, Kirsten; Kuhne, Christian R.; Muhlhoff, Rainer; Ost, Mveto R.; Pohle, Jorg; Rehak, Rainer",,116,20

A SQUID based TDEM system has been developed, characterized with prototype transmitter and field survey has been performed. Since the laboratory tests were done in a relatively noisy environment, the frequency dependence and the sign reversal effects have not been observed but the same have clearly been observed in the field survey. In the field survey, the decay transients surprisingly reached negative values in a terrain where a thin conducting layer is sandwiched between thick upper and thin lower resistive layers and the decay transients were highly dependent on base frequency of the transmitter waveforms. The major advantage of using the SQUIDs in TDEM applications is its extremely high sensitivity maintained at low frequencies. Therefore one can investigate the conductivity of the layers buried in deep below the surface of the ground. Nevertheless, the decay transients recorded with SQUID provided the information of the conducting layer along with an unexpected zero cross-over at later decay times. In this article, we describe the possible reasons for these peculiarities based on the observations made by various researchers, understanding of the TDEM concepts, behavior of the instruments and various experiments performed by us.","Nagendran, R.; Bisht, Lata; Mohanty, Ijee; Arasu, A.

To contain the virus, much hope is placed on participatory surveillance using mobile apps, such as automated digital contact tracing, but broad adoption is an important prerequisite for associated interventions to be effective. Data protection aspects are a critical factor for adoption, and privacy risks of solutions developed often need to be balanced against their functionalities. This is reflected by an intensive discussion in the public and the scientific community about privacy-preserving approaches. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to inform the current discussions and to support the development of solutions providing an optimal balance between privacy protection and pandemic control. To this end, we present a systematic analysis of existing literature on citizen-centered surveillance solutions collecting individual-level spatial data. Our main hypothesis is that there are dependencies between the following dimensions: the use cases supported, the technology used to collect spatial data, the specific diseases focused on, and data protection measures implemented. METHODS: We searched PubMed and IEEE Xplore with a search string combining terms from the area of infectious disease management with terms describing spatial surveillance technologies to identify studies published between 2010 and 2020. After a two-step eligibility assessment process, 27 articles were selected for the final analysis. We collected data on the four dimensions described as well as metadata, which we then analyzed by calculating univariate and bivariate frequency distributions. RESULTS: We identified four different use cases, which focused on individual surveillance and public health (most common: digital contact tracing). We found that the solutions described were highly specialized, with 89% (24/27) of the articles covering one use case only. Moreover, we identified eight different technologies used for collecting spatial data (most common: GPS receivers) and five different diseases covered (most common: COVID-19). Finally, we also identified six different data protection measures (most common: pseudonymization). As hypothesized, we identified relationships between the dimensions. We found that for highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 the most common use case was contact tracing, typically based on Bluetooth technology. For managing vector-borne diseases, use cases require absolute positions, which are typically measured using GPS. Absolute spatial locations are also important for further use cases relevant to the management of other infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We see a large potential for future solutions supporting multiple use cases by combining different technologies (eg, Bluetooth and GPS). For this to be successful, however, adequate privacy-protection measures must be implemented. Technologies currently used in this context can probably not offer enough protection. We, therefore, recommend that future solutions should consider the use of modern privacy-enhancing techniques (eg, from the area of secure multiparty computing and differential privacy).","Wirth, Felix Nikolaus; Johns, Marco; Meurers, Thierry; Prasser, Fabian",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,116,20

In this study, there were 1477 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for Kermanshah from 22 February to 9 April. The close contacts of the confirmed cases were identified using telephone follow up of patients and their contacts. The SI distribution was used as an alternative. We fitted different models using the clinical onset dates of patients with their close contact (infector–infectee). Also, we applied a ‘serial interval from sample’ approach as a Bayesian methodology for estimating reproduction number. From 22 February to 29 March, 247 COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR. Close contact between 21 patients (21 infector–infectee pairs), including 12 primary cases and 21 secondary cases, was confirmed. The mean and standard deviation of the SI were estimated as 5.71 and 3.89 days. The R varied from 0.79 to 1.88 for a 7-day time-lapse and ranged from 0.92 to 1.64 for a 14-day time-lapse on raw data. Also, the R varied from 0.83 to 1.84 for 7-day time-lapse and from 0.95 to 1.54 for a 14-day time-lapse using moving average data, respectively. It can be concluded that the low reproduction number for COVID-19 in Kermanshah province is an indication of the effectiveness of preventive and interventive programmes such as quarantine and isolation. Consequently, continuing these preventive measures is highly recommended.","Najafi, F.; Izadi, N.; Hashemi-Nazari, S.-S.; Khosravi-Shadmani, F.; Nikbakht, R.; Shakiba, E.",New Microbes New Infect.,116,1

Two final designs were selected. Mask components were assembled into kits and distributed to community sewists. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were developed for quality improvement. A process was successfully developed to produce 5000 face masks in a period of 3 weeks that fit almost all (95%) health care workers who did not fit in a commercially available mask.

Aged hamsters developed more severe disease and even succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, representing the first lethal model using genetically unmodified laboratory animals. After initial viral clearance, the hamsters were re-challenged with 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 and displayed more than 4 log reduction in median viral loads in both nasal washes and lungs in comparison to primary infections. Most importantly, re-challenged hamsters were unable to transmit virus to naïve hamsters, and this was accompanied by the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, these results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces protective immunity that not only prevents re-exposure but also limits transmission in hamsters. These findings may help guide public health policies and vaccine development and aid evaluation of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Selvaraj, Prabhuanand; Lien, Christopher Z; Liu, Shufeng; Stauft, Charles B; Nunez, Ivette A; Hernandez, Mario; Nimako, Eric; Ortega, Mario A; Starost, Matthew F; Dennis, John U; Wang, Tony T",,116,1

S201086/GLPG1972 is a potent and selective inhibitor of ADAMTS-5 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif-5) in development as a DMOAD, hypothesized to reduce cartilage loss via inhibition of the enzymatic cleavage of aggrecan (a key component of cartilage). S201086/GLPG1972 has been shown to reduce cartilage degradation in preclinical models of OA. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S201086/GLPG1972 in patients with knee OA. Methods: ROCCELLA was a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study comprising a 5-week screening period, a 52-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week safety follow-up period (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: ). Patients aged 40-75 years with knee OA and pain severity in the target knee of 40-90 mm on a visual analog scale at screening and baseline were included. Target knees had predominant medial compartment disease, with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 or 3 and OARSI medial joint space narrowing (JSN) grade 1 or 2. Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to placebo or 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg S201086/GLPG1972 administered orally once daily. Concomitant analgesics (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen) were permitted. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 in cartilage thickness of the central medial femorotibial compartment (cMFTC) of the target knee, as measured by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) and analyzed by a central reading facility. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: change from baseline to week 52 in radiographic joint space width of the target knee (JSW;X-ray with central readout);patient-reported outcomes (including WOMAC scores, patient global assessment [PGA] score and pain score, both measured by visual analog scales);and safety outcomes. A mixed-effects model for repeated measures (using all longitudinal observations at each post-baseline visit) was used for the primary analysis. Results: Across 12 countries, 3319 patients were screened and 932 were included in the study. Patients had a mean age of 62.9 years and the majority (69.3%) were women. Baseline characteristics were similar across study groups (Table 1). Overall, 88.8% of knees were KL grade 3 and 67.3% were OARSI medial JSN grade 2. Patients experienced substantial cartilage loss;the mean (SD) change in cMFTC cartilage thickness was −0.12 (0.27) mm from baseline to week 52 in the placebo group. However, no statistically significant differences between treatment groups and placebo were observed for the primary endpoint of cMFTC cartilage thickness loss (placebo vs 75 mg, p = 0.165;vs 150 mg, p = 0.939;vs 300 mg, p = 0.682;Figure 1). These results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses assessing the management of missing data and delayed week 52 qMRI owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. No significant differences between treatment groups and the placebo group were observed at any time point in any of the secondary endpoints, including changes in WOMAC total score and subscores (Figure 2), radiographic JSW, PGA score or pain score. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events were experienced by similar proportions of patients in the placebo and S201086/GLPG1972 groups (Table 2). The most common TEAEs across all S201086/GLPG1972 treatment groups were arthralgia, nasopharyngitis and fall (Table 2). Tolerability was similar across the three S201086/GLPG1972 dose groups, with 6.8% (75 mg) to 8.6% (300 mg) of patients withdrawing from treatment owing to TEAEs, compared with 3.8% in the placebo group. Conclusions: The study successfully selected patients who experienced a substantial decrease in cartilage thickness over 52 weeks;a decrease that would be large enough to demonstrate a sizeable structural benefit of a DMOAD candidate. However, the study failed to meet its primary endpoint (change from baseline to week 52 in cartilage thickness of the cMFTC) and secondary endpoints, and there was no dose-response relationship. S201086/GLPG1972 had a good safety profile and was generally well tolerated. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented]","Schnitzer, T.

An online survey was administered from 10 to 31 July 2020. Age, sex, years of professional activity, COVID-19 status, geographical area of origin and length of lockdown period were recorded for all participating dentists. The relationships between these variables and the changes in clinical activity, the treated patients' COVID-19 status and the implementation of protective measures in the dental clinic were analyzed. A total of 436 (70.6% women) dentists from 59 countries responded to the survey. Clinical activity was reduced or stopped for 79.1% of respondents. The most common change was to limit treatment to urgent care only (53.7%). Treatment under general anesthesia or deep sedation was discontinued (51.0%) or reduced (35.8%) for the majority of respondents. Male dentists were more likely to maintain their clinical activity than female dentists (p < 0.001), and respondents from North America were more likely to do so than participants from other geographical regions (p < 0.001). Dentists from Latin America and the Caribbean were more likely to report treatment of confirmed cases of COVID-19 than those from Europe (p < 0.001). The implementation of protective measures in the dental office was determined by the survey participant's sex, intensity of clinical activity and geographical area of origin. To conclude, the provision of special care dentistry was considerably reduced in response to the pandemic. Service maintenance was mainly related to the geographical area in which the surveyed dentists worked, further exacerbating pre-existing inequalities.","Limeres Posse, Jacobo; van Harten, Maria T; Mac Giolla Phadraig, Caoimhin; Diniz Freitas, Márcio; Faulks, Denise; Dougall, Alison; Daly, Blánaid; Diz Dios, Pedro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),116,12

Incompliance with infection control guidelines of healthcare workers (HCWs) may increase their risk of exposure to infectious disease, especially under pandemics. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of compliance with the infection prevention and control practices among HCWs in different healthcare settings and its relationship with their views on workplace infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Nurses in Hong Kong were invited to respond to a cross-sectional online survey, in which their views on workplace infection and prevention policy, compliance with standard precautions and self-reported health during pandemics were collected. Results: The respondents were dissatisfied with workplace infection and prevention policy in terms of comprehensiveness (62%), clarity (64%), timeliness (63%), and transparency (60%). For the protective behavior, the respondents did not fully comply with the standard precautions when they were involved in medical care. Their compliance was relatively low when having proper patient handling (54%) and performing invasive procedures (46%). A multivariate analysis model proved that the level of compliance of the standard precautions was positively associated with the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy among high risk group (0.020; 95% CI: 0.005-0.036), while older respondents had higher level of compliance among the inpatient and outpatient groups (coefficient range: 0.065-0.076). The higher level of compliance was also significantly associated with working in designated team and having chronic condition of the respondents among high-risk and inpatient groups. Conclusions: Standard precautions are the most important elements to reduce cross-transmission among HCWs and patients while the satisfaction on infection control and prevention policy would increase the compliance among the high-risk group. An overall suboptimal compliance and poor views on the infection prevention and control guidelines is a warning signal to healthcare system especially during pandemics.","Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi; Ho, Kin-Fai; Dong, Dong; Cheung, Annie Wai-Ling; Yau, Peter Sen-Yung; Chan, Emily Ying-Yang; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Chien, Wai-Tong; Chen, Frank Youhua; Poon, Simon; Zhang, Qingpeng; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),116,12

Research in digital environments was already booming, but now that face-to-face activities are temporarily suspended, it becomes an alternative to enable the continuity of studies. Understanding it better is an epistemological and methodological need for all researchers. Thus, the objective of this essay is to propose some theoretical and methodological considerations on qualitative research in the different digital environments formed by the Internet 2.0. We point out some introductory aspects and tensions considered strategic for those who are going to start their work in social networks supported by the Internet. We organized the article based on the following topics: (1) digital sociality; (2) the ""digital environment"" and the blurring of boundaries between real-virtual; (3) the redefinition of the meaning of ""field"" in the digital environment; (4) the different cultural uses of digital platforms; (5) platforms as producers of discursive genres; (6) the production and extraction of collections. The essay seeks to demonstrate that research in digital environments reveals an exponential field of possibilities, whether to explore the forms that this sociality assumes in our daily lives, or to modulate our (inter)subjectivities, as it allows the production of identity narratives and performances, associations for different purposes, among many other possibilities. However, it demands an understanding of social action based on the synergy of the socio-technical-cultural contexts that structure it.","Deslandes, Suely; Coutinho, Tiago",Cad Saude Publica,116,16

To analyze the different impacts of COVID-19 on black carbon (BC) in the two representative regions in China, one-year continuous online measurements of BC were conducted simultaneously in Beijing and Tibet. The average concentration in the LD period was 20% higher than that in the pre-LD period in Beijing, which could be attributed to the increase of transport from southwestern neighboring areas and enhanced aged BC. In contrast to megacity, the average concentration of BC in Tibet decreased over 70% in the LD period, suggesting high sensitivity of plateau background areas to the anthropogenic emission reduction in South Asia. Our study clearly showed that BC responded very differently in megacity and background areas to the change of anthropogenic emission under the lockdown intervention.","Liu, Yue Wang Yinan Cao Yang Yang Xi Zhang Tianle Luan Mengxiao Lyu Daren Hansen Anthony D.

The initial outbreak of the pandemic began in December 2019, and it is affecting the human health of the global community. In common with previous pandemics (Influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV) and the epidemics of Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, CoVs target bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. Virus protein ligands (e.g., haemagglutinin or trimeric spike glycoprotein for Influenza and CoV, respectively) interact with cellular receptors, such as (depending on the virus) either sialic acids, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Host proteases, e.g., cathepsins, furin, or members of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) family, such as Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are involved in virus entry by proteolytically activating virus ligands. Also involved are Toll Like Receptor (TLR) family members, which upregulate anti-viral and pro-inflammatory mediators [interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and type I and type III Interferons among others], through the activation of Nuclear Factor (NF)-kB. When these events (virus cellular entry and innate immune responses) are uncontrolled, a deleterious systemic response is sometimes encountered in infected patients, leading to the well-described ""cytokine storm"" and an ensuing multiple organ failure promoted by a downregulation of dendritic cell, macrophage, and T-cell function. We aim to describe how the lung and systemic host innate immune responses affect survival either positively, through downregulating initial viral load, or negatively, by triggering uncontrolled inflammation. An emphasis will be put on host cellular signaling pathways and proteases involved with a view on tackling these therapeutically.","Sallenave, Jean-Michel; Guillot, Loïc",Front Immunol,116,1

The lockdown in response to COVID-19 may have resulted in lifestyle changes that affected sleep quality. For this reason, the objective of this study is to determine the difference in nursing students' sleep quality before and during the lockdown, put in place in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To meet this objective, we conducted a longitudinal observational study on 207 nursing students, with two cut-off points (February and April). The main dependent variable was sleep quality, measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and its seven components. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data, as well as group-stratified analysis. The mean time students spent in bed was 7.6 h (standard deviation (SD) = 1.1 h) before lockdown and 8.5 h (SD = 1.2 h) during lockdown. The PSQI score got 0.91 points worse during lockdown (95% CI, -0.51, -1.31). Of the five components, five were statistically significantly affected (p &#8804; 0.05), and of these, the most changed were sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. When stratified by group, we observed differences in women, first-year students, second-year students, alcohol consumers, those of normal weight, and those that live with family. The main conclusion is that although students spent more time in bed, overall sleep quality was worse during lockdown, as well as being worse in five of the seven components.","Romero-Blanco, Cristina; Rodríguez-Almagro, Julián; Onieva-Zafra, María Dolores; Parra-Fernández, María Laura; Prado-Laguna, María Del Carmen; Hernández-Martínez, Antonio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),116,24

Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia. Coronaviruses code for an important multifunctional enzyme named papain-like protease (PLP), that has many roles in pathogenesis. First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication. Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the host's immune response that would otherwise hinder infection. Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins. Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response. PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro. In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.","Clemente, Valentino; D039,; Arcy, Padraig; Bazzaro, Martina",,116,2

This study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing anti-factor Xa activity in COVID-19 patients receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). We prospectively evaluated 80 COVID-19 patients, diagnosed using polymerase chain reaction test, who were admitted to our clinic and administered LMWH; LMWH (enoxaparin) was applied according to the weight, D-dimer levels, and clinical condition of patients. Anti-factor Xa activity in blood, drawn 4 h after the 3rd dose of LMWH, was measured and an activity of < 0.2 IU/mL was considered subprophylactic. Patients were followed up clinically, and anti-factor Xa activity was re-examined before discharge. Groups 1 and 2 included 13 and 67 patients with subprophylactic (mean ± SD: 0.18 ± 0.06) and prophylactic (mean ± SD: 0.43 ± 0.23) anti-factor Xa activity, respectively. The proportion of eosinophils in patients was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (mean ± SD; 2.96 ± 2.55 vs 0.90 ± 1.28; p = 0.001). At the time of discharge, the eosinophilic proportion of patients was significantly higher (eosinophil %, mean ± SD; 3.06 ± 1.49 vs 2.07 ± 1.92; p = 0.001), but the activated partial thromboplastin time was significantly lower (22.34 ± 1.38 vs 24.38 ± 3.58; p = 0.01) in group 1 than in group 2. Of 14 patients with eosinophil content > 4%, 6 were in group 1 ((6/13) 46.2%), while 8 were in group 2 ((8/63) 11.9%); (p = 0.009), and all had a D-dimer level < 1 µg/mL (p = 0.03). ROC analysis for the presence of anticoagulation at subprophylactic level revealed an area under curve of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64-0.93); p = 0.001). In conclusion; Elevated eosinophil count is related to lower anti-factor Xa activity in patients with COVID-19 receiving LMWH.

No reports encompass any conclusive confirmation of vertical transmission. Nevertheless, cases of fetal distress and multiple organ failure have been reported, as well as rare cases of fetal demise. While clinicians and scientists continue to seek proof of vertical transmission, they miss the greater point, namely the cause of preterm delivery. In this review, we suggest that the cause might not be due to the viral infection but the fetal exposure to maternal inflammation or cytokine storm that translates into a complication of COVID-19. This statement is extrapolated from previous experience with infections and inflammation which were reported to be fatal by increasing the risk of preterm delivery and causing abnormal neonatal brain development and resulting in neurological disorders like atypical behavioral phenotype or autistic syndrome. Given the potentially fatal consequences on neonate health, we highlight the urgent need for an animal model to study vertical transmission. The preclinical model will allow us to make the link between SARS-COV-2 infection, inflammation and long-term follow-up of child brain development.","Joma, M.; Fovet, C.

Assuming an underlying SIR model with general but known distribution for the time to recovery, this paper derives the implied differential-integral equations for observed incidence data when a fixed fraction of newly infected individuals are not observed. The parameters of the resulting system of differential equations are identifiable. Using these differential equations, we develop a stochastic model for the conditional distribution of current disease incidence given the entire past history of reported cases. We estimate the model parameters using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution. We use our model to estimate the transmission rate and fraction of asymptomatic individuals for the current Coronavirus 2019 outbreak in eight American Countries: the United States of America, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Panama, from January 2020 to May 2021.

Objective: Our objective was to create a repeatable modeling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability. Methods: Using readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable data sets, we used stepwise linear regression techniques to build predictive models during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in high population density states. The mean sample size was 43 and ranged from 8 (Connecticut) to 82 (Michigan). Results: The New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania models provided the strongest predictions of top counties in densely populated states with a high likelihood of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates. For all of these models, P values were less than .05. Conclusions: The models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states with strong model predictions as input into a much needed ""pandemic playbook"" for local health care agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources.

The absence of a globally distributed effective treatment makes the exploration of new mechanisms of action a key step to address this situation. Stabilization of non-native Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) of the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV has been reported as a valid strategy to inhibit viral replication. In this study, the applicability of this unexplored mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed. During our research, we were able to find three inducible interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD, compare them to the previously reported MERS-CoV stabilized dimers, and identify those residues that are responsible for their formation. A drug discovery protocol implemented consisting of docking, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA enabled us to find several compounds that might be able to exploit this mechanism of action. In addition, a common catechin skeleton was found among many of these molecules, which might be useful for further drug design. We consider that our findings could motivate future research in the fields of drug discovery and design towards the exploitation of this previously unexplored mechanism of action against COVID-19.

RESULTS: Promising a referral bonus did not affect nurses' referral likelihood and quality. Instead supporting self-determination theory, nurses exposed to the autonomous request were more likely to refer and assure referral quality than those exposed to the controlling request. CONCLUSION: Hospitals can increase nurses' referral likelihood and quality by framing their referral request in an autonomy-supportive way.

Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of 'self' in higher eukaryotes, while unmodified cap0-RNA is recognised as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess 'non-self' cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost and the closely-related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b and Ifit1c. While murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, while binding is much weaker to cap0- and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict wildtype mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families, to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection, and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.","Mears, Harriet V; Sweeney, Trevor R",J. biol. chem,116,20

Remdesivir treatment did not significantly affect nasopharyngeal viral load, as determined by comparing the differences between the first and last cycle threshold values of the SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR tests performed during hospitalization (cycle threshold 7.07 ± 6.85 vs. 7.08 ± 7.27, p 0.977 in the control and treated groups, respectively). Remdesivir treatment shortened hospitalization length by less than a day compared with non-treated controls and by 3.1 days when non-intubated patients from both groups were compared. These differences, however, were not statistically significant, possibly because of the small size of the remdesivir group. DISCUSSION: Remdesivir was not associated with nasopharyngeal viral load changes, but our study had a significant disease severity baseline imbalance and was not powered to detect viral load or clinical differences.","Goldberg, Elad; Ben Zvi, Haim; Sheena, Liron; Sofer, Summer; Krause, Ilan; Sklan, Ella H; Shlomai, Amir",Clin Microbiol Infect,116,27

We show that elementary principles of distributive justice guarantee that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in a finite economy where agents freely (and non-cooperatively) choose their inputs and derive utility from their pay. Chief among these principles is that: 1) your pay should not depend on your name, and 2) a more productive agent should not earn less. When these principles are violated, an equilibrium may not exist. Moreover, we uncover an intuitive condition -- technological monotonicity -- that guarantees equilibrium uniqueness and efficiency. We generalize our findings to economies with social justice and inclusion, implemented in the form of progressive taxation and redistribution, and guaranteeing a basic income to unproductive agents. Our analysis uncovers a new class of strategic form games by incorporating normative principles into non-cooperative game theory. Our results rely on no particular assumptions, and our setup is entirely non-parametric. Illustrations of the theory include applications to exchange economies, surplus distribution in a firm, contagion and self-enforcing lockdown in a networked economy, and bias in the academic peer-review system.

Chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia have been investigated mostly in China, and there is very little information available on the radiological findings occurring in other populations. In this study, we aimed to describe the characteristics of chest CT findings in confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Iranian population, based on a time classification. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR test, who were admitted to non-ICU wards and underwent a chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. Descriptive evaluation of radiologic findings was performed using a classification based on the time interval between the initiation of the symptoms and chest CT-scan. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 58.0 years, and the median time interval from the onset of symptoms to CT scan evaluation was 7 days. Most patients had bilateral (94.4%) and multifocal (91.0%) lung involvement with peripheral distribution (60.7%). Also, most patients showed involvement of all five lobes (77.5%). Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (84.3%), and mixed GGO with consolidation (80.9%) were the most common identified patterns. We also found that as the time interval between symptoms and CT scan evaluation increased, the predominant pattern changed from GGO to mixed pattern and then to elongated-containing and band-like-opacities-containing pattern; on the other hand, the percentage of lung involvement increased. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral multifocal GGO, and mixed GGO with consolidation were the most common patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in our study. However, these patterns might change according to the time interval from symptoms.","Jafari, Sirous; Tabary, Mohammadreza; Eshraghi, Sahereh; Araghi, Farnaz; Aryannejad, Armin; Mohammadnejad, Esmaeil; Rasoolinejad, Mehrnaz; Hajiabdolbaghi, Mahboubeh; Koochak, Hamid Emadi; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Abbasian, Ladan; Manshadi, Seyed Ali Dehghan; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Khalili, Hossein; Yazdi, Niloofar Ayoobi; Seifi, Arash",Rom. j. intern. med,116,25

Information on the differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed COVID-19 in real-life settings is lacking. METHODS: We extracted data from the medical records of adult patients who were consecutively admitted for suspected COVID-19 infection in Moscow, between April 8 and May 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 4261 patients hospitalised for suspected COVID-19, outcomes were available for 3480 patients (median age 56 years (interquartile range 45-66). The commonest comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, chronic cardiac disease and diabetes. Half of the patients (n=1728) had a positive RT-PCR while 1748 were negative on RT-PCR but had clinical symptoms and characteristic CT signs suggestive of COVID-19 infection.No significant differences in frequency of symptoms, laboratory test results and risk factors for in-hospital mortality were found between those exclusively clinically diagnosed or with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.In a multivariable logistic regression model the following were associated with in-hospital mortality; older age (per 1 year increase) odds ratio [OR] 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 - 1.06); male sex (OR 1.71, 1.24 - 2.37); chronic kidney disease (OR 2.99, 1.89 - 4.64); diabetes (OR 2.1, 1.46 - 2.99); chronic cardiac disease (OR 1.78, 1.24 - 2.57) and dementia (OR 2.73, 1.34 - 5.47). CONCLUSIONS: Age, male sex, and chronic comorbidities were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The combination of clinical features were sufficient to diagnoseCOVID-19 infection indicating that laboratory testing is not critical in real-life clinical practice.","Munblit, Daniel; Nekliudov, Nikita A; Bugaeva, Polina; Blyuss, Oleg; Kislova, Maria; Listovskaya, Ekaterina; Gamirova, Aysylu; Shikhaleva, Anastasia; Belyaev, Vladimir; Timashev, Petr; Warner, John O; Comberiati, Pasquale; Apfelbacher, Christian; Bezrukov, Evgenii; Politov, Mikhail E; Yavorovskiy, Andrey; Bulanova, Ekaterina; Tsareva, Natalya; Avdeev, Sergey; Kapustina, Valentina A; Pigolkin, Yuri I; Dankwa, Emmanuelle A; Kartsonaki, Christiana; Pritchard, Mark G; Victor, Fomin; Svistunov, Andrey A; Butnaru, Denis; Glybochko, Petr",Clin. infect. dis,116,26

Methods: We use daily data at the county level. The COVID-19 cases and fatalities data are from the New York Times. Social distancing measures are from SafeGraph. Both data are retrieved from the Unfolded Studio website. The county-level COVID-related policy responses are from the National Association of Counties. We use an event-study design and regression analysis to estimate the effect of the state-wide shelter-in-place order on social distancing and the number of cases and deaths. Results: We find that the growth rate of cases and deaths is significantly lower during the policy period when the percentage of the population that stays at home is highest. The crucial question is whether the policy has a causal impact on the sheltering percentages. The fact that some counties in Texas adopted local restrictive policies well before the state-wide policy helps us address this question. We do not find evidence that this top-down restrictive policy increased the percentage of the population that exercised social distancing. Discussion: Shelter-in-place policies are more effective at the local level and should go along with efforts to inform and update the public about the potential consequences of the disease and its current state in their localities.,"Castaneda, Marco A; Saygili, Meryem",Front Public Health,116,33

The early identification of who will progress on AA/P is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the role of prostate surface antigen (PSA) kinetics as a predictor of progression in mHSPC patients treated with AA/P. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with mHSPC who initiated androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AA/P from June 2017 to February 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic were eligible. PSA-mCRPC was defined as a PSA rise at two consecutive time points. Patients were followed until first mCRPC or last contact after AA/P. Patterns of PSA change were evaluated using a longitudinal mixed model at time 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from AA/P initiation. The association between PSA profile at 3 months and PSA-mCRPC was examined using survival analysis. Radiographic progression (Rad-mCRPC) was also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 130 men with follow-up were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time was 15.3 (10.5, 22.5) months. Eighty-two percent were Caucasian (median age 68.5 years); participants had a median (IQR) PSA of 16.8 (5.3, 48.0) ng/mL. Half of the patients had de novo disease, and 46.2% had high-risk disease (61% had a Gleason score &#8805; 8, 16% had visceral disease, and 54% had three or more bony lesions). The greatest PSA percentage reduction from baseline after AA/P initiation occurred at the first 3 months (median 98.3%). The reduction at 6-12 months from baseline was small (99.7-100%). Patients without PSA-mCRPC had a significantly greater 3-month reduction of PSA values compared to patients who developed PSA-mCRPC (p interaction = 0.0002). 50.8% of patients were able to achieve a non-detectable PSA (median 13.1 months). PSA-mCRPC (n = 20) was observed from 4 to 24 months after AA/P, with the majority of events occurring within the first 12 months. Patients with PSA < 0.3 ng/mL (12-month PSA-mCRPC-free 94.5% vs. 69.4%, p = 0.0004) or a &#8805; 98% reduction (94.9% vs. 68.0%, p = 0.0002) at 3 months had better PSA-mCRPC-free survival compared to their counterparts. Absolute reduction at 3 months was not associated with PSA-mCRPC. Similar PSA patterns were seen in those who had Rad-mCRPC compared to no Rad-mCRPC (p interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The degree of PSA decline at 3 months predicted serologic progression to mCRPC. Those who developed castration-resistant disease had higher PSA and a lower percentage reduction by 3 months. Tracking early PSA pattern changes may alert clinicians to poor treatment effect and potential progression; they should consider frequent PSA measurement and imaging, as well as the initiation of sequential therapy.","Sheng, Iris Y; Fallah, Jaleh; Gupta, Ruby; Li, Hong; Allman, Kimberly; Martin, Allison; Barata, Pedro; Ornstein, Moshe C; Gilligan, Timothy D; Rini, Brian I; Garcia, Jorge A",Target Oncol,116,24

This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on commonly prescribed first-line antibiotics in English primary care. A secondary analysis of publicly available government data pertaining to primary care prescribing was conducted. A list of twenty first-line antibiotics used to treat common infections was developed following the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. All primary care prescription and cost data pertaining to commonly prescribed first-line antibiotics in England between March and September of 2018–2020 were extracted and adjusted for inflation. Analysis suggests prescribing of antibiotics significantly reduced by 15.99% (p = 0.018) and 13.5% (p = 0.002) between March and September 2020 compared with same time period for 2018 and 2019, respectively. The most noticeable decrease in 2020 was noticed for prescribing for meningitis (−62.3%;p = 0.002) followed by respiratory tract infections (−39.13%;p = 0.035), in terms of indications. These results are suggestive of reduced transmission of infections in the community due to national lockdowns, social distancing and hygiene practices. In addition, the impact of reduced face-to-face consultations in general practices needs to be investigated as a potential reason for reduced prescribing. The pandemic also offers an opportunity to rationalize antibiotics use in the community.","Hussain, Alisha Zubair Paudyal Vibhu Hadi Muhammad Abdul",Antibiotics,116,1

The lack of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, along with the relatively high mortality rate and high contagiousness, has raised strong public concerns over COVID-19, especially for people living in the most severely affected areas. This study aimed to clarify the influencing factors for the anxiety level among the Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on the media exposure to different COVID-19 information. METHODS: A total of 4991 respondents were randomly recruited from a national online panel from February 12th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020, a period when the number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 10,000 in a single day, with the total cases in China reaching up to 90,000. The relationships between media exposure of COVID-19 information, social and geographical proximity to COVID-19, risk perceptions were assessed using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression analysis. RESULTS: The media exposure to COVID-19 information was differently associated with anxiety. Meanwhile, the anxiety level was found to be high in respondents who personally knew someone infected with COVID-19 or those who living in an area with reported cases. Respondents who perceived more risks also reported a higher level of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the role of media exposure in affecting individuals' anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, it is recommended that government and health professionals are recommended to adopt effective risk communication strategies to protect citizens' mental health during the pandemic.","Liu, Miao; Zhang, Hongzhong; Huang, Hui",BMC Public Health,116,1

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM (Jupyter notebook), https://github.com/EESI/ncov_ism (command line tool) and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.","Zhao, Zhengqiao; Sokhansanj, Bahrad A; Malhotra, Charvi; Zheng, Kitty; Rosen, Gail L",PLoS Comput Biol,116,16

METHODS: T1D Exchange coordinated a US type 1 diabetes COVID-19 registry. Forty-six diabetes centers submitted pediatric cases for patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Associations between clinical factors and hospitalization were tested with Fisher's Exact Test. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for hospitalization. RESULTS: Data from 266 patients with previously established type 1 diabetes aged <19 years with COVID-19 were reported. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was the most common adverse outcome (n = 44, 72% of hospitalized patients). There were four hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia, three hospitalizations requiring respiratory support (one of whom was intubated and mechanically ventilated), one case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 10 patients who were hospitalized for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or diabetes. Hospitalized patients (n = 61) were more likely than nonhospitalized patients (n = 205) to have minority race/ethnicity (67% vs 39%, P < 0.001), public insurance (64% vs 41%, P < 0.001), higher A1c (11% [97 mmol/mol] vs 8.2% [66 mmol/mol], P < 0.001), and lower insulin pump and lower continuous glucose monitoring use (26% vs 54%, P < 0.001; 39% vs 75%, P < 0.001). Age and gender were not associated with risk of hospitalization. Higher A1c was significantly associated with hospitalization, with an odds ratio of 1.56 (1.34-1.84) after adjusting for age, gender, insurance, and race/ethnicity.

Some of those infected become seriously ill. Others do not show any symptoms, but can still contribute to the transmission of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is excreted in the oral cavity and can be spread via aerosols. Therefore, there is an increased risk of its spread during aerosol-producing treatments in dental care clinics. Due to the risk of infection of dental care workers and patients, and based on the evidence currently available, additional infection control measures for all patients are strongly recommended when providing emergency dental care in this phase of the pandemic. Other treatments should be postponed. Based on guidance in scientific literature and advice from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), consideration should be given to what infection control measures are necessary when providing emergency and regular dental care in both the current situation and in the future.","Volgenant, C M C; Persoon, I F; de Ruijter, R A G; de Soet, J J",Ned Tijdschr Tandheelkd,116,23

COVID-19, the clinical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has a variable presentation ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Liver involvement is common during COVID-19 and exhibits a spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic elevations of liver function tests to hepatic decompensation. The presence of abnormal liver tests has been associated with a more severe presentation of COVID-19 disease and overall mortality. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the liver of COVID-19 patients, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 productively infects and replicates in liver cells and has a direct liver-pathogenic effect. The cause of liver injury in COVID-19 can be attributed to multiple factors including virus-induced systemic inflammation, hypoxia, hepatic congestion and drug induced liver disease. Among patients with cirrhosis, COVID-19 has been associated with hepatic decompensation and liver-related mortality. Additionally, COVID-19's impact on healthcare resources can adversely affect delivery of care and outcomes of patients with chronic liver disease. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of liver injury during COVID-19 will be important in the management of COVID-19 patients, especially those with advanced liver disease. This review summarizes our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactions in the liver as well the clinical impact of liver disease in COVID-19.","Saviano, Antonio; Wrensch, Florian; Ghany, Marc G; Baumert, Thomas F",Hepatology (Baltim.),116,16

A coordination program between Primary Care and Geriatrics and Public Health services was activated. METHODS: 2,668 seniors were followed at 39 nursing homes. Data from new cases, active cases, mortality and place of treatment of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed with the measurement of the absolute number of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases and the frequency distribution. RESULTS: Between August 7th 2020 and February 26th 2021, 30 outbreaks occurred at 21 nursing homes. 300 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (11% of total residents). The daily average of active cases was 27,166 were hospitalized (55%). 66 patients died (22% of those infected), 54 of them (78%) at the hospital. 1,984 PCR tests were performed. The temporary profile of new cases did not follow a distribution ""in waves"" as in the community. Thirty-seven days after the start of the second dose of vaccination, there were no active cases until March 1st, when new cases were under study for possible vaccine leakage. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 at nursing homes after the first wave of the pandemic has apparently been lower. The transmission in these centers has followed a different distribution than at community. Mass vaccination has achieved the practical disappearance of the disease.","Menendez Colino, R.; Merello de Miguel, A.; Argentina, F.; Barcons Marques, M.; Chaparro Jimenez, B.; Lopez Hernandez, P.; Jimenez Bueno, S.; Montero Vega, M.

The authors sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on cancer treatment, anxiety, and financial distress among low-income patients with gynecologic cancer during the peak of the NYC pandemic. METHODS: Medicaid-insured women who were receiving gynecologic oncology care at 2 affiliated centers were contacted by telephone interviews between March 15 and April 15, 2020. Demographics and clinical characteristics were obtained through self-report and retrospective chart review. Financial toxicity, anxiety, and cancer worry were assessed using modified, validated surveys. RESULTS: In total, 100 patients completed the telephone interview. The median age was 60 years (range, 19-86 years), and 71% had an annual income <$40,000. A change in employment status and early stage cancer (stage I and II) were associated with an increase in financial distress (P < .001 and P = .008, respectively). Early stage cancer and telehealth participation were significantly associated with increased worry about future finances (P = .017 and P = .04, respectively). Lower annual income (<$40,000) was associated with increased cancer worry and anxiety compared with higher annual income (>$40,000; P = .036 and P = .017, respectively). When controlling for telehealth participation, income, primary language, and residence in a high COVID-19 prevalence area, a delay in medical care resulted in a 4-fold increased rate of anxiety (P = .023, 95% CI, 1.278-14.50). Race was not significantly associated with increased financial distress, cancer worry, or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Low socioeconomic status was the most common risk factor for increased financial distress, cancer worry, and anxiety.

Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. Objective: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. Methods: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework–Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. Results: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.","Lebrasseur, Audrey Fortin-Bédard Noémie Lettre Josiane Raymond Emilie Eve-Line Bussières Lapierre Nolwenn Faieta Julie Vincent Claude Duchesne Louise Ouellet Marie-Christine Gagnon Eric Tourigny André Lamontagne Marie-Ève Routhier François",JMIR Aging,116,18

Currently, during the second wave, the situation is still far from normality. Here we describe the changes that took place, and are still ongoing, in the clinical practice. METHODS: Number and type of admissions, outpatients activity, ER and urgent procedures in SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients have been analyzed over seven weeks (October 26th-December 13th, 2020) and compared with the correspondent period in 2019 and the same timeframe during the first wave (February 24th-April 10th). RESULTS: 2019 vs. 2020: Overall admissions decreased by 39.8%; however, while admissions for elective surgery dropped by 42.0%, urgent surgeries increased by 117.0%. Rehabilitation admissions declined by 85.2%. White and green priority ER consultations declined by 41.6% and 52.0%, respectively; yellow and red increased by 766.7% and 400.0%, respectively. Second vs. first wave: Overall admissions increased by 58.6% with a smoother decrement in weekly admissions than during the first wave. Disparity of acute admissions vs. rehabilitation expanded: Acute cases increased by 63.6% while rehabilitation cases decreased by 8.7%. Admissions to triage procedures increased by 72.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Activity levels are far from normality during the second COVID-19 wave. Elective surgery and outpatients-related activities are still strongly limited compared to 2019 while the number of urgent cases treated increased consistently. SARS-CoV-2 positive emergencies are slightly higher than during the first wave.

The study aims to assess religious coping in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: It was an online survey. The sample was collected using a snowball sampling technique as the data were collected through Google forms. The survey started on 22 April 2020 and was closed on 28 May 2020. The participants were from two countries, India and Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, having completed at least 10 years of formal education, and have internet access. For data collection, Semi-structured proforma (demographic and personal characteristics) and Brief RCOPE was used to see the extent to which individuals engage in positive and negative forms of religious coping. RESULTS: A total of 647 individuals (360 from Nigeria and 287 from India) participated in the survey. A total of 188 (65.5%) participants in India reported no change in their religious activities since they heard about COVID-19, while, 160 (44.4%) in Nigeria reported a decrease in religious activities. Positive religious coping in the Nigerian population was significantly higher than the Indian population. Similarly, negative religious coping was significantly higher (for most of the items in the brief RCOPE) in the Indian population than the Nigerian population. CONCLUSION: Significant percentages of people after the COVID-19 pandemic took religious coping steps to overcome their problems. During this pandemic, positive religious coping among the Indian and Nigerian communities is more prevalent than negative religious coping. There is a substantial cross-national difference between Indians and Nigerians in the religious coping modes.","Fatima, Huma; Oyetunji, Tosin Philip; Mishra, Sudha; Sinha, Krittika; Olorunsogbon, Olorunyomi Felix; Akande, Oluwayemi Samson; Kar, Sujita Kumar",Int J Soc Psychiatry,116,24

Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with smokers and non-smokers from smoking households 19 to 27 weeks after the first full UK lockdown ended in May 2020. A non-probability purposive sample representing 25 adults aged 21 or over living in households with at least 1 smoker were recruited to the study. A quota sampling strategy was used, according to age, gender, smoking status, family status, household composition, householder access to outdoor space, and change to work-life status. Most participants found lockdown increased the amount of time spent at home, where stresses associated with confinement, curtailment of social routines, removal of barriers and distractions to smoking due to home working, and feelings of boredom all contributed to increased smoking. Fewer factors were identified as reducing smoking during lockdown. Prominent examples included disruption to habitual smoking patterns and distraction from smoking associated with spending more time doing outdoor activities. Pressures placed on physical space and lack of privacy due to the confinement at home were responsible for displacement of smoking within the home, leading to breaking of smoke-free rules and family tensions, and in some cases to greater awareness amongst parents that their children smoked. Changes in daily routines associated with lockdown affected and displaced smoking behaviour both positively and negatively. Health improvement interventions could seek to harness positive changes in smoking associated with any future lockdown approaches. New home-working norms highlight the need for employers to support staff to reduce their smoking and to remain smoke-free.","O039,; Donnell, Rachel; Eadie, Douglas; Stead, Martine; Dobson, Ruaraidh; Semple, Sean",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),116,20

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. CASES: We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). DISCUSSION: The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","Beach, Scott R; Praschan, Nathan C; Hogan, Charlotte; Dotson, Samuel; Merideth, Flannery; Kontos, Nicholas; Fricchione, Gregory L; Smith, Felicia A",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,116,16

This study describes abortion centre staff's perceptions of the influence of protective measures on abortion consultations and procedures, and aims to identify obstacles and opportunities that arose from this situation. Through the anonymised patient records of one Flemish abortion centre, we compared the number of requests and abortions during the first lockdown (16 March-14 June 2020) with the same period in the five preceding years. Using a phenomenological approach, we documented the procedures and conducted interviews (all inductively coded in Nvivo) with the centre's coordinator, seven psychosocial staff members and three doctors. Though fewer people requested and had an abortion, the pressure on the staff was high due to changed procedures. A substantial change was the substitution of telephone for in-person consultations, which the staff perceived as less suited for discussing worries, contraception counselling, and building trust. The centre remained accessible, but the staff perceived an influence on the emotional reactions of clients. Staff agreed that the lockdown did not negatively influence the abortion procedure itself. However, they felt a negative influence on the level of psychological support they could offer, especially in interactions with clients who were less certain of their choice and clients with whom there was no common language. When the lockdown was relaxed, a triage system was set up to ensure emotionally safe abortion care - as perceived by staff - for all clients.","De Kort, Leen; Wouters, Edwin; Van de Velde, Sarah",Sex Reprod Health Matters,116,7

The extracellular region of ACE2 can be administered as a soluble decoy to compete for binding sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S, but it has only moderate affinity and efficacy. The RBD, which is targeted by neutralizing antibodies, may also change and adapt through mutation as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, posing challenges for therapeutic and vaccine development. Areas Covered Deep mutagenesis is a Big Data approach to characterizing sequence variants. A deep mutational scan of ACE2 expressed on human cells identified mutations that increase S affinity and guided the engineering of a potent and broad soluble receptor decoy. A deep mutational scan of the RBD displayed on the surface of yeast has revealed residues tolerant of mutational changes that may act as a source for drug resistance and antigenic drift. Expert Opinion Deep mutagenesis requires a selection of diverse sequence variants; an in vitro evolution experiment that is tracked with next-generation sequencing. The choice of expression system, diversity of the variant library and selection strategy have important consequences for data quality and interpretation.","Procko, Erik",Expert review of proteomics,116,20

The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis’ effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects’ COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Huete-Pérez, Jorge A.; Cabezas-Robelo, Cristiana; Páiz-Medina, Lucía; Hernández-Álvarez, Carlos A.; Quant-Durán, Carlos; McKerrow, James H.",PLoS One,116,16

We aimed to compare the diagnosis performance of FAPP with conventional testing in 100 intensive care unit (ICU) patients who required mechanical ventilation, with clinically suspected HAP. A total of 237 samples [76 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL(DS)) and 82 endotracheal aspirates (ETA(DS)) obtained at HAP diagnosis, and 79 ETA obtained during follow-up (ETA(TT))], were analyzed independently by routine microbiology testing and FAPP. 58 patients had paired BAL(DS) and ETA(DS). The positivity thresholds of semi-quantified bacteria were 10(3)–10(4) CFUs/mL or 10(4) copies/mL for BAL, and 10(5) CFUs/mL or copies/mL for ETA. Respiratory commensals (H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, S. pneumoniae) were the most common pathogens. Discordant results for bacterial identification were observed in 33/76 (43.4%) BAL(DS) and 36/82 (43.9%) ETA(DS), and in most cases, FAPP identified one supplemental bacteria (23/33 BAL(DS) and 21/36 ETA(DS)). An absence of growth, or polybacterial cultures, explained almost equally the majority of the non-detections in culture. No linear relationship was observed between bin and CFUs/mL variables. Concordant results between paired BAL(DS) and ETA(DS) were obtained in 46/58 (79.3%) patients with FAPP. One of the 17 resistance genes detected with FAPP (mecA/C and MREJ) was not confirmed by conventional testing. Overall, FAPP enhanced the positivity rate of diagnostic testing, with increased recognition of coinfections. Implementing this strategy may allow clinicians to make more timely and informed decisions.","Crémet, Lise; Gaborit, Benjamin; Bouras, Marwan; Drumel, Thomas; Guillotin, Florian; Poulain, Cécile; Persyn, Elise; Lakhal, Karim; Rozec, Bertrand; Vibet, Marie-Anne; Roquilly, Antoine; Gibaud, Sophie",Front Microbiol,116,32

Grounded in participant observations and supplemented by in-depth interviews capturing the social life history of 21 participants, this paper paints a detailed picture of the social networks and class practices of those experiencing persisting poverty in the examined town and surrounding region. In addition, we explore the relations between the rural context and lived experiences of class and poverty. Our findings highlight the complex experience as well as spatial embeddedness of persisting poverty. We find that, although the specific circumstances to which the participants are exposed vary greatly, the repercussions in terms of the characteristics of their social networks and practices are very similar. In general, the social networks of participants are fragmented and small, tightly knit, and characterized by clear power imbalances. The most formative experiences that result in the isolation of networks of poor are found to occur in the home and family situation during childhood years. We argue that poverty and the region's history are intricately interwoven resulting in a socio-spatial stigma which in turn contributes to the persistent and intergenerational character of poverty in the rural context of our study. Due to the long history of stigmatization, dismantling the socio-spatial stigma attached to the Groninger Veenkoloniën will presumably take multiple generations.","Meij, Erik; Haartsen, Tialda; Meijering, Louise",J Rural Stud,116,24

Due to differences in patient characteristics and symptoms in different regions, in this research, a comparative study was performed on COVID-19 patients in 6 provinces of Iran. Also, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and Logistic Regression (LR) models were applied for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1043 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection in Iran participated in this study. 29 characteristics, symptoms and underlying disease were obtained from hospitalized patients. Afterwards, we compared the obtained data between confirmed cases. Furthermore, the data was applied for building the ANN and LR models to diagnosis the infected patients by COVID-19. RESULTS: In 750 confirmed patients, Common symptoms were: fever (%) >37.5°C, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chills and headache. The most common underlying diseases were: hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary heart disease. Finally, the accuracy of the ANN model to the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was higher than the LR model. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalent symptoms and underlying diseases of COVID-19 patients were similar in different provinces, but the incidence of symptoms was significantly different from each other.

Because of failure in timely closing of borders of the affected region, COVID-19 spread across like a wildfire through air travel initiating a pandemic. It is a serious lower respiratory track viral infection caused by highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus including COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 causes zoonotic diseases and thought to be originated from bats. Since its first incidence, the virus has spread all across the world, causing serious human casualties, economic losses, and disrupting global supply chains. As with SARS-CoV, COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than SARS and MERS. This review focusses on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, especially on the dysfunctional immune responses following a cytokine storm in severely affected persons. The mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors present on the epithelial lining of lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and mucus membranes. Older persons with weaker immune system and associated co-morbidities are more vulnerable to have dysfunctional immune responses, as most of them concomitantly have severe hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, causing severe damage to key organs of the body including lungs and the cardiovascular system. Since, vast majority of persons enters to the intensive care units and died, had severe vitamin D deficiency, thus, this area must be investigated seriously. In addition, this article assesses the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article provides the urgency of needed evidences through large population based randomized controlled trials and ecological studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in COVID-19.","Kumar, Raman; Himani; Haq, Afrozul; Wimalawansa, Sunil J.; Sharma, Alpana",Virus Res,116,28

Thereafter the calves received one test meal of whole fresh cow's milk whose lactose had been hydrolysed by added lactase and one test meal of unprocessed cow's milk at an interval of 24 h in a cross‐over design trial. In comparison with unprocessed milk, the intake of milk containing hydrolysed lactose resulted in a slight decrease of mean breath hydrogen concentration (P = 0.18), but also a slight decrease of mean blood galactose concentration (P = 0.14). There was no treatment effect on mean plasma glucose concentration. Peak plasma glucose and blood galactose concentration tended to be delayed after the intake of lactose‐hydrolysed milk, which implies that gastric emptying was probably delayed. The results show that feeding milk which contains hydrolysed lactose does not significantly improve lactose utilization in calves that are suffering from benign infectious diarrhoea.","Gutzwiller, A.",J Vet Med A Physiol Pathol Clin Med,116,20

In particular, the sudden change from face-to-face (F2F) appointments to telephone consultations (TC) has adversely impacted upon the assessment and management of disease activity. Therefore, we established a dedicated urgent F2F rheumatology clinic to rapidly assess new or follow-up patients with symptoms that could not be managed remotely during the pandemic. Herein we present patient outcomes to inform future service planning in the context of the ongoing pandemic and continuing need for rationing of F2F services. Methods Patients requiring urgent F2F assessment between 22(nd) April and 28(th) July 2020 were evaluated. Referrals came from rheumatologists, rheumatology trainees, nurse specialists, general practitioners, and other medical teams. Prior to attendance, patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 by a clinician. Temperature monitoring was performed on the day of attendance. A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted in which we identified outcomes of all patients reviewed. Results A total of 201 patients were scheduled an appointment (10 did not attend). Mean age was 45.4±16.6 years of which 14% were ‘shielding’. In all, 85% of patients were referred following a previous TC in which assessment and/or treatment could not be done remotely. New referrals consisted primarily of possible new inflammatory arthritis (55%), new autoimmune rheumatic disease (6%) or polymyalgia rheumatica (4%) with 23% currently undergoing investigation to confirm diagnosis. All patients required physical examination and alteration in investigation and/or management. Of those who attended, blood tests (66%), radiographs (32%), MRI (14%), and ultrasound (8%) were the most common investigations requested. In total 14% were referred to another secondary care specialty, 14% to physiotherapy, and 13% for specialist nurse review. Regarding treatment, 25% required intra-articular joint injection (37 patients received a total of 45 joint injections on the day of the clinic with a further 10 patients referred for ultrasound-guided injection); 13% of patients received intramuscular steroids; and 16% were prescribed oral steroids. New disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy was initiated in 17% of cases with an additional 11% starting a new biologic agent. No patients had their treatment reduced or discontinued. We are not aware of any new cases of COVID-19 following attendance at this clinic. Conclusion This urgent clinical service was formed because virtual remote consultations alone were insufficient to address the clinical needs of our patients. We found this service to be safe and effective for assessment of patients, with escalation of treatment according to clinical need, in spite of the adverse impact of COVID-19 upon our services. However, for future service planning during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic this F2F service requires the availability and support of nursing, allied healthcare professionals, pharmacy and diagnostic services.

However, few studies have explored healthcare workers’ views about their use in febrile children. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of hospital-based doctors and nurses regarding the use of POCTs in England. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth interviews with purposively selected hospital doctors and nurses. Data were analysed thematically. SETTING: Two university teaching hospitals in London and Newcastle. PARTICIPANTS: 24 participants (paediatricians, emergency department doctors, trainee paediatricians and nurses). RESULTS: There were diverse views about the use of POCTs in febrile children. The reported advantages included their ease of use and the rapid availability of results. They were seen to contribute to faster clinical decision-making; the targeting of antibiotic use; improvements in patient care, flow and monitoring; cohorting (ie, the physical clustering of hospitalised patients with the same infection to limit spread) and enhancing communication with parents. These advantages were less evident when the turnaround for results of laboratory tests was 1–2 hours. Factors such as clinical experience and specialty, as well as the availability of guidelines recommending POCT use, were also perceived as influential. However, in addition to their perceived inaccuracy, participants were concerned about POCTs not resolving diagnostic uncertainty or altering clinical management, leading to a commonly expressed preference for relying on clinical skills rather than test results solely. CONCLUSION: In this study conducted at two university teaching hospitals in England, participants expressed mixed opinions about the utility of current POCTs in the management of febrile children. Understanding the current clinical decision-making process and the specific needs and preferences of clinicians in different settings will be critical in ensuring the optimal design and deployment of current and future tests.","Li, Edmond; Dewez, Juan Emmanuel; Luu, Queena; Emonts, Marieke; Maconochie, Ian; Nijman, Ruud; Yeung, Shunmay",BMJ Open,116,1

The issues of food safety and food poisoning are being increasingly emphasised, particularly in developed countries. Infection/contamination with many agents i.e., bacterial, parasitic and viral entities can result in foodborne illness. This article will focus mainly on viral agents of infection. A range of different viruses can cause food poisoning/foodborne infection, and infection can result in a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild, acute disease to chronic, debilitating disease and even death. Due to the inherent differences between bacteria and viruses, namely the fact that viruses do not replicate in food, while bacteria do, viruses are frequently difficult to detect. This is compounded by the fact that many of the viruses associated with enteric disease do not replicate in cell culture. These factors can lead to a lag between reporting, detection and analysis of foodborne viruses versus bacterial agents. Despite these constraints, it is now evident that there are both well-established and emerging viruses implicated in foodborne infections, and the role of molecular detection and characterisation is becoming increasingly important.","O’Shea, Helen; Blacklaws, Barbara A.; Collins, Patrick J.; McKillen, John; Fitzgerald, Rose",Reference Module in Life Sciences,116,22

It is reported that SARS‐CoV2 seems to have relatively low pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than previously outbroke SARS‐CoV. To explore the reason of increased transmissibility of SARS‐CoV2 compared to SARS‐CoV, we have performed a comparative analysis on the structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, Nucleoprotein) of two viruses. Our analysis revealed that extensive substitutions of hydrophobic to polar and charged amino acids in spike glycoproteins of SARS‐CoV2 creates an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)at the beginning of membrane‐fusion subunit and intrinsically disordered residues in fusion peptide. IDR provides potential site for proteolysis by furin and enriched disordered residues facilitate prompt fusion of the SARS‐CoV2 with host membrane by recruiting Molecular Recognition features. Here, we have hypothesized that mutation driven accumulation of intrinsically disordered residues in spike glycoproteins play dual role in enhancing viral transmissibility than previous SARS‐corona virus.

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a valuable target of antivirals. However, the cell-free SARS-CoV-2 RdRp biochemical assay requires the conversion of nucleotide prodrugs into the active triphosphate forms, which regularly occurs in cells yet is a complicated multiple-step chemical process in vitro, and thus hinders the utility of this cell-free assay in the rapid discovery of RdRp inhibitors. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 exoribonuclease provides the proof-reading capacity to viral RdRp, thus creates relatively high resistance threshold of viral RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors, which must be examined and evaluated in the development of this class of antivirals. Here, we report a cell-based assay to evaluate the efficacy of nucleotide analog compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their tolerance to viral exoribonuclease-mediated proof-reading. By testing seven commonly used nucleotide analog viral polymerase inhibitors, Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, Penciclovir, Entecavir and Tenofovir, we found that both Molnupiravir and Remdesivir showed the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with EC50 value of 0.22 μM and 0.67 μM, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that exoribonuclease nsp14 increases resistance of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to nucleotide analog inhibitors. We also determined that Remdesivir presented the highest resistance to viral exoribonuclease activity in cells. Therefore, we have developed a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which can be deployed to discover SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors that are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Jianyuan; Guo, SaiSai; Yi, Dongrong; Li, Quanjie; Ma, Ling; Zhang, Yongxin; Wang, Jing; Li, Xiaoyu; Guo, Fei; Lin, Rongtuan; Liang, Chen; Liu, Zhenlong; Cen, Shan",Antiviral Res,116,30

In the present study, we aimed to perform a comparative evaluation of the conditions of cancer patients before and during the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to detect the impact of the pandemic on treatment delays that are associated with anxiety and depression in cancer patients. In addition, the effect of public transport use on treatment delays was examined. METHODS: BDI and BAI were administered to 595 breast, ovarian, colon and gastric cancer patients before and during the pandemic. The questionnaires were administered by the physician blindly, who was unaware of the delay of the patients. The number of days by which the patients delayed their treatment due to the fear of contamination were recorded retrospectively. Correlation analyses were performed between the obtained scores and treatment delays. RESULTS: The depression and anxiety levels in cancer patients were found to increase during the pandemic (p = 0.000), and this increase was positively correlated with the disruption of their treatment (p = 0.000, r = 0.81). Depression and anxiety levels and treatment delays were higher in elderly patients (p = 0.021). Depression and anxiety were more pronounced in female patients (p = 0.000). Moreover, treatment delays were more common in patients who had to use public transportation (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may increase anxiety and depression in cancer patients. This can cause patients to experience treatment delays due to concerns about becoming infected. At this point, if necessary, assistance should be obtained from psychiatric and public health experts.

Effective caregiver involvement in cancer care can improve both patient and caregiver outcomes. Despite this, interventions improving the caregiver involvement are sparse. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial evaluating the combined effectiveness of novel online caregiver communication education modules for: (1) oncology clinicians (eTRIO) and (2) patients with cancer and caregivers (eTRIO-pc). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Thirty medical/radiation/surgical oncology or haematology doctors and nurses will be randomly allocated to either intervention (eTRIO) or control (an Australian State Government Health website on caregivers) education conditions. Following completion of education, each clinician will recruit nine patient–caregiver pairs, who will be allocated to the same condition as their recruiting clinician. Eligibility includes any new adult patient diagnosed with any type/stage cancer attending consultations with a caregiver. Approximately 270 patient–caregiver pairs will be recruited. The primary outcome is caregiver self-efficacy in triadic (clinician–patient–caregiver) communication. Patient and clinician self-efficacy in triadic communication are secondary outcomes. Additional secondary outcomes for clinicians include preferences for caregiver involvement, perceived module usability/acceptability, analysis of module use, satisfaction with the module, knowledge of strategies and feedback interviews. Secondary outcomes for caregivers and patients include preferences for caregiver involvement, satisfaction with clinician communication, distress, quality of life, healthcare expenditure, perceived module usability/acceptability and analysis of module use. A subset of patients and caregivers will complete feedback interviews. Secondary outcomes for caregivers include preparedness for caregiving, patient–caregiver communication and caring experience. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and 1 week, 12 weeks and 26 weeks post-intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been received by the Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (REGIS project ID number: 2019/PID09787), with site-specific approval from each recruitment site. Protocol V.7 (dated 1 September 2020) is currently approved and reported in this manuscript. Findings will be disseminated via presentations and peer-reviewed publications. Engagement with clinicians, media, government, consumers and peak cancer groups will facilitate widespread dissemination and long-term availability of the educational modules.

In this study, we introduce a deterministic SEIR model considering the behavior-changed susceptible group to investigate the effect of the speed and intensity of behavioral change on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We used epidemiological data from South Korea and Italy for the simulation study, because South Korea and Italy were the first countries to report an outbreak of COVID-19 after China and the prevention and response policy of each government were similar during the first outbreak of COVID-19. Simulation results showed that it took approximately twenty fewer days in Korea than in Italy until 90% of susceptible individuals changed their behavior during the first outbreak. It was observed that the behavior-changed susceptible individuals reduced the COVID-19 transmission rate by up to 93% in Korea and 77% in Italy. Furthermore, if the intensity and speed of behavioral change in Italy were the same as in Korea, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been reduced by approximately 95%, from 210,700 to 10,700, until the end of the lockdown period. We assumed that behavioral change is influenced by the number of confirmed cases and does not take into account social and cultural differences, as well as the state of the healthcare system, between the two countries. Our mathematical modeling showed how important the high intensity and fast speed of behavioral change to reduce the number of confirmed cases in the early period of an epidemic are.","Lee, Jongmin; Lee, Seok-Min; Jung, Eunok",Int J Environ Res Public Health,116,16

This study aimed to evaluate and interpret Google search queries for terms related to the Ebola outbreak both at the global level and in all countries where primary cases of Ebola occurred. The study also endeavoured to look at the correlation between the number of overall and weekly web searches and the number of overall and weekly new cases of Ebola. METHODS: Google Trends (GT) was used to explore Internet activity related to Ebola. The study period was from 29 December 2013 to 14 June 2015. Pearson’s correlation was performed to correlate Ebola-related relative search volumes (RSVs) with the number of weekly and overall Ebola cases. Multivariate regression was performed using Ebola-related RSV as a dependent variable, and the overall number of Ebola cases and the Human Development Index were used as predictor variables. RESULTS: The greatest RSV was registered in the three West African countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic. The queries varied in the different countries. Both quantitative and qualitative differences between the affected African countries and other Western countries with primary cases were noted, in relation to the different flux volumes and different time courses. In the affected African countries, web query search volumes were mostly concentrated in the capital areas. However, in Western countries, web queries were uniformly distributed over the national territory. In terms of the three countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between the number of new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly GT index varied from weak to moderate. The correlation between the number of Ebola cases registered in all countries during the study period and the GT index was very high. CONCLUSION: Google Trends showed a coarse-grained nature, strongly correlating with global epidemiological data, but was weaker at country level, as it was prone to distortions induced by unbalanced media coverage and the digital divide. Global and local health agencies could usefully exploit GT data to identify disease-related information needs and plan proper communication strategies, particularly in the case of health-threatening events.

Thus, preparing ICUs is a prominent part of any pandemic response. The objective of this study is to examine the efficiencies of ICU services in Turkey right before the pandemic. Data were gathered from the Public Hospital Statistical Year Book for the year 2017. Analysis are presented at hospital level by comparing teaching and non-teaching hospitals. Bootstrapped data envelopment analysis procedure was used to gather more precise efficiency scores. Three analysis levels are incorporated into the study such as, all public hospitals (N = 100), teaching (N = 53), non-teaching hospitals (N = 47), and provinces that are providing high density of ICU services through the country (N = 54). Study results reveal that average efficiency scores of ICU services obtained from teaching hospitals (eff = 0.65) is higher than non-teaching (eff = 0.54) hospitals. After applying the bootstrapping techniques, efficiency scores are significantly improved and the difference between before and after bootstrapping results are statistically significant (P < .05). Province based analysis indicates that, ICU services efficiencies are high for provinces located in southeast part of the country and highly populated places, such as İstanbul. Evidence-based operational design that considers the spatial distribution of health resources and effective planning of critical care professionals are critical for efficient management of intensive care. Study results will be helpful for health policy makers to deeply understand dynamics of critical care.","Cinaroglu, Songul",Health Serv Insights,116,13

Our study aimed to evaluate the use of VC in this setting. METHODS: An 18-point questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC. Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using SPSS®. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63% response rate). Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n = 58/100, 58%; no answer provided (NAP), n = 4) equally satisfied or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual clinic encounter. The majority of patients felt that there should be a role for VC in the future (n = 84/102, 82%; NAP, n = 2). The majority of patients (n = 61/99, 61%; NAP, n = 5) were very relieved to avoid a hospital visit due to perceived risk of potential exposure to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of oncology patients were satisfied with a VC encounter. VC may have a role in the future of medical care in Ireland post the COVID-19 pandemic.","O’Reilly, David; Carroll, Hailey; Lucas, Mairi; Sui, Jane; Al Sendi, Maha; McMahon, David; Darwish, Waseem; McLaughlin, Ronan; Khan, Mohammed Raza; Sullivan, Hazel O; Chew, Sonya; Dennehy, Colum; Kelly, Catherine M.; McCaffrey, John; Greally, Megan; Carney, Desmond; Higgins, Michaela J.",Ir J Med Sci,116,3

We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled study to evaluate the optimal dose of nab-PTX. METHODS: We compared three different doses of q3w nab-PTX (Standard: 260 mg/m(2) [SD260] vs Medium: 220 mg/m(2) [MD220] vs Low: 180 mg/m(2) [LD180]) in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Grade 3/4 neuropathy rates in the three doses were estimated using the logistic regression model. The optimal dose was selected in two steps. Initially, if the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was <0.75 or >1.33, the inferior dose was excluded, and we proceeded with the non-inferior dose. Then, if the estimated incidence rate of grade 3/4 neurotoxicity exceeded 10%, that dose was also excluded. RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients were randomly assigned to SD260 (n = 47), MD220 (n = 46), and LD180 (n = 48) groups, and their median PFS was 6.66, 7.34, and 6.82 months, respectively. The HRs were 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42–1.28) in MD220 vs SD260, 0.77 (95% CI 0.47–1.28) in LD180 vs SD260, and 0.96 (95% CI 0.56–1.66) in LD180 vs MD220. SD260 was inferior to MD220 and was excluded. The estimated incidence rate of grade 3/4 neurotoxicity was 29.5% in SD260, 14.0% in MD220, and 5.9% in LD180. The final selected dose was LD180.

Evidence of immune involvement point to the participation of T, B, and NK cells in the lack of control of virus replication leading to COVID-19. NK cells contribute to early phases of virus control and to the regulation of adaptive responses. The precise mechanism of NK cell dysregulation is poorly understood, with little information on tissue margination or turnover. We investigated these aspects by multiparameter flow cytometry in a cohort of 28 patients hospitalized with early COVID-19. Relevant decreases in CD56(bright)CD16+/- NK subsets were detected, with a shift of circulating NK cells toward more mature CD56(dim)CD16+KIR+NKG2A+ and “memory” KIR+CD57+CD85j+ cells with increased inhibitory NKG2A and KIR molecules. Impaired cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production were associated with conserved expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors and perforin. Moreover, intense NK cell activation with increased HLA-DR and CD69 expression was associated with the circulation of CD69+CD103+ CXCR6+ tissue-resident NK cells and of CD34+DNAM-1(bright)CXCR4+ inflammatory precursors to mature functional NK cells. Severe disease trajectories were directly associated with the proportion of CD34+DNAM-1(bright)CXCR4+ precursors and inversely associated with the proportion of NKG2D+ and of CD103+ NK cells. Intense NK cell activation and trafficking to and from tissues occurs early in COVID-19, and is associated with subsequent disease progression, providing an insight into the mechanism of clinical deterioration. Strategies to positively manipulate tissue-resident NK cell responses may provide advantages to future therapeutic and vaccine approaches.","Bozzano, Federica; Dentone, Chiara; Perrone, Carola; Di Biagio, Antonio; Fenoglio, Daniela; Parodi, Alessia; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Bruzzone, Bianca; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Vena, Antonio; Taramasso, Lucia; Nicolini, Laura; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pelosi, Paolo; Gratarola, Angelo; De Palma, Raffaele; Filaci, Gilberto; Bassetti, Matteo; De Maria, Andrea",PLoS Pathog,116,1

In this comprehensive review, we discuss the potential protective effects of (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major constituent of green tea, against COVID-19. SCOPE AND APPROACH: Information from literature of clinical symptoms and molecular pathology of COVID-19 as well as relevant publications in which EGCG shows potential protective activities against COVID-19 is integrated and evaluated. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: EGCG, via activating Nrf2, can suppress ACE2 (a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, which mediate cell entry of the virus. Through inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, EGCG may inhibit viral reproduction. EGCG via its broad antioxidant activity may protect against SARS-CoV-2 evoked mitochondrial ROS (which promote SARS-CoV-2 replication) and against ROS burst inflicted by neutrophil extracellular traps. By suppressing ER-resident GRP78 activity and expression, EGCG can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. EGCG also shows protective effects against 1) cytokine storm-associated acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, 2) thrombosis via suppressing tissue factors and activating platelets, 3) sepsis by inactivating redox-sensitive HMGB1, and 4) lung fibrosis through augmenting Nrf2 and suppressing NF-κB. These activities remain to be further substantiated in animals and humans. The possible concerted actions of EGCG suggest the importance of further studies on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in humans. These results also call for epidemiological studies on potential preventive effects of green tea drinking on COVID-19.","Zhang, Zhichao; Zhang, Xiangchun; Bi, Keyi; He, Yufeng; Yan, Wangjun; Yang, Chung S.; Zhang, Jinsong",Trends Food Sci Technol,116,14

Despite high infectivity of the virus and lack of long-term immunity, volunteer and authentic studies has suggested the existence of inherited protective factors. Recent studies have shown that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and in particular secretor status controlled by the α1,2fucosyltransferase FUT2 gene determine susceptibility to norovirus infections, with nonsecretors (FUT2−/−), representing 20% of Europeans, being highly resistant to symptomatic infections with major strains of norovirus. Moreover, the capsid protein from distinct strains shows different HBGA specificities, suggesting a host–pathogen co-evolution driven by carbohydrate–protein interactions.","Le Pendu, Jacques; Ruvoën-Clouet, Nathalie; Kindberg, Elin; Svensson, Lennart",Semin Immunol,116,1

As these mitigation strategies may be necessary for the next 6-18 months to prevent recurrent peaks in disease prevalence, fewer objective measurements of lung function will alter the diagnosis and care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. PFTs, which include spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity measurement, are essential to the diagnosis and management of patients with asthma, COPD, and other chronic lung conditions. Both traditional and innovative alternatives to conventional testing must now be explored. These may include peak expiratory flow devices, electronic portable spirometers, portable exhaled nitric oxide measurement, airwave oscillometry devices, as well as novel digital health tools such as smartphone microphone spirometers, and mobile health technologies along integration of machine learning approaches. The adoption of some novel approaches may not merely replace but could improve existing management strategies and alter common diagnostic paradigms. With these options come important technical, privacy, ethical, financial, and medicolegal barriers that must be addressed. However, the COVID-19 pandemic also presents a unique opportunity to augment conventional testing by including innovative and emerging approaches to measuring lung function remotely in patients with respiratory disease. The benefits of such an approach have the potential to enhance respiratory care and empower patient self-management well beyond the current global pandemic.","Kouri, Andrew; Gupta, Samir; Yadollahi, Azadeh; Ryan, Clodagh M.; Gershon, Andrea S.; To, Teresa; Tarlo, Susan M.; Goldstein, Roger S.; Chapman, Kenneth R.; Chow, Chung-Wai",Chest,116,32

We aimed to explore the differences between English language and Chinese language Medical/Scientific journals publications, particularly aiming to explore the efficacy/contents of the literature published in English and Chinese in relation to the outcomes of management and characterization of COVID-19 during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Publications on COVID-19 research were retrieved from both English and Chinese databases. Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer 1.6.14, and CiteSpace V software. Network maps were generated to evaluate the collaborations between different authors, countries/provinces, and institutions. Results: A total of 143 English and 721 Chinese original research articles and reviews on COVID-19 were included in our study. Most of the authors and institutions of the papers were from China before March 1st, 2020, however, the distribution of authors and institutions were mainly in developed countries or more wealthy areas of China. The range of the keywords in English publications was more extensive than those in Chinese. Traditional Chinese Medicine was seen more frequently in Chinese papers than in English. Of the 143 articles published in English, 54 articles were published by Chinese authors only and 21 articles were published jointly by Chinese and other overseas authors. Conclusions: The publications in English have enabled medical practitioners and scientists to share/exchange information, while on the other hand, the publications in the Chinese language have provided complementary educational approaches for the local medical practitioners to understand the essential and key information to manage COVID-19 in the relatively remote regions of China, for the general population with a general level of education.","Fan, Jingchun; Gao, Ya; Zhao, Na; Dai, Runjing; Zhang, Hailiang; Feng, Xiaoyan; Shi, Guoxiu; Tian, Jinhui; Chen, Che; Hambly, Brett D.; Bao, Shisan",Front Public Health,116,1

Hypothesis: HBS is more advantageous than hypertonic saline in the treatment of calves with severe metabolic acidosis. Animals: Twenty‐eight dehydrated, inappetent calves with neonatal diarrhea. Methods: In 2 consecutive clinical studies, calves were initially treated with saline (5.85%; 5 mL/kg body weight [BW] over 4 minutes; study I: N = 16) or bicarbonate solution (8.4%; 10 mL/kg BW over 8 minutes; study II: N = 12), respectively, followed by oral administration of 3 L isotonic electrolyte solution 5 minutes after injection. Clinical and laboratory variables were monitored for 72 hours. Results: Treatment failed in 6 calves of study I and in 1 calf of study II as indicated by a deterioration of the general condition. All treatment failures had more severe metabolic acidosis compared with successfully treated calves before treatment. In the latter, rehydration was completed within 18 hours after injection; metabolic acidosis was corrected within 24 hours (study I) and 6 hours (study II) after injection. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Diarrheic calves with slight metabolic acidosis (base excess [BE] >−10 mM) can be treated successfully with hypertonic saline. HBS is appropriate in calves without respiratory problems with more severe metabolic acidosis (BE up to −20 mM). Intensive care of the calves is required to ensure a sufficient oral fluid intake after the initial IV treatment.","Koch, A.; Kaske, M.",J Vet Intern Med,116,21

Background: There have been growing concerns about the speed and rigor of the review process for COVID-related articles by journals. Methods: Using Dimensions, an online searchable platform, we identified PubMed-indexed journals that published >50 COVID-related articles (regardless of article type) between 1/1/2020 and 5/16/2020 and had available data on the date of article receipt. For the control group, we included consecutive full-length original investigations with available receipt date (regardless of topic) published in these journals starting from 3/1/2019 until a 1:2 ratio of COVID to non-COVID-related articles per journal was achieved. Results: The final number included 294 COVID-related full-length original investigations with available article receipt dates published in 16 journals with corresponding 588 control articles from the same journals.

METHODS: This was a retrospective matched cohort study. People with HIV were identified by reviewing clinical records and laboratory registries of 10 922 patients in active‐follow‐up within the Spanish HIV Research Network (CoRIS) up to 30 June 2020. Each hospitalized PWH was matched with five non‐PWH of the same age and sex randomly selected from COVID‐19@Spain, a multicentre cohort of 4035 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID‐19. The main outcome was all‐cause in‐hospital mortality. RESULTS: Forty‐five PWH with PCR‐confirmed COVID‐19 were identified in CoRIS, 21 of whom were hospitalized. A total of 105 age/sex‐matched controls were selected from the COVID‐19@Spain cohort. The median age in both groups was 53 (Q1–Q3, 46–56) years, and 90.5% were men. In PWH, 19.1% were injecting drug users, 95.2% were on antiretroviral therapy, 94.4% had HIV‐RNA < 50 copies/mL, and the median (Q1–Q3) CD4 count was 595 (349–798) cells/μL.

This study, hence, is intended to identify the best GIS-based model that can explore, quantify, and model the determinants of COVID-19 incidence and fatality. For this purpose, geospatial models were developed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates in Africa, up to 16th of August 2020 at the national level. The models involved Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis using ArcGIS. Spatial autocorrelation analysis recorded a positive spatial autocorrelation in COVID-19 incidence (Moran index 0.16, P = 0.1) and fatality (Moran index 0.26, P = 0.01) rates within different African countries. GWR model had higher R(2) than OLS for prediction of incidence and mortality (58% vs 45% and 55% vs 53%).

ED management is largely empiric, often occurring without reliable diagnostics needed for targeted therapies, safe outpatient discharge, or hospital admissions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the influenza diagnosis on physician decision making during ED visits using the Cobas Liat(®) influenza A + B assay. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study assessing the impact of rapid (<30 min), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) influenza testing on physician decision making in the ED. Physician responses established pre-and post-diagnosis management courses which required confirmation via secondary documentation in the medical record. Changes in physician decision making were analyzed across four clinical touchpoints: (i) admission/discharge status, (ii) medical procedures, (iii) antiviral and antibiotic prescribing, and (iv) laboratory studies. RESULTS: An influenza diagnosis changed patient management courses, relative to empiric, pre-diagnosis plans, in in 61% of the cases resulting in cost savings of $49,420-to-$42,270 over 143 patients and 104 days during influenza season resulting in a cost savings of $200.40/ED visit. Evaluation over 2000 ED patient visits projects cost savings > $578,000 due to deferred admissions, and reduction in antiviral prescribing. Sensitivity of ED-based influenza testing using the Cobas Liat(®) assay was equivalent to centralized lab testing at 98.8% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity respectively. CONCLUSION: Providing rapid, RT-PCR influenza testing to ED settings is actionable and used to guide patient care decisions. Understanding the cascade of events linked to the influenza diagnosis in the ED provides overall cost savings which offset the cost of providing ED-based testing.","Hansen, Glen T.; Moore, Johanna; Herding, Emily; Gooch, Tami; Hirigoyen, Diane; Hanson, Kevan; Deike, Marcia",J Clin Virol,116,1

This has led many to wonder, how are individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and especially those with contamination fears, doing in the era of COVID-19? We present data from eight patients in our residential treatment program for OCD who were admitted prior to any COVID-19 restrictions and continued in treatment at the facility during the pandemic. Much like the general population, our patients varied in the ways they were impacted by COVID-19, yet the majority experienced improvements in OCD symptoms despite the context. This is not to downplay the many ways in which our patients were personally affected by COVID-19. Rather our patients’ relatively resilient responses mirror our program’s treatment model, which emphasizes exposure and response prevention (ERP) within the complementary framework of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The intention of this article is to challenge the notion that by definition this population will fare worse than the general public or that ERP cannot proceed effectively during this time. In contrast, we underscore that effective OCD treatment can and should continue in the era of COVID-19.","Kuckertz, Jennie M.; Van Kirk, Nathaniel; Alperovitz, David; Nota, Jacob A.; Falkenstein, Martha J.; Schreck, Meghan; Krompinger, Jason W.",Front Psychol,116,1

Although these statistical potentials are not to be confused with their physics-based counterparts of the same name—i.e. PMFs obtained by molecular dynamics simulations—their particular success in assessing the native-like character of protein structure predictions has lead authors to consider the computed scores as approximations of the free energy. However, this physical justification is a matter of controversy since the beginning. Alternative interpretations based on Bayes’ theorem have been proposed, but the misleading formalism that invokes the inverse Boltzmann law remains recurrent in the literature. In this article, we present a conceptually new method for ranking protein structure models by quality, which is (i) independent of any physics-based explanation and (ii) relevant to statistics and to a general definition of information gain. The theoretical development described in this study provides new insights into how statistical PMFs work, in comparison with our approach. To prove the concept, we have built interatomic distance-dependent scoring functions, based on the former and new equations, and compared their performance on an independent benchmark of 60,000 protein structures. The results demonstrate that our new formalism outperforms statistical PMFs in evaluating the quality of protein structural decoys. Therefore, this original type of score offers a possibility to improve the success of statistical PMFs in the various fields of structural biology where they are applied.

METHODS: All obese inpatients recorded during a hospital stay by the French National Health Insurance were included, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery comprised the BS group and patients with obesity but no history of BS served as controls. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death and the secondary outcome was the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: 4,248,253 obese individuals aged 15–75 years were included and followed for a mean observation time of 5.43 ± 2.93 years. 8286 individuals with a previous diagnosis of obesity were admitted for COVID-19 between January 1 and May 15, 2020. Of these patients, 541 had a history of BS and 7745 did not. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation and death occurred in 7% and 3.5% of the BS group versus 15% and 14.2% of the control group, respectively. In logistic regression, the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, and hypertension, and mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of heart failure, cancer, and diabetes, whereas BS had an independent protective effect. Two random exact matching tests confirmed the protective effect of BS. CONCLUSION: This nationwide study showed that BS is independently associated with a reduced risk of death and invasive mechanical ventilation in obese individuals with COVID-19.","Iannelli, Antonio; Bouam, Samir; Schneck, Anne-Sophie; Frey, Sébastien; Zarca, Kevin; Gugenheim, Jean; Alifano, Marco",Obes Surg,116,1

The present study investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MATERIAL/METHODS: This study enrolled 336 consecutive patients with confirmed severe COVID-19, including 28 diagnosed with COPD, from January 20, 2020, to April 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, and clinical results were measured and compared in survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Patients with severe COVID-19 and COPD were older than those without COPD. The proportions of men, of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and of those requiring invasive ventilation were significantly higher in patients with than without COPD. Leukocyte and neutrophil counts, as well as the concentrations of NT-proBNP, hemoglobin, D-dimer, hsCRP, ferritin, IL-2R, TNF-α and procalcitonin were higher, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte counts were lower, in patients with than without COPD. Of the 28 patients with COPD, 22 (78.6%) died, a rate significantly higher than in patients without COPD (36.0%). A comparison of surviving and non-surviving patients with severe COVID-19 and COPD showed that those who died had a longer history of COPD, more fatigue, and a higher ICU occupancy rate, but a shorter average hospital stay, than those who survived. CONCLUSIONS: COPD increases the risks of death and negative outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.","He, Yuanzhou; Xie, Min; Zhao, Jianping; Liu, Xiansheng",Med Sci Monit,116,30

Various smart community studies and practices have been conducted, especially in China thanks to the government’s support. However, most intelligent systems are designed and built individually by different manufacturers in diverging platforms with different functionalities. Therefore, multiple individual systems must be deployed in a smart community to have a set of functions, which could lead to hardware waste, high energy consumption and high deployment cost. More importantly, current smart community systems mainly focus on the technologies involved, while the effects of human activity are neglected. In this paper, a fourth-order tensor model representing object, time, location and human activity is proposed for human-centered smart communities, based on which a unified smart community system is designed. Thanks to the powerful data management abilities of a high-order tensor, multiple functions can be integrated into our system. In addition, since the tensor model embeds human activity information, complex functions could be implemented by exploring the effects of human activity. Two exemplary applications are presented to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed unified fourth-order tensor-based smart community system.","Liu, Chang; Wu, Huaiyu; Wang, Junyuan; Wang, Mingkai",Sensors (Basel),116,11

This study aimed to (1) explore whether school start and end times and screen time influenced sleep disturbances in adolescents during the lockdown in China and (2) investigate if sleep disturbances at night and sleep-related impairment (daytime fatigue) influenced adolescents' academic performance and anxiety levels. Methods: Ninety-nine adolescents aged 15–17 years old were recruited from two public schools in Baishan City Jilin Province, China. An online questionnaire was distributed including questions on adolescents' demographics, screen time habits, academic performance, anxiety level, sleep disturbances, and sleep-related impairment. Results: Adolescents who started school earlier and ended school later had a greater severity of sleep disturbances and sleep-related impairment compared with students who started school later and finished earlier. Adolescents who engaged in screen time at bedtime were more likely to have a greater severity of sleep-related impairment than students who reported no screen time use at bedtime. Adolescents who had a greater severity of sleep disturbances had higher anxiety and higher academic achievements than adolescents with less sleep disturbances. Finally, 79.7% of adolescents reported their total sleep duration as <8 h. Conclusions: Adolescents are experiencing sleep disturbances to manage academic demands during COVID-19, which in turn is having a wider impact on their mental health. Many schools internationally have continued to provide online education to students, longitudinal studies on how COVID-19 has influenced adolescents sleep and mental health would be beneficial in understanding the impact of the pandemic.","Zhang, Xiaoning; Dimitriou, Dagmara; Halstead, Elizabeth J.",Front Psychol,116,1

Nowadays, different expression systems are used for the production of recombinant proteins including bacteria, yeasts, molds, mammals, plants, and insects. Yeast expression systems such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) and Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) are more popular. P. pastoris expression system is one of the most popular and standard tools for the production of recombinant protein in molecular biology. Overall, the benefits of protein production by P. pastoris system include appropriate folding (in the endoplasmic reticulum) and secretion (by Kex2 as signal peptidase) of recombinant proteins to the external environment of the cell. Moreover, in the P. pastoris expression system due to its limited production of endogenous secretory proteins, the purification of recombinant protein is easy. It is also considered a unique host for the expression of subunit vaccines which could significantly affect the growing market of medical biotechnology. Although P. pastoris expression systems are impressive and easy to use with well‐defined process protocols, some degree of process optimization is required to achieve maximum production of the target proteins. Methanol and sorbitol concentration, Mut forms, temperature and incubation time have to be adjusted to obtain optimal conditions, which might vary among different strains and externally expressed protein. Eventually, optimal conditions for the production of a recombinant protein in P. pastoris expression system differ according to the target protein.","Karbalaei, Mohsen; Rezaee, Seyed A.; Farsiani, Hadi",J Cell Physiol,116,1

Promoting decarbonisation in this sector will necessarily require the identification, development, and diffusion of breakthrough technologies for I&S production. This paper uses an approach inspired by the Technology Innovation System (TIS) to analyse the development of technology in the EU I&S industry and identify potential avenues of its decarbonisation. We have described key elements of the TIS, analyse the functioning of these elements and their interactions in a more general context of innovation dynamics and policy design; The focus has been put on the role of actors and the identification of the main specific blocking and inducement mechanism in the TIS to better explain its functioning. Risks and uncertainties have also been discussed. We argue that deep decarbonisation in the I&S industry is feasible but its TIS requires firm support, mostly political, to finance intensive R&D and reduce the business risk. To this end, all actors shall support more effectively the invention and implementation of new radical production technologies.

We describe here a novel flavivirus inhibition mechanism that results in interferon-mediated obstruction of tick-borne encephalitis virus particle assembly and involves release of malfunctioning membrane-associated capsid (C) particles. This mechanism is controlled by the activity of the interferon-induced protein viperin, a broad-spectrum antiviral interferon-stimulated gene. Through analysis of the viperin-interactome, we identified the Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) as the cellular protein targeted by viperin. Viperin-induced antiviral activity, as well as C-particle release, was stimulated by GBF1 inhibition and knockdown and reduced by elevated levels of GBF1. Our results suggest that viperin targets flavivirus virulence by inducing the secretion of unproductive noninfectious virus particles via a GBF1-dependent mechanism. This as-yet-undescribed antiviral mechanism allows potential therapeutic intervention. IMPORTANCE The interferon response can target viral infection on almost every level; however, very little is known about the interference of flavivirus assembly. We show here that interferon, through the action of viperin, can disturb the assembly of tick-borne encephalitis virus. The viperin protein is highly induced after viral infection and exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, the mechanism of action is still elusive and appears to vary between the different viruses, indicating that cellular targets utilized by several viruses might be involved. In this study, we show that viperin induces capsid particle release by interacting and inhibiting the function of the cellular protein Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1). GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and is essential in the life cycle of many viruses, also targeted by viperin, implicating GBF1 as a novel putative drug target.","Vonderstein, Kirstin; Nilsson, Emma; Hubel, Philipp; Nygård Skalman, Larsård; Upadhyay, Arunkumar; Pasto, Jenny; Pichlmair, Andreas; Lundmark, Richard; Överby, Anna K.",J Virol,116,20

Earlier discrimination of potentially severe patients basing on routine clinical and laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not only save lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelming healthcare burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features were collected from 125 COVID-19 patients who were classified into mild (93 cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3–7 days post-admission. The subsequent analysis with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups but that only comorbidity with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10 mg/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250 U/L) were independently associated with the later disease development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia individually, though a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC = 0.944, sensitivity = 0.941, and specificity = 0.902). A combination consisting of three or four factors could further increase the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission independently predicted the severe illness occurrence. In conclusion, a combination of general clinical characteristics and laboratory tests could provide a highly confident prognostic value for identifying potentially severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.","Huang, Huang; Cai, Shuijiang; Li, Yueping; Li, Youxia; Fan, Yinqiang; Li, Linghua; Lei, Chunliang; Tang, Xiaoping; Hu, Fengyu; Li, Feng; Deng, Xilong",Front Med (Lausanne),116,31

Methods: We conducted a survey to estimate SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seroprevalence among adult residents of capital city of Tbilisi (adult population: 859,328). Participants were recruited through respondent driven sampling during May 18-27, 2020. Blood specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using commercially available lateral flow immunoassay (COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech). Crude seroprevalence was weighted by population characteristics (age, sex, district of Tbilisi) and further adjusted for test accuracy. Results: Among 1,068 adults recruited 963 (90.2%) were between 18 and 64 years-old, 682 (63.9%) women. 176 (16.5%) reported symptoms indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring in previous three months. Nine persons tested positive for IgG: crude seroprevalence: 0.84%, (95% CI: 0.33%-1.59%), weighted seroprevalence: 0.94% (95% CI: 0.37%-1.95%), weighted and adjusted for test accuracy: 1.02% (95% CI: 0.38%-2.18%). The seroprevalence estimates translate into 7,200 to 8,800 infections among adult residents of Tbilisi, which is at least 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions: Low seroprevalence confirms that Georgia successfully contained spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of pandemic. Findings also suggest that undocumented cases due to asymptomatic or very mild disease account for majority of infections. Given that asymptomatic persons can potentially spread the virus, test and isolate approach should be further expanded to control the epidemic.","Tsertsvadze, T.; Gatserelia, L.; Mirziashvili, M.; Dvali, N.; Abutidze, A.; Metchurtchlishvili, R.; del Rio, C.; Chkhartishvili, N.",,116,18

The Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire (RCSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess sleep quality. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records and compared between the good-sleep group and poor-sleep group. In all, 135 patients (60 in good-sleep group and 75 in poor-sleep group) were included in this study. There were no significant between-group differences regarding demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as laboratory parameters upon admission and in-hospital treatment. Compared with patients in the good-sleep group, patients in the poor-sleep group had lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (day 14: median, 1.10 vs 1.32, P = 0.0055; day 21: median, 1.18 vs 1.48, P = 0.0034) and its reduced recovery rate (day 14: median, 56.91 vs 69.40, P = 0.0255; day 21: median, 61.40 vs 111.47, P = 0.0003), as well as increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; day 14: median, 3.17 vs 2.44, P = 0.0284; day 21: median, 2.73 vs 2.23, P = 0.0092) and its associated deterioration rate (day 14: median, -39.65 vs -61.09, P = 0.0155; day 21: median, -51.40% vs -75.43, P = 0.0003). Nine [12.0%] patients in the poor-sleep group required ICU care (P = 0.0151); meanwhile, none of the patients in good-sleep group required ICU care.

An increased incidence of hospital-acquired infection (seven [9.3%] vs one [1.7%]) was observed in the poor-sleep group compared to the good-sleep group; however, this difference was not significant (P = 0.1316). In conclusion, poor sleep quality during hospitalization in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia is associated with a slow recovery from lymphopenia and an increased need for ICU care.","Zhang, Jiancheng; Xu, Dan; Xie, Bing; Zhang, Yujing; Huang, Haiyan; Liu, Hongmei; Chen, Huaqi; Sun, Yongbo; Shang, You; Hashimoto, Kenji; Yuan, Shiying",Brain Behav Immun,116,3

As of 1 April 2020, 24 mothers confirmed with COVID-19, 19 mothers suspected with COVID-19 but Polymerase chain reaction negative, and 21 mothers without COVID-19 and their neonates have been recruited. Telephone follow-up was conducted to collect information on breastfeeding practices. Forty-four breast milk samples were collected from 16 of the 24 mothers with confirmed COVID-19 for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) and antibodies (IgM and IgG) testing. Findings The average mother-child separation time was 36•7 ± 21•1 days among mothers confirmed with COVID-19, significantly longer than that of the suspected group (16•6 ± 13•1 days) and control group (10•5 ± 8•2 days). Both the COVID-19 confirmed (58•3%) and suspected (52•6%) groups presented significantly lower rates of breastfeeding as compared with the control group (95•2%).

In recent years, the detection and analysis of O-acetylated sialic acids have advanced, and sialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferases (SOATs) and O-acetylesterases (SIAEs) that add and remove O-acetyl groups, respectively, have been identified and characterized in mammalian cells, invertebrates, bacteria, and viruses. These advances now allow us to draw a more complete picture of the biosynthetic pathway of the diverse O-acetylated sialic acids to drive the generation of genetically and biochemically engineered model cell lines and organisms with altered expression of O-acetylated sialic acids for dissection of their roles in glycoprotein stability, development, and immune recognition, as well as discovery of novel functions. Furthermore, a growing number of studies associate sialic acid O-acetylation with cancer, autoimmunity, and infection, providing rationale for the development of selective probes and inhibitors of SOATs and SIAEs. Here, we discuss the current insights into the biosynthesis and biological functions of O-acetylated sialic acids and review the evidence linking this modification to disease. Furthermore, we discuss emerging strategies for the design, synthesis, and potential application of unnatural O-acetylated sialic acids and inhibitors of SOATs and SIAEs that may enable therapeutic targeting of this versatile sialic acid modification.","Visser, Eline A.; Moons, Sam J.; Timmermans, Suzanne B.P.E.; de Jong, Heleen; Boltje, Thomas J.; Büll, Christian",J Biol Chem,116,1

The golden treatment against the invasive spread of COVID-19 is done by identifying and isolating the infected patients, and as a result, fast diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical issue. The common laboratory test for confirming the infection of COVID-19 is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). However, these tests suffer from some problems in time, accuracy, and availability. Chest images have proven to be a powerful tool in the early detection of COVID-19. In the current study, a hybrid learning and optimization approach named CovH2SD is proposed for the COVID-19 detection from the Chest Computed Tomography (CT) images. CovH2SD uses deep learning and pre-trained models to extract the features from the CT images and learn from them. It uses Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters. Transfer learning is applied using nine pre-trained convolutional neural networks (i.e. ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and DenseNet169). Fast Classification Stage (FCS) and Compact Stacking Stage (CSS) are suggested to stack the best models into a single one. Nine experiments are applied and results are reported based on the Loss, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under Curve (AUC) performance metrics. The comparison between combinations is applied using the Weighted Sum Method (WSM). Six experiments report a WSM value above 96.5%.

We used 1 large national insurance database to identify whether patient demographics, disease severity, or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) rates changed for the treatment and management of AIS during COVID-19. METHODS AIS patient records were queried from the Clinformatics® Data Mart Optum SES Database from the following 2 time periods: March 1, 2019-June 30, 2019 (pre-COVID-19), and March 1, 2020-June 30, 2020 (COVID-19). The database contains the longitudinal healthcare claims of approximately 77 million patients covered by a major insurance provider between 2003 and June 30, 2020 across all 50 states. Interrupted time-series analyses were used to assess trend differences before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS During the pre-COVID-19 period (March 1, 2019-June 30, 2019), there were 9,072 patients who presented for AIS, compared to 7,366 during COVID-19 (March 1, 2020-June 30, 2020). In both periods, the majority of patients were white (66.83% pre-COVID-19 and 67.91% during COVID-19). The average hospitalization duration was not different during the 2 time periods (p = 0.632), nor were rates of MT (p = 0.260). Total inpatient costs rose slightly for the COVID-19 period (USD 30,739 vs. USD 29,406; p = 0.015), and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was higher during CO-VID-19 (5 vs. 4; p = 0.023). When longitudinal trends were assessed for rates of MT and average NIHSS score for black and white patients, no differences were noted during the CO-VID-19 pandemic. Patients without any undergraduate experience did not present with AIS in increasing or decreasing incidence during COVID-19 (p = 0.268), but they did undergo declining rates of MT (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS In the largest SES analysis of AIS patients during the COVID-19 era, we found that several SES factors, including race and income, did not seem to significantly impact utilization of MT for the treatment of AIS or the severity of the stroke at presentation.","Rodrigues, Adrian; Jin, Michael C; Pendharkar, Arjun",Cerebrovascular diseases,116,30

Whether this is causative for the development of NAFLD is not yet clarified. Here we investigate the effect of hepatic DPP4 overexpression on the development of liver steatosis in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. METHODS: Plasma DPP4 activity of subjects with or without NAFLD was analyzed. Wild-type (WT) and liver-specific Dpp4 transgenic mice (Dpp4-Liv-Tg) were fed a high-fat diet and characterized for body weight, body composition, hepatic fat content and insulin sensitivity. In vitro experiments on HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were conducted to validate cell autonomous effects of DPP4 on lipid storage and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from insulin resistance and NAFLD show an increased plasma DPP4 activity when compared to healthy controls. Analysis of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice revealed elevated systemic DPP4 activity and diminished active GLP-1 levels. They furthermore show increased body weight, fat mass, adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis, liver damage and hypercholesterolemia. These effects were accompanied by increased expression of PPARγ and CD36 as well as severe insulin resistance in the liver. In agreement, treatment of HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes with physiological concentrations of DPP4 resulted in impaired insulin sensitivity independent of lipid content. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give evidence that elevated expression of DPP4 in the liver promotes NAFLD and insulin resistance. This is linked to reduced levels of active GLP-1, but also to auto- and paracrine effects of DPP4 on hepatic insulin signaling.","Baumeier, Christian; Schlüter, Luisa; Saussenthaler, Sophie; Laeger, Thomas; Rödiger, Maria; Alaze, Stella Amelie; Fritsche, Louise; Häring, Hans-Ulrich; Stefan, Norbert; Fritsche, Andreas; Schwenk, Robert Wolfgang; Schürmann, Annette",Mol Metab,116,20

DESIGN: A post hoc analysis of respiratory data from non-invasive venous waveform analysis among patients enrolled in an observational study was performed. SETTING: Vanderbilt University Medical Center. PATIENTS: Peripheral venous waveforms were recorded from admission to discharge in enrolled coronavirus disease 2019–positive patients and healthy age-matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: Data were analyzed in LabChart 8 to transform venous waveforms to the frequency domain using fast Fourier transforms. The peak respiratory frequency was normalized to the peak cardiac frequency to generate a respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index. Paired Fisher exact tests were used to compare each patient’s respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index at admission and discharge. A nonparametric one-way analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls for respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty coronavirus disease 2019–positive patients were enrolled between April 2020, and September 2020, and 45 were analyzed; 34 required supplemental oxygen and 11 did not. The respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index was significantly higher for the 34 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who received supplemental oxygen (median, 0.27; interquartile range, 0.11—1.28) compared with the 34 healthy controls (median, 0.06; interquartile range, 0.03–0.14) (p < 0.01). For patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who received supplemental oxygen, respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index was significantly lower at hospital discharge (p = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.10–1.9) compared with hospital admission (median = 0.12; interquartile range, 0.05–0.56). For patients with coronavirus disease 2019, a respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index of 0.64 demonstrated sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 47%, and positive predictive value of 93% for predicting requirement of supplemental oxygen during the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory non-invasive venous waveform analysis respiratory index represents a novel physiologic respiratory measurement with a promising ability to triage early care and predict the need for oxygen support therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.","Alvis, Bret; Vaughn, Lexie; Schmeckpeper, Jeffrey; Huston, Jessica; Case, Marisa; Semler, Matthew; Lindenfeld, JoAnn; Brophy, Colleen; Hocking, Kyle",Crit Care Explor,116,8

Assessing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker groups offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and a higher risk of contagion. The study enrolled 3242 asymptomatic employees of “Policlinico Riuniti”, Foggia. After the first screening, we collected sequential serum samples for up to 23 weeks from the same subjects. In order to perform a longitudinal follow-up study and get information about the titration of IgG levels, we analyzed data from subjects (33) with at least two consecutive serological IgG—positive tests; 62 (1.9%; 95% CI: 1.4–2.3) tested positive for at least one anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group 1.4% (6/428; 95% CI: 0.5–2.6) vs. the intermediate-risk group 2.0% (55/2736; 95% CI: 1.5–2.5). Overall, within eight weeks, we detected a mean reduction of –17% in IgG levels. Our data suggest a reduction of about 9.27 AU/mL every week (R(2) = 0.35, p = 0.0003). This study revealed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Foggia’s hospital healthcare staff (1.9%).

Our prospective detailed daily questionnaire-based telemonitoring study evaluated COVID-19’s impact among 105 outpatients. In accordance with government quarantine requirements, outpatients were divided into a cohort with two negative tests at the end of the disease (40 patients) and a cohort with a new algorithm (65 patients) following a 14-day quarantine. Median follow-up differed significantly between the 2 groups (23 days vs. 16 days). Only 6% of patients were asymptomatic during the entire telemonitoring period. Another 13% of patients were diagnosed asymptomatic, as suspected contacts, yet later developed symptoms, while the remaining 81% were diagnosed as symptomatic on average 6 days following symptom onset. Telemonitoring enabled precise symptom status chronicling. The most frequently reported complaints were fevers, respiratory issues, and anosmia. Six patients were eventually hospitalized for complications detected early after routine telemonitoring. During the extended follow-up (median 181 days), anosmia persisted in 26% of patients. 79% of patients in the new quarantine algorithm cohort reported no symptoms on day 11 compared to just 56% of patients in the two negative test cohort upon first testing negative (median–19 days). The highest viral load occurred within 0–2 days of initial symptom onset. Both the PCR viral load and two consecutive PCR negative sample realizations indicated high interindividual variability with a surprisingly fluctuating pattern among 43% of patients. No definitive COVID-19 symptoms or set of symptoms excepting anosmia (59%) and/or ageusia (47%) were identified. No preexisting medical conditions specifically foreshadowed disease trajectory in a given patient. Without a PCR negativity requirement for quarantine cessation, patients could exhibit fewer symptoms. Our study therefore highlights the urgent need for routine ambulatory patient telemedicine monitoring, early complication detection, intensive mass education connecting disease demeanor with subsequent swift diagnostics, and, notably, the need to reevaluate and modify quarantine regulations for better control of SARS-CoV-2 proliferation.","Weinbergerova, Barbora; Mayer, Jiri; Hrabovsky, Stepan; Novakova, Zuzana; Pospisil, Zdenek; Martykanova, Lucie; Hortova, Katerina; Mandelova, Lucie; Hejduk, Karel; Chloupková, Renata; Pospisil, Michal; Doubkova, Martina; Marek, Vladimir; Novotna, Renata; Dolecek, Martin; Kubesova, Hana Matejovska; Brat, Kristian; Parizkova, Radana; Husa, Petr; Mechl, Marek; Kral, Zdenek; Lengerova, Martina",Sci Rep,116,32

An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older. The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria. FINDINGS: Between Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66 752 adults were recruited to the study population. The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 13·6% (95% CI 12·0–15·2). The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (19·0%, 95% CI 16·9–21·2 vs 8·1%, 6·8–9·3; p<0·0001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 58·2% vs 4·0%). The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (20·2%, 95% CI 14·7–25·8) and the lowest in central China (10·2%, 8·2–12·2). Among adults with COPD, 56·4% (95% CI 53·7–59·2) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 36·3% (34·3–38·3) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 6·5% (5·5–7·4) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 0·9% (0·6–1·1) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV). INTERPRETATION: In a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the estimated overall prevalence of COPD in China in 2014–15 was 13·6%, indicating that this disease has become a major public-health problem.

Specialist services, including clinical genetics, must consider methods of remote delivery including videoconferencing—termed telegenetics. This review evaluates the evidence for telegenetics and its applicability to future service development. METHODS: A systematic review of six databases was conducted to identify studies from 2005 onward using synchronous videoconferencing to deliver clinical genetics services. Included studies compared telegenetics to an alternative method or used a before and after design. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (eight compared telegenetics to in-person consultations and three to telephone delivery). Patient satisfaction, genetic knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes were similar for in-person and telegenetic counseling. There was some evidence that telegenetics may be superior to telephone delivery for knowledge gain and reduction in anxiety and depression. There is limited evidence concerning the effect of telegenetics on provider satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions are limited by at least moderate risk of bias in all evaluated studies and small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Across most outcomes measured, telegenetics had equivalent outcomes to in-person appointment; however, the extent to which the available evidence is applicable to longer-term use is debatable.","Brown, Elizabeth G.; Watts, Isabella; Beales, Emily R.; Maudhoo, Ashwini; Hayward, Judith; Sheridan, Eamonn; Rafi, Imran",Genet Med,116,30

METHODS: A crown preparation on a manikin was performed on tooth number 30 and repeated five times for each setup to simulate a patient under care. Aerosol, environmental, and operator face shield spatter, and sound intensity was measured. Generalized linear mixed models were used, and posthoc pairwise comparisons were performed to compare least‐squares means when appropriate using a Tukey adjustment. RESULTS: All tested setups showed some environmental spatter formation; however, these were able to control most (and in some cases all) spatter on the operator face shield. All methods resulted in excellent aerosol mitigation when a second line of high‐volume evacuation (HVE) was added to the device setup. However, in most setups, total sound levels exceeded 85 dB, posing a concern for prolonged noise exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The Prototype device and four other tested setups with secondary HVE addition completely eliminated aerosol creation as tested. Spatter of the Face Shield was best eliminated using the Prototype device. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the dental community has at its disposal equipment that can effectively mitigate aerosol and spatter.","Comisi, John C.; Ravenel, Theodore D.; Kelly, Abigail; Teich, Sorin T.; Renne, Walter",J Esthet Restor Dent,116,20

Within a span of a few days, this disease became a global threat and was termed as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020, since then the disease has affected more than 1.5 crore people worldwide and around 6.9 lakh people in India as of 5th July 2020. The origin of the COVID-19 disease has been traced back to the bats, but the intermediary contact is unknown. The disease spreads by respiratory droplets and contaminated surfaces. In most cases, the virus shows mild symptoms like fever, fatigue, dyspnea, cough, etc. which may become severe if appropriate precautions are not adhered to. For people with comorbidities (usually elderly) the disease may turn deadly and cause pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure, thereby affecting a person's ability to breathe leading to being put on the ventilator support.

Insight in pathways associated with unfavourable outcome may lead to new treatment strategies. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to general ward or ICU who underwent serial blood sampling. To provide insight in the pathways involved in disease progression, associations were estimated between outcome risk and serial measurements of 64 biomarkers in potential important pathways of COVID-19 infection (inflammation, tissue damage, complement system, coagulation and fibrinolysis) using joint models combining Cox regression and linear mixed-effects models. For patients admitted to the general ward, the primary outcome was admission to the ICU or mortality (unfavourable outcome). For patients admitted to the ICU, the primary outcome was 12-week mortality. FINDINGS: A total of 219 patients were included: 136 (62%) on the ward and 119 patients (54%) on the ICU; 36 patients (26%) were included in both cohorts because they were transferred from general ward to ICU. On the general ward, 54 of 136 patients (40%) had an unfavourable outcome and 31 (23%) patients died. On the ICU, 54 out of 119 patients (45%) died. Unfavourable outcome on the general ward was associated with changes in concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and Pentraxin-3. Death on the ICU was associated with changes in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, sRAGE, VCAM-1, Pentraxin-3, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, IL-1-receptor antagonist, CD14, procalcitonin, tumor necrosis factor alfa, tissue factor, complement component 5a, Growth arrest–specific 6, angiopoietin 2, and lactoferrin. Pathway analysis showed that unfavourable outcome on the ward was mainly driven by chemotaxis and interleukin production, whereas death on ICU was associated with a variety of pathways including chemotaxis, cell-cell adhesion, innate host response mechanisms, including the complement system, viral life cycle regulation, angiogenesis, wound healing and response to corticosteroids. INTERPRETATION: Clinical deterioration in patients with severe COVID-19 involves multiple pathways, including chemotaxis and interleukin production, but also endothelial dysfunction, the complement system, and immunothrombosis. Prognostic markers showed considerable overlap between general ward and ICU patients, but we identified distinct differences between groups that should be considered in the development and timing of interventional therapies in COVID-19.

Until then, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications could have a protective effect against severe disease. This is the objective of this large population study performed in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel. METHODS: CHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHRs) including medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess systematically which drugs affected the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization: in both cohorts, case patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; matched control patients were taken from the general population in the first cohort, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the second cohort. For each medication anatomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) class acquired during the last month before the index-date, we computed the odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p-value, using Fisher’s exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS: Several drugs and pharmacy sold items were associated with significantly reduced odds for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, notably ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95% CI [0.058,0.458], p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.513, 95% CI [0.375,0.688], P<0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.746, 95% CI [0.645,0.858], p<0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.303, 95% CI [0.080,0.813], p<0.01). Additionally, acquisition of surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased risk for hospitalization.

Despite the fact that condoms are effective and easily accessible, young adults report inconsistent condom use and young adults represent a disproportionately large amount of new STI cases annually. The Behavioural Immune System theory suggests that health behaviours, such as condom use, are impacted by cognitive activation of perceived threat of disease. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic may then have unforeseen impacts on condom use and the spread of STIs. The present study investigated changes in condom use during the pandemic, and any associations these changes may have had with perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. An Australian sample of 269 students completed a survey asking them to recall their condom use prior to COVID-19, and then their current condom use. Final analyses included a sample of 149 sexually active heterosexual participants. Results revealed a general decline in condom use. Single and coupled participants both reported less frequent condom use, but this decrease was more pronounced among single people. Gender did not moderate these effects. Surprisingly, diminished condom use was not significantly related to perceived threat of COVID-19. Findings of the present study have concerning implications for sexual health and sexual messaging during pandemics.","Dacosta, L.; Pinkus, R. T.; Morandini, J.; Dar-Nimrod, I.",Sexologies,116,20

The child/youth mental health workforce bears the additional burden of the disruption of the systems‐based practice crucial to the successful provision of mental health services. Major sources of stress for the workforce include: (a) a threat to the worker’s personal/family health and life (traumatic injury), (b) a loss of colleagues or threat to professional mastery and identity (grief injury), (c) an inner conflict between ones’ values and aspirations and what they are able to accomplish in their work (moral injury), and (d) fatigue, simply feeling worn out by the relentless work and need, without time for rest and recovery (fatigue injury).

The urinary antigen test (UAT) is known to be useful for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of UAT in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) era. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases aged ≥19 years were reviewed retrospectively. This study evaluated the utility of Streptococcus pneumoniae UAT (BinaxNOW(®) assay) for diagnosis of pneumococcal CAP, and the relation of the UAT positive rate to age, comorbidities, pneumonia severity, and pneumococcal serotypes. Among 752 microbiologically identified CAP cases, S. pneumoniae (36.7%) was the most common isolate, and of those cases, 56.4% were positive for UAT. UAT positivity varied by pneumococcal serotype (serotype 3, 50%; 9V/9A, 85%; 11A/11E, 54%; 14, 36.4%; 19A, 50%; and 23F, 37.5%), and was significantly increased since 2012, two years after introduction of PCV13. The positive rate of UAT was significantly related to CRP level (P = 0.007) and lobar pneumonia (P = 0.006), but not to age, co-morbidities or prior antibiotic therapy. In conclusion, urinary antigen detection varied depending on the S. pneumoniae serotype. In the PCV13 era, the serotype distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia may be changing, and the clinical usefulness of UAT needs to be monitored. The positive rate of UAT may be influenced by a localized bacterial burden and host reactions.","Choi, Min Joo; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Jeon, Ji Ho; Kang, Seong Hui; Jung, Eun Ju; Noh, Ji Yun; Kim, Woo Joo",J Infect Chemother,116,22

Impaired innate and adaptive immunity observed in T1DM seem to play a major role. Severe, life-threatening COVID-19 disease is characterized by the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as a “cytokine storm”. Patients with T1DM present elevated levels of cytokines including interleukin-1a (IL), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), suggesting the pre-existence of chronic inflammation, which, in turn, has been considered the major risk factor of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in many cohorts. Even more importantly, oxidative stress is a key player in COVID-19 pathogenesis and determines disease severity. It is well-known that extreme glucose excursions, the prominent feature of T1DM, are a potent mediator of oxidative stress through several pathways including the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the increased production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Additionally, chronic endothelial dysfunction and the hypercoagulant state observed in T1DM, in combination with the direct damage of endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may result in endothelial and microcirculation impairment, which contribute to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory syndrome and multi-organ failure. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in pancreatic b-cells permits the direct destruction of b-cells, which contributes to the development of new-onset diabetes and the induction of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with T1DM. Large clinical studies are required to clarify the exact pathways through which T1DM results in worse COVID-19 outcomes.","Kountouri, Aikaterini; Korakas, Emmanouil; Ikonomidis, Ignatios; Raptis, Athanasios; Tentolouris, Nikolaos; Dimitriadis, George; Lambadiari, Vaia",Antioxidants (Basel),116,21

We have previously shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus M protein suppresses type I interferon (IFN) production by impeding the formation of functional TRAF3-containing complex. In this study, we demonstrate that the IFN-antagonizing activity is specific to SARS coronavirus M protein and is mediated through its first transmembrane domain (TM1) located at the N terminus. M protein from human coronavirus HKU1 does not inhibit IFN production. Whereas N-linked glycosylation of SARS coronavirus M protein has no influence on IFN antagonism, TM1 is indispensable for the suppression of IFN production. TM1 targets SARS coronavirus M protein and heterologous proteins to the Golgi apparatus, yet Golgi localization is required but not sufficient for IFN antagonism. Mechanistically, TM1 is capable of binding with RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε, and preventing the interaction of TRAF3 with its downstream effectors. Our work defines the molecular architecture of SARS coronavirus M protein required for suppression of innate antiviral response.","Siu, Kam-Leung; Chan, Chi-Ping; Kok, Kin-Hang; Chiu-Yat Woo, Patrick; Jin, Dong-Yan",Cellular & Molecular Immunology,116,26

The present study was conducted to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nephrology and transplant services and clinical training at our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS This observational study was conducted at the Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Centre (Ahmedabad, India). Our institute is one of the largest tertiary care centers of its kind in India with around 400 total inpatient beds for nephrology, urology, and transplant patients. In 2019, our center had annual outpatient and inpatient numbers of 132 181 and 7471, respectively, and conducted 412 renal transplant procedures. For this study, monthly data on number of outpatients, inpatients, and patients undergoing renal transplant, as well as various nonelective procedures, conducted in 2019 and 2020 were collected and analyzed. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various non-COVID-19-related health care facilities and on clinical training and research activities at our institute. RESULTS During the 2020 COVID-19 period, the number of outpatients and inpatients was greatly reduced compared with data from 2019. A similar decrease was seen in patients undergoing hemodialysis, renal transplant, and nonelective procedures at our center. The COVID-19 period also greatly affected clinical training of residents enrolled at our institute and research activities, as a result of focus on COVID-19 as a priority. CONCLUSIONS The effects of reduced numbers of outpatients and inpatients on workflow, as well as reduced numbers of renal transplants and nonelective procedures on the health of our patients, are unknown. Hence, a strategic scheme is needed to develop new health care models that can help manage the COVID-19 pandemic at present and any further waves arising in the future.","Kute, Vivek B; Gupta, Akash; Patel, Himanshu V; Engineer, Divyesh P; Banerjee, Subho; Rizvi, Syed J; Mishra, Vineet V; Patel, Ansy H; Navadiya, Vijay V",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,116,1

The approaches based on the use of the natural ability of bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 systems to recognize DNA sequences with a high specificity under isothermal conditions are an alternative to the polymerase chain reaction method, which requires expensive laboratory equipment. The development of the methods for signal registration with the formation of a DNA/RNA/Cas9 protein complex is a separate bioengineering task. In this work, a design was developed and the applicability of a biosensor system based on the binding of two dCas9 proteins with target DNA sequences (without their cutting) and detection of their colocalization using reporter systems based on split enzymes was studied. Using the methods of molecular modeling, possible mutual positions of two dCas9 proteins at a detectable locus of genomic DNA, allowing the split enzyme domains attached to them to interact in an optimal way, were determined. The optimal distances on DNA between binding sites of dCas9 proteins in different orientations were determined, and the dependence of the complex structure on the distance between the binding sites of dCas9 proteins was modeled. Using the methods of bioinformatics, the genomes of a number of viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed, and the presence of genomic loci unique to the species, allowing the possibility of landing pairs of dCas9 proteins in optimal positions, was demonstrated. The possibility of a combined use of dCas9 proteins from different bacteria to expand the spectrum of detected loci was analyzed. The results of the work indicate a fundamental possibility of the creation of highly specific nucleic acid biosensors based on a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and split enzymes.","Novikov, R.

This systematic review aims to stratify studies as high or low risk of bias to determine the true sensitivity of CT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection according to the unbiased (low risk) studies, a topic of particular importance given the insufficient quantity of RT-PCR kits in many countries. We focus on sensitivity as that is the chief advantage perceived of CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review involved searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles conducted and published between January 1 and April 15, 2020. The quality assessment tool QUADAS-2 was used to stratify studies according to their risk of bias, and exclusion criteria included not providing the information deemed relevant for such a stratification, such as not indicating if the patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, or identifying the source of the specimen for the reference standard, RT-PCR (eg, nasal, oropharyngeal, etc). Sensitivity values were then extracted, and random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 641 search results, 37 studies (n = 9610 patients) were included in the analysis. The mean sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 reported by the biased studies was 70% (n = 5409/7 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43–97; I(2) = 99.1%), compared with 78% by unbiased studies (n = 534/4 studies; 95% CI, 69–87, I(2) = 89.9%). For chest CT, the mean sensitivity reported by biased studies was 94% (n = 3371 patients/24 studies; 95% CI, 92–96; I(2) = 93.1%), compared with 75% by unbiased studies (n = 957/10 studies; 95% CI, 67–83; I(2) = 89.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The difference between the sensitivities of CT and RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is lower than previously thought, as after stratifying the studies, the true sensitivity for CT based on the unbiased studies is limited.","Waller, Joseph V.; Allen, Isabel E.; Lin, Keldon K.; Diaz, Michael J.; Henry, Travis S.; Hope, Michael D.",Invest Radiol,116,24

Accordingly, the general understanding and awareness of IBD among healthcare professionals has increased considerably in this region. This increase is ultimately associated with the evolving focus of IBD clinicians devoted to comprehensive patient care, especially in establishing IBD clinics/centers capable of providing multidisciplinary counseling. Comprehensive IBD care at IBD clinics/centers usually includes surgical and medication decision-making, transition from pediatric to adult clinics, care of extraintestinal manifestations, care of infectious diseases in patients undergoing immunomodulatory or biologic therapies, and nutritional, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and pharmacological care. Team members comprise specialists from various departments related to IBD and can be divided into core and ad hoc members. Usually, the scope of work in IBD clinics/centers involves patient care, patient outreach, and system management.

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the fecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. In spite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (convention and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policymakers and regulators.","Venkata Mohan, S.; Hemalatha, Manupati; Kopperi, Harishankar; Ranjith, I.; Kiran Kumar, A.",Chem Eng J,116,16

The pairing of a male worm with a female worm residing in the gynaecophoral canal of male plays a critical role in the development of female parasite. Because the male specific gynaecophoral canal protein of Schistosoma japonicum (SjGCP) is found in significant quantities in the adult female worm after pairing, it could play an important role in parasite pairing. METHODS: In the present study, three small interfering (si)RNA duplexes targeting the SjGCP gene were designed, synthesized and the silencing effects were evaluated in vitro as well as in mice infected with S. japonicum in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies using semi‐quantitative reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and real‐time RT‐PCR revealed the reduction of SjGCP at the transcript level. Similarly, western blotting and immunofluorescence studies showed its reduction at the protein level after treatment of parasites with siRNAs. At a concentration of 200 nm, two siRNAs totally abolished the parasite pairing. To evaluate such a pairing inhibitory effect in vivo, mice infected with S. japonicum were treated with siRNA and both parasite pairing and burden were evaluated. In vivo tests confirmed the in vitro silencing effect of SjGCP siRNA and revealed that the systemic delivery of siRNA significantly inhibited early parasite pairing and the associated burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrated that the SjGCP plays an important role in pairing and subsequent development in S. japonicum, and its silencing might have potential as a therapeutic approach for controlling schistosomiasis.

Ayurveda, the age old practice of treating human ailments in India, can be considered against SARS-CoV-2. Attempt was made to provide preliminary evidences for interaction of 35 phytochemicals from two plants (Phyllanthus amarus and Andrographis paniculata used in Ayurveda) with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (open & closed state S protein, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) through in silico docking analysis. The nucleotide analogue remdesivir, being used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2, was used as a positive control. The results revealed that 18 phytochemicals from P. amarus and 14 phytochemicals from A. paniculata shown binding energy affinity/dock score < − 6.0 kcal/mol, which is considered as minimum threshold for any compound to be used for drug development. Phytochemicals used for docking studies in the current study from P. amarus and A. paniculata showed binding affinity up to − 9.10 kcal/mol and − 10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of these compounds with closed and open state S protein. Further, flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and quercetin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) present in P. amarus have shown more binding affinity (up to − 10.60 kcal/mol) than remdesivir (up to − 9.50 kcal/mol). The pharmacokinetic predictions suggest that compounds from the two plants species studied in the current study are found to be non-carcinogenic, water soluble and biologically safe. The phytochemicals present in the extracts of P. amarus and A. paniculata might have synergistic effect with action on multiple target sites of SARS-CoV-2.

Also, child’s diet and nutrition appear to be an important factor affecting sleep health. Few studies have addressed the effect of parental emotional disturbance that can leave on children’s sleep. Therefore, the objective of our study was to assess the prevalence of sleep disorders in pre- and school-aged children and evaluate its relation with parental mental health and child’s nutrition and activity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, conducted between October 2020 and January 2021, which enrolled 402 Lebanese parents from all over Lebanon. The questionnaire was distributed online using the snowball technique. The Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) was used to assess pediatric sleep behaviors and the Family Nutrition and physical activity questionnaire was used to assess parental behaviors that might predispose children for obesity. RESULTS: A total of 76 (19%) children had sleep disorders (PSQ scores of 8 or more). The multivariable analysis showed that higher paternal depression (Beta = 0.079, p = 0.010), maternal depression (Beta = 0.089, p = 0.001) and higher anxiety in the father (Beta = 0.064, p = 0.021) were significantly associated with higher PSQ scores (worse sleep) in the child.

In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of no statistical significance. Moreover, 11 mammalian viral genera in minks were possibly identified for the first time through this study.","Qiu, Yuan; Chen, Ji-Ming; Wang, Tong; Hou, Guang-Yu; Zhuang, Qing-Ye; Wu, Run; Wang, Kai-Cheng",Virus Res,116,12

Yet strong sectorial identities exist within biosecurity that are associated with specific international standards, individual economic interests, specific research communities, and unique stakeholder involvement. Despite considerable research addressing human, animal, plant, and environmental health, the science connections between these sectors remain quite limited. One Biosecurity aims to address these limitations at global, national, and local scales. It is an interdisciplinary approach to biosecurity policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and environmental health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. It provides an integrated perspective to address the many biosecurity risks that transcend the traditional boundaries of health, agriculture, and the environment. Individual invasive alien plant and animal species often have multiple impacts across sectors: as hosts of zoonotic parasites, vectors of pathogens, pests of agriculture or forestry, as well as threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. It is time these risks were addressed in a systematic way. One Biosecurity is essential to address several major sociological and environmental challenges to biosecurity: climate change, increasing urbanisation, agricultural intensification, human global mobility, loss of technical capability as well as public resistance to pesticides and vaccines. One Biosecurity will require the bringing together of taxonomists, population biologists, modellers, economists, chemists, engineers, and social scientists to engage in a new agenda that is shaped by politics, legislation, and public perceptions.","Hulme, Philip E.",Emerg Top Life Sci,116,20

DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted in a descriptive design. The keywords ""COVID-19, explain, children"" were searched on the YouTube platform on March 17, 2021, and 294 videos were reviewed. The content of the selected videos was analyzed by 2 independent reviewers. Meet the inclusion criteria, 57 videos were evaluated according to the presenter source and the presented audience with the COVID-19 for Children Checklist (CCC), DISCERN score and the Global Quality Score (GQS). RESULTS: When the contents of 57 videos included in the study were reviewed, it was determined that 56.1% (n = 32) were informative and 43.9% (n = 25) were misleading. Kappa value among the two independent observers was 0.89. 17.5% (n = 10) of the videos scored 5 points from DISCERN and 31.6% (n = 18) scored 4 points from GQS. The mean scores of GQS, DISCERN and CCC of videos with the grouped as informative were found to be statistically higher. There was a significant difference between the DISCERN mean score of ministry/academic/hospital/physician channel videos was higher than the mean score of entertainment/individual channel videos. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that videos explaining COVID-19 to children have high viewing rates, but also videos that are low in terms of quality and reliability.

This study aimed to evaluate the association of RRT with 6-month mortality in patients with severe AKI treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) after OHCA. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multicentre observational cohort study that included adult OHCA patients treated with TTM across 22 hospitals in South Korea between October 2015 and December 2018. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality and the secondary outcome was cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to define the role of RRT in stage 3 AKI. RESULTS: Among 10,426 patients with OHCA, 1373 were treated with TTM. After excluding those who died within 48 h of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and those with pre-arrest chronic kidney disease, our study cohort comprised 1063 patients. AKI developed in 590 (55.5%) patients and 223 (21.0%) had stage 3 AKI. Among them, 115 (51.6%) were treated with RRT. The most common treatment modality among RRT patients was continuous renal replacement therapy (111 [96.5%]), followed by intermittent haemodialysis (4 [3.5%]). The distributions of CPC (1–5) at 6 months for the non-RRT vs. the RRT group were 3/108 (2.8%) vs. 12/115 (10.4%) for CPC 1, 0/108 (0.0%) vs. 1/115 (0.9%) for CPC 2, 1/108 (0.9%) vs. 3/115 (2.6%) for CPC 3, 6/108 (5.6%) vs. 6/115 (5.2%) for CPC 4, and 98/108 (90.7%) vs. 93/115 (80.9%) for CPC 5, respectively (P = 0.01). The RRT group had significantly lower 6-month mortality than the non-RRT group (93/115 [81%] vs. 98/108 [91%], P = 0.04). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that RRT was independently associated with a lower risk of death in patients with stage 3 AKI (hazard ratio, 0.569 [95% confidence interval, 0.377–0.857, P = 0.01]). CONCLUSION: Dialysis interventions were independently associated with a lower risk of death in patients with stage 3 AKI treated with TTM after OHCA.","Choi, Yoon Hee; Lee, Dong Hoon; Oh, Je Hyeok; Wee, Jung Hee; Jang, Tae Chang; Choi, Seung Pill; Park, Kyu Nam",Crit Care,116,30

Yet, with any crisis, there is the opportunity to learn, grow, and develop new knowledge and strategies to benefit educational programs moving forward. The purpose of this study is to describe the leadership lessons learned by academic pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of administrators, faculty, and students. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of qualitative data provided by three focus groups. Each focus group was composed of one of three distinct college of pharmacy constituencies: (1) members of the college’s executive team, (2) faculty members who currently or in the recent past served in college leadership positions, and (3) students in an elective pharmacy leadership course. Focus groups were semi-structured, and discussion concerned leadership lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified form of inductive content analysis and abstraction was used to assess qualitative data collected during the focus groups. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged across all three focus groups, which include open and ongoing communication, staying connected, turning crisis into opportunity, being adaptable/flexible, and finding ways to stay productive. Themes unique to each focus group were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Core leadership lessons in emergent situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, including adaptability to the changing environment and communicating accurately and with appropriate frequency, illustrate the need for flexibility during times of crisis and highlight areas of focus for future planning.","Chisholm-Burns, Marie A.; Brandon, Hope Howard; Spivey, Christina A.",Curr Pharm Teach Learn,116,21

Inappropriate overemphasis of specialization of disciplines has ignored public health. Identifying the causes of disease and determining how exposures are related to outcomes in “emerging zoonoses” affecting multiple species are considered to be the hallmarks of public health research and practice that compels the adoption of “One Health”. The interactions within and among populations of vertebrates in the causation and transmissions of emerging zoonotic diseases are inherently dynamic, interdependent, and systems based. Disease causality theories have moved from one or several agents causing disease in a single species, to one infectious agent causing disease in multiple species-emerging zoonoses. Identification of the causative pathogen components or structures, elucidating the mechanisms of species specificity, and understanding the natural conditions of emergence would facilitate better derivation of the causal mechanism. Good quality evidence on causation in emerging zoonoses affecting multiple species makes a strong recommendation under the One Health approach for disease prevention and control from diagnostic tests, treatment, antimicrobial resistance, preventive vaccines, and evidence informed health policies. In the tenets of One Health, alliances work best when the legitimate interests of the different partners combine to prevent and control emerging zoonoses.","Asokan, G.V.; Asokan, Vanitha",J Epidemiol Glob Health,116,11

Repeated damage of lung epithelial cells can cause fibroblast activation and excessive collagen will lead the scar formation and severe fibrosis. It has been decades since drugs for the treatment of IPF were developed, but clinical choices were limited. Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP (EPAC), as a newly emerging cAMP (adenosine 3ʹ,5ʹ-cyclic monophosphate) downstream molecule, plays a vital role in the cellular pathways of IPF such as inhibiting fibroblast proliferation, stress fiber formation and epithelium cell adhesion, so it may be a novel target for drug development and treatment for curbing IPF. Here, we hypothesize that EPAC may participate in the signaling pathways related to IPF in different cell types (fibroblasts; airway smooth muscle cells; vascular endothelial cells; lung epithelial cells; macrophages; mesenchymal stem cells; T cells), thereby playing a potentially therapeutic role in resisting the process of fibrosis. We summarize the current correlation between EPAC and IPF in these different cell types, and further insights into EPAC will help to optimize the pharmacological treatment for IPF.","Cao, Xinwei; Li, Yajun; Shi, Jianrong; Tang, Huifang",J Inflamm Res,116,20

In this study, a risk model was developed for predicting rehabilitation duration (the time from hospital admission to discharge) of the mild-moderate COVID-19 cases and was used to conduct refined risk management for different risk populations. METHODS: A total of 90 consecutive patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 were enrolled. Large-scale datasets were extracted from clinical practices. Through the multivariable linear regression analysis, the model was based on significant risk factors and was developed for predicting the rehabilitation duration of mild-moderate cases of COVID-19. To assess the local epidemic situation, risk management was conducted by weighing the risk of populations at different risk. RESULTS: Ten risk factors from 44 high-dimensional clinical datasets were significantly correlated to rehabilitation duration (P < 0.05). Among these factors, 5 risk predictors were incorporated into a risk model. Individual rehabilitation durations were effectively calculated. Weighing the local epidemic situation, threshold probability was classified for low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. Using this classification, risk management was based on a treatment flowchart tailored for clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed novel model is a useful tool for individualized risk management of mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, and it may readily facilitate dynamic clinical decision-making for different risk populations.","Zheng, Qiong-Na; Xu, Mei-Yan; Zheng, Yong-Le; Wang, Xiu-Ying; Zhao, Hui",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,116,1
