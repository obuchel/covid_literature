This is due to the increasing number of infectious diseases emergencies that are important challenges for health protection authorities, which was shown impressively when SARS emerged as the first pandemic in this millennium. In Germany, effective and efficient infection control is complex, with local health protection authorities having their own responsibilities. In the case of an emergency epidemic, regional health departments are responsible. Having authority over these are authorities on the federal state level as well as on the federal level. For the European Community, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was established. The mission of this agency is to identify, assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases.","Gottschalk, René; Dreesman, J.; Leitmeyer, K.; Krause, G.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,683,1

This study aimed at investigating the survival rate in patients with ICU-acquired infections (ICU-AIs) and its related factors in Iran’s hospitals. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Iranian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (INIS), which registers all necessary information on the main types of infection from different units of each included hospital. One thousand one hundred thirty-four duplicate cases were removed from the analysis using the variables of name, father’s name, age, hospital code, infection code, and bedridden date. From 2016 to 2019, 32,998 patients diagnosed with ICU-AI from about 547 hospitals. All patients were followed up to February 29, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of patients with ICU-AIs was 61 (IQR = 46) years. 45.5, 20.69, 17.63, 12.08, and 4.09% of infections were observed in general, surgical, internal, neonatal and pediatric ICUs, respectively. Acinetobacter (16.52%), E.coli (12.01%), and Klebsiella (9.93%) were the major types of microorganisms. From total, 40.76% of infected patients (13,449 patients) died. The 1, 3, 6-months and overall survival rate was 70, 25.72, 8.21 1.48% in ICU-AI patients, respectively. The overall survival rate was 5.12, 1.34, 0.0, 51.65, and 31.08% for surgical, general, internal, neonatal and pediatric ICU, respectively. Hazard ratio shows a significant relationship between age, hospitalization-infection length, infection type, and microorganism and risk of death in patients with ICU-AI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, it seems that the nosocomial infections surveillance system should be more intelligent. This intelligence should act differently based on related factors such as the age of patients, hospitalization-infection length, infection type, microorganism and type of ward. In other words, this system should be able to dynamically provide the necessary and timely warnings based on the factors affecting the survival rate of infection due to the identification, intervention and measures to prevent the spread of HAIs based on a risk severity system.

However, its accuracy and clinical impact remain uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of CLT and to assess the impact of pre-extubation variables on the incidence of PES. A prospective observational study was performed on adult critically ill patients who required mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h. Patients were extubated after the successful spontaneous breathing trial, and CLT was conducted before extubation. Of the 191 patients studied, 26 (13.6%) were deemed positive through CLT. PES developed in 19 patients (9.9%) and resulted in a higher reintubation rate (8.1% vs. 52.6%, p < 0.001) and longer intensive care unit stay (8 [4.5–14] vs. 12 [8–30.5] days, p = 0.01) than patients without PES. The incidence of PES and post-extubation outcomes were similar in patients with both positive and negative CLT results. Compared with patients without PES, patients with PES had longer durations of endotracheal intubation and required endotracheal suctioning more frequently during the 24-h period prior to extubation. After adjusting for confounding factors, frequent endotracheal suctioning more than 15 times per day was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.97 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–8.77) for PES. In conclusion, frequent endotracheal suctioning before extubation was a significant PES predictor in critically ill patients. Further investigations of its impact on the incidence of PES and patient outcomes are warranted.","Tanaka, Aiko; Uchiyama, Akinori; Horiguchi, Yu; Higeno, Ryota; Sakaguchi, Ryota; Koyama, Yukiko; Ebishima, Hironori; Yoshida, Takeshi; Matsumoto, Atsuhiro; Sakai, Kanaki; Hiramatsu, Daisuke; Iguchi, Naoya; Ohta, Noriyuki; Fujino, Yuji",Sci Rep,683,20

In yeast, retromer and Snx4 coat complexes are recruited to the endosomal surface, where they recognize cargos. They sort cargo and deform the membrane into recycling tubules that bud from the endosome and target to the Golgi. Here, we reveal that the SNX-BAR protein, Mvp1, mediates an endosomal recycling pathway that is mechanistically distinct from the retromer and Snx4 pathways. Mvp1 deforms the endosomal membrane and sorts cargos containing a specific sorting motif into a membrane tubule. Subsequently, Mvp1 recruits the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 to catalyze membrane scission and release of the recycling tubule. Similarly, SNX8, the human homolog of Mvp1, which has been also implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, mediates formation of an endosomal recycling tubule. Thus, we present evidence for a novel endosomal retrieval pathway that is conserved from yeast to humans.","Suzuki, Sho W; Oishi, Akihiko; Nikulin, Nadia; Jorgensen, Jeff R; Baile, Matthew G; Emr, Scott D",,683,20

Here, we investigate the influence of hydration water on the molecular dynamics in hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a commonly used solubilized drug form. When hydration, even at a low level, results in a disordered structure, as opposed to the highly ordered structure of dry hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the activation barriers for the rotation of methyl groups in the drug molecules become randomized and, on average, significantly reduced. The facilitated stochastic motions of the methyl groups may benefit the biomolecular activity due to the more efficient sampling of the energy landscape in the disordered hydration environment experienced by the drug molecules in vivo.","Mamontov, Eugene; Cheng, Yongqiang; Daemen, Luke L.; Keum, Jong K.; Kolesnikov, Alexander I.; Pajerowski, Daniel; Podlesnyak, Andrey; Ramirez-Cuesta, Anibal J.; Ryder, Matthew R.; Stone, Matthew B.",ACS Omega,683,20

Misplacement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) can lead to devastating, preventable morbidity and mortality. Colorimetric carbon dioxide detectors are considered a simplistic mainstream capnography that contains a pH-sensitive chemical marker that is prone to color change with ventilation. Real-time tracheal ultrasound allows for the dynamic observation of tube passage through the trachea or the esophagus, providing immediate confirmation of placement prior to any ventilation attempts with reported sensitivity/specificity of 100% for adult patients in the operating room. We aimed to compare two different techniques (tracheal real-time ultrasound vs colorimetric capnography) as point of care tools for confirmation of correct endotracheal tube position. RESULTS: This study carried out on eligible seventy patients undergoing general anesthesia. Patients were divided randomly and equally into two groups (35 patients each). Group A in which patients’ ETT position was confirmed by real-time tracheal ultrasound and group B in which patients’ ETT position was confirmed by colorimetric capnography. Comparing both groups according to their diagnostic performance for detecting the correct position of the ETT inserted showed the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of real-time tracheal ultrasound vs colorimetric capnography (93.8%, 66.7%, and 91.4% VS 97%, 50%, and 94.3% respectively). Although there were higher sensitivity and accuracy of colorimetric capnography than real-time tracheal ultrasound, the p value between the two groups was 0.462. CONCLUSION: Both tools are fast, effective, reliable, and accurate with many advantages and few disadvantages including the need for training on ultrasound practice and air-filled stomach in colorimetric capnography. However, these disadvantages can be easily overruled and the benefits from both tools overweigh their disadvantages.","Abdelrahman, Tamer Nabil; Abdelhameed, Gamal A.; Armanious, Simon H.",Ain-Shams J Anesthesiol,683,12

This is compounded by the pathology caused by host innate and adaptive immune responses that struggle to simultaneously counter infection and repair tissue damage. RESULTS: Complementary transcriptomic and proteomic approaches defined the F. hepatica factors associated with their migration in the liver, and the resulting immune-pathogenesis. Immature liver-stage flukes express ~ 8000 transcripts that are enriched for transcription and translation processes reflective of intensive protein production and signal transduction pathways. Key pathways that regulate neoblast/pluripotent cells, including the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, are particularly dominant and emphasise the importance of neoblast-like cells for the parasite’s rapid development. The liver-stage parasites display different secretome profiles, reflecting their distinct niche within the host, and supports the view that cathepsin peptidases, cathepsin peptidase inhibitors, saposins and leucine aminopeptidases play a central role in the parasite’s destructive migration, and digestion of host tissue and blood. Immature flukes are also primed for countering immune attack by secreting immunomodulating fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) and helminth defence molecules (FhHDM). Combined with published host microarray data, our results suggest that considerable immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis of the liver tissue exacerbates oxidative stress within parenchyma that compels the expression of a range of antioxidant molecules within both host and parasite. CONCLUSIONS: The migration of immature F. hepatica parasites within the liver is associated with an increase in protein production, expression of signalling pathways and neoblast proliferation that drive their rapid growth and development. The secretion of a defined set of molecules, particularly cathepsin L peptidases, peptidase-inhibitors, saponins, immune-regulators and antioxidants allow the parasite to negotiate the liver micro-environment, immune attack and increasing levels of oxidative stress. This data contributes to the growing F. hepatica -omics information that can be exploited to understand parasite development more fully and for the design of novel control strategies to prevent host liver tissue destruction and pathology.","Cwiklinski, Krystyna; Robinson, Mark W.; Donnelly, Sheila; Dalton, John P.",BMC Genomics,683,16

METHODS: Questions about the perceived impact of COVID-19 were included as part of an evaluation survey of a community-based nutrition program, and assessed cross-sectionally in November-December 2020 among a total of 2960 poor or ultra-poor women. RESULTS: 84–87% of respondents perceived COVID-19 has affected their daily routine in the activities related to diet, work/school, income, social activities and to lesser extent, 78.8% in entertainment activities and 67.9% in health activity. For the current food acquisition and consumption compared to pre-COVID-19 situation, 77.3% reported less grocery shopping, 74.2% decreased activities of eating with someone else, 39.6% reduced consumption of fresh foods, and 23.4% decreased consumption of stable foods. Also, 92.3% of respondents experienced restriction to market access for food acquisition. In light of this, 74.4% of respondents found food assistance to be helpful coping with a negative impact of COVID-19, the highest among other assistances (below 10%). Only 25.7% of respondents reported wearing facial masks whenever out and 67.9% did not perceive any change of their health and hygiene practices after COVID-19. 58.7% of respondents responded that public health messages were helpful to cope with the current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: While COVID-19 has hit every area of routine and lives, food-related activities and assistance were perceived to be affected the hardest compared to other daily activities in rural Bangladesh. People fear about infections through gathering, not wearing masks, and going out, however, disease prevention practices does not follow as much as they fear. This study suggest that the food security intervention deserves urgent attention as well as educational information dissemination on the prevention and protection measures of COVID-19.

However, most of them are not aware of this condition, which motivates many volunteers to set up health awareness booths to give them free health screening. As a result, a screening tool that can be operated on various platforms is needed to support the automated pterygium assessment. One of the crucial functions of this assessment is to extract the infected regions, which directly correlates with the severity levels. Hence, Group-PPM-Net is proposed by integrating a spatial pyramid pooling module (PPM) and group convolution to the deep learning segmentation network. The system uses a standard mobile phone camera input, which is then fed to a modified encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, inspired by a Fully Convolutional Dense Network that consists of a total of 11 dense blocks. A PPM is integrated into the network because of its multi-scale capability, which is useful for multi-scale tissue extraction. The shape of the tissues remains relatively constant, but the size will differ according to the severity levels. Moreover, group and shuffle convolution modules are also integrated at the decoder side of Group-PPM-Net by placing them at the starting layer of each dense block. The addition of these modules allows better correlation among the filters in each group, while the shuffle process increases channel variation that the filters can learn from. The results show that the proposed method obtains mean accuracy, mean intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and Jaccard index performances of 0.9330, 0.8640, 11.5474, and 0.7966, respectively.","Abdani, Siti Raihanah; Zulkifley, Mohd Asyraf; Zulkifley, Nuraisyah Hani",Diagnostics (Basel),683,32

The aim of the current study was to characterize the changes in the fecal microbiota diversity and composition of weaned piglets following an oral challenge with an ETEC: F4 strain and/or a treatment with colistin sulfate (CS). Twenty-eight piglets were used in this experiment and were divided into four groups: challenged untreated, challenged treated, unchallenged treated, and unchallenged untreated. Rectal swab samples were collected at five sampling times throughout the study. Total genomic DNA was used to assess the fecal microbiota diversity and composition using the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The relative abundance, the composition, and the community structure of piglet fecal microbiota was highly affected by the ETEC: F4 challenge throughout the experiment, while the oral treatment with CS, a narrow spectrum antibiotic, resulted in a significant decrease of E. coli/Shigella populations during the treatment period only. This study was the first to identify some gut microbiota subgroups (e.g., Streptococcus, Lachnospiraceae) that are associated with healthy piglets as compared to ETEC: F4 challenged animals.

Effective approaches targeting cardiovascular health for diabetic patients are urgently needed. Crocodile blood, an emerging dietary supplement, was suggested to have anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro, which have yet to be proven in animal models. This study thereby aimed to evaluate whether crocodile blood can protect vascular function in diabetic mice against oxidation and inflammation. Diabetic db/db mice and their counterparts db/m(+) mice were treated daily with crocodile blood soluble fraction (CBSF) or vehicle via oral gavage for 4 weeks before their aortae were harvested for endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) quantification using wire myograph, which is a well-established functional study for vascular function indication. Organ culture experiments culturing mouse aortae from C57BL/6 J mice with or without IL-1β and CBSF were done to evaluate the direct effect of CBSF on endothelial function. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in mouse aortae were assessed by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining with inflammatory markers in endothelial cells quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). CBSF significantly improved deteriorated EDR in db/db diabetic mice through both diet supplementation and direct culture, with suppression of ROS level in mouse aortae. CBSF also maintained EDR and reduced ROS levels in mouse aortae against the presence of pro-inflammatory IL-1β. Under the pro-inflammatory state induced by IL-1β, gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines were downregulated, while the protective transcripts UCP2 and SIRT6 were upregulated in endothelial cells. Our study suggests a novel beneficial effect of crocodile blood on vascular function in diabetic mice and that supplementation of diet with crocodile blood may act as a complementary approach to protect against vascular diseases through anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation in diabetic patients.

Unfortunately, anemia is a known dose-limiting side effect of these inhibitors and presents a major caveat to development of antiglycolytic therapies. We developed specific inhibitors of enolase – a critical enzyme in glycolysis – and validated their metabolic and cellular effects on human erythrocytes. Enolase inhibition increases erythrocyte susceptibility to oxidative damage and induces rapid and premature erythrocyte senescence, rather than direct hemolysis.

Spinal cord stimulation with dorsal epidural leads can be used to treat back and leg pain in FBSS patients. This paper presents a detailed protocol for using spinal cord stimulation with surgical leads in FBSS patients. In our department, with the patient under general anesthesia, we place the lead in the epidural space by means of a small laminectomy at the 10th thoracic level. Placement of the lead is followed by a 1 month trial period with an externalized lead. If pain relief is greater than 50% at the end of this 1 month stimulation trial (required by Belgian reimbursement criteria), an internal pulse generator is then placed under the skin and connected to the lead in a second surgical procedure. We have demonstrated that using this technique in rigorously selected FBSS patients can significantly improve back pain, leg pain, patient activity, and quality of life for a sustained period of time.","Remacle, Thibault; Gilis, Nathalie; Mauviel, Stéphane; Remacle, Jean Michel",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,683,19

Especially for adolescents, who highly rely on social contacts with peers, the prolonged period of social isolation may have detrimental effects on their mental health. Based on the mood management theory, the current study examines if social media are beneficial for adolescents to cope with feelings of anxiety and loneliness during the quarantine. A survey study among 2,165 (Belgian) adolescents (13-19 years old) tested how feelings of anxiety and loneliness contributed to their happiness level, and whether different social media coping strategies (active, social relations, and humor) mediated these relations. Structural equation modeling revealed that feelings of loneliness had a higher negative impact on adolescents' happiness than feelings of anxiety. However, anxious participants indicated to use social media more often to actively seek for a manner to adapt to the current situation, and to a lesser extent as a way to keep in touch with friends and family. The indirect effect of anxiety on happiness through active coping was significantly positive. Participants who were feeling lonely were more inclined to use social media to cope with lacking social contact. However, this coping strategy was not significantly related to their happiness feelings. Humorous coping was positively related with feelings of happiness, but not influenced by loneliness or anxiety. To conclude, social media can be used as a constructive coping strategy for adolescents to deal with anxious feelings during the COVID-19 quarantine.","Cauberghe, Verolien; Van Wesenbeeck, Ini; De Jans, Steffi; Hudders, Liselot; Ponnet, Koen","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",683,1

Ventilator weaning protocols have been introduced, and extubation is conducted based on the results of a spontaneous breathing trial. Room for improvement still exists in extubation management, and additional objective indices may improve the safety of the weaning and extubation process. Static lung-thorax compliance reflects lung expansion difficulty that is caused by several conditions, such as atelectasis, fibrosis, and pleural effusion. Nevertheless, it is not used commonly in the weaning and extubation process. In this study, we investigated whether lung-thorax compliance is a good index of extubation failure in adults even when patients pass a spontaneous breathing trial. Methods In a single-center, retrospective cohort study, patients over 18 years of age were mechanically ventilated, weaned with proportional assist ventilation, and underwent a spontaneous breathing trial process in surgical intensive care units of Kagawa University Hospital from July 2014 to June 2016. Extubation failure was the outcome measure of the study. We defined extubation failures as when patients were reintubated or underwent non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation within 24 h after extubation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical involvement of several parameters. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the discriminative power of the parameters. Results We analyzed 173 patients and compared the success and failure groups. Most patients (162, 93.6%) were extubated successfully, and extubation failed in 11 patients (6.4%). The averages of lung-thorax compliance values in the success and failure groups were 71.9 ± 23.0 and 43.3 ± 14.6 mL/cmH2O, respectively, and were significantly different (p < 0.0001). In the ROC curve analysis, the AUC was highest for lung-thorax compliance (0.862), followed by the respiratory rate (0.821), rapid shallow breathing index (0.781), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (0.72), heart rate (0.715), and tidal volume (0.695). Conclusions Lung-thorax compliance measured during a spontaneous breathing trial is a potential indicator of extubation failure in postoperative patients.","Okabe, Yugo; Asaga, Takehiko; Bekku, Sayuri; Suzuki, Hiromi; Kanda, Kanae; Yoda, Takeshi; Hirao, Tomohiro; Shirakami, Gotaro",Journal of intensive care,683,31

As a result of these findings, an increase in inflammation and preatherogenic factors is observed, and these changes may lead to endothelial dysfunction. AIM Our study aims to reveal possible cardiac risks (systolic-diastolic functions and endothelial dysfunctions) in patients who have applied to the emergency department with hypoglycemia. METHODS This cross-sectional, case-control study included 46 hypoglycemia patients who admitted to the emergency with symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia and diagnosed with hypoglycemia and 30 healthy volunteers. All patients were evaluated with baseline echocardiography, tissue-Doppler imaging (carotid and brachial artery). Also, the fasting blood tests of the patients referred to the internal medicine department were examined. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups regarding age, weight, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Vitamin B12, TSH, and fasting blood glucose levels were similar in the groups' blood tests (all P values > .05). We observed a statistically significant decrease in diastolic dysfunction parameters: E/A and E/e' ratios (respectively, P = .020 and 0.026). It was shown that insulin resistance was influential in forming these considerable differences. The patient group observed that the carotid intima-media thickness was more remarkable (P = .001), and the brachial flow-mediated dilatation value was smaller (P = .003), giving an idea about endothelial functions. CONCLUSION As a message, we can say that hypoglycemia may affect diastolic functions in addition to endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, even young individuals without any chronic diseases may need follow-up in terms of possible risks.","Akhan, Onur; Ardahanli, Isa",Echocardiography,683,1

However, safety, tolerability and efficacy data in connection with functional brain activity from larger samples are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine clinical and cognitive effects of MST and the influence of MST on regional brain glucose metabolism. METHOD Twenty-six patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) underwent MST. Ten patients underwent a randomized trial and 16 patients an open-label study design. The primary outcome criterion was the severity of depressive symptoms assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Depressive symptoms, tolerability and cognitive safety, along with social functioning and quality of life parameters, were assessed using various rating scales. A clinical follow-up visit 6 months following the completion of a course of MST and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans of 12 patients were analysed. RESULTS A significant response to MST was demonstrated by 69% of the patient sample, with 46% meeting remission criteria. Anxiety ratings were significantly reduced in responders and their quality of life was improved. Half of the responders relapsed within 6 months. No cognitive side-effects were observed. FDG-PET scans showed a metabolic increase in the frontal cortex bilaterally and a decrease in the left striatum. CONCLUSIONS Robust antidepressant and anti-anxiety efficacy of MST was demonstrated, and found to be associated with localized metabolic changes in brain areas that are strongly implicated in depression. Thus, MST presents an effective, well-tolerated and safe treatment option for patients unable to respond to other forms of therapy for depression.","Kayser, S; Bewernick, B H; Matusch, A; Hurlemann, R; Soehle, M; Schlaepfer, T E",Psychological medicine,683,24

OBJECTIVES This study compared the risk of initiation of antipsychotic medications among older adults with dementia treated with the ChEIs donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used multiyear (2013-2015) Medicare claims data involving Parts A, B, and D. The study sample included community-dwelling older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) with a diagnosis of dementia. The study identified new users of ChEIs and followed them for up to 180 days for antipsychotic initiation. The ChEIs included donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, whereas antipsychotics included typical and atypical agents. Donepezil was used as the reference category as it is the most commonly used ChEI and only acts on acetylcholinesterase, whereas both rivastigmine and galantamine have dual mechanisms of action. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression compared the risk of and time to antipsychotic initiation among the three ChEIs, adjusting for other risk factors. RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 178,441 older adults with dementia who were new users of ChEIs. A total of 23,433 (15.14%) donepezil users, 4114 (19.04%) rivastigmine users, and 324 (15.77%) galantamine users initiated antipsychotics. The mean time to antipsychotic initiation among patients who received antipsychotics was 109.29 ± 69.72 days for donepezil users, 96.70 ± 71.60 days for rivastigmine users, and 104.15 ± 72.53 days for galantamine users. The Cox regression analysis showed that rivastigmine (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.34) was significantly associated with antipsychotic initiation compared with donepezil, whereas no significant difference was observed between galantamine and donepezil (aHR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81-1.20). CONCLUSION The study found a 27% increased risk of antipsychotic initiation among users of rivastigmine compared with donepezil users. There was no difference between galantamine and donepezil for antipsychotic initiation. Although the limitations of the study should be considered, the results suggest that donepezil or galantamine may be more appropriate treatments for older patients with dementia, to minimize antipsychotic use.","Rege, Sanika; Carnahan, Ryan M; Johnson, Michael L; Chen, Hua; Holmes, Holly M; Aparasu, Rajender R",Drugs & aging,683,1
84170,84170,84170,Send cat and dog samples to test for SARS-CoV-2.,10.134711,9.978736,2020-05-25,"BACKGROUND If left untreated, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can cause significant distress and impact on functioning throughout the lifespan. Despite the severity of the disorder, there is often a significant delay between the onset of symptoms and successful treatment. This is in part due to delays in recognising OCD symptoms in young people, particularly if the symptom forms are less common. Once OCD is accurately diagnosed, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment, sometimes in combination with medication, producing good long-term prognosis. It is therefore important to accurately detect OCD in children and young people so that they can be offered timely intervention. Use of the best tools in clinical and research settings improves detection and diagnosis, as well as enabling the tracking of progress through treatment. The aim of this current paper was to review measurement tools for OCD in young people with a focus on the practicalities of using tools in busy child mental health clinical settings. METHOD To discover what measurement tools are available for OCD in young people, we conducted a pragmatic literature of measurement tools for OCD in young people. We searched PsycINFO, Med-Line and the Cochrane databases for reports relating to the measurement of OCD. Additionally, we sought information from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, the Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC) website and the Children and Young People's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT) Programme. We also reviewed large trials and meta-analyses of the treatment of OCD in young people and communicated with relevant researchers/clinicians. RESULTS Seventeen questionnaire measurement tools, with variable psychometric properties, and four commonly used semistructured clinician administered interview measures were identified. CONCLUSIONS There are several measurement tools with good psychometric properties that are useful for initial screening/identification of OCD, as well as formal diagnosis, symptom tracking and treatment evaluation. With the availability of brief screens, as well as online diagnostic measures, such tools should not be a burden on clinical practice, but rather a helpful aid to support clinicians' assessment and treatment of OCD.","Bennett, Sophie D; Coughtrey, Anna E; Shafran, Roz; Heyman, Isobel",Child and adolescent mental health,683,16

Postoperative penile rehabilitation seeks to restore erectile function but results have been conflicting. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of penile rehabilitation strategies in restoring erectile function following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and a grey literature repository (Grey Literature Report) from their inception through to 3 January 2018. We also searched the reference lists of other relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials with a parallel or cross-over design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence according to GRADE on a per-outcome basis. Primary outcomes were self-reported potency, erectile function measured by validated questionnaires (with potency defined as an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) score of 19 or greater and or an IIEF-5 of score of 17 or greater) and serious adverse events. For all quality of life assessments on a continuous scale, higher values indicated better quality of life. MAIN RESULTS We included eight randomised controlled trials with 1699 participants across three comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of this review only.Scheduled phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) versus placebo or no treatmentScheduled PDE5I may have little or no effect on short-term (up to 12 months) self-reported potency (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to1.41; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 47 more men with self-reported potency per 1000 (95% CI 33 fewer to 149 more) and short-term erectile function as assessed by a validated instrument (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 28 more men per 1000 (95% CI 50 fewer to 138 more), but we are very uncertain of both of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in fewer serious adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; low quality evidence), though this does not appear biologically plausible and may represent a chance finding. We are also very uncertain of this finding. We found no long-term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes.Scheduled PDE5I versus on-demand PDE5I Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in both short-term and long-term (greater than 12 months) self-reported potency (short term: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.53; long term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.67; both very low quality evidence); this corresponds to nine fewer men with self-reported short-term potency per 1000 (95% CI 119 fewer to 166 more) and zero fewer men with self-reported long-term potency per 1000 (95% CI 153 fewer to 257 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in short-term and long-term erectile function (short term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.55; long term; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14; both very-low quality evidence), which corresponds to zero men with short-term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 80 fewer to 125 more) and 119 fewer men with long-term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 239 fewer to 64 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in little or no effects on short-term adverse events (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.12 to 4.04; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to seven fewer men with short-term serious adverse events (95% CI 18 fewer to 64 more), but we are very uncertain of these findings. We found no long-term data for serious adverse events.Scheduled PDE5I versus scheduled intraurethral prostaglandin E1At short-term follow-up, daily PDE5I may result in little or no effect on self-reported potency (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79, to 1.52; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 46 more men per 1000 (95% CI 97 fewer to 241 more). Daily PDE5I may result in a small improvement of erectile function (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.20; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 92 more men per 1000 (95% CI 23 fewer to 318 more) but we are very uncertain of both these findings. We found no long-term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes.We found no evidence for any other comparisons and were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on nerve-sparing approach, age or baseline erectile function. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on mostly very-low and some low-quality evidence, penile rehabilitation strategies consisting of scheduled PDE5I use following radical prostatectomy may not promote self-reported potency and erectile function any more than on demand use.","Philippou, Yiannis A; Jung, Jae Hung; Steggall, Martin J; O'Driscoll, Stephen T; Bakker, Caitlin J; Bodie, Joshua A; Dahm, Philipp",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,683,1

Clozapine is without doubt the only antipsychotic available with repeatedly proven efficacy in treatment resistant schizophrenia.1 Replacing clozapine with an alternative antipsychotic in patients stabilized with clozapine can potentially lead to higher risk of relapse or exacerbation of severity of illness.1 Clozapine, as already known, has a number of side effects, some of which can be serious, thus patients receiving clozapine require ongoing scheduled monitoring. Side effects of clozapine include neutropenia or agranulocytosis, myocarditis, fever, hypersalivation, weight gain and constipation. These side effects can be detected and treated when recognized on time decreasing the possibility of serious consequences making the implementation of an ongoing treatment monitoring protocol for patients on clozapine mandatory.2 Since it was advised for all mental health providers in most countries worldwide to limit non-urgent hospital visits and procedures to reduce the risk of contamination a challenge arose for patients' ability to access health care facilities for their routine clozapine monitoring. Nevertheless, the majority of Mental Health Care Authorities decided to ensure access for all patients on clozapine to their routine monitoring protocol.3,4 To date, no data exist on any potential relationship between antipsychotic use and the risk of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or the development of severe symptoms of the infection. The literature suggests that patients receiving antipsychotics, especially clozapine, have an increased risk of developing pneumonia, leading to the assumption that patients receiving clozapine are at higher risk to develop COVID-19. 1 Balancing the importance of monitoring continuation against the increased risk for COVID-19, an International Consensus Statement was recently published addressing a monitoring protocol with reduced visits. The Consensus suggested reduced hematologic monitoring frequency of every 3 months with a prescription of 90 days clozapine supply (if safe). The above applies to patients receiving clozapine for at least one year without neutropenia. Τhe risk of neutropenia after 12 months of clozapine treatment falls significantly.4 Based on the above it is suggested to all clozapine clinics to implement a guidance monitoring protocol for all patients on clozapine to ensure safety during the pandemic. Besides hematological monitoring that requires physical contact with healthcare workers it is significant to implement a telemedicine appointment in frequent intervals to monitor symptoms of infection, symptoms of cardiovascular diseases and constipation. Patient should also be advised to regularly monitor one's blood pressure and pulses and ideally be educated on how by a member of the staff. If a patient is detected with any symptoms related to the above an emergency appointment for evaluation should be planned. Overall, since both the consequences and the duration of the pandemic are unknown, mental health services must work jointly to implement a clozapine monitoring plan to ensure safe continuation in such a vulnerable population.","Nystazaki, Maria; Alevizopoulos, Giorgos",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,683,16

After cinnamaldehyde treatment, this immunosuppressive function of CAFs was partially reversed. To explore the molecular mechanism, Western blotting and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were applied, and TLR4-dependent signaling pathway-related protein and mRNA levels were quantified. Results Cinnamaldehyde acted on the TLR4-dependent signaling pathway, altering the function of CAFs such that its supernatant no longer inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Conclusion These data indicate that cinnamaldehyde can modify the functions of CAFs, which may be helpful for treating tumors.

The implementation of naloxone programs, such as 'take-home naloxone' (THN), has emerged as a key intervention in reducing opioid overdose deaths. These programs aim to train individuals at risk of witnessing or experiencing an opioid overdose to recognize an opioid overdose and respond with naloxone. Naloxone effectively reverses opioid overdoses on a physiological level; however, there are outstanding questions on community THN program effectiveness (adverse events, dosing requirements, dose-response between routes of administration) and implementation (accessibility, availability, and affordability). The objective of this scoping review is to identify existing systematic reviews and best practice guidelines relevant to clinical and operational guidance on the distribution of THN. METHODS Using the Arksey & O'Malley framework for scoping reviews, we searched both academic literature and grey literature databases using keywords (Naloxone) AND (Overdose) AND (Guideline OR Review OR Recommendation OR Toolkit). Only documents which had a structured review of evidence and/or provided summaries or recommendations based on evidence were included (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, short-cut or rapid reviews, practice/clinical guidelines, and reports). Data were extracted from selected evidence in two key areas: (1) study identifiers; and (2) methodological characteristics. RESULTS A total of 47 articles met inclusion criteria: 20 systematic reviews; 10 grey literature articles; 8 short-cut or rapid reviews; 4 scoping reviews; and 5 other review types (e.g. mapping review and comprehensive reviews). The most common subject themes were: naloxone effectiveness, safety, provision feasibility/acceptability of naloxone distribution, dosing and routes of administration, overdose response after naloxone administration, cost-effectiveness, naloxone training and education, and recommendations for policy, practice and gaps in knowledge. CONCLUSIONS Several recent systematic reviews address the effectiveness of take-home naloxone programs, naloxone dosing/route of administration, and naloxone provision models. Gaps remain in the evidence around evaluating cost-effectiveness, training parameters and strategies, and adverse events following naloxone administration.

The first was disseminated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the second, which is more usable due to the lower difficulty of calculation and the availability of data, was adopted by various regional and local institutions.The rationale for the Rt index refers to that for the R0 index, the basic reproduction number, which is used by infectivologists as a measure of contagiousness of a given infectious agent in a completely susceptible population. The RDt index, on the other hand, is borrowed from the techniques of time series analysis for the trend of an event measurement that develops as a function of time. The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population.The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects.The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices. The maximum correlation between Rt and RDt is reached at lag 7 with a value of R exceeding 0.97 (R2=0.944).The two indices, albeit formally distinct, are both valid; they show specific aspects of the phenomenon, but provide basically similar information to the public health decision-maker. Their distinction lies not so much in the method of calculation, rather in the use of different information, i.e., the beginning of symptoms and the swabs outcome.Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a judgment of preference for one of the two indices, but only to invite people to understand their different potentials so that they can choose the one they consider the most appropriate for the purpose they want to use it for.","Giraudo, Maria Teresa; Falcone, Manuele; Cadum, Ennio; Deandrea, Silvia; Scondotto, Salvatore; Mattaliano, Andrea; Di Pietrantonj, Carlo; Bisceglia, Lucia; Duca, Piergiorgio; Cislaghi, Cesare",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,683,16

The scale and frequency of large-scale international events pose substantial risks to the spread of infectious diseases. The available literature on respiratory tract infections at the Hajj pilgrimage - annually attended by 3 million pilgrims from all over the globe - are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS The most common respiratory tract infection viruses are influenza and rhinovirus. Despite the occurrence of the Hajj during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic the available literature did not show an increased rate of infection. In hospitalized patients, pneumonia is a significant cause of admission accounting for 20-50% of such admissions. SUMMARY The use of masks may reduce exposure to droplet nuclei, the main mode of transmission of most respiratory tract infections. The practice of social distancing, hand hygiene, and contact avoidance was associated with reduced risk of respiratory illness. In addition, utilizing the recommended vaccines would decrease the risk of acquiring respiratory tract pathogens.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Zumla, Alimuddin; Memish, Ziad A",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,683,6

A rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis is important to provide a balanced view of current knowledge on the effect of vitamin D on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and physical performance. OBJECTIVES This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations and physical performance in athletes. METHODS Multiple electronic databases were searched, and study eligibility, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction were completed independently and in duplicate. Studies were stratified by baseline vitamin D sufficiency, season, and latitude. A cut-off of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) of 25(OH)D was used for sufficiency. Absolute mean differences (AMDs) between vitamin D and placebo using random effects analysis, and heterogeneity using Q statistic and I 2 index, were calculated. AMD with 95% confidence interval (CI), p value, and I 2 are reported. RESULTS In total, 13 RCTs (2005-2016) with 532 athletes (vitamin D 311, placebo 221) were eligible. A total of 433 athletes (vitamin D 244, placebo 189) had complete outcome data. Among athletes with baseline values suggesting insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation led to significant increases from 3000 IU (AMD 15.2 ng/ml; 95% CI 10.7-19.7, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 0%) and 5000 IU (AMD 27.8 ng/ml; 95% CI 16.9-38.8, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 78%) per day at >45° latitudes. Both doses led to sufficiency concentrations during winter months. Among athletes with baseline vitamin D suggesting sufficiency, serum 25(OH)D sufficiency was maintained from different doses at both latitudes. Of 13 included trials, only seven measured different physical performances and none demonstrated a significant effect of vitamin D supplementation during 12 weeks of follow-up. CONCLUSION Despite achieving sufficiency in vitamin D concentrations from ≥3000 IU supplementation, physical performance did not significantly improve. Between-study heterogeneity was large, and well-designed RCTs examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations, physical performance, and injuries in different sports, latitudes, ethnicities, and vitamin D status are needed.","Farrokhyar, Forough; Sivakumar, Gayathri; Savage, Katey; Koziarz, Alex; Jamshidi, Sahab; Ayeni, Olufemi R; Peterson, Devin; Bhandari, Mohit",Sports medicine,683,5

Comparison of the percentage of disorder (PID) in nucleocapsid proteins VP30 and NP reveals high correlation between nucleocapsid PIDs and the case-fatality rates of EBOV. The higher disorder of these proteins is likely to be needed for more efficient multiplication of virus copies via more efficient viral RNA transcription and more promiscuous protein binding potential. This is important for the more efficient assistance of nucleocapsid in viral particle budding and of the assembly and mobility of viral proteins across the host membrane and within the cytoplasm. A more comprehensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of EBOV virulence would also lead to new and more effective strategies in vaccine development.,"Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A Keith; Uversky, Vladimir N",Molecular bioSystems,683,5

In this work, we developed a facile and effective ""one-pot"" deposition method based on dopamine polymerization for the development of cell-adhesive, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive titanium implants. Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-conjugated polymers, hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles, and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) were mixed with an alkaline dopamine solution, and then, titanium substrates were immersed in the mixture for an hour. During poly(dopamine) coating, the three types of bioactive substances were immobilized on the titanium surfaces. Our results indicate that RGD conjugation enhanced the adhesion of human bone marrow stem cell line, while HAp incorporation facilitated cellular osteodifferentiation. The immobilization of BMP-2 induced the osteogenesis of the stem cells, indicated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The mineralization on the deposited substrates was also enhanced greatly. This functionalized layer on titanium substrate promoted mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblast and improved osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. In conclusion, the surface modification method shows a great potential for enhancement of osteointegration of orthopaedic and dental implants.","Chien, Chih-Yuan; Tsai, Wei-Bor",ACS applied materials & interfaces,683,32

Culturally adapted cutoff scores for embedded PVTs were established using an analog study design. In addition, the psychometric properties of these measures when applying culturally adapted scores as compared to non-adapted scores were analyzed. METHOD Participants (N = 114) were administered three embedded PVTs (Reliable Digit Span, Phonetic Fluency Test, and Animal Semantic Fluency Test) in a randomized order. Following an analog design, control participants were instructed to perform to the best of their abilities and the analog group was instructed to simulate cognitive impairment. RESULTS In keeping with guidelines for specificity and sensitivity, the most culturally appropriate scores of ≤6, ≤27, and ≤16 were determined for the Reliable Digit Span, Phonetic Fluency Test, and the Semantic Fluency Test, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This the first study addressing culturally sensitive cutoffs for commonly used embedded validity measures using a European Spanish population. While these findings cannot be generalized to forensic or clinical populations at the present time, they support the claim that specific cutoff scores that are sensitive to cultural variables are necessary in addressing embedded validity measures of the Reliable Digit Span, Phonetic Fluency Test, and Semantic Fluency Test.","Daugherty, J C; Puente, A E; Lozano-Ruiz, A; Perez-Garcia, M",Applied neuropsychology.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this systematic review was to identify whether athlete age, sex, sport type, injury definition and mechanism contribute to the variable findings. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in October 2018 using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Scopus, EmBase and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed and published in English language, included athletes from any competition level, performed the FMS at baseline to determine risk groups based on FMS composite score, asymmetry or pain, and prospectively observed injury incidence during training and competition. Study eligibility assessment and data extraction was performed by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine odds ratio (OR), sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals. Sub-group analyses were based on athlete age, sex, sport type, injury definition, and injury mechanism. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies were included in the FMS composite score meta-analysis. There was a smaller effect for junior (OR = 1.03 [0.67-1.59]; p = 0.881) compared to senior athletes (OR = 1.80 [1.17-2.78]; p = 0.008) and for male (OR = 1.79 [1.08-2.96]; p = 0.024) compared to female (OR = 1.92 [0.43-8.56]; p = 0.392) athletes. FMS composite scores were most likely to be associated with increased injury risk in rugby (OR = 5.92 [1.67-20.92]; p = 0.006), and to a lesser extent American football (OR = 4.41 [0.94-20.61]; p = 0.059) and ice hockey (OR = 3.70 [0.89-15.42]; p = 0.072), compared to other sports. Specificity values were higher than sensitivity values for FMS composite score. Eleven studies were included in the FMS asymmetry meta-analysis with insufficient study numbers to generate sport type subgroups. There was a larger effect for senior (OR = 1.78 [1.16-2.73]; p = 0.008) compared to junior athletes (OR = 1.21 [0.75-1.96]; p = 0.432). Sensitivity values were higher than specificity values for FMS asymmetry. For all FMS outcomes, there were minimal differences across injury definitions and mechanisms. Only four studies provided information about FMS pain and injury risk. There was a smaller effect for senior athletes (OR = 1.28 [0.33-4.96]; p = 0.723) compared to junior athletes (OR = 1.71 [1.16-2.50]; p = 0.006). Specificity values were higher than sensitivity values for FMS pain. CONCLUSION Athlete age, sex and sport type explained some of the variable findings of FMS prospective injury-risk studies. FMS composite scores and asymmetry were more useful for estimating injury risk in senior compared to junior athletes. Effect sizes tended to be small except for FMS composite scores in rugby, ice hockey and American football athletes.

The 'Three Delays Model' suggests that maternal deaths are a consequence of delays in: seeking care, reaching medical care and receiving care. Birth Preparedness and Complication Readiness (BPCR) refers to a plan organised during pregnancy in preparation for a normal birth and in case of complications. Male partners in many Sub-Saharan African communities could play a pivotal role in a woman's ability to prepare for birth and respond to obstetric complications. This review aimed identify: the extent and quality of research performed on the topic of male partner involvement in BPCR in Sub-Saharan Africa; the degree to which populations and geographic areas are represented; how male partner involvement has been conceptualized; how male partners response to obstetric complications has been conceptualised; how the variation in male partners involvement has been measured and if any interventions have been performed. METHODS In this scoping review, articles were identified through a systematic search of databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Maternity and Infant Care and a manual scan of relevant papers, journals and websites. All authors contributed to the screening process and a quality assessment using the Kmet checklist. The PRISMA checking list for Scoping Reviews was used to guide the search, data charting and reporting of the review The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019126263). RESULTS Thirty-five articles met inclusion criteria, reporting: 13 qualitative, 13 cross-sectional, 5 mixed method and 4 intervention studies. Data were contributed by approximately 14,550 participants (numbers were not always reported for focus groups) including: women who were pregnant or who had experienced pregnancy or childbirth within the previous 3 years, their male partners and key informants such as health workers and community leaders. CONCLUSIONS The diversity of study designs, aims and source countries in this body of literature reflects an emerging stage of research; as a result, the review yielded strong evidence in some areas and gaps in others. Male partner's involvement in BPCR and responding to obstetric emergencies can be conceptualised as being centrally involved in responding to complications and having some role in preparing for birth through their position in the chain of decisions and provision of logistic support. However, their knowledge of pregnancy complications and level of preparation for birth is low, suggesting they are making decisions without being fully informed. There is limited evidence on interventions to improve their knowledge. Future research efforts should be focused on producing standardised, culturally appropriate, higher level evidence.","Forbes, Faye; Wynter, Karen; Zeleke, Berihun M; Fisher, Jane",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,683,29

METHODS A post hoc analysis to examine the effects of pregabalin on pain quality in patients with moderate-to-severe peripheral neuropathic pain was performed using data from an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal proof-of-concept study. Patients rated the quality of their pain experience using the Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS) at baseline, after a 12-day titration period, after a 9-day maintenance period, and after a 19-day randomized withdrawal period. Pretitration to posttitration and prewithdrawal to postwithdrawal changes in PQAS paroxysmal, surface, and deep pain scale scores were examined. RESULTS PQAS data were available for 99 of the 104 participants who entered all phases of the study. There were significant (P<0.006, Bonferroni adjusted for multiple tests) improvements pretitration to posttitration in all 3 PQAS subscales, with a greater effect on paroxysmal and deep pain than on surface pain. During the withdrawal phase, pregabalin was significantly (P<0.006) more effective than placebo for improvements in paroxysmal and surface pain only, although the pregabalin group continued to show numerical improvement in deep pain relative to placebo. DISCUSSION Pregabalin had a greater effect on PQAS-assessed paroxysmal pain than on surface or deep pain in patients with peripheral neuropathy. The findings corroborate previous research demonstrating differential effects of analgesic drugs across pain qualities, further emphasizing the need to assess individual pain qualities in addition to overall pain intensity.","Jensen, Mark P; Gammaitoni, Arnold R; Bolognese, James A; Alon, Achilles; Smugar, Steven S; Galer, Bradley S; Hewitt, David J",The Clinical journal of pain,683,28

This review seeks to answer two research questions from the perspectives of older adults with MCC, their caregivers and their health care providers (HCPs): 1) What are the health and social care needs of community-dwelling older adults with MCC and their caregivers? and 2) How do social and structural determinants of health impact these health and social care needs? METHODS We conducted a scoping review guided by a refinement of the Arksey & O'Malley framework. Articles were included if participants were 55 years or older and have at least two chronic conditions. We searched 7 electronic databases. The data were summarized using thematic analysis. RESULTS Thirty-six studies were included in this review: 28 studies included participants with MCC; 12 studies included HCPs; 5 studies included caregivers. The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to good. Five main areas of needs were identified: need for information; coordination of services and supports; preventive, maintenance and restorative strategies; training for older adults, caregivers and HCPs to help manage the older adults' complex conditions; and the need for person-centred approaches. Structural and social determinants of health such as socioeconomic status, education and access influenced the needs of older adults with MCC. CONCLUSION The review highlights that most of the needs of older adults with MCC focus on lack of access to information and coordination of care. The main structural and social determinants that influenced older adults' needs were their level of education/health literacy and their socioeconomic status.","McGilton, Katherine S; Vellani, Shirin; Yeung, Lily; Chishtie, Jawad; Commisso, Elana; Ploeg, Jenny; Andrew, Melissa K; Ayala, Ana Patricia; Gray, Mikaela; Morgan, Debra; Chow, Amanda Froehlich; Parrott, Edna; Stephens, Doug; Hale, Lori; Keatings, Margaret; Walker, Jennifer; Wodchis, Walter P; Dubé, Veronique; McElhaney, Janet; Puts, Martine",BMC geriatrics,683,7

How the distinct signals from lipid bilayer stress and unfolded proteins are processed by the conserved UPR transducer Ire1 remains unknown. Here, we have generated a functional, cysteine-less variant of Ire1 and performed systematic cysteine cross-linking experiments in native membranes to establish its transmembrane architecture in signaling-active clusters. We show that the transmembrane helices of two neighboring Ire1 molecules adopt an X-shaped configuration independent of the primary cause for ER stress. This suggests that different forms of stress converge in a common, signaling-active transmembrane architecture of Ire1.","Väth, Kristina; Mattes, Carsten; Reinhard, John; Covino, Roberto; Stumpf, Heike; Hummer, Gerhard; Ernst, Robert",The Journal of cell biology,683,1

Here we aimed to investigate the roles of cytochromes P450s (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and efflux transporters in metabolism and disposition of CA.Metabolism of CA were evaluated in HLM, expressed CYPs and UGTs. Chemical inhibitors and shRNA-mediated gene siliencing of multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were performed to assess the roles of transporters in CA disposition.Three oxidated metabolites (M1-M3) and two glucuronides (M4-M5) were detected. The intrinsic clearances (CLint) values of M1 and M4 in HLM were 48.10 and 184.03 μL/min/mg, respectively. Additionally, CYP1A1, 2C8 and 2C19 were identified as main contributors with CLint values of 13.01 ∼ 49.36 μL/min/mg, while UGT1A1, 1A7, 1A8 and 1A9 were with CLint values ranging form 85.01 to 284.07 μL/min/mg. Furthermore, activity correlation analysis proved CYP2C8, UGT1A1 and 1A9 were main active hepatic isozymes. Besides, rats and monkeys were appropriate model animals. Moreover, dipyridamole and MK571 both could significantly inhibit M4 efflux. Gene silencing results also indicated MRP4 and BCRP were major contributors in HeLa1A1 cells.Taken together, CYPs, UGTs, MRP4 and BCRP were important determinants of CA pharmacokinetics.","Li, Yang; Xu, Jinjin; Xu, Chunxia; Qin, Zifei; Li, Shishi; Hu, Liufang; Yao, Zhihong; Gonzalez, Frank J; Yao, Xinsheng",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,683,12

To minimize postoperative gastroparesis, we have developed a new modified laparoscopic pyloroplasty (LP) technique for use during laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (LSD). METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of 31 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding and secondary hypersplenism who underwent synchronous LSD with modified LP (n = 14) or LSD without modified LP (n = 17) between January 2015 and August 2015. Perioperative variables were compared. RESULTS LSD with and without modified LP were successful in all patients. Operation time was significantly longer for LSD with modified LP than LSD without modified LP ( P = .001). However, the LSD with modified LP group had significantly reduced incidences of bloating 1 month postoperatively ( P < .05), nausea ( P < .05), and bloating ( P < .05) 3 months postoperatively, gastric retention 3 months postoperatively ( P < .0001), and prokinetic use at 1 month ( P = .009) and 3 months postoperatively ( P < .05) compared with the LSD without modified LP group. Gastric emptying scintigraphy showed that the mean time required to empty 50% of the ingested meal was significantly shorter in the LSD with modified LP group than in the LSD without modified LP group at 3 months postoperatively (74.3 ± 19.1 vs 261.7 ± 61.0 minutes, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Modified LP during LSD was feasible, effective, and safe, and significantly reduced short-term symptoms of postoperative gastroparesis.","Jiang, Guoqing; Bai, Dousheng; Qian, Jianjun; Chen, Ping; Jin, Shengjie",Surgical innovation,683,16

Estimates for the number of present-day infections that will, at a later date, prove to be fatal are derived through a nowcasting model, which relates the day of death of each deceased patient to the corresponding day of registration of the infection. Our district-level modelling approach for fatal infections disentangles spatial variation into a global pattern for Germany, district-specific long-term effects and short-term dynamics, while also taking the age and gender structure of the regional population into account. This enables to highlight areas with unexpectedly high disease activity. The analysis of death counts contributes to a better understanding of the spread of the disease while being, to some extent, less dependent on testing strategy and capacity in comparison to infection counts. The proposed approach and the presented results thus provide reliable insight into the state and the dynamics of the pandemic during the early phases of the infection wave in spring 2020 in Germany, when little was known about the disease and limited data were available.","Schneble, Marc; De Nicola, Giacomo; Kauermann, Göran; Berger, Ursula",Biometrical journal.

However, such benefit is limited by the low survival of transplanted MSCs in an ischemic microenvironment. Previous studies showed that melatonin pretreatment can increase MSC survival in the ischemic kidney. However, whether it will improve MSC survival in cerebral ischemia is unknown. Our study examined the effect of melatonin pretreatment on MSCs under ischemia-related conditions in vitro and after transplantation into ischemic rat brain. Results showed that melatonin pretreatment greatly increased survival of MSCs in vitro and reduced their apoptosis after transplantation into ischemic brain. Melatonin-treated MSCs (MT-MSCs) further reduced brain infarction and improved neurobehavioral outcomes. Angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were greatly increased in the MT-MSC-treated rats. Melatonin treatment increased the level of p-ERK1/2 in MSCs, which can be blocked by the melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole. ERK phosphorylation inhibitor U0126 completely reversed the protective effects of melatonin, suggesting that melatonin improves MSC survival and function through activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Thus, stem cells pretreated by melatonin may represent a feasible approach for improving the beneficial effects of stem cell therapy for cerebral ischemia.","Tang, Yaohui; Cai, Beibei; Yuan, Falei; He, Xiaosong; Lin, Xiaojie; Wang, Jixian; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Cell transplantation,683,1

However, the impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here, we engineer the D614G mutation in the USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect. D614G enhances replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues through an improved infectivity of virions. Hamsters infected with the G614 variant produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, confirming clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. Sera from D614-infected hamsters exhibit modestly higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus.

Insights into the interplay between PEDV infection and the innate immune system are necessary for understanding the associated mechanism of pathogenesis. The transcription factor NF-κB plays an important role in regulating host immune responses. Here, we elucidated for the first time to our knowledge the potential mechanism of PEDV-mediated NF-κB activation in porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). During PEDV infection, NF-κB p65 was found to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and PEDV-dependent NF-κB activity was associated with viral dose and active replication. Using small interfering RNAs to screen different mRNA components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) or RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathways, we demonstrated that TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 contribute to NF-κB activation in response to PEDV infection, but not RIG-I. By screening PEDV structural proteins for their ability to induce NF-κB activities, we found that PEDV nucleocapsid protein (N) could activate NF-κB and that the central region of N was essential for NF-κB activation. Furthermore, TLR2 was involved in PEDV N-induced NF-κB activation in IECs. Collectively, these findings provide new avenues of investigation into the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activation induced by PEDV infection.","Cao, Liyan; Ge, Xuying; Gao, Yu; Ren, Yudong; Ren, Xiaofeng; Li, Guangxing",The Journal of general virology,683,25

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition for which antibiotic use ranges from a few months to years of daily exposure. AIM To systemically search for and synthesise evidence on the risk of treatment-resistant infections, and other evidence of AMR, following long-term oral antibiotic use for acne. DESIGN & SETTING Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were searched using MeSH, EMTREE or other relevant terms and following a pre-registered protocol. METHOD Search strategies were developed with a librarian and run in July 2019. All searches date from database inception. The primary outcome was antibiotic treatment failure or infection caused by a resistant organism. Secondary outcomes included detection of resistant organisms without an infection, rate of infection, or changes to flora. RESULTS 6,996 records were identified. 73 full-text articles were shortlisted for full review, of which five were included. Two investigated rates of infection and three resistance or changes to microbial flora. Three studies had 35 or fewer participants (range 20-118,496). Three studies had a 'serious' or 'high' risk of bias, one 'moderate' and one a 'low' risk of bias. We found weak evidence for an association between antibiotic use for acne and subsequent increased rates of upper respiratory-tract infections and pharyngitis.

Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) are a powerful new class of immunotherapy drugs known as STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) agonists, currently in clinical trials. However, previous studies of CDNs in murine cancer models have required multiple injections, and improve survival only in relatively nonaggressive tumor models. Therefore, we sought to improve the efficacy of CDN immunotherapy by developing a novel biomaterial we call ""STINGel."" STINGel is an injectable peptide hydrogel that localizes and provides controlled release of CDN delivery, showing an 8-fold slower release rate compared to a standard collagen hydrogel. The carrier hydrogel is a positively charged, MultiDomain Peptide (MDP) which self-assembles to form a nanofibrous matrix and is easily delivered by syringe. The highly localized delivery of CDN from this nanostructured biomaterial affects the local histological response in a subcutaneous model, and dramatically improves overall survival in a challenging murine model of head and neck cancer compared to CDN alone or CDN delivered from a collagen hydrogel. This study demonstrates the feasibility of biomaterial-based immunotherapy platforms like STINGel as strategies for increasing the efficacy of CDN immunotherapies.","Leach, David G; Dharmaraj, Neeraja; Piotrowski, Stacey L; Lopez-Silva, Tania L; Lei, Yu L; Sikora, Andrew G; Young, Simon; Hartgerink, Jeffrey D",Biomaterials,683,1

Computational calculations employing the B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p) functional of DFT were executed to explore the optimized geometrical structures of ligands along with geometric parameters, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies. Global reactivity parameters estimated from FMO energy gaps signified the bioactive nature of ligands. The synthesized ligands were used for chelation with 3d-transition metals [VO(IV), Cr(III), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)] in 1 : 2 (metal : ligand) molar ratio. The spectral and magnetic results confirmed the formation of octahedral geometry around all the divalent and trivalent metal centres, whereas the tetravalent vanadyl centres were confirmed to have square-pyramidal geometry. All the as-synthesized compounds were investigated for in vitro antibacterial potential against two Gram-negative (Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli) and two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Antibacterial assay results displayed pronounced activity, and their activity is comparable to that of a standard drug (streptomycin). The antioxidant potential of these compounds was assessed by employing diphenyl picryl hydrazide radical scavenging activity. The results displayed that all the metal chelates have exhibited more bioactivity in contrast with free ligands. The chelation was the main reason for their enhanced bioactivity.

We estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0) of these enteroviruses to obtain a better understanding of their transmission dynamics. We merged records of cases from HFMD outbreaks reported between 2007 and 2012 with laboratory results from virological surveillance. R 0 was estimated based on the cumulative number of reported cases in the initial growth phase of each outbreak associated with the particular enterovirus type. A total of 33 HFMD outbreaks were selected based on the inclusion criteria specified for our study, of which five were associated with CV-A6, 13 with CV-A16, and 15 with EV-A71.

The dopaminergic and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) coexist in the gut and regulate different processes such as motility, absorption/secretion and inflammation. We investigated the changes in expression of major angiotensin and dopamine receptors in the colon of male, female and ovariectomized female mice. Possible interaction between both systems was investigated using male and female mice deficient (ko) for major angiotensin and dopamine receptors. In wild type mice, colonic tissue from females showed lower angiotensin type 1 (AT1)/angiotensin type 2 (AT2) ratio (an index of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory RAS balance), lower dopamine D1 and D2 receptor expression, and lower levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative markers relative to males. Interestingly, ovariectomy increased the expression of pro-inflammatory AT1 receptor expression and decreased anti-inflammatory AT2 receptor expression, increased D1 and D2 receptor expression, and increased the levels of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative markers. Ovariectomy-induced changes were blocked by estrogen replacement. The present results suggest a mutual regulation between colonic angiotensin and dopamine receptors, and sex differences in this mutual regulation. Estrogen regulates changes in both angiotensin and dopamine receptor expression, which may be involved in sex- and surgical menopause-related effects on gut motility, permeability and vulnerability to inflammatory processes.","Garrido-Gil, Pablo; Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I; Lage, Lucia; Labandeira-Garcia, Jose Luis","The journals of gerontology.

The study objective was to determine whether the histogram distribution of SpO2 over a 24-h period will predict readiness for weaning respiratory support in preterm infants. We hypothesize that infants with ≥15% of time spent with SpO2 <86% before transitioning from CPAP or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) to low-flow nasal cannula, oxyhood, or room air are more likely to fail transitioning. METHODS The SpO2 histograms were downloaded daily for 31 infants, 24-32 weeks gestational age, before transition from CPAP or HFNC to low-flow nasal cannula, oxyhood, or room air. The SpO2 histogram downloads were continued for each infant for 1 week after transition or when the infant reached 36 weeks postmenstrual age or when SpO2 monitoring was discontinued. Failure was defined as an increase in respiratory support within 72 h of transitioning. We compared the percentage of time for each SpO2 quintile for the 24-h periods before and immediately following CPAP/HFNC transitioning between groups. RESULTS Twenty-four subjects transitioned successfully, but 7 subjects failed. Two of 7 subjects (28.6%) who failed transition experienced SpO2 <86% ≥15% of the time pretransition compared with none in the success group (P = .045). The failure group experienced SpO2 <86% 10.7 ± 11.9% of time pre-wean compared with 3.3 ± 4.7% of time in the success group (P = .02).

However, the mechanisms underlying how discrete affective events shape memory formation and subsequent recall are not well understood. Further understanding this is important given the central role of negative biases in affective memory recall in depression and antidepressant drug action. In order to capture cognitive processes associated with affective memory formation and recall, we studied value-based decision-making between affective memories in two within-subject experiments (n=45 and n=74). Our findings suggest that discrete affective events, created by large magnitude Wheel of Fortune (WoF) outcomes, influence affective memory formation processes during reinforcement-learning (RL). After 24 hours, we show that healthy volunteers display stable preferences during value-based recall of affective memories in a binary decision-making task. Computational modelling of these preferences demonstrated a positive bias during value-based recall, induced by previously winning in the WoF. We further showed that value-based decision-making between affective memories engages the pupil-linked central arousal systems, leading to pupil constriction prior to, and differential pupil dilation after the decision onset depending on the valence of the chosen options.

Design/methodology/approach: To understand the challenges faced, data was collected from entrepreneurship students and entrepreneurship educators through focus group discussions. The study followed Kitzinger (1995) as data was analyzed in its entirety as a group and then individually. Groups and individuals were the focus of the analysis. The study applies the Kepner Trego problem analysis technique (KPTA) as the problem-solving technique adopted by the institute and SAP-LAP (situation, actor, process, learning, action, performance) to discuss the findings of the study. Findings: The study found that to engage, encourage and enable students to study on their start-up/business ideas;it is important to facilitate peer interactions, internships in start-ups and meaningful engagement with alumni entrepreneurs. Some proactive interventions are also expected from institutes to energize the student community with positivity. It is also important to nurture the emotional well-being of budding entrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications: The case study narrates the innovative and agile problem-solving approach of the business school during the pandemic. KPTA focuses more on appreciative dialogue and also helps to replicate the best from other situations to the problem areas. SAP-LAP method also helps practitioners to initiate the right new actions with targeted performance. Practical implications: As a greater number of academic institutions impart entrepreneurship education today, the findings of the study would be relevant to the stakeholders, including students, educators and institutes. Social implications: The study underpins the importance of the emotional well-being of entrepreneurs/student entrepreneurs and an innovative approach to keep the student moral high during such a challenging situation. Originality/value: It is an ongoing exercise at a business school where the challenges were identified, analyzed and solutions were implemented using a structured methodology such as focused group discussions, KPTA and SAPLAP. The innovative initiatives not only engaged the student well but also were able to ensure their emotional well-being. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brahmankar, Y.; Bedarkar, M.; Mishra, M.",International Journal of Innovation Science,683,16

One of the ways to solve this problem is to form a management measures based on forecasting the length of stay of tourists in accommodation facilities, load levels of hotel enterprises in tourist destinations of Ukraine, planning the production of competitive hotel services that can meet the needs of foreign and domestic consumers, market demand. This problem is especially important in the context of overcoming the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the article is to identify trends in the hotel business in the tourist regions of Ukraine and outline the prospects that can be realized in post-crisis conditions. The study used a statistical method of trend analysis of the dynamics of the duration of tourists in hotels, which aims at the establishing patterns of changes in the levels of the studied indicators over time, to identify the main trend of this phenomenon. The example of Odessa region proved that the evaluation of the hotel business areas are the basis for predicting spatial and temporal relationships in the regional economy for the development of hotel business in other tourist destinations, increase their competitiveness and improve the marketing of tourist flows. According to the calculations, the annual decrease in the length of stay of tourists for the period 2021-2022 in hotel establishments of the Odessa region is forecasted. The experience of experimental verification of the proposed approach to forecasting the length of stay of tourists in hotel establishments shows that the proposed research methods can form modem tools for diagnosing the current state of regional markets for hotel services and making management decisions.","Nezdoyminov, S.

Controversial cases of security related political communication, salient media enunciations, and social media reframing are explored through the theoretical lenses of securitization and cascading activation of framing in the contexts of Slovakia, Russia, and the United States. The first research question explores whether and how the frame element of moral evaluation factors into the conversations on the securitization of the pandemic. The analysis tracks the framing process through elite, media, and public levels of communication. The second research question focused on fairly controversial actors- ""rogue actors"" -such as individuals linked to far-leaning political factions or militias. The proliferation of digital media provides various actors with opportunities to join publicly visible conversations. The analysis demonstrates that the widely differing national contexts offer different trends and degrees in securitization of the pandemic during spring and summer of 2020. The studied rogue actors usually have something to say about the pandemic, and frequently make some reframing attempts based on idiosyncratic evaluations of how normatively appropriate is their government's ""war"" on COVID-19. In Slovakia, the rogue elite actors at first failed to have an impact but eventually managed to partially contest the dominant frame. Powerful Russian media influencers enjoy some conspiracy theories but prudently avoid direct challenges to the government's frame, and so far only marginal rogue actors openly advance dissenting frames. The polarized political and media environment in the US has shown to create a particularly fertile ground for rogue grassroots movements that utilize online platforms and social media, at times going as far as encouragement of violent acts to oppose the government and its pandemic response policy.","Lukacovic, M.

In Portugal, the main assessment method used is multiple-choice questions (MCQ). The virtual interactive patients (VIP) as an assessment method can be indicated for the development of clinical reasoning for medical students of the clinical years. This study compared the use of MCQ and VIP as assessment methodologies in medical students. Methods A randomized crossover study carried out, which 35 Portuguese medical students from clinical years evaluated by MCQ and VIP in four medical specialties. In each specialty, students randomized into two groups. One group started being evaluated by MCQ and finished with VIP, the other vice-versa. After the evaluation, students asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire. Results The final score was higher with the VIP than MCQ method (MCQ: 67.40±8.96 vs. VIP: 73.34±10.8;p<0.01) with significant differences higher in Clinical History and Physical Examination. The satisfaction quiz showed although both methodologies are adequate and satisfactory, but VIP method allows to improve knowledge. Conclusion VIP is more accurate for clinical reasoning, accepted by medical students and should be integrated into the pre-graduate medical curriculum with other methodologies already used.

Resilience capacity is defined as the capacity to endure shocks and stressors including absorptive capacity (persistence), adaptive capacity (incremental adjustment), and transformative capacity (change). Resilience Capacity Model assesses the resilience capacity of a system based on the actors and corresponding components of that system. Resilience capacity has been explored in school nutrition setting but a Resiliency Capacity Model addressing school meal provision is lacking. Qualitative exploration of a Resilience Capacity Model to assess the resilience capacity of school meal programs. Assisted by PRISMA, a systematic evaluation of peer-reviewed full-text articles published between 2005-2020 was performed. Qualitative and quantitative studies explored the effect of school meal programs or in-school interventions on child food security that accounts for resilience capacity of school meal programs. Thematic analysis was used to identify factors associated with strategies for building resilience capacity. Of 406 articles identified via online search, 32 full-text articles met inclusion criteria. Based on the systematic review and thematic analysis, it was found that strategies to build resilience include food availability, food accessibility, food quality, education, training, parent/teacher support, and administrative response. The Resilience Capacity Model to assess resilience capacity of school meal programs fits well in the context of school nutrition. This model can be used to assess whether the strategies adopted during unprecedented circumstances lead to a resilience or a vulnerability pathway. The findings of the systematic review of literature support that Resilience Capacity Model that accounts for identified factors can be used to assess the resilience capacity of school meal programs. A systematic assessment of resilience capacity can help to improve school meal program operations in times of crisis or during/after disasters. None.

Hypoxaemia needs to be identified correctly in patients with COVID-19 as it is associated with in-hospital mortality. The aetiology of silent hypoxia is unclear, and the pathophysiological processes involved in the relationship between the response to hypoxaemia and the sensation of dyspnoea may explain its clinical presentation. Pulse oximetry is used routinely to measure oxygen saturation. However, recent literature has questioned its accuracy in patients with COVID-19. Inaccuracies in readings, which arise for several reasons, could in part explain silent hypoxaemia. Caution should be taken when interpreting pulse oximeter readings or patients could be given a higher inspired oxygen fraction than necessary. Silent hypoxaemia may also mask disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Wilson-Baig, Noamaan",Journal of Paramedic Practice,683,1

Our study aimed to describe the challenges that OP faced while delivering cancer care in Latin America. Methods: We conducted an international crosssectional study using an anonymous online survey in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. The questionnaire included 43 multiple choice questions. The sample was stratified by OP who have treated patients with COVID-19 versus those who have not treated patients with COVID-19. Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests. Results: A total of 704 OP from 20 Latin American countries completed the survey (77% of 913 who started the survey). Oncologists represented 46% of respondents, followed by 25% surgicaloncologists. Of the respondents, 56% treated patients with COVID-19. A significant proportion of OP reported newly adopting telemedicine during COVID-19 (14% vs 72%, p=0.001). More than half (58%) of OP reported making changes to the treatments they offered to patients with cancer. As shown in the table, caring for patients with COVID-19 significantly influenced practice patterns of OP. Access to specialty services and procedures was significantly reduced: 40% noted significantly decreased or no access to imaging, 20% significantly decreased or no access to biopsies, 65% reported delays in surgical oncology referrals, and 49% in radiation oncology referrals. A vast majority (82%) reported oncologic surgeries were delayed or cancelled, which was heightened among those treating patients with COVID-19 (87% vs 77%, p=0.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the way cancer care is delivered in globally. Although changes to healthcare delivery are necessary as a response to this global crisis, our study highlights the significant disruption and possible undertreatment of patients with cancer in Latin America that results from COVID-19.","Ramirez, C.

This paper aims to explore the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of delivering psychological therapy remotely to adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). Design/methodology/approach: As part of routine practice within an adult ID community health service, this paper develops a six-session programme based on compassion-focused therapy (CFT) and delivered it to six clients. Clients completed the psychological therapy outcome scale for ID 2nd edition, at assessment, pre- and post-therapy, as well as a feasibility and acceptability measure. Findings: Six clients engaged in telephone therapy;four clients individually, while the remaining two were supported by their caregiver. Most clients found the intervention helpful, enjoyable and were pleased that they received telephone-delivered psychological therapy. A reduction was observed at post-therapy in distress (g = 0.33) and risk (g = 0.69). No difference was reported in psychological well-being.

This study aimed to explore the relationships between SES, WB and academic achievement, based on the data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2018 within the Turkish context. In this cross-sectional study, we used hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis to explore how the independent variables predicted academic achievement in blocks based on data from 6890 students attending 186 schools. The study revealed that the model, including the independent variables, predicted students' achievement in reading, mathematics and science;however, the prediction level of demographic factors and domains of WB were very low, while SES had the highest prediction level.

The mineral raw material industry encompasses many different, sometimes highly specialized activities, such as exploration, mining, hauling, mineral processing, metallurgy and metal refining, as well as risk assessment, management (environmental, financial, legal) and marketing. The purpose of the article is to identify the market gap for business for entities or individuals in the mineral resources sector in Poland. Taking into account the European Union regulations which enforce the closure of hard coal mines in Poland by 2050, it is reasonable to identify such a gap in the raw materials area, especially since the current situation may turn out to be a new revival of the raw materials market after the pandemic period. Based on the NACE classification, a key area was identified, which is dedicated to potential entrepreneurs in the mineral resources area. Based on an internal analysis, the sectors directly related to the RM field in Poland were distinguished. Narrowing down the analyzed sections, leading areas were indicated that offer significant employment opportunities for hundreds of thousands of people who will be made redundant (often in groups) as a result of the phasing out of hard coal mining in Poland. As part of the article, the identification and analysis of key trends that have a significant impact on the functioning of companies, the industry, the region or the country, as well as threats, challenges and opportunities that may arise in the near future, was carried out. What is more, a number of scientific, research or development projects implemented in the area of mineral raw materials in the years 2010–2019 were analyzed. The authors present an innovative approach to defining the gap in the mineral raw materials sector in Poland in what regards conducting business activity, as well as an in-depth analysis of the sector in terms of enterprise development opportunities (creation of new start-up companies) and its directions. It should be mentioned that the presented research is the first attempt to analyze this issue in Poland.","Sukiennik, Marta Kowal Barbara",Energies,683,1

Although various results have been reported on the subject, it is still unknown whether patients with rheumatic disease, many of whom are on immune-suppression, are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Objectives: We aim to share our clinical SARS-CoV-2 experience in patient with the childhood rheumatic disease during pandemic. Methods: We evaluated 4470 patients at our pediatric-rheumatology clinic during the pandemic, from 11-March to 15-October-2020. Demographic and clinical features, treatments, laboratory results, imaging findings, and clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and/or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were review from the medical records. The data of all these patients were compared between groups and presented. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among 4470 patients, 87 COVID-19 suspected patients were included in the study. Fifty six (64.4%) patients were hospitalized and 31 were followed without hospitalization. The most common rheumatic diseases among them were juvenile idiopathic arthritis and familial Mediterranean fever (35.6% and 34.5%). The primary disease status of these patients were;78 (89.6%) were in remission, while 9 (10.3%) had active disease at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Twenty six of these patients were treated with biologic DMARDs. SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR and/or antibody test) was found positive in 84 patients (96.5%). Also, fifty one (58.6%) patients had an epidemiologic contact to a person with COVID-19. Fifty six of 87 (64.3%) had a fever and 20 (23%) had a fever for five or more days. Gastrointestinal system involvement was in 11 (12.6%), the respiratory system was in 40 (46%) and fatigue was in 57 (65.5%) patients. Cutaneous involvement was seen in 5 patients including maculopapular rash in two, vasculitic rash in two, and chilblain in one patient. 63.2% of patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP), 40.2% had lymphocytopenia (<1500/mm3) and 26.4 % had elevated D-dimer level. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 84 patients (96.5%). The diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR in 74 patients and by antibody test in 10. 18 patients met the clinical criteria and diagnosed with MIS-C. Nine of them had also hypotension and seven patients admitted the intensive care unit because of shock and severe end-organ illness. COVID-19 outbreak also caused exacerbation of systemic disease in 56 children due to a discontinue of medication, postponed drug switch, or viral infection triggered. Conclusion: In conclusion, children with rheumatic disease do not appear to present a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Whether these patients receive biological treatment does not affect the severity of the disease, but it is still not true to say that these drugs are protective. The immunosuppressive treatments can be adjusted in case of infection, otherwise it is not recommended interrupt the treatments. Physicians should be cautious about the hyperinflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in rheumatic children, which may be severe in this group of patients and may be confused with primary diseases.","Sözeri, B.; Demir, F.; Kalin, S.; Hasbal Akkuş, C.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,683,24

Here, we develop and extensively validate an approach to designing viral diagnostics that applies a learned model within a combinatorial optimization framework. Concentrating on CRISPR-based diagnostics, we screen a library of 19,209 diagnostic–target pairs and train a deep neural network that predicts, from RNA sequence alone, diagnostic signal better than contemporary techniques. Our model then makes it possible to design assays that are maximally sensitive over the spectrum of a virus’s genomic variation. We introduce ADAPT (https://adapt.guide), a system for fully-automated design, and use ADAPT to design optimal diagnostics for the 1,933 vertebrate-infecting viral species within 2 hours for most species and 24 hours for all but 3. We experimentally show ADAPT’s designs are sensitive and specific down to the lineage level, including against viruses that pose challenges involving genomic variation and specificity. ADAPT’s designs exhibit significantly higher fluorescence and permit lower limits of detection, across a virus’s entire variation, than the outputs of standard design techniques. Our model-based optimization strategy has applications broadly to viral nucleic acid diagnostics and other sequence-based technologies, and, paired with clinical validation, could enable a critically-needed, proactive resource of assays for surveilling and responding to pathogens.","Metsky, Hayden C.; Welch, Nicole L.; Pillai, Priya P.; Haradhvala, Nicholas J.; Rumker, Laurie; Mantena, Sreekar; Zhang, Yibin B.; Yang, David K.; Ackerman, Cheri M.; Weller, Juliane; Blainey, Paul C.; Myhrvold, Cameron; Mitzenmacher, Michael; Sabeti, Pardis C.",bioRxiv,683,24

Given their increased susceptibility to COVID-19, the question arises whether individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other metabolic conditions can respond effectively to the mRNA-based vaccine. We aimed to evaluate the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in people with T2DM and/or other metabolic risk factors (hypertension and obesity) compared to those without. This study included 262 people that took two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine. Both T2DM and non-diabetic individuals had a robust response to vaccination as demonstrated by their high antibody titers. However, both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies titers were lower in people with T2DM. Their levels were 154{+/-}49.1 vs. 138{+/-}59.4BAU/mL for IgG and 87.1{+/-}11.6 vs. 79.7{+/-}19.5% for neutralizing antibodies in individuals without diabetes compared to those with T2DM, respectively. In a multiple linear regression adjusted for individual characteristics, comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection and duration since second vaccine dose, diabetics had 13.86 BAU/ml (95%CI: -27.08 to -0.64BAU/ml, p=0.041) less IgG antibodies and 4.42% (95%CI: -8.53 to -0.32%, p=0.036) less neutralizing antibodies than non-diabetics. Hypertension and obesity did not show significant changes in antibody titers. Taken together, both type-2 diabetic and non-diabetic individuals elicited strong immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; nonetheless, lower levels were seen in people with diabetes. Continuous monitoring of the antibody levels might be a good indicator to guide personalized needs for further booster shots to maintain adaptive immunity.","Ali, H.; Al-Terki, A.; Sindhu, S.; Alahmad, B.; Hammad, M.; Al-Sabah, S.; Alghounaim, M.; Jamal, M.

Relevant to all, type I IFNs can enhance germinal center (GC) B cell responses but underlying signaling pathways are incompletely understood due to pleiotropic effects in multiple cell types. Here, we demonstrate that a succinct type I IFN response promotes GC formation and associated IgG subclass distribution primarily through signaling in cDCs and B cells. Type I IFN signaling in cDCs, distinct from cDC1, stimulates development of separable Tfh and Th1 cell subsets. However, Th cell-derived IFN-γ induces T-bet expression and IgG2c isotype switching prior to this bifurcation and has no evident effects once GCs and bona fide Tfh cells developed. This pathway acts in synergy with early B cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling, which reinforces T-bet expression in B cells and leads to a selective amplification of the IgG2c+ GC B cell response. Despite the strong Th1 polarizing effect of type I IFNs, the Tfh cell subset develops into IL-4 producing cells that control the overall magnitude of the GCs and promote generation of IgG1 + GC B cells. Thus, type I IFNs act on B cells and cDCs to drive GC formation and to coordinate IgG subclass distribution through parallel Th1 and Tfh cell-dependent pathways.","Dahlgren, Madelene W.; Plumb, Adam W.; Niss, Kristoffer; Lahl, Katharina; Brunak, Søren; Johansson-Lindbom, Bengt",bioRxiv,683,1

Market fundamentalism is thoroughly complicit with biopolitical sovereignty-its racializing socioeconomic projects, cheapens life given its obsessive focus on high growth, by any means necessary.

Hospitalizations and deaths were significantly fewer (p<0.002 or 0.05, respectively) than in background-matched controls from the CDC database. Triple combination therapy is safe and effective even in moderate-severe patients with hypoxia treated in the outpatient setting.","Hazan, S.; Dave, S.; Gunaratne, A. W.; Dolai, S.; McCullough, P.

The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19. However, this test is time consuming and subject to availability of the test kits during a crisis. An automated method of screening chest x-ray images using convolutional neural network (CNN) Transfer Learning approach has been proposed as a relatively fast and cost-effective, decision support tool to detect pulmonary pathology due to COVID-19. In this study we have used Kaggle dataset with chest x-ray images of normal and pneumonia cases. We have added COVID-19 x-ray images from 5 different open-source datasets. The images were pre-processed based on the position of radiography images and greyscale was applied and subsequently the images were used for training. After consolidation, COVID-19 images comprised only 5% of the dataset. To address the class imbalance, we have used dynamic image augmentation technique to reduce the bias. We have then explored custom CNN and VGG-16, InceptionNet-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-50, and DarkNet-53 transfer learning approaches to classify COVID-19, other pneumonia and normal x-ray images and compared their performances. So far, we have achieved the best score of F1 score 0.95, sensitivity 95% and specificity 95% for COVID-19 class with Darknet-53 feature extractor. Darknet-53 classifier is part of the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm named Yolo-v3. We have also done a McNemar-Bowker post-hoc test to compare Darknet-53 performance with the next best ResNet-50. This test suggests that Darknet-53 is significantly better skilled than ResNet-50 in differentiating COVID-19 from other pneumonia in chest x-ray images. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Darapaneni, N.; Sil, A.; Kagiti, B.; Krishna Kumar, S.; Ramanathan, N.

Madagascar’s status as a “least developed country”, coupled with its high marine biodiversity, makes its waters particularly susceptible to fishing by distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). However, given constraints in management and research, it is unclear how foreign industrial fishing, both legal via foreign agreements and illegal, may impact local marine resources that many coastal communities depend on for food security, cultural meaning and livelihoods. We used satellite-derived fishing effort data from 2012-2020, via Global Fishing Watch, to analyze industrial fishing effort occurring within Madagascar’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We documented 907,643 hours of industrial fishing within the Madagascar EEZ across 277 vessels from 17 different countries. We found that Taiwanease vessels (39.8%) using drifting longlines and Malagasy (17.2% shrimp trawlers were the most prevalent. Fishing effort was highly seasonal (68% of effort between October and February) and increased with higher global fish prices and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is a measure of regional water temperature cycles. We also found a number of instances (17.6% of the fishing effort for 170,726 total hours) of foreign fishing vessels operating close to shore and within a number of marine protected areas. These results highlight the need for increased transparency surrounding foreign fishing agreements and unauthorized fishing within the waters of developing countries. Increases in industrial fishing effort and encroachment into near-shore areas has the potential to severely threaten current sustainable fisheries management initiatives by conservation organizations and coastal communities. Highlights Distant water fishing nations dominated fishing efforts within Madagascar’s EEZ. Longlining by foreign nations was the dominant fishing mode and increased from October-February. Malagasy vessels focused on trawling for shrimp. Fishing effort increased during positive Indian Ocean Dipoles and with higher fish prices. Distant water fishing nations frequently fished close to shore and sometimes within MPAs.","White, Easton R.; Baker-Médard, Merrill; Vakhitova, Valeriia; Farquhar, Samantha; Ramaharitra, Tendro Tondrasoa",bioRxiv,683,27

It started as an epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province, central China, and has now become a pandemic, spreading over most of the continents of the planet. The major clinical symptoms of the infection are dry cough, fever, pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypoxia, and in certain cases, even death. Alveolar damage and respiratory system failure are observed in severe cases. Initial mild infection leads to activation of the immune system in the lungs and accumulation of various inflammatory cells and molecules. At a later phase during the infection, a “cytokine storm” causes an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), leading to an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, migration of a large number of immune cells to the site of infection, and ultimately pulmonary damage. The rapid and uncontrolled outbreak requires putative therapeutic drugs for treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19. Amongst the currently used antiviral drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir etc. we would like to present an update on another effective drug, pentoxifylline. Pentoxifylline has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-viral, and bronchodilatory properties. Pentoxifylline is known to reduce cytokine production, immune cell migration, and suppress certain signal transduction pathways (e.g. NF-κβ and STAT3). Thus, it minimizes inflammatory damage in the lung tissues.","Dhameliya, Hiren A.; Thakkar, Vasudev R.; Trivedi, Gauravi N.; Mesara, Sureshkumar N.; Subramanian, R. B.",J. Pure Appl.

Spatial analytic techniques allow for discovering areas of concern and finding correlates of asthma prevalence. Objective There is growing interest in disentangling the impacts of socioeconomic and environmental factors on respiratory health, their spatial correlation, and the demographic profile of people at risk of respiratory diseases. It is important to know how people with asthma are geographically distributed and what social and environmental factors correlate with asthma. Thereby, the purpose of the study is to describe socioeconomic factors associated with asthma prevalence in Cook County, IL, and to identify the significant risks and the protective factors to control asthma. Data and Methods Data obtained from CDC 2018 SVI, ACS, the City of Chicago Data Portal, HealthData.gov, and ESRI. In this paper, we illustrate the usefulness of geospatial regression analysis in the analysis and presentation of spatially distributed asthma prevalence among the population with disabilities, minorities with the language barrier, nonwhite population, age 17 and younger, and age 65 and older in the census tracts of Cook County, IL where Chicago Metropolitan Area located. In addition, we map the spatial variation of asthma prevalence with variation in the tree canopy, access to medical centers, air quality, and household quality. Lastly, we used bivariate mapping to illustrate the spatial distributions of residential land use and tree covers. Results Our findings show a good correlation between asthma and socioeconomic and physical factors including age 17 and younger, age 65 and older, population with disabilities, a minority with the language barrier, tree canopy, access to medical centers, air quality, and household quality. The aged 65 and older, 17 and younger, and people with disabilities are found to have a higher asthma prevalence in areas around the industrial corridors in southeast and west sides of Cook County, IL.

Consequently, a centralized workflow was needed to effectively recruit, screen and connect volunteers to COVID-19 research opportunities. Objective: To create a centralized registry to match eligible and interested volunteers ≥18 years with COVID-19 outpatient research studies at an academic health system. Methods: Key stakeholders, including researchers and participant advocates, collaborated to build the Hopkins Opportunity for Participant Engagement (HOPE) Registry in English and Spanish. REDCap, a secure web-based application, served as the Registry platform. Study teams recruiting for outpatient studies were invited to present their studies through the Registry. Study volunteers were recruited using multiple methods, including patient portal messages, email, social media, and online advertisement. The Registry included COVID testing results and participant survey of demographic and COVID-19 related questions. Branching logic was used to pre-screen and present participating studies for which the person was eligible. The individual then selected which studies, ifany, they were interested in. Study teams received an automatic notification and reached out directlyto individuals expressing interest in their study ( Figure ). Results: The HOPE Registry includes 7 studies and has enrolled 4186 people. Over half (55%)were &gt;55 years and the majority were female (64%). Racial/ethnic groups represented were Whites(80%), Black s (9%), Asians (4.7%), Hispanics (5%), and American Indian (0.3%).

But choosing the right face detection and recognition model for the right purpose is always a billion-dollar decision before rolling out a real-time computer vision-based project. Although it is a very common understanding that face recognition is a closed problem, in reality it still has a lot of areas for improvements in the context of implementations. Development of a general-purpose face recognition-based attendance system is completely dependent on the availability of generalized face detection and recognition algorithms which can keep balance between speed, accuracy and anti-spoofing at the higher side of the benchmark. In some of the use cases, speed affects the usability and in some other use cases accuracy affects the usability. So in this paper, we have tried to find face detection and recognition models which can address all types of use cases and in the absence of such a model we tried to create alternative architecture to achieve the best out of the existing model by right positioning them in a pipeline. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Mohanty, N.

The etiopathogenesis in a subset of such patients, who continue to have progressive pulmonary disease following virus clearance remains unexplored. Methods: We investigated the role of NKG2C+/NKG2A- adaptive natural killer (ANK) cells, KLRC2 genotype and cytomegalovirus reactivation in 22 such patients. Results: The median duration of virus positivity was 23 days and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48 days. The overall survival at 60 days in this group was 50%. Older age and comorbidities impacted survival negatively. CMV viremia was documented in 11 patients, with a survival of 25% vs 80% in those without viremia with viral load correlating with mortality. ANK cells were markedly depressed in all patients at day 15. However, persistently low ANK cells at 30 days along with an inversely high NKG2C-/NKG2A+ inhibitory NK cells significantly correlated with high CMV viremia as well as mortality, irrespective of KLRC2 genotype. Day 30 ANK cells were significantly lower in KLRC2 deletion group. IFN-gamma and Perforin release were severely compromised in all patients at day +15, with significant improvement in the survivors at day +30, but not in those with adverse outcome. Conclusion: Patients with severe lung disease even after negative SARS-CoV-2 status, with persistently reduced and functionally compromised ANK cells, are more likely to have CMV reactivation and an adverse outcome, independent of KLRC2 genotype.","Jaiswal, S.

Worldwide, the emergence of shared survival needs led to the self-organisation of local communities in care infrastructures for mutual aid, psychological support, sharing experiences and storytelling, often based on crowd-sourcing and crowd-mapping platforms. From the (post-)pandemic urban planning perspective, the growth of this phenomenon has implied the call for spatial research to reconsider ICTs and collaborative spatial information systems as strategic tools to support vulnerable communities and public engagement in collective matters. This contribution aims to define an open-source database to be used and implemented by citizens and social operators to provision territorial care systems and mutual aid initiatives. The adopted methodological approach proposes a citizen-led spatial information system, where updated information, perceptions and preferences can be spatialised and collected, building a crowd-sourced and sharable system of territorial knowledge, useful for collective actions and the development of sustainable and effective strategies in emergency conditions.

In this paper, the authors synthesize the state-of-the-art, up to early June 2020, on key developments regarding public transportation and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the different responses adopted by governments and public transportation agencies around the world, and the research needs pertaining to critical issues that minimize contagion risk in public transportation in the so-called post-lockdown phase. While attempts at adherence to physical distancing (which challenges the very concept of mass public transportation) are looming in several countries, the latest research shows that for closed environments such as public transportation vehicles, the proper use of face masks has significantly reduced the probability of contagion. The economic and social effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in public transportation extend beyond service performance and health risks to financial viability, social equity, and sustainable mobility. There is a risk that if the public transportation sector is perceived as poorly transitioning to post-pandemic conditions, that viewing public transportation as unhealthy will gain ground and might be sustained. To this end, this paper identifies the research needs and outlines a research agenda for the public health implications of alternative strategies and scenarios, specifically measures to reduce crowding in public transportation. The paper provides an overview and an outlook for transit policy makers, planners, and researchers to map the state-of-affairs and research needs related to the impacts of the pandemic crisis on public transportation.

Our objectives were to: 1) estimate monthly SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among children aged 0-17 years and 2) calculate ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infections to reported COVID-19 cases among children and adolescents in 14 U.S. states. Methods: Using data from commercial laboratory seroprevalence surveys, we estimated monthly SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among children aged 0-17 years from August 2020 through May 2021. Seroprevalence estimates were based on SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid immunoassays from February to May 2021. We compared estimated numbers of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 2021 to cumulative incidence of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from case-based surveillance, and calculated infection: case ratios by state and type of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid immunoassay used for seroprevalence testing. Results: Analyses included 67,321 serum specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among children in 14 U.S. states. Estimated ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infections to reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases among children and adolescents varied by state and type of immunoassay, ranging from 0.8-13.3 in May 2021. Conclusions: Through May 2021, the majority of children in selected states did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies. Case-based surveillance underestimated the number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2, however the predicted extent of the underestimate varied by state, immunoassay, and over time. Continued monitoring of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence should inform prevention and vaccination strategies.","Couture, A.; Lyons, B. C.; Mehrotra, M.

This syndrome is characterized by acute respiratory signs, high fever, and occasional sudden death, and has mostly been observed in pregnant alpacas (Vicugna pacos), although all signalments have been affected. A similarity in clinical signs to cases located on the East Coast of the United States was observed; however, a causative agent had not been identified. Preliminary diagnostic submissions to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS) were negative for known bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and viral pathogens, as well as for toxins, making the etiology of this disease unknown. However, based on pathologic findings, a viral or toxic etiology was strongly considered. A novel coronavirus was recovered from lung tissue of a clinical case submitted to CAHFS. The coronavirus identity was confirmed in tissue culture by transmission electron microscopy and by sequence analysis of a conserved region within the viral genome. Statistical analysis calculating a serologic association between the serum virus neutralization antibody titer and coronavirus, the presence of exposure history on 40 animals with a history of ARS, and 167 controls provided an odds ratio of 121 (95% confidence interval: 36.54 and 402.84; P < 0.0001). The findings indicate that the ARS-associated coronavirus described is distinct from the previously reported gastrointestinal-associated coronavirus identified in alpaca herds.","Crossley, Beate M; Barr, Bradd C; Magdesian, K Gary; Ing, Michelle; Mora, Daniel; Jensen, David; Loretti, Alexandre P; McConnell, Ty; Mock, Richard","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",683,17

At present, it has spread to more than 33 countries or regions all over the world and affected 8 360 people and killed 764 by May 31,2003. Identification of the SARS causative agent and development of a diagnostic test are important. Detecting disease in its early stage, understanding its pathways of transmission and implementing specific prevention measures for the disease are dependent upon swift progress. Due to the efforts of the WHO-led network of laboratories testing for SARS, tests for the novel coronavirus have been developed with unprecedented speed. The genome sequence reveals that this coronavirus is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses. WHO established the definitions of suspected and confirmed and probable cases. But the laboratory tests and definitions are limited. Until now, the primary measures included isolation, ribavirin and corticosteroid therapy, mechanical ventilation, etc. Other therapies such as convalescent plasma are being explored.

Simultaneous electrical impedance spectra (1 kHz-1024 kHz) and ultrasound time-of-flight measurements were made on layered sheep liver and fat tissue samples as the temperature was increased from 30-50 °C. The change in propagation velocity for 100% fat and 100% liver samples was found to vary linearly with temperature and the temperature coefficient of the time-of-flight was shown to vary linearly with the % fat in the sample (0.009% °C-1%-1). Tetrapolar impedance measurements normalized to 8 kHz were shown to have a small sensitivity to temperature for both liver (0.001% °C-1 ≤ 45 °C) and fat (0.002% °C-1 ≤ 512 kHz) and the best linear correlation between the normalized impedance and the % fat in the sample was found at 256 kHz (gradient 0.026%-1, r2 = 0.65). A bootstrap analysis on 15 layered tissue samples evaluated using the normalized impedance at 256 kHz to determine the % fat in the sample and the temperature coefficient of the time of flight to determine the temperature. The results showed differences (including some large differences) between the predicted and measured temperatures and an error evaluation identified the possible origins of these.","Islam, Naimul; Hale, Rebecca; Taylor, Matthew; Wilson, Adrian",Physiological measurement,683,11

METHODS A cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary rheumatology department in Israel. Consecutive patients completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoprotein IgG (N-IgG). If this was positive, an anti-S1/S2 spike IgG (S-IgG) test was done. If both were positive, the patient was considered seropositive. Seropositive patients were retested after 3 months. RESULTS The study included 572 AIIRD patients. Thirty patients were found seropositive, for a seroprevalence of 5.24%. The seropositive rate was significantly lower for patients treated with immunosuppressive medications (3.55%, p≤0.01), and specifically for patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) (2.7%, p≤0.05). These associations remained significant in the multivariate regressions adjusting for age, sex and exposure to a known COVID-19 patient. A second serology test 3 months later was collected in 21 of the 30 seropositive patients. In a mean±standard deviation (SD) of 166.63±40.76 days between PCR and second serology, 85% were still positive for N-IgG, and 100% were still positive for S-IgG, with a higher mean±SD titre compared to the first S-IgG (166.77±108.77 vs. 132.44±91.18, respectively, p≤0.05). CONCLUSIONS Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 in AIIRD patients may be affected be immunosuppressive treatment, especially bDMARDs.

The burdens of pandemic-associated increases in domestic and caregiving responsibilities, professional demands, health risks associated with contracting COVID-19, and the resulting psychosocial distress have exacerbated existing gender disparities at home, at work, and in academia. School and daycare closures have created additional childcare needs, primarily for women, yet little support exists for parents and families. These increased childcare and domestic responsibilities have forced women HCWs, who make up the overwhelming majority of the workforce, to adapt their schedules and, in some cases, leave their jobs entirely. In this article, the authors detail how COVID-19 has exacerbated existing childcare accessibility and affordability issues as well as gender disparities. They argue that, unless government and health care organization support for childcare increases, families, specifically women and children, will continue to suffer. Lack of access to affordable childcare can prevent HCWs from doing their jobs, including conducting and publishing academic scholarship. This poses incalculable risks to families, science, and society. COVID-19 should serve as a call to action to all sectors, including the government and health care organizations, to prioritize childcare provision and increase support for women HCWs, both now during the pandemic and going forward.","Robinson, Londyn J; Engelson, Brianna J; Hayes, Sharonne N",Acad. med,683,19

This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men: PR 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.62) and participants aged &#8805;65 years: PR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.92-3.12) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men: PR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93 and participants &#8805;65 years: PR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.49).

CONCLUSIONS: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Additionally, changing from smoking cigarettes to using HTPs makes smokers less likely to quit.","Koyama, Shihoko; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Okawa, Sumiyo; Kadobayashi, Takayoshi; Shirai, Hisaya; Nakatani, Takeshi; Miyashiro, Isao",J Epidemiol,683,24

While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they can model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","Browning, Raiha; Sulem, Deborah; Mengersen, Kerrie; Rivoirard, Vincent; Rousseau, Judith",PLoS One,683,16

We demonstrated that super-lower concentrations of PAEs could be oxidized, which was due to their unique structure. POM molecules have been embedded onto graphene to form H5PMo10V2O40@surfactant(n)/Graphene(L wt%) (abbreviated as HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(L wt%)) using surfactants with the carbon chain length n = 2, 4, 6 and 8 for the loading of HPMoV. The coexistence of the graphene and surfactant layer (on HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(20 wt%)) adsorbed PAE molecules and transported them rapidly to HPMoV active sites. And n values determined the electron transfer ability between graphene and POMs that promoted PAEs oxidation. The loading of POMs on the surface of graphene permitted HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(L wt%) act as interfacial catalyst which degraded various PAEs (i.e., diethyl phthalate (DEP), diallyl phthalate (DAP) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) while removed more than 70% of TOC and COD. The degradation of DEP achieved 93.0% with HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(20 wt%) and H2O2, which followed ï¬rst-order kinetics and the reaction activation energy (Ea) of 23.1 kJ/mol. Further, HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(20 wt%) showed potential for the removal of PAEs in Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), and the degradation efficiency for PAE (DEP) in secondary effluent achieved 55.0%. In addition, the loading method for POMs on graphene eliminated the leaching of POMs from graphene, and the degradation efficiency could still reach 88.1% after ten recycles.","Huo, Yang; Zhang, Dan; Wu, Jinghui; Wang, Xianze; Wang, Xiaohong; Shao, Changlu; Crittenden, John C; Huo, Mingxin",J Hazard Mater,683,20

Both IPA soaking and spraying removed most electrostatic charges on all four electret materials (three commercial and one alternative), causing significant deterioration of filtration efficiency to unacceptable level. The other non-electret alternative material sustained its N95-grade performance after both IPA soaking and spraying treatments, demonstrating the possible application of IPA disinfection for non-electret alternative respirator/mask materials. UVGI preserved the filtration of all three commercially available respirator/mask materials after up to 10 treatments, suggesting it can be a possible decontamination method for hospital and clinic use without compromising respirator/mask performance. The considerations of the practical implementation of this method was discussed. Between the two heat treatment methods tested, dry heat showed better compatibility with electret material by sustaining both filtration efficiency and fit (tested on commercial respirator only), although adding moisture was reported in favor of virus inactivation. Heat treatment is easily accessible method for general publics to implement at home, while it is recommended to maintain the moisture level below saturation. Comparing to size-integrated method, the size-resolved fractional efficiency measurement technique, although more time consuming, proved to be a better method for evaluating respirator/mask filtration performance after decontaminations by providing more sensitive detection of performance degradation and the capability of distinguishing charge loss to other mechanisms causing efficiency deterioration. Detailed descriptions are provided in methodology part to emphasize the cares needed for an appropriate efficiency evaluation. The limited results in this study on worn masks made of alternative sterilization wrap indicated possible performance degradation of electret material caused by normal human wearing activities, suggesting the need of assessing respirator/mask decontamination strategy by testing practically worn-and-decontaminated/reused samples instead of unworn only-decontaminated counterparts.","Ou, Qisheng; Pei, Chenxing; Chan Kim, Seong; Abell, Elizabeth; Pui, David Y.H.",J.

RT-PCR assays are diagnosis gold standard; however, they can lead to false-negative results. Therefore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA investigation can play a complementary role in assessing the individuals immune status. Majority of serological tests focus on IgM and IgG although IgA are the main immunoglobulins involved in mucosal immunity. It has been reported that digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any typical respiratory symptom. Thus, a complete screening, comprising IgA, IgM, and IgG detection could be more consistent and useful in patients with atypical symptoms or in paucisymptomatic cases. Current literature describes over 200 immunoassays available worldwide, pointing out a great results variability, depending on methodology or antigens' nature. In our study we evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, and IgG trend on a control group and on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection time) with a lateral-flow combined immunoassay (LFIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dissimilar antibodies time kinetics have been described in COVID-19 (decreasing IgM concentration with IgA/IgG persistence for a longer time; as well as persistent IgA, IgG, and IgM concentration); our results confirmed both of them depending on the methodology; therefore, it is difficult to compare different studies outcomes, suggesting the importance of a serological tests international standardization. Nevertheless, we propose a flowchart with combined anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM/IgA detection as a screening on general population, where serological positivity should be considered as an ""alert,"" to avoid and contain possible new outbreaks.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Gisone, Francesca; Bernardini, Sergio",Immunol Invest,683,26

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19 ). Because of its immunomodulatory action, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients developing COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS: The trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of IVIG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28 days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28 days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of IVIG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IVIG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level. DISCUSSION: The ICAR trial investigates the effect of IVIG in COVID-19-related ARDS. We expect an increase in the survival rate and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is associated with significant morbidity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2020-001570-30.

This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the efficacy and safety of baloxavir compared to other antivirals for influenza in otherwise healthy patients. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed on 14 November 2016 in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and ICHUSHI to identify randomized controlled trials assessing antivirals for influenza. A NMA including 22 trials was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of baloxavir with other antivirals. RESULTS: The time to alleviation of all symptoms was significantly shorter for baloxavir compared to zanamivir (difference in median time 19.96 h; 95% CrI [3.23, 39.07]). The time to cessation of viral shedding was significantly shorter for baloxavir than zanamivir and oseltamivir (47.00 h; 95% CrI [28.18, 73.86] and 56.03 h [33.74, 87.86], respectively). The mean decline in virus titer from baseline to 24 h was significantly greater for baloxavir than for the other drugs. Other differences in efficacy outcomes were not significant. No significant differences were found between baloxavir and the other antivirals for safety, except total drug-related adverse events where baloxavir demonstrated a decrease compared to oseltamivir and laninamivir. CONCLUSION: The NMA suggests that baloxavir demonstrated better or similar efficacy results compared to other antivirals with a comparable safety profile. Baloxavir led to a significant decrease in viral titer versus zanamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir and decreased viral shedding versus zanamivir and oseltamivir.","Taieb, V; Ikeoka, H; Ma, F; Borkowska, K; Aballea, S; Tone, K; Hirotsu, N",Ter Arkh,683,16

Trauma and orthopaedic services are no different. A fundamentally important and significant portion of trauma services is the treatment of fragility fractures of the proximal femur, otherwise known as hip fractures. The hip fracture ""Blue book Standards"", the key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with appropriate hip fracture care are challenging during non-crisis times. We aim to review Blue Book compliance during the Covid-19 crisis and review outcomes of hip fractures, including Covid-19 infection rates. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed IHFD data to collection demographic data, IHFD standards of care, 30-day mortality rates and complications between 23rd March and 20th May 2020 and 2019. Covid-19 rates in 2020 were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 36 hip fractures were recorded in 2020, compared with 45 in 2019, resulting in a 20% reduction in presentations. Thirty-day mortality in hip fractures during the Covid-19 crisis was 8.3% compared with 2.2% in 2020. Covid-19 infection was statistically associated with 30-day mortality in the 2020 cohort. Statistically significant improvements in time-dependent KPIs (time to ward and time to surgery) were noted in the 2020 cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in hip fracture care KPIs, the Covid-19 crisis was associated with increased 30-day mortality in hip fracture patients. A positive Covid-19 swab was associated with higher mortality. These observations are of paramount importance to ensure adequate service planning and provision in the face of a potential ""second wave"" of Covid-19 infections leading into the winter months of 2020.","Crozier-Shaw, Geoff; Hughes, Andrew J; Conlon, Breda; Sheehan, Eoin; Merghani, Khalid",Ir. j. med. sci,683,20

RECENT FINDINGS: For the last few years, progress in research and management of essential hypertension has been stagnating while at the same time, the sequencing of the human genome has been generating many new research tools and opportunities to investigate the biology of hypertension. Cancer research has applied modern tools derived from DNA and RNA sequencing on a large scale, enabling the improved understanding of cancer biology and leading to many clinical applications. Compared with cancer, studies in hypertension, using whole genome, exome, or RNA sequencing tools, total less than 2% of the number cancer studies. While true, sequencing the genome of cancer tissue has provided cancer research an advantage, DNA and RNA sequencing derived tools can also be used in hypertension to generate new understanding how complex protein network, in non-cancer tissue, adapts and learns to be effective when for example, somatic mutations or environmental inputs change the gene expression profiles at different network nodes. The amount of data and differences in clinical condition classification at the individual sample level might be of such magnitude to overwhelm and stretch comprehension. Here is the opportunity to use AI tools for the analysis of data streams derived from DNA and RNA sequencing tools combined with clinical data to generate new hypotheses leading to the discovery of mechanisms and potential target molecules from which drugs or treatments can be developed and tested. Basic and clinical research taking advantage of new gene sequencing-based tools, to uncover mechanisms how complex protein networks regulate blood pressure in health and disease, will be critical to lift hypertension research and management from its stagnation. The use of AI analytic tools will help leverage such insights. However, applying AI tools to vast amounts of data that certainly exist in hypertension, without taking advantage of new gene sequencing-based research tools, will generate questionable results and will miss many new potential molecular targets and possibly treatments. Without such approaches, the vision of precision medicine for hypertension will be hard to accomplish and most likely not occur in the near future.","Mueller, Franco B",Curr Hypertens Rep,683,16

Here we summarize scientific evidence supporting the potential relevance of these interactions and suggest that unfavorable clinical data on hydroxychloroquine administration in COVID-19 may have been influenced by the dose provided and its impact on gut dysbiosis. The proposition is based on preliminary data on gut microbiota composition from individuals with inactive systemic lupus erythematosus under exclusive continuous hydroxychloroquine treatment, displaying a direct correlation between drug doses and markers typically associated with gut dysbiosis.","Balmant, Bianca D; Torrinhas, Raquel S; Rocha, Ilanna M; Fonseca, Danielle C; Formiga, Francisco F C; Bonfá, Eloisa S D O; Borba, Eduardo F; Waitzberg, Dan L",Nutrition,683,16

In Ethiopia, the number of infected peoples has been increased from day to day, despite government mitigation measures. But in our country the psychological impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic diseases was unknown. Hence, this study was aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 and its associated factors among chronic disease patients. METHODS: A facility based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 413 chronic disease patients in Dessie town government and private hospitals from July 20 to August 5, 2020. Impact of event scale revised questionnaire was used for data collection. Both binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to show the association between outcomes and independent variables. In multivariable analysis, significant association was declared at p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: Overall, COVID-19 had abnormal psychological impact on 22.8% (95% CI: 18.6-27.1) of chronic disease patients. Age, sex, duration of chronic disease, respiratory symptoms and having no social support were factors for abnormal psychological impact. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had abnormal psychological impact on one-fourth of chronic disease patients. Therefore, the government, health professionals and researchers should contribute to prevent the psychological impact ofCOVID-19 on chronic disease patients.","Addis, Sisay Gedamu; Nega, Abebe Dires; Miretu, Debrnesh Goshiye",Diabetes Metab Syndr,683,16

We found de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to be significantly enriched in gene promoters in SLE patients compared with healthy controls at a level corresponding to 26 de novo promoter SNVs more in each patient than expected. We identified 12 de novo SNVs in promoter regions of genes that have been previously implicated in SLE, or that have functions that could be of relevance to SLE. Furthermore, we detected three missense de novo SNVs, five de novo insertion-deletions, and three de novo structural variants with potential to affect the expression of genes that are relevant for SLE. Based on enrichment analysis, disease-affecting de novo SNVs are expected to occur in one-third of SLE patients. This study shows that de novo variants in promoters commonly contribute to the genetic risk of SLE. The fact that de novo SNVs in SLE were enriched to promoter regions highlights the importance of using whole-genome sequencing for identification of de novo variants.","Almlöf, Jonas Carlsson; Nystedt, Sara; Mechtidou, Aikaterini; Leonard, Dag; Eloranta, Maija-Leena; Grosso, Giorgia; Sjöwall, Christopher; Bengtsson, Anders A; Jönsen, Andreas; Gunnarsson, Iva; Svenungsson, Elisabet; Rönnblom, Lars; Sandling, Johanna K; Syvänen, Ann-Christine",Eur. j. hum. genet,683,20

Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels; T-cell proportion; and related gene expression occurring in patients with COVID-19 on admission and after initial treatment. METHODS: Eleven patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimens were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokine, peripheral T cell proportions, and microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: Five patients with mild and 6 with severe disease were included. Cough and fever were the primary symptoms in the 11 COVID-19 cases. Older age, higher neutrophil count, and higher C-reactive protein levels were found in severe cases. IL-10 level significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. Decreased T-cell proportions were observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and all were returned to normal in patients with mild disease after initial treatment, but only CD4+ T cells returned to normal in severe cases. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the disease progression, and decreased after initial treatment. All downregulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved Th17-cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and T-cell activation. After initial treatment in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a decreased T-cell proportion with downregulated gene expression related to T-cell activation and differentiation occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19.","Ouyang, Yabo; Yin, Jiming; Wang, Wenjing; Shi, Hongbo; Shi, Ying; Xu, Bin; Qiao, Luxin; Feng, Yingmei; Pang, Lijun; Wei, Feili; Guo, Xianghua; Jin, Ronghua; Chen, Dexi",Clin Infect Dis,683,25

Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is an increasing concern about the risk and handling of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, clinical data raised during pandemic suggests that IBD patients do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe course of infection. In the present review, we intend to highlight how two potentially important contributors to the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients, the RAGE axis activation as well as the cross-talk with the renin-angiotensin system, are dampened by the high expression of soluble forms of both RAGE and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. The soluble form of RAGE functions as a decoy for its ligands, and soluble ACE2 seems to be an additionally attenuating contributor to RAGE axis activation, particularly by avoiding the transactivation of the RAGE axis that can be produced by the virus-mediated imbalance of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II receptor type 1 pathway.","Rojas, Armando; Schneider, Iván; Lindner, Cristian; Gonzàlez, Ileana; Morales, Miguel Angel",World J Gastroenterol,683,33

Officially recognised at the beginning of 2020, it rapidly spread from Wuhan to the rest of China, eventually taking hold in the rest of the world despite global efforts to contain it. Of these efforts, the most notable is the implementation of lockdown policies which were meant to reduce as much as possible the spread of the virus, thus reducing the burden on the healthcare systems (""flatten the curve""), as well as buy time to develop more effective treatments. This paper intends to study the mental and physical effects exerted by these policies on people worldwide. The online survey has collected responses from 1,586 individuals from across the world, on which the authors employed varied statistical methods such as confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multivariate analysis. The findings presented in the paper suggest that several effects, such as problems focusing, insomnia, feelings of guilt or pessimism, can be directly attributed to the lockdown-induced changes in people's behaviours and routines. The findings are not only indicative of the need for social interaction and physical activity, but also of the importance of factual information available to the public during such crises, and of the emotional support and assistance required by people to cope with situations like this.","Milea, E.

Kahan, 2013) Examples are the rejection of vaccinations, even if there is good scientific evidence for them, or - very recently - the spreading of conspiracy theories in the course of new crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Calisher et al , 2020) In view of such phenomena there is even talk of the “death of expertise” (Nichols, 2017) - this argument is put forward by Tom Nichols, who observes an increasing rejection of established knowledge and makes it clear that with modern media anyone can become an expert, as long as he is only able to use the media to spread his views Nichols identifies a collapse of any division between experts and laypeople, which is encouraged by new information channels: “a Google-fueled, Wikipedia-based, blog-sodden collapse of any division between professionals and laymen, students and teachers, knowers and wonderers - in other words, between those of any achievement in an area and those with none at all” (Nichols, 2014) At the same time, a tendency is reviving according to which even due politics ignores and rejects scientific facts: Instead of the much demanded evidence-based policy, post-truth politics is gaining ground, which means political action that is not based on facts, or that relies on false information that is labelled as being an alternative truth (d Ancona, 2017) Countries such as the USA or Brazil are good examples - here presidents are in power who reject scientific findings on climate change and, as in the case of Trump, restructure entire institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which are actually supposed to provide science-based environmental policy information, without any longer considering all the scientific facts (Bravender, 2016; Dillon et al , 2018) In Brazil, President Bolsonaro is neglecting any responsibility of the Brazilian government for the Amazon rainforest fires whereas scientists argue that these are at least partly a result of Brazil's deforestation policy (Escobar, 2019) Thus, in addition to a social questioning and de-differentiation of scientific knowledge, a supposedly, very powerful new political rejection of scientific expertise is emerging","Böcher, Michael",Forest Policy and Economics,683,20

We suggest that the conceptual separation between nature and society renders accounting for the circular economy and the COVID-19 pandemic problematic. A critical account of the circular economy might problematize things like the whole economic system's physical scale, spatial and temporal system boundaries, consumer culture, and the inherent politics of the circular economy. We also suggest that a critical account of the COVID-19 pandemic needs to take on board the participation of accounting representations in the construction of particular narratives about the virus. In particular, calculations of the costs caused by COVID-19 need to be connected to the ecological value of viruses to illustrate how the social and the biological worlds are inextricably connected. In both cases, we suggest critical accounting researchers need to be actively involved in discussions about how valuation constructs narratives about resource or waste, with significant implications on how we conceive the relationship between humanity and the environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Larrinaga, C.; Garcia-Torea, N.",Critical Perspectives on Accounting,683,20

This case report presents an unexpected cause of biliopancreatic limb obstruction and the importance of prompt intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 37-year-old woman presented with complaints of weight regain (BMI increased from 27 to 33.3 kg/m2) and bile reflux and was found to have marginal ulcers on endoscopy. She had undergone loop gastric bypass with Braun anastomosis in 2009 at another center for morbid obesity (BMI = 43 kg/m2). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was created after the separation of gastro-jejunostomy (GJ) and jejuno-jejunostomy (JJ). On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was readmitted with signs of peritonitis. Urgent relaparoscopy showed Biliopancreatic limb (BP) obstruction. It was then and that we understood intraoperatively the uncut Roux-en-Y caused stricture between the previous GJ and JJ staple lines. Side-to-side jejuno-jejunostomy between the proximal dilated and the distal collapsed biliopancreatic limb was performed. RESULT: The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged after drain removal. CONCLUSION: Biliopancreatic limb obstruction requires prompt decision for relaparoscopy. Timely intervention is necessary to prevent postoperative morbidity.

Early start of rehabilitation and its continuation at home once the patient is discharged are key factors for the success of the process. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation solution (ReHub) on improving functional capacity and clinical outcomes for patients who underwent TKA. Methods/design: The study is a randomized, open-label with blinded outcome assessor, parallel assignment clinical trial with a sample size of 52 patients that is conducted according to the SPIRIT recommendations. After the TKA intervention, the patients are randomly allocated to the control group or the experimental group with a 1:1 ratio. Both groups follow a Fast Track recovery protocol which includes discharge after 2-3 days from surgery, a daily plan of 5 exercises for autonomous rehabilitation and domiciliary visits by a physiotherapist starting approximately 2 weeks after surgery. The experimental group uses the sensor-based telerehabilitation system ReHub to perform the exercises. The primary outcome measure is the range of motion of the knee. Secondary outcomes include physical performance, quality of life, pain intensity, muscle strength, treatment adherence and satisfaction with the ReHub system. The outcomes assessment is performed at hospital discharge (baseline), at stitch removal (2 weeks after baseline) and 2 weeks after stitch removal (4 weeks after baseline). The study conforms to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the hospital's ethics committee. Discussion: The study will address an important gap in the evidence base by reporting the effectiveness of an affordable and low-cost home-based telerehabilitation solution in patients who underwent TKA. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee (""Comite Etico de Investigacion Clinica del HCB"", reg. HCB/2019/0571). The trial was registred at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04155957). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals as well as national and international conferences. Trial registration: NCT04155957 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Highlights: Assessing a home-based telerehabilitation solution effectiveness in knee surgery. In situations such as the CoVid-19 pandemic, it is a resolutive intervention method. Telerehabilitation is an alternative to conventional face-to-face physical therapy. This system is far less demanding in terms of human resources.Range of motion assessment is the primary outcome measure.","Nuevo, M.; Mahdavi, H.; Rodriguez, D.; Faura, T.; Fabrellas, N.; Balocco, S.; Conti, M.; Castagna, A.; Prat, S.",International Journal of Surgery Protocols,683,20

However, data from European centres are scarce. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterise the gastrointestinal manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their disease course. METHODS: Patients admitted at our centre between March and April 2020 with diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Asymptomatic patients or those without symptom information were excluded. Clinical features, laboratory data and disease severity (mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission or death) were analysed. RESULTS: Two-hundred one patients were included (median age 71 years; 56.2% male). Digestive symptoms were reported by 60 (29.9%) patients during the disease course, being part of the disease presentation in 34 (16.9%). The most frequent were diarrhoea in 36 patients (17.9%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were younger (P = 0.032), had higher haemoglobin levels (P = 0.002) and lower C-reactive protein (P = 0.045) and potassium levels (P = 0.004). Patients with digestive symptoms had less severe disease (28.3 vs. 44.0%; P = 0.038). Regarding liver damage, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was elevated in 65.2% of patients and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 62.7%, but these patients did not present a more severe disease (elevated AST P = 0.062; elevated ALT P = 0.276). CONCLUSION: A significant portion of COVID-19 patients have digestive symptoms, mostly at presentation.

However, sharing information can be costly, which motivates developing policies that minimize group regret while also reducing the number of messages communicated by agents. Existing cooperative bandit algorithms obtain optimal performance when agents share information with their neighbors at \textit{every time step}, i.e., full communication. This requires $\Theta(T)$ number of messages, where $T$ is the time horizon of the decision making process. We propose \textit{ComEx}, a novel cost-effective communication protocol in which the group achieves the same order of performance as full communication while communicating only $O(\log T)$ number of messages. Our key step is developing a method to identify and only communicate the information crucial to achieving optimal performance. Further we propose novel algorithms for several benchmark cooperative bandit frameworks and show that our algorithms obtain \textit{state-of-the-art} performance while consistently incurring a significantly smaller communication cost than existing algorithms.","Madhushani, Udari; Leonard, Naomi",,683,20

The findings show that the 2012 Guidelines have had a positive and significant effect on the green patent output of HPEs, especially HPEs under stronger financial constraints. Furthermore, this positive effect occurred predominantly in HPEs with higher expected sunk costs or noncompliance costs, more intense product market competition, and state ownership. These results suggest that the GCP can stimulate green innovation in HPEs by exerting credit constraints, thus achieving green transformation in an emerging economy.

LID - 10.2217/fvl-2020-004,10.180829,9.967985,2020,"BACKGROUND: The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5-6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. FINDINGS: In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57·0 (IQR 47·0-65·0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186·0 (175·0-199·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5-6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5-6, and median CT scores were 3·0 (IQR 2·0-5·0) for severity scale 3, 4·0 (3·0-5·0) for scale 4, and 5·0 (4·0-6·0) for scale 5-6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1·61 (95% CI 0·80-3·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4·60 (1·85-11·48) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0·88 (0·66-1·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1·77 (1·05-2·97) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0·74 (0·58-0·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2·69 (1·46-4·96) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96·2% vs 58·5%) and median titres (19·0 vs 10·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1·73 m2 at follow-up. INTERPRETATION: At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

Disuse of chloroquine led to restoration of drug-sensitive parasite to some extent in certain countries. Ever since chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were touted as potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been a dramatic surge in demand for the drugs. Even in areas where chloroquine is proscribed, there has been an unexpected increase in demand and supply of the drug. This situation is quite worrying as the indiscriminate use of chloroquine may produce drug-resistant parasites which may impact negatively on the efficacy of amodiaquine due to cross-resistance. Amodiaquine is a partner drug in one of the ACTs and in some of the drugs used for intermittent preventive treatment. We herein discuss the consequences of the escalated use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19 on chemotherapy or chemoprevention of malaria and offer an advice. We speculate that parasite strains resistant to chloroquine will escalate due to the increased and indiscriminate use of the drug and consequently lead to cross-resistance with amodiaquine which is present in some drug schemes aforementioned. Under the circumstance, the anticipated hope of reverting to the use of the 'resurrected chloroquine' to manage malaria in future is likely to diminish. The use of chloroquine and its derivatives for the management of COVID-19 should be controlled.","Quashie, Neils Ben; Duah-Quashie, Nancy Odurowah",J. trop. pedriatr,683,16

However, the difference in the sociocultural contexts between countries requires the specific adjustment of these estimates to each scenario. This article analyses the main elements used for the construction of models from epidemiological patterns, to describe the interaction, explain the dynamics of infection and recovery, and to predict possible scenarios that may arise with the introduction of public health measures such as social distancing and quarantines, specifically in the case of the pandemic unleashed by the new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus. Comment: Mathematical models are highly relevant for making objective and effective decisions to control and eradicate the disease. These models used for COVID-19 have supported and will continue to provide information for the selection and implementation of programs and public policies that prevent associated complications, reduce the speed of the virus spread and minimize the occurrence of severe cases of the disease that may collapse health systems.","Grillo Ardila, Elvia Karina; Santaella-Tenorio, Julián; Guerrero, Rodrigo; Bravo, Luis Eduardo",Colomb Med (Cali),683,23

The present discussion is to bring the focus on various social issues that emerge during outbreak and calls for equal attention as that of other health-care interventions. These issues are summarized in three categories: first, stigmatization due to lack of knowledge about the source of infection; second, speculations and their consequences around lack of knowledge about transmission; and finally, the concern regarding miscommunication during such a crisis. Most of these concerns emerge from press and social media coverage of the episode. The Ebola outbreak response is an example of how social scientists and anthropologists can work with other experts to solve questions of public health importance. Their approach toward the community with the objective to understand the sources, reasons, and circumstances of the infection will help to manage the current outbreak.

OBJECTIVES: This is the first Italian study aiming to assess the magnitude of environmental contamination in a COVID-19 non-Intensive Care Unit. METHODS: In addition to ordinary cleaning procedures, surface and air samplings have been performed before and after the application of two different sanitization devices. Samples have been analyzed with Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction in order to find viral RNA. RESULTS: All samples obtained from surfaces and air before and after extra-ordinary sanitization procedures turned out negative for viral detection.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the absence of computational approaches to understand the molecular basis of this infection rapidly. Here we present an integrated approach to the study of the nsp1 protein in SARS-CoV-1, which plays an essential role in maintaining the expression of viral proteins and further disabling the host protein expression, also known as the host shutoff mechanism. We present three independent methods of evaluating two potential binding sites speculated to participate in host shutoff by nsp1. We have combined results from computed models of nsp1, with deep mining of all existing protein structures (using PDBMine), and binding site recognition (using msTALI) to examine the two sites consisting of residues 55-59 and 73-80. Based on our preliminary results, we conclude that the residues 73-80 appear as the regions that facilitate the critical initial steps in the function of nsp1. Given the 90% sequence identity between nsp1 from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conjecture the same critical initiation step in the function of COVID-19 nsp1.","Pandala, Niharika; Cole, Casey A.; McFarland, Devaun; Nag, Anita; Columbia, Homayoun Valafar University of South Carolina; Upstate, University of South Carolina",,683,26

The acute and or chronic detrimental impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health, especially depression, is increasingly described. Simultaneously the pandemic has influenced depressive symptomatology by modifying economic, social and political structures, in addition to affecting daily routines. In both cases, associated immunological perturbations favoring a pro-inflammatory state could underlie an increased risk for depressive symptomatology. A resultant elevation in global depressive burden could further tax mental health care infrastructure and contribute to a range of worse health outcomes including diminished quality of life.

Thus, all countries are employing a lot of resources in order to test more and more subjects. For this purpose, there are different strategies, based on either direct or indirect tests. Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed. In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed.

Here, we examined attachment dynamics in dyadic interactions, focusing specifically on the role of physiological coregulation in state attachment processes in couples oversampled for personality pathology. A total of 121 couples completed a 10-minute discussion about an area of disagreement in their relationship and a 5-minute discussion in which they planned an event together. We used a dynamical model of heart rate changes to estimate coregulation. We found that (a) increases in state attachment avoidance were associated with contrarian coregulation (heart rate becoming misaligned with the partner's physiology) and (b) conversely, increases in state attachment anxiety were associated with dependent coregulation (heart rate becoming aligned with the partners' physiology). Dispositional attachment insecurity moderated the effects of state attachment insecurity on physiological coregulation. Whereas dispositional anxiety predicted individuals exhibiting dependent coregulation in response to state insecurity, dispositional avoidance predicted contrarian coregulation in response to state insecurity. This work provides insight into the role of physiological coregulation in attachment dynamics among couples oversampled for personality pathology, suggesting that disruptions to coregulation contribute to impaired emotion regulation during romantic conflicts.

This Health Policy identifies the necessary characteristics for a new global public health security convention designed to optimise prevention, preparedness, and response to pandemic infectious diseases. We propose ten recommendations to strengthen global public health governance and promote compliance with global health security regulations. Recommendations for a new global public health security convention include greater authority for a global governing body, an improved ability to respond to pandemics, an objective evaluation system for national core public health capacities, more effective enforcement mechanisms, independent and sustainable funding, representativeness, and investment from multiple sectors, among others. The next steps to achieve these recommendations include assembling an invested alliance, specifying the operational structures of a global public health security system, and overcoming barriers such as insufficient political will, scarcity of resources, and individual national interests.","Duff, Johnathan H; Liu, Anicca; Saavedra, Jorge; Batycki, Jacob N; Morancy, Kendra; Stocking, Barbara; Gostin, Lawrence O; Galea, Sandro; Bertozzi, Stefano; Zuniga, Jose M; Alberto-Banatin, Carmencita; Dansua, Akua Sena; Del Rio, Carlos; Kulzhanov, Maksut; Lee, Kelley; Scaglia, Gisela; Shahpar, Cyrus; Ullmann, Andrew J; Hoffman, Steven J; Weinstein, Michael; Szapocznik, José",Lancet Public Health,683,7

This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying. Finally, two cases are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.","Fu, Peihua; Jing, Bailu; Chen, Tinggui; Xu, Chonghuan; Yang, Jianjun; Cong, Guodong",Front Public Health,683,21

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate temporal changes of quantitative CT findings in patients with COVID-19 in three clinic types, including moderate, severe, and non-survivors, and to predict severe cases in the early stage from the results. METHODS: One hundred and two patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Based on the time interval between onset of symptoms and the CT scan, four stages were defined in this study: Stage-1 (0 â¼7 days); Stage-2 (8 â¼ 14 days); Stage-3 (15 â¼ 21days); Stage-4 (> 21 days). Eight parameters, the infection volume and percentage of the whole lung in four different Hounsfield (HU) ranges, ((-, -750), [-750, -300), [-300, 50) and [50, +)), were calculated and compared between different groups. RESULTS: The infection volume and percentage of four HU ranges peaked in Stage-2. The highest proportion of HU [-750, 50) was found in the infected regions in non-survivors among three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate rapid deterioration in the first week since the onset of symptoms in non-survivors. Higher proportion of HU [-750, 50) in the lesion area might be a potential bio-marker for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.","Chen, Xiaohui; Sun, Wenbo; Xu, Dan; Ma, Jiaojiao; Xiao, Feng; Xu, Haibo",Technol Health Care,683,16

The analysis is divided into three parts and addresses problematic issues associated with different stages of the pandemic. In the first part of the paper, the author outlines the asylum practices of EU Member States in the initial stage of the Covid-19 pandemic during which the pandemic was perceived as a state of emergency. By exploring the legal possibilities to derogate both from the EU asylum rules and international human rights standards, the author offers conclusions as regards limits of derogations and the legality of Member States' practices, especially their failure to differentiate between rules that are susceptive of being derogated in emergency situations and those that are not. The second part of the paper analyses the current phase of the pandemic in which it is perceived as a 'new normal' and focuses on making the EU asylum system immune to Covid-19 influence to the greatest extent possible and in line with relevant EU and human rights rules. The author insists on the vulnerability as an inherent feature of persons in need of international protection and researches upon the relationship between the two competing interests involved - protection of asylum seekers and ensuring public health as a legitimate reason for restricting certain asylum seekers' rights. The final part of the paper analyses the prospects of the future EU asylum system, as announced by the New Pact on Migration and Asylum in September 2020, to adapt to the exigencies of both the current Covid-19 crisis and pandemics that are yet to come. With an exclusive focus on referral to Covid-19 and provisions relevant for the current and future pandemics, the author criticizes several solutions included in the instruments that make up the Pact. It is concluded that the Pact failed to offer solutions for problems experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic and that, under the pretext of public health, it prioritizes the interests of Member States over the interests of applicants for international protection.","Čučković, Bojana PhD Associate Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,683,8

The survey assessed passengers' knowledge of symptoms, actions to take, and attitudes towards PHE COVID-19 public health information; interviews explored their views of official public health information and self-isolation. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one passengers participated in the survey and 15 in follow-up interviews. Eighty three percentage of surveyed passengers correctly identified all three COVID-19 associated symptoms listed in PHE information at that time. Most could identify the recommended actions and found the advice understandable and trustworthy. Interviews revealed that passengers shared concerns about the lack of wider official action, and that passengers' knowledge had been acquired elsewhere as much from PHE. Respondents also noted their own agency in choosing to self-isolate, partially as a self-protective measure. CONCLUSION: PHE COVID-19 public health information was perceived as clear and acceptable, but we found that passengers acquired knowledge from various sources and they saw the provision of information alone on arrival as an insufficient official response. Our study provides fresh insights into the importance of taking greater account of diverse information sources and of the need for public assurance in creating public health information materials to address global health threats.","Zhang, T; Robin, C; Cai, S; Sawyer, C; Rice, W; Smith, L E; Amlôt, R; Rubin, G J; Reynolds, R; Yardley, L; Hickman, M; Oliver, I; Lambert, H",Public Health,683,20

The nanostructures are hydrophobic, highly uniform in width (4-5 nm) and variable in length (up to 1200 nm). Whereas the particle width is constrained by the size of the catanionic reverse micelles, changes in the reaction conditions such as the concentration of the surfactant salts and [Ce(AOT)]/[(CTA)PO] molar ratio, markedly influence the length of the inorganic nanostructures. The CePO nanofilaments are crystalline and morphologically invariant with regard to changes in the reaction conditions, whereas the Co(PO) nanorods are amorphous and more sensitive to modifications in the surfactant salt molar ratio. The results are consistent with a mechanism based on the slow uni-directional aggregation/crystallization of nanoscale surfactant-coated inorganic building blocks.","Xing, Yan; Li, Mei; Davis, Sean A; Patil, Avinash J; Mann, Stephen",Soft Matter,683,1

Detection and diagnosis are steps in the right direction: misconfigurations cause many costly failures and severe performance issues. But, we argue that continued focus on detection and diagnosis is symptomatic of a more serious problem: configuration design and implementation are not yet first-class software engineering endeavors in cloud systems. Little is known about how and why developers evolve configuration design and implementation, and the challenges that they face in doing so. This paper presents a source-code level study of the evolution of configuration design and implementation in cloud systems. Our goal is to understand the rationale and developer practices for revising initial configuration design/implementation decisions, especially in response to consequences of misconfigurations. To this end, we studied 1178 configuration-related commits from a 2.5 year version-control history of four large-scale, actively-maintained open-source cloud systems (HDFS, HBase, Spark, and Cassandra). We derive new insights into the software configuration engineering process. Our results motivate new techniques for proactively reducing misconfigurations by improving the configuration design and implementation process in cloud systems.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult visits for suspected COVID-19 between March 1 - April 30, 2020 at 15 EDs in Southern California. The primary outcomes were death or respiratory decompensation within 7-days. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models and logistic regression to derive a risk score. We report metrics for derivation and validation cohorts, and subgroups with pneumonia or COVID-19 diagnoses. RESULTS: 26,600 ED encounters were included and 1079 experienced an adverse event. Five categories (comorbidities, obesity/BMI &#8805; 40, vital signs, age and sex) were included in the final score. The area under the curve (AUC) in the derivation cohort was 0.891 (95% CI, 0.880-0.901); similar performance was observed in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.895, 95% CI, 0.874-0.916).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to assess the prevalence of stroke stratified by race among patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 who visited emergency department (ED) up to August 13, 2020 in the United States (US). We used multivariable logistic regression to compare the odds of stroke in Black patients with COVID-19 compared to their non-Black counterparts while adjusting for the major potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 8815 patients with ED visits with COVID-19, 77 (0.87%), 95% confidence interval CI (95% CI): 0.69% to 1.10%) had ischemic stroke. The mean age of patients with stroke was 64 years (SD: 2 years); 28 (43%) were men, 55 (71%) had hypertension, and 29 (50%) were Black. The prevalence of ischemic stroke in Blacks, non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics was 1.26% (95% CI: 0.86% to 1.83%), 0.84% (95% CI: 0.51% to 1.37%) and 0.49% (95% CI: 0.26% to 0.88%) respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, drinking and smoking, the likelihood of stroke was higher in Black than non-Black patients (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.13 to 7.15, p=0.03).

Although correlation does not equate causation, once we come to understand the correlational structure of an assessment program, we can use that information to make predictions of future performance, to consider early intervention for students who are otherwise likely to drop out, and to inform revisions in either assessment or teaching. This article demonstrates how the correlational structure of an assessment program can be represented in terms of a network, in which the assessments constitute our nodes and the degree of connectedness between any two nodes can be represented as a thicker or thinner line connecting these two nodes, depending on whether the correlation between the two assessments at hand is stronger or weaker.

In this study, the neuroimaging findings and clinical course of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary care hospital network in Canada were characterized. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary hospital network in Ontario, Canada. All adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted from February 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020 who received neuroimaging related to their COVID-19 admission were included. CT and MR images were reviewed and categorized by fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS: We identified 422 patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period. 103 (24.4%) met the inclusion criteria and were included: 30 ICU patients (29.1%) and 73 non-ICU patients (70.9%). A total of 198 neuroimaging studies were performed: 177 CTs and 21 MRIs. 17 out of 103 imaged patients (16.8%) had acute abnormalities on neuroimaging: 10 had macrohemorrhages (58.8%), 9 had acute ischemia (52.9%), 4 had SWI abnormalities (23.5%), and 1 had asymmetric sulcal effacement suggesting possible focal encephalitis (5.8%). ICU patients were more likely to have positive neuroimaging findings, more specifically acute ischemia and macrohemorrhages (P < 0.05). Macrohemorrhages were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Macrohemorrhages, acute ischemia and SWI abnormalities were the main neuroimaging abnormalities in our cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The approach is tested in application of the micro-solvated, protected amino acid Ac-Phe-OMe , by using the scaled anharmonic hybrid potential in the VSCF and VSCF-PT2 algorithms. The hybrid potential method yields results in good accord with experiment, and very close to these obtained in calculations with the high level, very costly potential from the large basis set. At the same time, the hybrid potential calculations are much less expensive. The results of the hybrid calculations are much more accurate than these computed from the potential surface corresponding to the modest basis set. The results are very encouraging for using the hybrid potential method for inexpensive yet sufficiently accurate anharmonic calculations for the spectra of large bio-molecules.","Roy, Tapta Kanchan; Gerber, R Benny",,683,21

While both of the deep learning systems outperformed the system using the linguistically informed rules, we found that through the integration of (the output of) the three systems a better performance could be achieved than the standalone performance of each approach in a cross-validation setting. However, on the test data the performance of the integration was slightly lower than our best performing deep learning model. These results hardly indicate any progress in line of integrating machine learning and expert rules driven systems. We expect that the release of the annotation manuals and gold labels of the test data after this workshop will shed light on these perplexing results.","Hurriyetouglu, Ali; Safaya, Ali; Oostdijk, Nelleke; Mutlu, Osman; Yoruk, Erdem",,683,16

Torsade de pointes typically occurs in bursts of self-limiting episodes with symptoms of dizziness and syncope. However, it may occasionally progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. In this article, we report a case of COVID-19 patient who developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with torsade de pointes morphology with normal QTc interval in the setting of fever. An 81-year-old woman was admitted with symptoms of COVID-19. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and doxycycline at an outside facility and finished the treatment 5 days prior to admission to our facility. Her course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring cardioversion. Later, she developed two episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with TdP morphology with normal QTc. There was a correlation with fever triggering the ventricular tachycardia. We advocated aggressive fever control given the QTc was normal and stable. Following fever control, the patient remained stable and had no abnormal rhythm. COVID-19 patients are prone to different arrhythmias including life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias with normal left ventricular systolic function and normal QTc, and they should be monitored for fever and electrolyte abnormality during their hospital stay.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Port, Zachary; Wiener, Philip C; Amanullah, Aman; Mainigi, Sumeet K",SN Compr Clin Med,683,15

As sleep problems may persist and hurt health, it is important to identify which populations have experienced changes in sleeping patterns during the pandemic and their extent. METHODS: In Study 1, 3,062 responders from 49 countries accessed the survey website voluntarily between March 26-April 26, 2020, and 2,562 (84%; age: 45.2±14.5, 68% women) completed the study. In Study 2, 1,022 adult US responders were recruited for pay through Mechanical Turk, and 971 (95%; age 40.4±13.6, 52% women) completed the study. The survey tool included demographics and items adapted from validated sleep questionnaires on sleep duration, quality and timing, and sleeping pills consumption. RESULTS: In Study 1, 58% of the responders were unsatisfied with their sleep. Forty percent of the responders reported a decreased sleep quality vs. before COVID-19 crisis. Self-reported sleeping pill consumption increased by 20% (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated that female sex, being in quarantine, 31 to 45-year age group, reduced physical activity and adverse impact on livelihood were independently associated with more severe worsening of sleep quality during the pandemic. The majority of findings were reproduced in the independent cohort of Study 2. CONCLUSIONS: Changes imposed due to the pandemic have led to a surge in individuals reporting sleep problems across the globe. The findings raise the need to screen for worsening sleep patterns and use of sleeping aids, especially in more susceptible populations, namely, women and people with insecure livelihoods subjected to social isolation.","Mandelkorn, Uri; Genzer, Shir; Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Reiter, Joel; Meira E Cruz, Miguel; Hochner, Hagit; Kheirandish-Gozal, Leila; Gozal, David; Gileles-Hillel, Alex",J. clin. sleep med,683,16

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to present an epidemiological analysis of the first two months (March and April 2020) of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis was based on data from epidemiological reports collected between March 4 and April 30, 2020, by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate. These epidemiological reports include data on sociodemographic characteristics of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the number of COVID-19 related deaths, the number of recovered COVID-19 patients, as well as the number of laboratory tests performed. Results: From March 4 to April 30, 2020, a total of 12,877 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were registered in Poland (55.7% women, mean age 50.6 (20.5) years). The RT-PCR test was performed on 338,000 patients. The notification rate for COVID-19 was 33.2 per 100,000 inhabitants. One-third of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were among quarantined persons, 26.1% were related to the healthcare system (hospital or clinic), and 13.3% occurred in nursing homes. As of April 30, 2020, 644 COVID-19-related deaths were registered in Poland (46.5% women). The death rate for the whole country was 1.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show higher notification rate for COVID-19 among women than men but men more likely to die from COVID-19. The notification rate for COVID-19 in Poland among women aged 45-54 years is two times higher than among men.","Raciborski, Filip; Pinkas, Jaroslaw; Jankowski, Mateusz; Sierpinski, Radoslaw; Zgliczynski, Wojciech S; Szumowski, Lukasz; Rakocy, Kamil; Wierzba, Waldemar; Gujski, Mariusz",Pol.

Testing for COVID-19 infection is performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, but availability is limited in many parts of the world. The role of chest computed tomography is yet to be determined and may vary depending on the local prevalence of disease and availability of laboratory testing. A common but nonspecific pattern of disease with a somewhat predictable progression is seen in patients with COVID-19. Specifically, patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of the lower lungs may be present initially, eventually undergoing coalescence, consolidation, and organization, and ultimately showing features of fibrosis. In this article, we review the computed tomography features of COVID-19 infection. Familiarity with these findings and their evolution will help radiologists recognize potential COVID-19 and recognize the significant overlap with other causes of acute lung injury.","Goyal, Nikhil; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Keir, Graham; Mei, Xueyan; Huang, Mingqian; Li, Shaolin; Kanne, Jeffrey P",J Thorac Imaging,683,13

Since its first appearance in December 2019, the outbreak has already caused over 5.8 million infections worldwide (till 29 May 2020), with more than 0.35 million deaths. Early virus-mediated immune suppression is believed to be one of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes at least partially to the viral pathogenesis. In this study, we identified the key viral interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with two well-characterized SARS-CoV interferon antagonists, PLpro and orf6. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6, but not the unique orf8, could potently suppress primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Although SARS-CoV PLpro has been well-characterized for its potent interferon-antagonizing, deubiquitinase and protease activities, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, despite sharing high amino acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, loses both interferon-antagonising and deubiquitinase activities. Among the 27 viral proteins, SARS-CoV-2 orf6 demonstrated the strongest suppression on both primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Orf6-deleted SARS-CoV-2 may be considered for the development of intranasal live-but-attenuated vaccine against COVID-19.","Yuen, Chun-Kit; Lam, Joy-Yan; Wong, Wan-Man; Mak, Long-Fung; Wang, Xiaohui; Chu, Hin; Cai, Jian-Piao; Jin, Dong-Yan; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kok, Kin-Hang",Emerg Microbes Infect,683,20

We studied public perception of social distancing through organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we retrieved English-only tweets matching two trending social distancing hashtags, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We analyzed the tweets using natural language processing and machine-learning models, and we conducted a sentiment analysis to identify emotions and polarity. We evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and associated sentiments. RESULTS: We studied a sample of 574,903 tweets. For both hashtags, polarity was positive (mean, 0.148; SD, 0.290); only 15% of tweets had negative polarity. Tweets were more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0-0.6) with ~30% of tweets labeled as completely objective (labeled as 0 in range from 0 to 1). Approximately half of tweets (50.4%) primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise. Each correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure and community support (ie, joy), concerns about food insecurity and quarantine effects (ie, fear), and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications (ie, surprise). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the positive sentiment, preponderance of objective tweets, and topics supporting coping mechanisms, we concluded that Twitter users generally supported social distancing in the early stages of their implementation.","Saleh, Sameh N; Lehmann, Christoph U; McDonald, Samuel A; Basit, Mujeeb A; Medford, Richard J",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,683,20

Furthermore, the sensitivities towards the aquatic species reveal that from the studied ILs, BMIMBF4 with an acceptable risk value of 3200 × 10-5 mmol/L is the most suitable IL towards the selected aquatic species. Hence, current work provides cumulative allowable concentrations and acceptable risk values for ILs which release to aquatic compartment of ecosystem.","Khan, Muhammad Ishaq; Mubashir, Muhammad; Zaini, Dzulkarnain; Mahnashi, Mater H; Alyami, Bandar A; Alqarni, Ali O; Show, Pau Loke",J Hazard Mater,683,6

The study investigates the prevalence, duration, most popular activities, and social selectivity of home-based digital sport and its contribution to overall levels of sporting activity during the pandemic. It is based on cross-sectional survey data (n = 1508), representing the population >14 years living in Germany. Data collection took place in October 2020, using computer-assisted web interviewing. Results show that overall, 23% of respondents used digital media for sports activities at least one time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Numbers increased during the lockdown and decreased afterwards. People engaged in a variety of fitness workouts, most frequently practiced with the help of publicly accessible fitness videos from video-sharing platforms. Digital sports practitioners are younger, better educated, and financially better off. Females are overrepresented. Individuals engaged in digital sports achieved 30 min/week more sports activity during the pandemic compared to individuals solely involved in offline sports. Hence, home-based digital sports activities were a popular means to stay active, particularly in the period of the lockdown. Strong social disparities indicate that the possible health benefits of digital sports only reach out to particular population groups.","Mutz, Michael; Müller, Johannes; Reimers, Anne K",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),683,29

The metabolic disease type 2 diabetes (T2D) significantly increases the risk of developing active TB. Effective new TB vaccine candidates and novel therapeutic interventions are required to meet the challenges of global TB eradication. Recent evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a significant role in how the host responds to infection, injury and neoplastic changes. Animal models that closely reflect human physiology are crucial in assessing new treatments and to decipher the underlying immunological defects responsible for increased TB susceptibility in comorbid patients. In this study, using a diet-induced murine T2D model that reflects the etiopathogenesis of clinical T2D and increased TB susceptibility, we investigated how the intestinal microbiota may impact the development of T2D, and how the gut microbial composition changes following a very low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our data revealed a substantial intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in T2D mice compared to non-diabetic animals. The observed differences were comparable to previous clinical reports in TB patients, in which it was shown that Mtb infection causes rapid loss of microbial diversity. Furthermore, diversity index and principle component analyses demonstrated distinct clustering of Mtb-infected non-diabetic mice vs. Mtb-infected T2D mice. Our findings support a broad applicability of T2D mice as a tractable small animal model for studying distinct immune parameters, microbiota and the immune-metabolome of TB/T2D comorbidity. This model may also enable answers to be found to critical outstanding questions about targeted interventions of the gut microbiota and the gut-lung axis.","Sathkumara, Harindra D; Eaton, Janet L; Field, Matt A; Govan, Brenda L; Ketheesan, Natkunam; Kupz, Andreas",Animal Model Exp Med,683,16

Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown. Our purpose was to evaluate whether mortality can be predicted from either of two lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS) as well as the potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged>70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. RESULTS: LUSS8 vs LUSS12 predicted mortality in 93.3% vs 91.1% of the cases; their associated odds ratios (OR) were 1.67 (95% CI 1.20-2.31) and 1.57 (95% CI 1.10-2.23), respectively. The association between biochemical parameters and LUSS scores was significant for ferritin; the OR for LUSS12 was 1.005 (95% CI 1.001-1.009) and for LUSS8 1.005 (95% CI 1.0-1.1), using thresholds for both of them. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic capacity of LUSS12 does not surpass that of LUSS8.

Education is especially affected, with schools and universities widely closed for long periods. People under 25 years have the lowest risk of severe disease but their activities can be key to persistent ongoing community transmission. A challenge arose for how to provide education, including university level, without the activities of students increasing wider community SARS-CoV-2 infections. We used a Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) framework to assess the risks associated with university student activity and recommend how to mitigate these risks. This tool appealed because it relies on multiagency collaboration and interdisciplinary expertise and yet is low cost, allowing rapid generation of evidence-based recommendations. We identified key critical control points associated with university student' activities, lifestyle, and interaction patterns both on-and-off campus. Unacceptable contact thresholds and the most up-to-date guidance were used to identify levels of risk for potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as well as recommendations based on existing research and emerging evidence for strategies that can reduce the risks of transmission. Employing the preventative measures we suggest can reduce the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among and from university students. Reduction of infectious disease transmission in this demographic will reduce overall community transmission, lower demands on health services and reduce risk of harm to clinically vulnerable individuals while allowing vital education activity to continue. HACCP assessment proved a flexible tool for risk analysis in a specific setting in response to an emerging infectious disease threat. Systematic approaches to assessing hazards and risk critical control points (#HACCP) enable robust strategies for protecting students and staff in HE settings during #COVID19 pandemic.","Edmunds, Kelly L; Bowater, Laura; Brainard, Julii; de Coriolis, Jean-Charles; Lake, Iain; Malik, Rimsha R; Newark, Lorraine; Ward, Neil; Yeoman, Kay; Hunter, Paul R",Risk anal,683,24

The present study's objective was to know the variables associated with the risk of major depression during confinement due to SAR-CoV-2 in patients with AS and COPD in the Colombian Caribbean. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional observational study was done with the participation of patients diagnosed with AS or COPD. AS and COPD patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to identify a major depressive disorder risk. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven patients diagnosed with AS or COPD aged 18 to 69 (M=60.4, SD=17.6) participated. The risk of major depression was assessed using the PHQ-9 sent online after telephone contact with the participants. 30.7% of the patients during the last month reported a risk of major depression, and it was associated with a history of major depressive disorder (OR=4.39, 95% CI 1.53-12.67) and medical comorbidity (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.00-2.86). CONCLUSIONS: The depression risk is associated with a history of depressive disorder and medical comorbidity in patients with AS and COPD. Medical history is the leading risk factor for depression during confinement. It is recommended to carry out studies with many participants and study other variables that may mediate said associations during confinement by SAR-CoV-2 in the Colombian Caribbean.","Caballero-Domínguez, Carmen Cecilia; Pedrozo-Pupo, John Carlos; Campo-Arias, Adalberto",Psychiatr Danub,683,1

Therefore, it is important to have a reliable estimate of respiratory effort to guarantee lung and diaphragm protective mechanical ventilation. Recently, a novel non-invasive method was found to detect excessive dynamic transpulmonary driving pressure (&#8710;PL) and respiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) with reasonable accuracy. During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was impossible to obtain the gold standard for respiratory effort, esophageal manometry, in every patient. Therefore, we investigated whether this novel non-invasive method could also be applied in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: &#8710;PL and Pmus were derived from esophageal manometry in COVID-19 patients. In addition, &#8710;PL and Pmus were computed from the occlusion pressure (&#8710;Pocc) obtained during an expiratory occlusion maneuver. Measured and computed &#8710;PL and Pmus were compared and discriminative performance for excessive &#8710;PL and Pmus was assessed. The relation between occlusion pressure and respiratory effort was also assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Patients had a low dynamic lung compliance [24 (20-31) mL/cmH2O], high &#8710;PL (25 ± 6 cmH2O) and high Pmus (16 ± 7 cmH2O). Low agreement was found between measured and computed &#8710;PL and Pmus. Excessive &#8710;PL > 20 cmH2O and Pmus > 15 cmH2O were accurately detected (area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.00], sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 72-100%) and specificity 100% (95% CI, 16-100%) and AUROC 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00), sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 54-100%) and specificity 86% (95% CI, 42-100%), respectively). Respiratory effort calculated per minute was highly correlated with &#8710;Pocc (for esophageal pressure time product per minute (PTPes/min) r2 = 0.73; P = 0.0002 and work of breathing (WOB) r2 = 0.85; P < 0.0001).

When the SARS-CoV-2 enters the biological fluids in the human body, different types of biomolecules (in particular proteins) may adsorb on its surface and alter its infection ability. Although great efforts have recently been devoted to the interaction of the specific antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2, it still remains largely unknown how the other serum proteins affect the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we systematically investigate the interaction of serum proteins with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by the molecular docking and the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the non-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) indeed cannot effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD while the human serum albumin (HSA) may have some potential of blocking its infection (to ACE2). More importantly, we find that the RBD can cause the significant structural change of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), by which SARS-CoV-2 may hijack the metabolic pathway of the ApoE to facilitate its cell entry. The present study enhances the understanding of the role of protein corona in the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2, which may aid the more precise and personalized treatment for COVID-19 infection in the clinic.","Yin, Yue-wen; Sheng, Yan-jing; Wang, Min; Ni, Song-di; Ding, Hong-ming; Ma, Yu-qiang",,683,16

Severe infections induce hyperinflammatory responses that are often intensified by host adaptive immune pathways to profoundly advance disease severity. Proinflammatory responses are triggered by CoV entry mediated by host cell surface receptors. Interestingly, five of the seven strains use three cell surface metallopeptidases (CD13, CD26, and ACE2) as receptors, whereas the others employ O-acetylated-sialic acid (a key feature of metallopeptidases) for entry. Why CoV evolved to use peptidases as their receptors is unknown, but the peptidase activities of the receptors are dispensable, suggesting the virus uses/benefits from other functions of these molecules. Indeed, these receptors participate in the immune modulatory pathways that contribute to the pathological hyperinflammatory response. This review will focus on the role of CoV receptors in modulating immune responses.","Devarakonda, Charan Kumar V; Meredith, Emily; Ghosh, Mallika; Shapiro, Linda H",J Immunol,683,19

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated two rapid antigen immunochromatographic tests, Abbott Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Panbio) and Zhejiang Orient Gene/Healgen Biotech Coronavirus Ag rapid test cassette (Orient gene) for detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The tests were evaluated on nasopharyngeal samples taken from individuals having respiratory and/or COVID-19 related symptoms, which had been analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time PCR. In total 156 PCR-positive, and 130 (Panbio) and 176 (Orient Gene) PCR-negative samples were analyzed. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 71.8% and 100% for Panbio and 79.5% and 74.4% for the Orient Gene test respectively. The false positives by the Orient Gene test were verified as SARS-CoV-2 negative by in-house real-time PCR assay and were negative for the four seasonal coronaviruses. Subgroup analysis revealed that the antigen tests had high sensitivity for samples with Ct-values <25 (>88%) and for samples containing infectious viruses as determined by cultivation on Vero cells, 94.1% and 97.1% for the Panbio and Orient gene tests, respectively. Furthermore, both tests had a sensitivity of <50 picogram for nucleocapsid protein. No sample with a Ct-value >27 was shown to contain infectious virus. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the rapid antigen tests, especially the Panbio tests may be a valuable tool to detect contagious persons during the ongoing pandemic.","Nordgren, Johan; Sharma, Sumit; Olsson, Henrik; Jämtberg, Mikael; Falkeborn, Tina; Svensson, Lennart; Hagbom, Marie",J Clin Virol,683,21

As of now, COVID-19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2’) within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.

This study aimed to describe and compare the symptom burden and clinical management in adult patients seen at a COVID-19 Recovery Engagement Clinic (CORE) between hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: A prospective observational study of COVID-19 adult patients referred to the CORE clinic, from June-December, 2020 was performed. Eligible patients had either a positive COVID-19 PCR or IgG antibody test. All patients were administered a modified revised Edmonton Physical Symptom Assessment (mrESAS), where patients were asked to quantify their level of 13 symptoms over the week prior to presentation to the clinic using a numerical rating scale between 0 (none) and 10 (the highest level imaginable). The ten most common symptoms were then tallied to generate a total symptom score that could range from 0-100. All patient qualified their physical, emotional and cognitive function post-COVID (as the same, worse or better) compared to before acute COVID illness. Chart review was used to collect additional information on patient's history, demographics, and to summarize relevant clinical management. Results: Of the 127 adults who presented to CORE clinic (mean age 52, SD 14.0), 43 (34.4%) had been hospitalized for COVID-related acute illness. Adults who were hospitalized were older than those who were not hospitalized (mean age (standard deviation (SD) 58.6 (11.7) in hospitalized versus 48.9 (12.7) in non-hospitalized, p&lt;0.001). Figure 1 summarizes the prevalence of symptoms on presentation to the clinic (median (IQR) time in days from PCR first positive 139.5 (124, 162)1). The four most common symptoms were: fatigue (n=110 (88.0%);anxiety (n=95 (76.0%);shortness of breath (n=96 (76.8%);pain (n=92 (73.6%). Of the cohort, 84.7%, 73.4%, and 59.7% reported being worse in their physical, emotional, and cognitive health respectively compared to before COVID-19 acute illness. There were few clinically or statistically significant differences in the prevalence or severity of symptoms by hospitalization status (median (interquartile range) of total symptom score 39 (28-56) in hospitalized versus 32 (20-47) in hospitalized patients, p-value=0.09. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks after testing positive, most commonly being fatigue, anxiety, shortness of breath, and pain. We found no significant difference in symptom presentation between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Further symptom assessment in post-acute care of COVID-19 patients is necessary, specifically with a larger sample size to compare hospitalization status.","Lessen, S.; Vayner, Y.; Tomer, D.; Congdon, S.; Gong, M.

PURPOSE: This report describes a health-system pharmacy's response to a natural disaster while staff members simultaneously prepared for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By detailing our experience, we hope to help other institutions that are current facing or could encounter similar crises. SUMMARY: In early March 2020, a tornado destroyed the health system's warehouse for storage of most clinical supplies, including personal protective equipment and fluids. The pharmacy purchasing team collaborated with suppliers and manufacturers to recover losses and establish alternative storage areas. Days later, the pharmacy department was forced to address the impending COVID-19 pandemic. Key elements of the COVID-19 response included reducing the potential for patient and staff virus exposure; overcoming challenges in sourcing of staff, personal protective equipment, and medications; and changing care delivery practices to maintain high-quality patient care while maximizing social distancing. The pharmacy department also created distance learning opportunities for 70 pharmacy students on rotations. After an initial plan, ongoing needs include adjustment in patient care activities if significant staff losses occur, when and how to resume clinical activities, and how to best utilize the resources accumulated. Elements of practice changes implemented to reduce COVID-19 threats to patients and pharmacy personnel have proven beneficial and will be further evaluated for potential continuation. CONCLUSION: The pharmacy department's efforts to respond to a natural disaster and unprecedented pandemic have proven successful to this point and have illuminated several lessons, including the necessity of cohesive department communication, staff flexibility, prioritization of teamwork, and external collaboration.","Zuckerman, Autumn D; Patel, Pratish C; Sullivan, Mark; Potts, Amy; Knostman, Molly; Humphreys, Elizabeth; O039,; Neal, Michael; Bryant, Andrea; Torr, Donna K; Lobo, Bob; Peek, Grayson; Kelley, Tara; Manfred, James; Tomichek, Jason; Crothers, Garrett; Catlin, Rusty; Brumagin, Hannah E; Hughes, Leslee; Hayman, Jim",Am. j. health system pharm,683,16

This results in social sorting of people with subsequent unforeseen consequences leading to discrimination and curtailment of freedoms for both animals and their owners. Ultimately this opens people up to further intrusive targeting by commercial interests and, more alarmingly, scrutiny from law enforcement agencies.Design/methodology/approachAn empirical study examining an initiative involving the collection of canine DNA sources data from publicly available Cabinet, Select Committee and Scrutiny Committee records from the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham (LBBD).

Methods include analysis of documents, semiotic and discourse analysis.FindingsThis paper highlights the importance of animals to surveillance studies and examines the extent to which animals are a part of the surveillant assemblage in their own right. It also demonstrates how nonhuman animals extend the reach of the surveillant assemblage.Social implicationsThe scheme was called a badge of considerate dog ownership, yet it is one that can be franchised to tie up with diverse income streams being described as advantageous in the age of austerity. In 2017, it was reported that this scheme was to be rolled out in other areas and was moving from being voluntary to being mandatory with the enforcement of Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs). These have been described as “geographically defined ASBOS” that have come into force under the Anti-social Behaviour and Policing Act (2014);they often work to criminalise activities that were not previously considered illegal.Originality/valueIn the theorising of surveillance, animals have been largely overlooked.

A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever. During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We examined the characteristics of these patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. RESULTS: Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had a fever (>37.2°C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P < .05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases. Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.","Yu, Jingjing; Zhang, Tian; Zhao, Dan; Haapasalo, Markus; Shen, Ya",J Endod,683,21

The personal protective equipment (PPE) undoubtedly provides a shield of protection for the healthcare workers (HCWs) fighting the disease as a valuable asset to the nation. However, there have been various problems associated with the PPE, ranging from its shortage to problems arising from heat, dehydration, etc while wearing them. There is a need to assess these problems faced by HCWs both qualitatively and quantitatively for their timely and effective redressal. Methods An electronic questionnaire survey was conducted among a cohort of HCWs who had performed COVID-19 duties and used PPE kits. The cohort consisted of different categories of doctors, nursing personnel, and other paramedical staff. Results The most common problems associated with using PPE kits was excessive sweating (100%), fogging of goggles, spectacles, or face shields (88%), suffocation (83%), breathlessness (61%), fatigue (75%), headache due to prolonged use (28%), and pressure marks on the skin at one or more areas on repeated use (19%). Occasional problems reported were skin allergy/dermatitis caused by the synthetic material of the PPE kit, face shield impinging onto the neck during intubation, and nasal pain, pain at the root of the pinna, and slipperiness of shoe covers. Various ways and means have been employed by the HCWs to actively address and solve these problems. Conclusion These plausible solutions will definitely help the HCWs to deal with and solve the problems arising out of the PPE use.","Agarwal, Ankur; Agarwal, Sheetal; Motiani, Poonam",Cureus,683,6

To control pathogen contamination and reduce the risk of illness, a system is required that can quickly detect and monitor target pathogens. We developed a simple and reproducible strategy, termed three-way junction (3WJ)-induced transcription amplification, to detect target nucleic acids by rationally combining 3WJ-induced isothermal amplification with a light-up RNA aptamer. In principle, the presence of the target nucleic acid generates a large number of light-up RNA aptamers (Spinach aptamers) through strand displacement and transcription amplification for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting Spinach RNA aptamers specifically bind to fluorogens such as 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone and emit a highly enhanced fluorescence signal, which is clearly distinguished from the signal emitted in the absence of the target nucleic acid. With the proposed strategy, concentrations of target nucleic acids selected from the genome of Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) were quantitatively determined with high selectivity. In addition, the practical applicability of the method was demonstrated by performing spike-and-recovery experiments with S. Typhi in human serum.","Kim, Jung Ho; Kim, Seokjoon; Hwang, Sung Hyun; Yoon, Tae Hwi; Park, Jung Soo; Lee, Eun Sung; Woo, Jisu; Park, Ki Soo",Sensors (Basel),683,1

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed literature search was done in PubMed and Embase from December 1, 2019, till May 1, 2020. Studies reporting cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients were included. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of data, a random effects model with inverse-variance approach was used for pooling the prevalence using meta package in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS: Out of 15,143 articles, 2086 articles were selected for full-text read. Forty-three articles were selected for qualitative analysis, of which 10 articles (N = 1682) were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overall cutaneous lesions was 5.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87-15.98; I2 88%). The pooled prevalence of other outcome parameters were as follows: viral exanthem-like presentation 4.15 (95% CI: 1.33-12.23; I2 88%), maculopapular rash 3.81 (95% CI: 1.02-13.18; I2 87%), vesiculobullous lesions 1.67 (95% CI: 0.70-3.96; I2 0%). CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 was 5.69%. Other manifestations were urticaria, chilblain-like lesions, livedo reticularis, and finger/toe gangrene. Although it is premature to conclude the prevalence of the cutaneous manifestations during this ongoing pandemic, our report may be a stimulating factor for the physicians to perform further vigilant streamlined reporting of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients to estimate the final prevalence.","Bandhala Rajan, M; Kumar-M, Praveen; Bhardwaj, Abhishek",Int. j. dermatol,683,20

This study aims to identify areas with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission in different periods in Hong Kong and analyze the associated built environment and demographic factors using data of individual confirmed cases. We detect statistically significant space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the Large Street Block Group (LSBG) level in Hong Kong between January 23 and April 14, 2020. Two types of high-risk areas are identified (residences of and places visited by confirmed cases) and two types of cases (imported and local cases) are considered. The demographic and built environment features for the identified high-risk areas are further examined. The results indicate that high transport accessibility, dense and high-rise buildings, a higher density of commercial land and higher land-use mix are associated with a higher risk for places visited by confirmed cases. More green spaces, higher median household income, lower commercial land density are linked to a higher risk for the residences of confirmed cases. The results in this study not only can inform policymakers to improve resource allocation and intervention strategies but also can provide guidance to the public to avoid conducting high-risk activities and visiting high-risk places.","Kan, Zihan; Kwan, Mei-Po; Wong, Man Sing; Huang, Jianwei; Liu, Dong",Sci Total Environ,683,16

The ability to quickly predict traffic patterns in different scenarios has become more urgent to support short-term operations and long-term transportation planning, emergency management, and resource allocation. Urban traffic exhibits a high spatial correlation in which links adjacent to a congested link are likely to become congested due to spillback effects. The spillback behavior requires modeling the entire metropolitan area to recognize all of the upstream and downstream effects from intentional or unintentional perturbations to the network. However, there is a well-known trade-off between increasing the level of detail of a model and decreasing computational performance. This paper addresses these performance shortcomings by introducing a new platform MANTA for traffic microsimulation at the metropolitan-scale. MANTA employs a highly parallelized GPU implementation that is fast enough to run simulations on large-scale demand and networks within a few minutes. We test our platform to simulate the entire Bay Area metropolitan region over the course of the morning using half-second time steps. The runtime for the nine-county Bay Area simulation is just over four minutes, not including routing and initialization. This computational performance significantly improves state of the art in large-scale traffic microsimulation and offers new capacity for analyzing the detailed travel patterns and travel choices of individuals for infrastructure planning and emergency management.","Yedavalli, Pavan; Kumar, Krishna; Waddell, Paul",,683,2

It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS.

Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns about the potential risk of QT interval prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the change in corrected QT (QTc) interval and arrhythmic events in patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 251 patients from 2 centers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed electrocardiographic tracings from baseline and until 3 days after the completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc interval and the incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. Results: The QTc interval prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc interval prolongation to >500 ms, a known marker of high risk of TdP, had developed in 23% of patients. One patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suspected as TdP, requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc interval of patients exhibiting extreme QTc interval prolongation was normal. Conclusion: The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc interval in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life-threatening arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in light of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc interval monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.","Chorin, Ehud; Wadhwani, Lalit; Magnani, Silvia; Dai, Matthew; Shulman, Eric; Nadeau-Routhier, Charles; Knotts, Robert; Bar-Cohen, Roi; Kogan, Edward; Barbhaiya, Chirag; Aizer, Anthony; Holmes, Douglas; Bernstein, Scott; Spinelli, Michael; Park, David S; Stefano, Carugo; Chinitz, Larry A; Jankelson, Lior",Heart Rhythm,683,24

Later on, a condition with similar characteristics has also been reported in adults.1,2 Case report: 26-year-old male patient with obesity and arterial hypertension presented to the emergency department with 3 days history of fever, chills, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, headache, dry cough, nasal discharge and diarrhea approximately six weeks after he has been diagnosed with mild COVID-19. Initial blood tests showed markedly elevated laboratory inflammatory markers. CT scan showed enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and small areas of residual ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out. He was admitted to the infectious disease clinic and was started on cloxacillin, ceftriaxone, antipyretics and appropriate rehydration. On the third day of hospital treatment, the patient complained of chest and neck pain and severe dyspnea. His general condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit due to the development of cardiogenic shock. Inotropic and vasopressor support was initiated. Echocardiography showed mildly dilated left ventricle with severe impairment of global systolic function (LVEF 20 %). High-sensitivity troponin I and NT-proBNP were markedly elevated with a peak concentration of 792 and 18200 ng/l, respectively. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the tertiary center coronary care unit (CCU). Pulse steroid therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin were immediately initiated, while heart failure therapy was gradually introduced in the following days. Seven days after admission to CCU, multiparametric cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed preserved LVEF with diffusely prolonged myocardial T1 relaxation time and T2 relaxation time, confirming myocardial injury and edema, respectively. There was no late gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1). Updated Lake-Louise criteria for myocarditis have been fulfilled.3 The following criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) were met: age over 21 years, a positive test result for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, documented fever &gt;38.0°C for ≥24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, involvement of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system, and severe illness requiring hospitalization. Conclusion: This case indicates that there is a vast diversity of clinical presentation and underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 syndromes with myocardial injury. Recently described MIS-A is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinicians should be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on time and start with appropriate treatment.

In March 2020, in response to the virus, state/provincial and local governments instituted shelter-in-place orders, and nonessential ambulatory care was significantly curtailed, including allergy/immunology services. With rates of new infections and fatalities potentially reaching a plateau and/or declining, restrictions on provision of routine ambulatory care are lifting, and there is a need to help guide the allergy/immunology clinician on how to reinitiate services. Given the fact that coronavirus disease 2019 will circulate within our communities for months or longer, we present a flexible, algorithmic best-practices planning approach on how to prioritize services, in 4 stratified phases of reopening according to community risk level, as well as highlight key considerations for how to safely do so. The decisions on what services to offer and how fast to proceed are left to the discretion of the individual clinician and practice, operating in accordance with state and local ordinances with respect to the level of nonessential ambulatory care that can be provided. Clear communication with staff and patients before and after all changes should be incorporated into this new paradigm on continual change, given the movement may be forward and even backward through the phases because this is an evolving situation.","Searing, Daniel A; Dutmer, Cullen M; Fleischer, David M; Shaker, Marcus S; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell H; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W Y; Rider, Nicholas L; Vander Leek, Timothy K; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K; Abrams, Elissa M; Bansal, Priya; Lang, David M; Lieberman, Jay; Golden, David Bk; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,683,24

SUMMARY: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new therapeutic options.","Ciotti, Marco; Benedetti, Francesca; Zella, Davide; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Chemotherapy,683,1

This is exactly what was requested in March and what has occurred since late April 2020 when the first phase I/II clinical trial was approved at the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University Hospital. The preprint of day-7 interim results by the investigators concluded, “In a small pilot trial of 5 oxygen-dependent patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvement in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic infiltrates without acute toxicity or worsening the cytokine storm. Low-dose whole-lung radiation appears to be safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants larger prospective trials.” Preliminary results from another clinical trial gave similar results. In conclusion, the authors believe it would be unethical not to investigate radiotherapy as a potential remedy against COVID-19 induced pneumonia.","Cuttler, Jerry M.; Bevelacqua, Joseph J.; Mortazavi, S.M.J.",Dose-Resp.,683,14

Thus, a new paradigm has come with the need of achieving alternative (less invasive) and effective therapies. In this work, biocompatible gold nanoparticles (GNPs) coated with hyaluronic acid and oleic acid were prepared and characterized in terms of size, morphology and cytotoxicity in the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and two cell lines, the keratinocytes (healthy skin cells, HaCat) and the melanoma cells (B16F10). Results showed that these GNPs absorb within the near-infrared region (750-1400 nm), in the optical therapeutic window (from 650 to 1300 nm), in contrast to other commercial gold nanoparticles, which enables light to penetrate into deep skin layers. A laser emitting in this region was applied and its effect also analyzed. The coated GNPs showed a spherical morphology with a mean size of 297 nm without cytotoxic effects towards yeast and tested cell lines. Nevertheless, after laser irradiation, a reduction of 20% in B16F10 cell line viability was observed. In summary, this work appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of non-metastatic melanoma or other superficial tumors.","Lopes, Joana; Coelho, João Miguel Pinto; Vieira, Pedro Manuel Cardoso; Viana, Ana Silveira; Gaspar, Maria Manuela; Reis, Catarina",,683,1

The United States has borne the largest absolute burden of disease globally, as COVID-19 exploited pre-existing poor population health among Americans to spread rapidly, with devastating consequences. Why does the country that spends the most on healthcare in the world have one of the worst responses to COVID-19? We argue that this is because the United States conception of health is predominantly focused on healthcare, an overwhelming investment in developing drugs and treatments, and an underinvestment in the foundational conditions that keep people healthy. COVID-19 has exposed the limits of this approach to health. In order to prevent COVID-19 and future such pandemics, we must create the conditions that can keep population-level health threats at bay. This means addressing the conditions that shape health, including economics, employment, community networks, racial disparities, how we treat older adults, and the physical layout of our communities. To do so means acknowledging health as a public good, as a transnational project with countries working together to build a healthier world. It also means acknowledging that everyone has a right to health. These aspirations should become core to the global community's health aspirations in the post-COVID-19 era.","Abdalla, Salma M; Maani, Nason; Ettman, Catherine K; Galea, Sandro",Development (Rome),683,24

This resulted in an urgent need for doctors with competence in working with critically ill COVID-19 patients. A training course and a theoretical test for non-intensivist doctors were developed. The aims of this study were to gather validity evidence for the theoretical test and explore the effects of the course. METHODS: The 1-day course was comprised of theoretical sessions and hands-on training in ventilator use, hemodynamic monitoring, vascular access, and use of personal protective equipment. Validity evidence was gathered for the test by comparing answers from novices and experts in intensive care. Doctors who participated in the course completed the test before (pretest), after (posttest), and again within 8 weeks following the course (retention test). RESULTS: Fifty-four non-intensivist doctors from 15 different specialties with a wide range in clinical experience level completed the course. The test consisted of 23 questions and demonstrated a credible pass-fail standard at 16 points. Mean pretest score was 11.9 (SD 3.0), mean posttest score 20.6 (1.8), and mean retention test score 17.4 (2.2). All doctors passed the posttest. CONCLUSION: Non-intensivist doctors, irrespective of experience level, can acquire relevant knowledge for working in the ICU through a focused 1-day evidence-based course. This knowledge was largely retained as shown by a multiple-choice test supported by validity evidence. The test is available in appendix and online.","Engberg, Morten; Bonde, Jan; Sigurdsson, Sigurdur T; Møller, Kirsten; Nayahangan, Leizl J; Berntsen, Marianne; Eschen, Camilla T; Haase, Nicolai; Bache, Søren; Konge, Lars; Russell, Lene",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,683,29

Countries worldwide have been affected by the recent outbreak caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 virus. As with prior viral pandemics, health-care workers are at increased risk. Orthopaedic surgical procedures are common in health-care systems, ranging from emergency to elective procedures. Many orthopaedic surgical procedures are life or limb-saving and cannot be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic because of potential patient harm. Our goal is to analyze how orthopaedic surgeons can perform medically necessary procedures during the pandemic and to help guide decision-making perioperatively. METHODS: We performed a review of the existing literature regarding COVID-19 and prior viral outbreaks to help guide clinical practice in terms of how to safely perform medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic for both asymptomatic patients and high-risk (e.g., COVID-19-positive) patients. We created a classification system based on COVID-19 positivity, patient health status, and COVID-19 prevalence to help guide perioperative decision-making. RESULTS: We advocate that only urgent and emergency surgical procedures be performed. By following recommendations from the American College of Surgeons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the recent literature, safe orthopaedic surgery and perioperative care can be performed. Screening measures are needed for patients and perioperative teams. Surgeons and perioperative teams at risk for contracting COVID-19 should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), when risk of viral spread is high. When preparing for medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic, our classification system will help to guide decision-making. A multidisciplinary care plan is needed to ensure patient safety with medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic can be performed safely when medically necessary but should be rare for COVID-19-positive or high-risk patients. Appropriate screening, PPE use, and multidisciplinary care will allow for safe medically necessary orthopaedic surgery to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level V.

Countries worldwide have been affected by the recent outbreak caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 virus. As with prior viral pandemics, health-care workers are at increased risk. Orthopaedic surgical procedures are common in health-care systems, ranging from emergency to elective procedures. Many orthopaedic surgical procedures are life or limb-saving and cannot be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic because of potential patient harm. Our goal is to analyze how orthopaedic surgeons can perform medically necessary procedures during the pandemic and to help guide decision-making perioperatively. METHODS: We performed a review of the existing literature regarding COVID-19 and prior viral outbreaks to help guide clinical practice in terms of how to safely perform medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic for both asymptomatic patients and high-risk (e.g., COVID-19-positive) patients. We created a classification system based on COVID-19 positivity, patient health status, and COVID-19 prevalence to help guide perioperative decision-making. RESULTS: We advocate that only urgent and emergency surgical procedures be performed. By following recommendations from the American College of Surgeons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the recent literature, safe orthopaedic surgery and perioperative care can be performed. Screening measures are needed for patients and perioperative teams. Surgeons and perioperative teams at risk for contracting COVID-19 should use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), when risk of viral spread is high. When preparing for medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the pandemic, our classification system will help to guide decision-making. A multidisciplinary care plan is needed to ensure patient safety with medically necessary orthopaedic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic can be performed safely when medically necessary but should be rare for COVID-19-positive or high-risk patients. Appropriate screening, PPE use, and multidisciplinary care will allow for safe medically necessary orthopaedic surgery to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level V.

This diagnosis offered him closure which he had desperately sought for well over a decade. A pathogenic variant in the CHEK2 gene can potentially explain these cancers because of its function as a tumour suppressor gene. Consideration is warranted of what this means for individuals with CHEK2 variants who may develop multiple cancers, their prognosis and whether different treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target agents would need modification. We encourage more research into the many faces of the CHEK2 gene and the potential for predisposition to multiple cancers.","De Silva, Dilanka L; Winship, Ingrid",BMJ case reports,683,24

Our objective was to assess stress and coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: During the pandemic in New York City, patients taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs answered open-ended questions about the pandemic's effects on daily life and their rheumatic condition. Themes of stress and coping were discerned from volunteered responses. Patients also completed the standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale/PROMIS Anxiety surveys. Anxiety scores were independent variables in multivariable analyses with stress and coping themes as combined dependent variables. RESULTS: Of the 112 patients interviewed (86% women; mean age, 50 years), 72 volunteered COVID-19-related stress on their rheumatic condition, home, work, and finances. Patients volunteering stress were younger, had disease longer, were taking more than 1 medication, had worse GAD-7 scores and a positive anxiety screen, and had worse PROMIS scores that were significantly worse than population norms (all comparisons, p &#8804; 0.01; all variables remained associated in multivariable analyses). Fourty-one patients volunteered coping mechanisms including support from others, engaging in activities, and resilience already establish in dealing with rheumatic diseases. Of these, 18 volunteered both coping and stress and 23 volunteered coping and no stress. Patients in the latter (coping-only) group were more likely to be older, taking only 1 medication, and had better GAD-7 and PROMIS scores (all comparisons, p &#8804; 0.02). In multivariable analysis, older age (p = 0.02) and lower GAD-7 (p = 0.03) or PROMIS scores (p = 0.03) remained associated. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported stress and coping due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, eflornithine) is the best-known inhibitor of ODC and a broad-spectrum, unique therapeutical agent. Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetic profile is not perfect, especially when large doses are required in antiviral treatment. This article presents a holistic study focusing on the molecular and supramolecular structure of DFMO and the design of its analogues toward the development of safer and more effective formulations. In this context, we provide the first deep insight into the supramolecular system of DFMO supplemented by a comprehensive, qualitative and quantitative survey of non-covalent interactions via Hirshfeld surface, molecular electrostatic potential, enrichment ratio and energy frameworks analysis visualizing 3-D topology of interactions in order to understand the differences in the cooperativity of interactions involved in the formation of either basic or large synthons (Long-range Synthon Aufbau Modules, LSAM) at the subsequent levels of well-organized supramolecular self-assembly, in comparison with the ornithine structure. In the light of the drug discovery, supramolecular studies of amino acids, essential constituents of proteins, are of prime importance. In brief, the same amino-carboxy synthons are observed in the bio-system containing DFMO. DFT calculations revealed that the biological environment changes the molecular structure of DFMO only slightly. The ADMET profile of structural modifications of DFMO and optimization of its analogue as a new promising drug via molecular docking are discussed in detail.","Bojarska, J.; New, R.; Borowiecki, P.; Remko, M.; Breza, M.; Madura, I.

In this work, we plug this gap through market based mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods. To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein each agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial currency budget that they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets provide a strong methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints - budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. Thus, we introduce a modified Fisher market, where each individual may have additional physical constraints, characterize its solution properties and establish the existence of a market equilibrium. Furthermore, to account for additional constraints we introduce a social convex optimization problem where we perturb the budgets of agents such that the KKT conditions of the perturbed social problem establishes equilibrium prices. Finally, to compute the budget perturbations we present a fixed point scheme and illustrate convergence guarantees through numerical experiments. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only consider capacity and budget constraints.","Jalota, Devansh; Qi, Qi; Pavone, Marco; Ye, Yinyu",,683,16

Clinical information and laboratory results were collected and the concentrations of ferritin were compared among different groups. The association between ferritin and mortality was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the efficiency of the predicting value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The amount of ferritin was significantly higher in critical group compared with moderate and severe groups. The median of ferritin concentration was about three times higher in death group than survival group (1722.25µg/L vs. 501.90µg/L, p<0.01). The concentration of ferritin was positively correlated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ferritin was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Especially, high-ferritin group was associated with higher incidence of mortality, with adjusted odds ratio of 104.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.63-4185.89; p=0.013]. Moreover, ferritin had an advantage of discriminative capacity with the area under ROC (AUC) of 0.822 (95% CI 0.737-0.907) higher than procalcitonin and CRP.

On the basis of the analogy between SIRD and compartmental models in hydrology, this study makes mathematical formulations developed in hydrology available for modelling in epidemiology. We adapt the Hayami model solution of the diffusive wave equation generally used in hydrological modelling to compartmental I-R-D models in epidemiology by simulating the relationships between the number of infectious I(t), the number of recoveries R(t) and the number of deaths D(t). The Hayami model is easy-to-use, robust and parsimonious. We compare the empirical one-parameter exponential model usually used in SIRD models to the two-parameter Hayami model. Applications were implemented on the recent Covid-19 pandemic. The application on data from 24 countries shows that both models give comparable performances for modelling the I-D relationship. However, for modelling the I-R relationship and the active cases, the exponential model gives fair performances whereas the Hayami model substantially improves the model performances. The Hayami model also presents the advantage that its parameters can be easily estimated from the analysis of the data distributions of I(t), R(t) and D(t). The Hayami model is parsimonious with only two parameters which are useful to compare the temporal evolution of recoveries and deaths in different countries based on different contamination rates and recoveries strategies. This study highlights the interest of knowledge transfer between different scientific disciplines in order to model different processes.","Moussa, Roger; Majdalani, Samer",Epidemiol Infect,683,0

Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-COVID-19 patients in many hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK). We investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-COVID bays, in the context of various scenarios: placing the initially-exposed individual in different beds, varying the recovery and incubation periods, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (COVID-only) hospital bays.","Martos, David Moreno; Parcell, Benjamin J; Eftimie, Raluca",Math Biosci Eng,683,18

However, the development of a new, effective, and safe vaccine or drug often requires years and poses great risks. At this critical stage, there is an advantage in using existing clinically approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In this study, in vitro severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike pseudotyped viral infection experiments indicated that histamine H1 antagonists loratadine (LOR) and desloratadine (DES) could prevent entry of the pseudotyped virus into ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells and showed that DES was more effective. Further binding experiments using cell membrane chromatography and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that both antagonists could bind to ACE2 and that the binding affinity of DES was much stronger than that of LOR. Molecular docking results elucidated that LOR and DES could bind to ACE2 on the interface of the SARS-CoV-2-binding area. Additionally, DES could form one hydrogen bond with LYS31 but LOR binding relied on non-hydrogen bonds. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of LOR and DES on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus viropexis by blocking spike protein-ACE2 interaction.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; Ho, Cyrus S; Ho, Roger C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),683,1

Endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME), play an important role for CoVs to penetrate the cell membrane barrier. In this study, a novel CoV entry manner is unraveled in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV). Using multicolor live-cell imaging, the dynamics of the fluorescently labeled clathrin structures, caveolae structures, and PEDV were dissected. During CavME of PEDV, we found that clathrin structures can fuse with caveolae near the cell plasma membrane, and the average time of PEDV penetrating the cell membrane was within â¼3 min, exhibiting a rapid course of PEDV entry. Moreover, based on the dynamic recruitment of clathrin and caveolae structures and viral motility, the direct evidence also shows that about 20% of PEDVs can undergo an abortive entry via CME and CavME. Additionally, the dynamic trafficking of PEDV from clathrin and caveolae structures to early endosomes, and from early endosomes to late endosomes, and viral fusion were directly dissected, and PEDV fusion mainly occurred in late endosomes within â¼6.8 min after the transport of PEDV to late endosomes. Collectively, this work systematically unravels the early steps of PEDV infection, which expands our understanding of the mechanism of CoV infection.IMPORTANCE Emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses cause serious human and animal epidemics worldwide. For many enveloped viruses, including coronavirus, it is evident that breaking the plasma membrane barrier is a pivotal and complex process, which contains multiple dynamic steps. Although great efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms of coronavirus endocytic pathways, the direct real-time imaging of individual porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) internalization has not been achieved yet. In this study, we not only dissected the kinetics of PEDV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and the kinetics of endosome trafficking and viral fusion but also found a novel productive coronavirus entry manner in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of PEDV. Moreover, we uncovered the existence of PEDV abortive endocytosis. In summary, the productive PEDV entry via the cooperation between clathrin and caveolae structures and the abortive endocytosis of PEDV provide new insights into coronavirus penetrating the plasma membrane barrier.","Li, Yangyang; Wang, Jian; Hou, Wei; Shan, Yanke; Wang, Shouyu; Liu, Fei",mBio (Online),683,1

Emerging data suggests that employment in certain occupations (e.g., essential; frontline) may place individuals at higher-risk for contracting COVID-19. The current investigation examined how Black American fathers' COVID-19 perceived work risk was associated with their individual well-being (COVID-19 diagnosis; depressive and anxiety symptoms; sleep disturbance; sleep quality) as well as spillover into family contexts. Participants were 466 Black American fathers (M = 36.63; SD = 11.00) who completed online surveys in June-July 2020. Adjusted binomial logistic and multiple regressions were estimated to examine how fathers' work context was associated with COVID-19 health outcomes, psychological functioning, sleep health, and family stress. Descriptive analyses revealed that 32% of fathers reported a personal diagnosis of COVID-19 and 21% indicated that an immediate family member had been diagnosed. Adjusted binomial logistic regression analyses revealed that fathers working in higher-risk contexts for contracting COVID-19 had a greater odds ratio for both a personal (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.68) and an immediate family member diagnosis (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.36). Working in a higher-risk context for contracting COVID-19 was associated with poorer psychological functioning, greater sleep disturbance, and higher levels of family discord. Findings suggest that Black fathers working in higher risk contexts may be at risk for COVID-19 exposure and infection. Further, this study indicates that these effects extend to their own well-being, including mental and sleep health as well as increased family stress.","Cooper, Shauna M; Thomas, Alvin; Bamishigbin, Olajide",Am J Mens Health,683,16

Analysis of the spectra included the perimeter model and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. With the increasing number of phenyl substituents, the molecule is transformed from a positive hard (&#916;HOMO > &#916;LUMO) to a soft (&#916;HOMO &#8776; &#916;LUMO) chromophore. This is manifested by a drastic decrease of the absorption intensity in the 0-0 region of the Q-band and by the strongly altered ratio of MCD intensities in the Q and Soret regions. Such behavior can be readily predicted using perimeter model, by analyzing frontier orbital shifts caused by various perturbations: alkyl and aryl substitution, insertion of a metal, and deviations from planarity. TDDFT calculations confirm the trends predicted by the perimeter model, but they fail in cases of less symmetrical derivatives to properly reproduce the MCD spectra in the Soret region. Our results confirm the power of the perimeter model in predicting absorption and MCD spectra of large organic molecules, porphyrins in particular. We also postulate, contrary to previous works, that the isolated porphyrin dianion is not a soft chromophore, but rather a strongly positive-hard one.","Gorski, A; Kijak, M; Zenkevich, E; Knyukshto, V; Starukhin, A; Semeikin, A; Lyubimova, T; Rolinski, T; Waluk, J",J. phys. chem.

The review noted the sparse literature on a range of development outcomes, with limited attention to some of the key themes of inclusion and sustainability associated with the SDGs. Many studies report on some form of limited connection between TE and development outcomes, also drawing attention to contextual conditions beyond TE that contribute to this. The article considers the reasons for these findings, and some of the difficulties of forming conclusions on a still limited base of research evidence.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advocates the use of prognostic enrichment of clinical trials by preselecting a patient population with increased likelihood of experiencing the trial's primary endpoint. OBJECTIVE: This study compares validated clinical scales of risk (COMPERA, the French score, and REVEAL 2.0) to identify patients that are likely to experience a clinical worsening event for trial enrichment. METHODS: Baseline data from three pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical trials (AMBITION, SERAPHIN, and GRIPHON) were pooled and standardized. Receiver-operating curves were used to measure each algorithm's performance in predicting clinical worsening within the pooled placebo cohort. Power simulations were conducted to determine sample size and treatment time reductions for multiple enrichment strategies. A cost analysis was performed to illustrate potential financial savings by applying enrichment to GRIPHON. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All risk algorithms were compared using area under the receiver-operating curve and substantially outperformed prediction per New York Heart Association Functional Class. REVEAL 2.0's risk grouping provided the greatest time and sample size savings in AMBITION and GRIPHON for all enrichment strategies but lacked appropriate inputs (i.e., N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide) to perform as well in SERAPHIN. Cost analysis applied to GRIPHON demonstrated the greatest financial benefit by enrolling patients with a REVEAL score &#8805;8.

This study aims to investigate the current status of occupational stress, coping styles, mental health and emotional well-being of university academics during the COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Ireland, and examine the effect of stress and coping strategies on mental health and emotional well-being. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a sample size of 87 academic staff working in a university in Northern Ireland. SPSS version 25 was used to analyse the collected data. The results showed academics experienced moderate stress levels, and distraction behaviours were the most common form of coping mechanism. Academics were in the moderate status of mental health and poor emotional well-being. Occupational stress has a significant effect on mental health and emotional well-being. Positive reframing and acceptance coping styles have an impact on emotional well-being. This study contributes to the understanding of occupational stress, coping strategies, mental health and emotional well-being of academics in higher education in Northern Ireland.

Many patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the University Hospital Aachen during an outbreak that first struck the Heinsberg district in February 2020. METHODS: A comparative presentation of the clinical features of the first 50 COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were hospitalized in the University Hospital Aachen. RESULTS: 24 intubated patients were treated in the intensive care unit for ARDS of varying degrees of severity, while 26 patients who were breathing spontaneously without ARDS, but nevertheless needed supplemental oxygen, were treated in a separate isolation ward. The median age of the patients was 65 (IQR 58-76). The median latency from symptom onset to hospitalization was four days (IQR 1-8). Patients with ARDS had preexisting respiratory diseases more commonly than patients without ARDS (58% [95% confidence interval: 39; 76] versus 42% [26; 61]) and were more commonly overweight or obese (83% [64; 93] versus 42% [26; 61]). The two groups did not differ in viral burden but displayed significant differences in laboratory findings: ARDS patients had persistently elevated values for leukocytes, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and D-dimers over the period of observation. Patients without ARDS had persistently elevated inflammatory parameters and fever for at least one week, with an accompanying need for supplemental oxygen. Three of the patients with ARDS died of multiorgan failure, while four in the non-ARDS group died of respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION: This initial description of a cohort of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS in Germany reveals that those with ARDS more commonly have preexisting respiratory diseases and obesity, as well as persistently elevated inflammatory markers. COVID-19 patients without ARDS may likewise require prolonged hospitalization because of persistently elevated inflammatory values with a simultaneous need for supplemental oxygen.","Dreher, Michael; Kersten, Alexander; Bickenbach, Johannes; Balfanz, Paul; Hartmann, Bojan; Cornelissen, Christian; Daher, Ayham; Stöhr, Robert; Kleines, Michael; Lemmen, Sebastian W; Brokmann, Jörg Christian; Müller, Tobias; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Marx, Gernot; Marx, Nikolaus",Dtsch Arztebl Int,683,33

In view of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) pandemic, studies based on KAP theory have been useful to better understand certain behaviors, such as adherence to prevention measures and control of the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of cross-cultural adaptation of two complementary instruments for assessing KAP regarding the COVID­19 pandemic in the Brazilian population. METHODS: Two independent translators proposed a first Brazilian Portuguese version of the scales. The cultural adaptation and pre-test of the Brazilian Portuguese versions occurred at different stages, using a panel of specialists and a subsample of the target population, respectively. RESULTS: The pre-test of the adapted instruments involved 30 Brazilian adults (mean age = 41.8 years; standard deviation = 4.24) and was carried out to assess instrument understanding and applicability. The participants informed they did not have difficulties to self-complete the instruments and reported a high level of clarity and understanding. CONCLUSION: Both instruments can bring an opportunity to study behavioral constructs about COVID­19 in the Brazilian population, aiming to articulate strategies that enable the fulfillment of effective preventive measures.","Meneghini, Andréa Cristina; da Silva, Wanderson Roberto; Martinez, Edson Zangiacomi; Zucoloto, Miriane Lucindo",Trends psychiatry psychother.

As a response to this disruption, BSPGHAN trainees set up the BSPGHAN Education Series, a twice- weekly virtual learning programme. The core objective of this programme was to deliver high quality paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (PGHAN) teaching during the pandemic.In this study, we analysed the attendances and feedback received from the education series, in order to guide future directions.MethodsWe reviewed the Zoom meeting attendance logs and Survey Monkey feedback forms for the BSPGHAN Education Series from April 2020 to December 2020. ResultsIn nine months, a total of 55 talks were delivered by 43 speakers. 23 (41.8%) sessions were gastroenterology-themed, 25 (45.4%) were hepatology-themed and 7 (12.7%) were nutrition-themed. Thirteen paediatrics gastroenterology units (12 in the UK and 1 in the United States) and all 3 UK tertiary paediatric liver centres contributed to the talks. The highest contributing centres were Birmingham Children’s Hospital (20 sessions), followed by King’s College Hospital (9 sessions) and Leeds Children’s Hospital (7 sessions).Attendance logs and feedback forms were available for 53 sessions. A total of 2369 attendances were logged, with a median of 41 attendees per session (IQR 31–54). Attendees from 22 countries have participated in these sessions.A total of 810 survey feedback forms were received, with a median of 14 forms received per session (IQR 10–18). 32% were filled in by PGHAN Grid trainees, 23% by consultants, 15% by clinical fellows. Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) comprised 6% of feedback returns. 54% of survey feedback respondents accessed the teaching sessions from home.An average of 98% (95% CI 96.3–99.2) survey respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the sessions were relevant to their learning. 97% (95% CI 96–98.7) of survey respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the sessions delivered were of high quality.DiscussionThe BSPGHAN series has been a positive initiative arising from the pandemic, providing access to high quality PGHAN education when local availability was paused, and giving a platform for the society internationally. Our report shows that the BSPGHAN Education Series has been well-received by attendees. The virtual sessions are more accessible compared to in-person teaching sessions, as evidenced by the high percentage of feedback respondents accessing the sessions from home.Looking ahead, the BSPGHAN Education Group, set up in October 2020, will play a vital role in the further development of the Education Series. Sessions are recorded and made available to BSPGHAN members on the BSPGHAN website- further work may include creating online learning modules centred around these recordings. AHP involvement is an area for development- for 2021, we hope to include more topics that will be relevant to their interests. AcknowledgmentsWe thank all speakers for contributing to the teaching programme, and to all trainees who have devoted their time and efforts towards organising and running the teaching programme.","Kwang Yang, Lee McConnell Neil Al-Araji Rulla Jayaprakash Kavitha Hegarty Robert Kelgeri Chayarani Wong Theodoric Protheroe Sue",Frontline Gastroenterology,683,16

However, evidence of an association between As exposure from food and hypertension risks is sparse. To quantify the association between daily As intake from both food (rice, wheat and potatoes) and drinking water (Aswater) along with total exposure (Astotal) and hypertension risks in a study population in Bihar, India, we conducted an individual level cross-sectional analysis between 2017 and 2019 involving 150 participants. Arsenic intake variables and three indicators of hypertension risks (general hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) were derived, and any relationship was quantified using a series of crude and multivariable log-linear or logistic regression models. The prevalence of general hypertension was 40% for the studied population. The median level of HDL was 45 mg/dL while median value of LDL was 114 mg/dL. Apart from a marginally significant positive relationship between As intake from rice and the changes of LDL (p-value = 0.032), no significant positive association between As intake and hypertension risks could be ascertained. In fact, Astotal was found to be associated with lower risks of general hypertension and higher levels of HDL (p-value = 0.020 and 0.010 respectively) whilst general hypertension was marginally associated with lower Aswater (p-value = 0.043). Due to limitations regarding study design and residual confounding, all observed marginal associations should be treated with caution.","Xu, Lingqian; Suman, Sidharth; Sharma, Pushpa; Kumar, Ranjit; Singh, Shatrunjay Kumar; Bose, Nupur; Ghosh, Ashok; Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur; Polya, David A; Mondal, Debapriya",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,683,12

Additional infection control, the possibility of quarantine of staff and minimising contact among staff have significant impact on the work of doctors in the emergency department. Infection of a single healthcare worker may require quarantine of close contacts at work. This may thus affect a potentially large number of staff. As such, we developed an Outbreak Response Roster. This Outbreak Response Roster had fixed teams of doctors working in rotation, each team that staff the emergency department in turn. Members within teams remained constant and were near equally balanced in terms of manpower and seniority of doctors. Each team worked fixed 12 hours shifts with as no overlapping of staff or staggering of shifts. Handovers between shifts were kept as brief as possible. All these were measures to limit interactions among healthcare workers. With the implementation of the roster, measures were also taken to bolster the psychological wellness of healthcare workers. With face-to-face contact limited, we also had to maintain clear, open channels for communication through technology and continue educating residents through innovative means.","Chua, Wei Lin Tallie; Quah, Li Juan Joy; Shen, Yuzeng; Zakaria, Diana; Wan, Paul Weng; Tan, Kenneth; Wong, Evelyn",Emerg. med. j,683,16

Eosinophils and ELR were determined in both groups, in patients that died or survived and were correlated to duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in eosinophils and ELR between patients that died and patients that survived (p<0.05), and in mean values of the two biomarkers (p<0.05 for eosinophils and p<0.05 for ELR) between patients hospitalized for more or less than 15 days among those with moderate to severe disease.

Since the distribution of outlier utterances is arbitrary and unknown in the training stage, existing methods commonly rely on strong assumptions on data distribution such as mixture of Gaussians to make inference, resulting in either complex multi-step training procedures or hand-crafted rules such as confidence threshold selection for outlier detection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to train an out-of-scope intent classifier in a fully end-to-end manner by simulating the test scenario in training, which requires no assumption on data distribution and no additional post-processing or threshold setting. Specifically, we construct a set of pseudo outliers in the training stage, by generating synthetic outliers using inliner features via self-supervision and sampling out-of-scope sentences from easily available open-domain datasets. The pseudo outliers are used to train a discriminative classifier that can be directly applied to and generalize well on the test task. We evaluate our method extensively on four benchmark dialogue datasets and observe significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.

SARS-CoV-2 has human-to-human transmission ability and universally contagious to all populations. The main transmission patterns are respiratory droplets transmission and contact transmission. The purpose of this study is to propose a protocol that may be used as a guide to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 infections among otolaryngology care teams. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to show the efficacy of our protocol to prevent transmission to health-care providers from March 11, 2020 through April 14, 2020. The protocol consisted of a series of protective measures that we applied to all health-care providers, then testing of our providers for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction along with immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing at the end of the study period to ensure effectiveness. RESULTS: Our protocol resulted in zero transmissions to our health-care providers during the duration of the initial study. We were involved in greater than 150 sinonasal, skull base, open airway, and endoscopy procedures during this study. At the conclusion of the initial 5 weeks, we had no health-care providers test positive for SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of emergency nurses during their responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, A cross-sectional design was used. For the data collection, a questionnaire was constructed and its validity and reliability was rigorously evaluated by principle component analysis (PCA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The data were collected in two phases, in which 111 and 128 emergency nurses were recruited from different hospitals in Saudi Arabia.

The reliability of the three factors was 0.84, 0.86, and 0.73, respectively, indicating that the scale had good reliability. The 11 scale items had robust psychometric properties, which implies that they could be used to evaluate emergency nurses’ experience in encountering and dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Although nurses in the frontline showed compliance with infection control prevention measures, they were likely to experience certain degrees of fear and worry, which could lead to burnout. Hence, it is highly recommended to help nurses overcome such crises by providing consistent support and reassurance.

The resultant increase in prescribing was accompanied by an increase in adverse events, including severe toxicity and death. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) workgroup sought to determine the effect of and indications for extracorporeal treatments in cases of poisoning with these drugs. METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews of the literature, screened studies, extracted data, and summarized findings following published EXTRIP methods. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies (three in vitro studies, two animal studies, 28 patient reports or patient series, and 11 pharmacokinetic studies) met inclusion criteria regarding the effect of extracorporeal treatments. Toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic analysis was available for 61 patients (13 chloroquine, three hydroxychloroquine, and 45 quinine). Clinical data were available for analysis from 38 patients, including 12 with chloroquine toxicity, one with hydroxychloroquine toxicity, and 25 with quinine toxicity. All three drugs were classified as non-dialyzable (not amenable to clinically significant removal by extracorporeal treatments). The available data do not support using extracorporeal treatments in addition to standard care for patients severely poisoned with either chloroquine or quinine (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Although hydroxychloroquine was assessed as being non-dialyzable, the clinical evidence was not sufficient to support a formal recommendation regarding the use of extracorporeal treatments for this drug. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our systematic review and analysis, the EXTRIP workgroup recommends against using extracorporeal methods to enhance elimination of these drugs in patients with severe chloroquine or quinine poisoning.","Berling, Ingrid; King, Joshua D; Shepherd, Greene; Hoffman, Robert S; Alhatali, Badria; Lavergne, Valery; Roberts, Darren M; Gosselin, Sophie; Wilson, Gabrielle; Nolin, Thomas D; Ghannoum, Marc",J Am Soc Nephrol,683,1

We aimed to estimate the case-fatality rate (CFR) and rate ratios (RR) for patients with hypertension (HBP) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in the New York state. We obtained the age-specific number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths from public reports provided by the New York State Department of Health, and age-specific prevalence of HBP and DM from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2017. We calculated CFR and RR for COVID-19 patients with HBP and DM based on the reported number of deaths with the comorbidity divided by the expected number of COVID-19 cases with the comorbidity. We performed subgroup analysis by age and calculated the CFR and RR for ages of 18-44, 45-64 and 65+ years, respectively. We found that the older population had a higher CFR, but the elevated RRs associated with comorbidities are more pronounced among the younger population. Our findings suggest that besides the elderly, the young population with comorbidity should also be considered as a vulnerable group.","Ge, Yang; Sun, Shengzhi; Shen, Ye",Epidemiol Infect,683,1

These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeons' performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. Methods: Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24-26° temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. Results: The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3 ± 8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9 ± 3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6 ± 5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. Conclusion: A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears. Besides this, the workable vision is maintained for a prolonged duration.","Kumar, Arvind; Qureshi, Owais Ahmed; Arora, Rajesh; Kumar, Sandeep; Jameel, Javed; Khan, Rizwan",,683,24

Fostering a prediction system can help prepare the officials to respond properly and quickly. Medical imaging like X-ray and computed tomography (CT) can play an important role in the early prediction of COVID-19 patients that will help the timely treatment of the patients. The x-ray images from COVID-19 patients reveal the pneumonia infections that can be used to identify the patients of COVID-19. This study presents the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that extracts the features from chest x-ray images for the prediction. Three filters are applied to get the edges from the images that help to get the desired segmented target with the infected area of the x-ray. To cope with the smaller size of the training dataset, Keras' ImageDataGenerator class is used to generate ten thousand augmented images. Classification is performed with two, three, and four classes where the four-class problem has X-ray images from COVID-19, normal people, virus pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model can predict COVID-19 patients with high accuracy. It can help automate screening of the patients for COVID-19 with minimal contact, especially areas where the influx of patients can not be treated by the available medical staff. The performance comparison of the proposed approach with VGG16 and AlexNet shows that classification results for two and four classes are competitive and identical for three-class classification.","Umer, Muhammad; Ashraf, Imran; Ullah, Saleem; Mehmood, Arif; Choi, Gyu Sang",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,683,16

This study examined the apparent impact of the pandemic on college students' PA, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: From 2015 through 2020, data were collected at the beginning and end of the spring semester at a large Northeastern US university via an online survey assessing student demographics, PA, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms. Mixed ANOVA examined differences in PA and mental health changes over the spring semester between ""normal"" and COVID-19 circumstances. Two-way ANOVA examined the interaction between circumstance and changes in PA in relation to changes in mental health. RESULTS: Participants (n = 1019) were predominately women and non-Hispanic white. There was a significant decline in PA and an increase in perceived stress under COVID-19, but not normal, circumstances and a significant increase in depressive symptoms under COVID-19, but not normal, circumstances among women. CONCLUSIONS: A significant decline in PA and mental health among college students occurred under COVID-19 circumstances, and PA did not appear to protect against deterioration in mental health.

Here, we performed a high-throughput screening of small chemical compounds blocking active Rac1 proteasomal degradation triggered by the Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor-1 (CNF1) toxin, followed by orthogonal screens against two AB toxins hijacking defined endolysosomal (Diphtheria toxin) or retrograde (Shiga-like toxin 1) pathways to intoxicate cells. This led to the identification of the molecule N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-1-propyl-4-piperidinamine, referred to as C910. This compound induces the swelling of EEA1-positive early endosomes, in absence of PIKfyve kinase inhibition, and disturbs the trafficking of CNF1 and the B-subunit of Shiga toxin along the endolysosomal or retrograde pathways, respectively. Together, we show that C910 protects cells against 8 bacterial AB toxins including large clostridial glucosylating toxins from Clostridium difficile. Of interest, C910 also reduced viral infection in vitro including influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, parenteral administration of C910 to the mice resulted in its accumulation in lung tissues and reduced lethal influenza infection.","Wu, Yu; Mahtal, Nassim; Swistak, Lea; Sagadiev, Sara; Acharya, Mridu; Demeret, Caroline; Werf, Sylvie Van der; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Schwartz, Olivier; Petracchini, Serena; Mettouchi, Amel; Paillares, Elea; Caramelle, Lucie; Couvineau, Pierre; Thai, Robert; Barbe, Peggy; Keck, Mathilde; Machelart, Arnaud; Sencio, Valentin; Trottein, Francois; Sachse, Martin; Chicanne, Gaetan; Payrastre, Bernard; Ville, Florian; Kreis, Victor; Popoff, Michel-Robert; Johannes, Ludger; Cintrat, Jean-Christophe; Barbier, Julien; Gillet, Daniel; Lemichez, Emmanuel",,683,16

The genetic background of the host might account for individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection besides age and comorbidities. A list of candidate polymorphisms is needed to drive targeted screens, given the existence of frequent polymorphisms in the general population. We carried out text mining in the scientific literature to draw up a list of genes referable to the term ""SARS-CoV*"". We looked for frequent mutations that are likely to affect protein function in these genes. Ten genes, mostly involved in innate immunity, and thirteen common variants were identified, for some of these the involvement in COVID-19 is supported by publicly available epidemiological data. We looked for available data on the population distribution of these variants and we demonstrated that the prevalence of five of them, Arg52Cys (rs5030737), Gly54Asp (rs1800450) and Gly57Glu (rs1800451) in MBL2, Ala59Thr (rs25680) in CD27, and Val197Met (rs12329760) in TMPRSS2, correlates with the number of cases and/or deaths of COVID-19 observed in different countries. The association of the TMPRSS2 variant provides epidemiological evidence of the usefulness of transmembrane protease serine 2 inhibitors for the cure of COVID-19.

Given the reciprocal relationship between habit and behavior, changing lifestyle behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing) is largely a task of breaking old habits and creating new and healthy ones. Thus, representing users' habit strengths can be very useful for behavior change support systems (BCSS), for example, to predict behavior or to decide when an intervention reaches its intended effect. However, habit strength is not directly observable and existing self-report measures are taxing for users. In this paper, built on recent computational models of habit formation, we propose a method to enable intelligent systems to compute habit strength based on observable behavior. The hypothesized advantage of using computed habit strength for behavior prediction was tested using data from two intervention studies, where we trained participants to brush their teeth twice a day for three weeks and monitored their behaviors using accelerometers. Through hierarchical cross-validation, we found that for the task of predicting future brushing behavior, computed habit strength clearly outperformed self-reported habit strength (in both studies) and was also superior to models based on past behavior frequency (in the larger second study). Our findings provide initial support for our theory-based approach of modeling user habits and encourages the use of habit computation to deliver personalized and adaptive interventions.","Zhang, Chao; Vanschoren, Joaquin; Wissen, Arlette van; Lakens, Daniel; Ruyter, Boris de; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand A.",,683,1

The proposed work concentrates primarily on post-sale service provided by the firm under warranty returns. The proposed model assumes that existing warehouses can also serve as collection centres or repair centres for reverse logistics. In addition, the model also explores the possibility of establishing a new facility. Hybrid facilities are considered because of their huge cost-cutting potential due to equipment sharing and space sharing. The capacity of hybrid facilities can be expanded to a predefined limit to process returned products without hampering forward logistics operations. However, if a product cannot be repaired at the warehouse, it is transported to the plant for remanufacturing. The model optimizes the overall configuration and operation cost of the production-distribution network. The production-distribution model developed in the paper is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is later transformed to a mixed-integer linear program to reduce the solution time. The usefulness of the model is illustrated using a randomly generated dataset. The model identifies (a) the optimal locations/allocations of the existing/new facilities, (b) the distribution of returned products for refurbishing and remanufacturing, and (c) the capacity expansion of the existing plants and warehouses to facilitate remanufacturing and repair services.","Mishra, Shraddha; Singh, Surya Prakash",Ann Oper Res,683,24

Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with a higher chance of infection by COVID-19 (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.80-1.88), but we identified that severe cases of COVID-19 present 64% (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.30-2.09) more vitamin D deficiency compared with mild cases. A vitamin D concentration insufficiency increased hospitalization (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.41-2.21) and mortality from COVID-19 (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.06-2.58). We observed a positive association between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of the disease.","Pereira, Marcos; Dantas Damascena, Alialdo; Galvão Azevedo, Laylla Mirella; de Almeida Oliveira, Tarcio; da Mota Santana, Jerusa",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,683,26

Although the peak sensitivity of RT-PCR can be high, the probability of detecting an infection will vary throughout the course of an infection. The effectiveness of routine asymptomatic testing will therefore depend on testing frequency and how PCR detection varies over time. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to a dataset of twice weekly PCR tests of UK healthcare workers performed by self-administered nasopharyngeal swab, regardless of symptoms. We jointly estimated times of infection and the probability of a positive PCR test over time following infection; we then compared asymptomatic testing strategies by calculating the probability that a symptomatic infection is detected before symptom onset and the probability that an asymptomatic infection is detected within 7 days of infection. RESULTS: We estimated that the probability that the PCR test detected infection peaked at 77% (54-88%) 4 days after infection, decreasing to 50% (38-65%) by 10 days after infection. Our results suggest a substantially higher probability of detecting infections 1-3 days after infection than previously published estimates. We estimated that testing every other day would detect 57% (33-76%) of symptomatic cases prior to onset and 94% (75-99%) of asymptomatic cases within 7 days if test results were returned within a day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine asymptomatic testing can enable detection of a high proportion of infected individuals early in their infection, provided that the testing is frequent and the time from testing to notification of results is sufficiently fast.","Hellewell, Joel; Russell, Timothy W; Beale, Rupert; Kelly, Gavin; Houlihan, Catherine; Nastouli, Eleni; Kucharski, Adam J",BMC Med,683,1

SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people in the world and immediately became a pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus genus of the large family of Coronaviridae. It is now known that its surface spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the lung epithelial cells, mediates the fusion of the cellular and viral membranes, and facilitates the entry of viral genome to the host cell. Therefore, blocking the virus-cell interaction could be a potential target for the prevention of viral infection. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is a protein-protein interaction, and so, analyzing the structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying mechanism to bind the host cell receptor would be useful for the management and treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we performed comparative in silico studies to deeply understand the structural and functional details of the interaction between the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its cognate cellular receptor ACE2. According to our results, the affinity of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV. According to the free energy decomposition of the spike glycoprotein-ACE2 complex, we found critical points in three areas which are responsible for the increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These mutations occurred at the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein that play an essential role in the increasing the affinity of coronavirus to ACE2. For instance, mutations Pro462Ala and Leu472Phe resulted in the altered binding energy from - 2 kcal mol-1 in SARS-COV to - 6 kcal mol-1 in SARS-COV-2. The results demonstrated that some mutations in the receptor-binding motif could be considered as a hot-point for designing potential drugs to inhibit the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and ACE2.","Jafary, Farzaneh; Jafari, Sepideh; Ganjalikhany, Mohamad Reza",Sci Rep,683,16

METHODS: Data were collected through the Survey on Maternal Health, a cross-sectional survey administered in Canada's ten provinces between November 2018 and February 2019 among women who gave birth between January 1 and June 30, 2018. A total of 6558 respondents were included. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated, and logistic regression was used to model the relationship between symptoms consistent with PPA, PPD, and potential risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 13.8% of women had symptoms consistent with PPA, while the prevalence of having symptoms consistent with PPD was 17.9%. Results of the logistic regression models indicated that women who had a history of depression were 3.4 times (95% CI 2.7-4.2) more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPA and 2.6 times more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPD (95% CI 2.2-3.2) compared with those who did not. Women who reported good, fair, or poor physical health were 2.4 times more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPD (95% CI 2.0-2.9) and 2.0 times more likely to experience symptoms consistent with PPA (95% CI 1.7-2.4) compared with those who reported very good or excellent health. Maternal marital status, other postpartum maternal support, and sense of community belonging were also significant. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that a history of depression and good, fair, or poor physical health are associated with an increased odds of symptoms consistent with PPA and PPD, while other maternal support and sense of community belonging are associated with a decreased odds of these conditions.","Gheorghe, Mihaela; Varin, Mélanie; Wong, Suzy L; Baker, Melissa; Grywacheski, Vera; Orpana, Heather",Can. j. public health,683,20

The EGSnrc Monte Carlo software modules, BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc, were used to generate whole brain radiotherapy plans for a pediatric patient using two lateral opposing 40-MeV electron beams. Electron beam phase space files were simulated using a model of a diverging beam with a diameter of 10 cm at 50 cm SAD (defined at brain midline). The electron beams were collimated using a 10-cm-thick block composed of 5 cm of aluminum oxide and 5 cm of tungsten. For comparison, a 6-MV photon plan was calculated with the Varian AAA algorithm. Electron beam parameters were based on a novel linear accelerator designed for the PHASER system and powered by a commercial 6-MW klystron. Calculations of the linear accelerator's performance indicated an average beam current of at least 6.25 µA, providing a dose rate of 115 Gy/s at isocenter, high enough for cognition-sparing FLASH effects. The electron plan was less homogenous with a homogeneity index of 0.133 compared to the photon plan's index of 0.087. Overall, the dosimetric characteristics of the 40-MeV electron plan were suitable for treatment. In conclusion, Monte Carlo simulations performed in this work indicate that two lateral opposing 40-MeV electron beams can be used for pediatric whole brain irradiation at FLASH dose rates of 115 Gy/s and serve as motivation for a practical clinical FLASH radiotherapy system, which can be implemented in the near future.","Breitkreutz, Dylan Yamabe; Shumail, Muhammad; Bush, Karl K; Tantawi, Sami G; Maxim, Peter G; Loo, Billy W",Radiat. res,683,5

In addition, the fact that the current outbreak of COVID-19 provokes stigmatization and discriminatory behavior of society towards representatives of certain ethnic groups, as well as towards people suspected of having contact with carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, is of great epidemiological significance. The widespread prevalence of COVID-19 is believed to be not a pandemic, but a syndemia (not just comorbidity, but an integration that identifies biological and social interactions important for prognosis, treatment and health policy), characterized by biological and social interactions between conditions and conditions, interactions that increase a person's susceptibility to harm or worsen their health. Thus, in the case of COVID-19, the fight against non-communicable diseases (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, snake bites, epilepsy, kidney disease and sickle cell anemia) and socioeconomic inequality will also become a prerequisite for its successful containment.","Bolekhan, V.

A common dynamics has been observed, but its propagation has not been homogeneous over each continent. We aimed at characterizing the non-viral parameters that were most associated with death rate. Methods: We tested major indices from five domains (demography, public health, economy, politics, environment) and their potential associations with Covid-19 mortality during the first 8 months of 2020, through a Principal Component Analysis and a correlation matrix with a Pearson correlation test. Data of all countries, or states in federal countries, showing at least 10 fatality cases, were retrieved from official public sites. For countries that have not yet finished the first epidemic phase, a prospective model has been computed to provide options of death rates evolution. Results: Higher Covid death rates are observed in the [25/65°] latitude and in the [-35/-125°] longitude ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate. Conclusion: Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population resilience through better physical fitness and immunity.","De Larochelambert, Quentin; Marc, Andy; Antero, Juliana; Le Bourg, Eric; Toussaint, Jean-François",Front Public Health,683,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the impact on contamination characteristics before and after the second partial lockdown in France to adapt public health restrictions to further prevent pandemic surges. METHODS: Between December 15 and 24, 2020, after a national media campaign, users of the sourcecovid.fr web application were asked questions about their own or a close relative's COVID-19 contamination after August 15, 2020, in France. The data of the contamination's circumstances were assessed and compared before and after the second partial lockdown, which occurred on October 25, 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic and was ongoing on December 24, 2020. RESULTS: As of December 24, 2020, 441,000 connections on the web application were observed. A total of 2218 questionnaires were assessable for analysis. About 61.8% (n=1309) of the participants were sure of their contamination origin, and 38.2% (n=809) thought they knew it. The median age of users was 43.0 (IQR 32-56) years, and 50.7% (n=1073) were male. The median incubation time of the assessed cohort was 4.0 (IQR 3-5) days. Private areas (family's or friend's house) were the main source of contamination (1048/2090, 50.2%), followed by work colleagues (579/2090, 27.7%). The main time of day for the contamination was the evening (339/961, 35.3%) before the lockdown and was reduced to 18.2% (86/473) after the lockdown (P<.001). The person who transmitted the virus to the user before and after the lockdown was significantly different (P<.001): a friend (382/1317, 29% vs 109/773, 14.1%), a close relative (304/1317, 23.1% vs 253/773, 32.7%), or a work colleague (315/1317, 23.9% vs 264/773, 34.2%). The main location where the virus was transmitted to the users before and after the lockdown was significantly different too (P<.001): home (278/1305, 21.3% vs 194/760, 25.5%), work (293/1305, 22.5% vs 225/760, 29.6%), collective places (430/1305, 33% vs 114/760, 15%), and care centers (58/1305, 4.4% vs 74/760, 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Modalities of transmissions significantly changed before and after the second lockdown in France. The main sources of contamination remained the private areas and with work colleagues. Work became the main location of contamination after the lockdown, whereas contaminations in collective places were strongly reduced.

The problem is to construct a Hamiltonian tour over a subset of candidate parking nodes, and each customer is assigned to the nearest parking node on the tour to pick up goods or parcels. The aim is to minimize the total cost, including the routing, allocation, and parking costs. We propose three models to formulate the problem, which are node-based, flow-based and bilevel programing formulations. Moreover, we develop a variable neighborhood search algorithm based on the ideas from the bilevel programing formulations to solve the problem. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of randomly generated instances, and the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Jiang, Li; Zang, Xiaoning; Dong, Junfeng; Liang, Changyong; Mladenovic, Nenad",Optim Lett,683,1

Preliminary data obtained in studies of properties of recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) that involved patients with community-acquired pneumonia (including bacterial), acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI), influenza and new coronavirus infection have shown promising results.The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of subcutaneous administration of IFN-Î³ in patients with viral pneumonia on the changes of vital signs and the duration of hospital stay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open-label, randomized, low-interventional study included patients with moderate new coronavirus infection COVID-19 over 18 years of age of both sexes. IFN-Î³ 500,000 IU was administered s/c, daily, once a day, during 5 days. RESULTS: IFN-y in addition to complex therapy of the disease resulted in more favorable changes in the stabilization of vital signs, as well as in reduced length of fever and hospital stay by 2 days what allows suggesting a positive effect of this substance on the recovery processes in patients with moderate COVID-19. Special emphasis should be made to the fact that patients who received recombinant IFN- Î³ experienced no progression of respiratory failure and required no transfer to intensive care unit. DISCUSSION: This study confirms earlier obtained data on the positive effect of IFN-y on the rate of clinical stabilization and recovery of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and viral infections. Presented results are limited to a small number of patients; further study of drug properties in post-marketing studies is required. CONCLUSION: Progress in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 by adding recombinant IFN-Î³ to the complex therapy may reasonably expand the range of existing treatment options for this infection.","Myasnikov, A L; Berns, S A; Talyzin, P A; Ershov, F I",Vopr Virusol,683,33

DESIGN: Multivariate analysis with population weights. SETTING: Two hundred eighty-seven American Indian Reservations and tribal homelands (in Oklahoma) and, as of April 10, 2020, 861 COVID-19 cases on these reservation lands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between rate per 1000 individuals of publicly reported COVID-19 cases at the tribal reservation and/or community level and average household characteristics from the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey records. RESULTS: By April 10, 2020, in regression analysis, COVID-19 cases were more likely by the proportion of homes lacking indoor plumbing (10.83, P = .001) and were less likely according to the percentage of reservation households that were English-only (-2.43, P = .03). Household overcrowding measures were not statistically significant in this analysis (-6.40, P = .326). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for the lack of complete indoor plumbing and access to potable water in a pandemic may be an important determinant of the increased incidence of COVID-19 cases. Access to relevant information that is communicated in the language spoken by many reservation residents may play a key role in the spread of COVID-19 in some tribal communities. Household overcrowding does not appear to be associated with COVID-19 infections in our data at the current time. Previous studies have identified household plumbing and overcrowding, and language, as potential pandemic and disease infection risk factors. These risk factors persist. Funding investments in tribal public health and household infrastructure, as delineated in treaties and other agreements, are necessary to protect American Indian communities.","Rodriguez-Lonebear, Desi; Barceló, Nicolás E; Akee, Randall; Carroll, Stephanie Russo",J Public Health Manag Pract,683,24

The second experiment explores how returning to a hybrid semester, the ""new normal,"" further affected these listening habits. In both experiments, the participants provided a list of their most frequently listened-to songs during the respective period of time.

These reasons were coded on nine underlying themes. Three clusters were found to underlie the themes: (1) emotional responses (2) memory associations, and (3) discovery of new music. We identified songs and reasons for selecting them that represented the three clusters and related these to the lyrical content. Compared to before the pandemic, participants in both experiments report listening more in general and on Spotify, but there were no differences in listening between lockdown and the new normal. Whom they were listening with shifted overtime from family members to significant others and finally to other friends and roommates.

Furthermore, many public service providers require customers to use the service only if they wear masks correctly. However, there are only a few research studies about face mask detection. To contribute to public healthcare for human beings, we propose RetinaMask, which is a high-accuracy and efficient face mask detector. The proposed RetinaMask is a one-stage detector, which consists of a feature pyramid network to fuse high-level semantic information with multiple feature maps, and a novel context attention module to focus on detecting face masks. In addition, we also propose a novel cross-class object removal algorithm to reject predictions with low confidences and the high intersection of union. Experimental results show that RetinaMask achieves state-of-the-art results on a public face mask dataset with 2.3% and 1.5% higher than the baseline result in the face and mask detection precision, respectively, and $11.0\%$ and $5.9\%$ higher than baseline for recall.

MethodsThe epitopes and pathways of escape for Spike-specific antibodies in individuals with diverse infection and vaccination history were profiled using Phage-DMS. Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential escape mutations by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue. ResultsIndividuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination. ConclusionsThe finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.

The aim of this survey was to estimate declines in imaging volumes and financial impact across different practice settings during April 2020. METHODS: The survey, comprising 48 questions, was conducted among members of the ACR and the Radiology Business Management Association during May 2020. Survey questions focused on practice demographics, volumes, financials, personnel and staff adjustments, and anticipation of recovery. RESULTS: During April 2020, nearly all radiology practices reported substantial (56.4%-63.7%) declines in imaging volumes, with outpatient imaging volumes most severely affected. Mean gross charges declined by 50.1% to 54.8% and collections declined by 46.4% to 53.9%. Percentage reductions did not correlate with practice size. The majority of respondents believed that volumes would recover but not entirely (62%-88%) and anticipated a short-term recovery, with a surge likely in the short term due to postponement of elective imaging (52%-64%). About 16% of respondents reported that radiologists in their practices tested positive for COVID-19. More than half (52.3%) reported that availability of personal protective equipment had become an issue or was inadequate. A majority (62.3%) reported that their practices had existing remote reading or teleradiology capabilities in place before the pandemic, and 22.3% developed such capabilities in response to the pandemic.

The research presented here provides analysis of the ethical challenges with regard to allocation of limited resources, particularly experimental therapeutics, using the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa as a case study. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior healthcare personnel (n = 16) from international humanitarian aid organizations intimately engaged in the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak response in West Africa. Interviews were recorded in private setting, transcribed, and iteratively coded using grounded theory methodology. A majority of respondents indicated a clear propensity to adopt an ethical framework of guiding principles for international responses to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Respondents agreed that prioritization of frontline workers' access to experimental therapeutics was warranted based on a principle of reciprocity. There was widespread acceptance of adaptive trial designs and greater trial transparency in providing access to experimental therapeutics. Many respondents also emphasized the importance of community engagement in limited resource allocation scheme design and culturally appropriate informed consent procedures.

However, it is difficult to accurately estimate the population densities of P. infestans in soil, especially Japanese soil. In the present study, P. infestans DNA was extracted from soil samples using a modified CTAB-bead method and quantified using real-time PCR to accurately, rapidly and easily estimate the P. infestans population densities in upland soils in Japan. P. infestans was well quantified in eleven types of soil samples, including nine types of upland soils in Japan, that were artificially inoculated with a zoosporangia suspension. The amounts of P. infestans DNA estimated by the real-time PCR were proportional to the inoculum densities. In the non-controlled experimental potato field, P. infestans population densities in soil corresponded to the development of symptoms and were correlated with the number of lesions on the potato foliage. These results imply that the proposed real-time PCR assay is suitable for the estimation or monitoring of P. infestans population densities in upland soils in Japan. The population densities at the ridge bottoms were larger than those at any other location in commercial potato fields. These results were similar to those of a previous report using a bioassay. Moreover, a correlation between DNA quantity and inoculum potential was observed. In conclusion, the real-time PCR assay developed in this study is suitable for indirect estimation of the inoculum potential of P. infestans.","Osawa, Hisashi; Suzuki, Nobuyuki; Akino, Seishi; Araki, Hiromichi; Asano, Kenji; Akai, Kotaro; Kondo, Norio",Sci Rep,683,16

Covid-19 appeared as a very dangerous virus and unfortunately caused a worldwide pandemic disease. Radiology doctors use X-ray or CT images for the diagnosis of Covid-19. It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods. Therefore, we proposed a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus. The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called as Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used. Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN) and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation are used for training and testing. In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation. This result clearly has shown that we reached the perfect classification rate by using X-ray image for Covid-19 detection.","Tuncer, Turker; Dogan, Sengul; Ozyurt, Fatih",Chemometr Intell Lab Syst,683,16

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019) epidemic created a need to rapidly evaluate potential treatment options to address the global pandemic including evaluation of azithromycin (AZM) as a mono or combination therapy. Due to the complicating medical conditions of COVID-19, in some cases patients may be unable to take medication orally and could require medication administration by alternate routes such as an EFT. The aim of this study was an in vitro assessment for the dose preparation and simulated administration of AZM suspensions, prepared from tablets and capsules, via nasogastric feeding tubes (NGT). AZM tablets and capsules were used to prepare aqueous suspensions from 250 to 2000 mg for administration via NGT. NGT between 8 and 12 French (Fr), from common materials of construction and typical lengths were evaluated. About 20 mL syringes were used with water as the diluent. The preparation and simulated NGT administration steps for AZM suspensions were evaluated in the laboratory studies and included assessment of in-use stability of the aqueous suspensions, chemical compatibility of prepared aqueous suspensions with the syringe and NGT, ease of delivery and accuracy of simulated administration. Analysis of the prepared sample solutions for assay/impurities was performed using chromatographic conditions based on the USP-NF monograph. Verification of dose preparation and simulated administration was performed for intact tablets, crushed tablets, and capsules. Aqueous suspensions prepared from intact tablets and capsules were exposed to dosing materials (enteral syringe and NGT) for a period of up to 4 hours at ambient conditions. Assessment of the ease of dose delivery and analyses of the resulting samples for assay, purity and total degradation products were performed. The laboratory studies verified a procedure to reliably prepare suspensions from AZM tablets and capsules, over a range of 250 to 2000 mg, that can be accurately administered through NGT in sizes of 8 to 12 Fr. No incompatibilities of the prepared aqueous AZM suspension with dosing materials were observed and acceptable stability was demonstrated for up to 4 hours.

The causative agent of the outbreak was identified by the WHO as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), producing the disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers. The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation. Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers.","Helmy, Yosra A.; Fawzy, Mohamed; Elaswad, Ahmed; Sobieh, Ahmed; Kenney, Scott P.; Shehata, Awad A.",J.

While it is well-established that severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections, a number of neurological sequelae have now been reported in a large proportion of cases. Additionally, the disease causes arterial and venous thromboses including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and a significant number of cerebrovascular complications. The increasing incidence of large vessel ischemic strokes as well as intracranial hemorrhages, frequently in younger individuals, and associated with increased morbidity and mortality, has raised questions as to why the brain is a major target of the disease. COVID-19 is characterized by hypercoagulability with alterations in hemostatic markers including high D-dimer levels, which are a prognosticator of poor outcome. Together with findings of fibrin-rich microthrombi, widespread extracellular fibrin deposition in affected various organs and hypercytokinemia, this suggests that COVID-19 is more than a pulmonary viral infection. Evidently, COVID-19 is a thrombo-inflammatory disease. Endothelial cells that constitute the lining of blood vessels are the primary targets of a thrombo-inflammatory response, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 also directly infects endothelial cells through the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Being highly heterogeneous in their structure and function, differences in the endothelial cells may govern the susceptibility of organs to COVID-19. Here, we have explored how the unique characteristics of the cerebral endothelium may be the underlying reason for the increased rates of cerebrovascular pathology associated with COVID-19.","Sashindranath, Maithili; Nandurkar, Harshal H",Stroke,683,24

COVID-19 surveillance in the Philippines relies on clinical monitoring and contact tracing, with both having limited use in early detection or prediction of community outbreaks. Thus, complementary public health surveillance methods that can provide community-level infection data faster and using lesser resources must be explored. ObjectivesThis study piloted and assessed WBE and WGS as approaches for COVID-19 surveillance in low-resource and low-sanitation communities in Davao City, Philippines. MethodsWeekly wastewater samples were collected from six barangay community sewer pipes or creeks from November to December 2020. Samples were concentrated using a PEG-NaCl precipitation method and analyzed by RT-PCR to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N, RdRP, and E genes. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive samples were subjected to WGS for genomic mutation surveillance. Public data from clinical surveillance were also reviewed to interpret WBE data. ResultsTwenty-two of the 24 samples (91.7%) obtained from the six barangays tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were correlated with RNA concentration and attack rate. Thirty-two SARS-CoV-2 mutations were detected in WGS, including novel non-synonymous mutations or indels in seven SARS-CoV-2 genes and ten mutations previously reported in the Philippines. DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in community wastewater from the six barangays of Davao City, even when the barangays were classified as having a low risk of COVID-19 transmission and no new cases were reported. Despite the fragmented genome sequences analyzed, our genomic surveillance in wastewater confirmed the presence of previously reported mutations while identifying mutations not yet registered in clinical surveillance. The local context of a community must be considered when planning to adopt WBE and WGS as complementary COVID-19 surveillance methodologies, especially in low-sanitation and low-resource settings.","Otero, Maria Catherine Bernolo; Murao, Lyre Anni E.; Limen, Mary Antoinette G.; Gaite, Paul Lorenzo A.; Bacus, Michael G.; Acaso, Joan T.; Corazo, Kahlil; Knot, Ineke E.; Sajonia, Homer; Reyes, Francis L. de los; Jaraula, Caroline M.

Telemedicine has recently emerged as an alternative for healthcare delivery to the patients and providing them with important information about orthopedic self-care and medications that can be followed without a hospital visit. However, due to lack of physical assessment, telemedicine is bound to have some limitations as well. The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of proactive telemedicine in maintaining follow-up of orthopedic patients, and their satisfaction with telemedicine as an alternative mode of treatment delivery. Methods: This one-month cross-sectional study enrolled the follow-up patients that visited the orthopedic outpatient-department in February 2020. The patients were sequentially called according to the order of their registration, on a daily basis. Consenting patients were provided with telemedicine-based consultations, and those requiring physical evaluation were called for outpatient visits after documenting the valid reasons. The response-rates and the volume of patients requiring physical visits were measured for different diagnosis-based groups. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire that included overall patient satisfaction with telemedicine, its effectiveness, and ease in following the telemedicine-based treatment. Results: The response rate to telemedicine was 88.67%. Among the patients availing telemedicine, 71.43% were managed without needing physical visits to the outpatient-department. The need for physical examination and failed patient-doctor communication were the most common reasons for advising physical outpatient visits. The overall satisfaction-rate to telemedicine was 92%, and only 7.2% of patients had difficulty in understanding or following telemedicine-based advice. Conclusions: Telemedicine can effectively reduce the need for physical visits to outpatient-departments for follow up of orthopedic patients. The response-rate and overall patient-satisfaction rates to telemedicine are high. Further efforts in expanding the use of telemedicine and addressing its limitations, especially those related to the failed communications, are needed to develop it as an alternative to physical orthopedic consultations in the current situation.","Kumar, Sandeep; Kumar, Arvind; Kumar, Mukesh; Kumar, Ashok; Arora, Rajesh; Sehrawat, Rakesh",,683,16
395096,395096,395096,Perspectives on the development of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,10.149028,9.854393,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene in neurons. Promising disease-modifying treatments to reinstate UBE3A expression are under development and an early measure of treatment response is critical to their deployment in clinical trials. Increased delta power in EEG recordings, reflecting abnormal neuronal synchrony, occurs in AS across species and correlates with genotype. Whether delta power provides a reliable biomarker for clinical symptoms remains unknown. METHODS: We analyzed combined EEG recordings and developmental assessments in a large cohort of individuals with AS (N = 82 subjects, 133 combined EEG and cognitive assessments, 1.08-28.16 years; 32F) and evaluated delta power as a biomarker for cognitive function, as measured by the Bayley Cognitive Score. We examined the robustness of this biomarker to varying states of consciousness, recording techniques and analysis procedures. RESULTS: Delta power predicted the Bayley Scale cognitive score (P < 10-5 , R2 = 0.9374) after controlling for age (P < 10-24 ), genotype:age (P < 10-11 ), and repeat assessments (P < 10-8 ), with the excellent fit on cross validation (R2 = 0.95). There were no differences in model performance across states of consciousness or bipolar versus average montages (&#916;AIC < 2). Models using raw data excluding frontal channels outperformed other models (&#916;AIC > 4) and predicted performance in expressive (P = 0.0209) and receptive communication (P < 10-3 ) and fine motor skills (P < 10-4 ). INTERPRETATION: Delta power is a simple, direct measure of neuronal activity that reliably correlates with cognitive function in AS. This electrophysiological biomarker offers an objective, clinically relevant endpoint for treatment response in emerging clinical trials.","Ostrowski, Lauren M; Spencer, Elizabeth R; Bird, Lynne M; Thibert, Ronald; Komorowski, Robert W; Kramer, Mark A; Chu, Catherine J",,683,20

Methodological approaches to investigate the health impacts of air pollution on epidemics should differ from those used for chronic diseases, but the methods used in these studies have not been appraised critically. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to identify and critique the methodological approaches of studies of air pollution on infections and mortality due to COVID-19 and to identify and critique the methodological approaches of similar studies concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Published and unpublished papers of associations between air pollution and developing or dying from COVID-19 or SARS that were reported as of 10 May 2020 were identified through electronic databases, internet searches, and other sources. RESULTS: All six COVID-19 studies and two of three SARS studies reported positive associations. Two were time series studies that estimated associations between daily changes in air pollution, one was a cohort that assessed associations between air pollution and the secondary spread of SARS, and six were ecological studies that used area-wide exposures and outcomes. Common shortcomings included possible cross-level bias in ecological studies, underreporting of health outcomes, using grouped data, the lack of highly spatially resolved air pollution measures, inadequate control for confounding and evaluation of effect modification, not accounting for regional variations in the timing of outbreaks' temporal changes in at-risk populations, and not accounting for nonindependence of outcomes. DISCUSSION: Studies of air pollution and novel coronaviruses have relied mainly on ecological measures of exposures and outcomes and are susceptible to important sources of bias. Although longitudinal studies with individual-level data may be imperfect, they are needed to adequately address this topic. The complexities involved in these types of studies underscore the need for careful design and for peer review. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7411.","Villeneuve, Paul J; Goldberg, Mark S",Environ Health Perspect,683,29

Until recently, WHO recommended to limit the use of facemasks to symptomatic people and advised against off-standard solutions. Moreover, recommendations differ among and within countries, causing public confusion and individual initiative.There is wide consensus that universal appropriate use of masks may contribute both to contain the epidemic and to reduce the burden on national procurement, if a community production approach is followed. Especially in low-middle income countries, due to the scarce capacity of national industrial production or import, the use of masks produced at community level may become the only viable option.

Time-integrated PM2.5 filters were collected at a residential site in Milan metropolitan area from April 11th to June 3rd at 2020, encompassing full-lockdown (FL), the followed partial-lockdown (PL2), and full-relaxation (FR) periods of COVID-19 restrictions. The collected filters were analyzed for elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), individual organic species (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and levoglucosan), and metals. According to online data, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and benzene (C6H6) levels significantly decreased during the entire COVID-19 period compared to the same time span in 2019, mainly due to the government-backed shutdowns and curtailed road traffic. Similarly, with a few exceptions, surrogates of tailpipe emissions (e.g., traffic-associated PAHs) as well as re-suspended road dust (e.g., Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, and Ti) were relatively lower during FL and PL2 periods in comparison with year 2019, whereas an increasing trend in mass concentration of mentioned species was observed from FL to PL2 and FR phases due to the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions. In contrast, comparable concentrations of ambient PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) between lockdown period and the same time span in 2019 were attributed to the interplay between decreased road traffic and elevated domestic biomass burning as a result of adopted stay-home strategies. Finally, the curtailed road traffic during FL and PL2 periods led to ~25% drop in the PM2.5 oxidative potential (measured via 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) and dithiothreitol (DTT) assays) with respect to the FR period as well as the same time span in 2019.

The present study was conducted to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and perceived financial implications in otorhinolaryngologists during the COVID-19 pandemic across India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among otorhinolaryngology specialists across India using WHOQOL-BREF and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Financial Well-Being Scale questionnaires on Google Forms, which was kept open for the latter half of July 2020. Results: A total of 358 responses were obtained; the response rate was 26.64%. Twenty-four percent of respondents worked exclusively in academic settings; 40.22% of specialists had over 10 years of work experience. Average monthly income in 2019 was between 1-3 lakhs Indian Rupees (INR) in 43.85%, while in 2020, 62.57% of the specialists had an average monthly income of below one lakh INR; this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Mean WHOQOL-BREF scores for physical, psychological, social and environmental domains were 68.8 ± 1, 62.3 ± 0.75, 68.9 ± 1.17 and 65.8 ± 1.01, respectively; mean CFPB financial well-being scale score was 55.5 ± 0.66. QOL and financial well-being were better in otolaryngologists older than 60 years, male specialists and private consultants. Conclusions: There has been a tremendous impact on quality of life and financial well-being among otorhinolaryngologists in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study outcome may help otolaryngologists comprehend and perceive the extent to which it has affected their professional and personal lives, and explore ways to face and overcome the situation.","Dosemane, Deviprasad; Khadilkar, Meera Niranjan; Kanthila, Jayashree; Mithra, Prasanna P",Acta otorhinolaryngol. ital,683,23

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in eHealth literacy and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19, and their associations with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. METHODS: The COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHIns), using telephonic (n=500) and web-based surveys (n=1001), was conducted among adults in Hong Kong in April 2020. The Chinese eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS; score range 8-40) was used to measure eHealth literacy. COVID-19 preventive behaviors included wearing surgical masks, wearing fabric masks, washing hands, social distancing, and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system. Adjusted beta coefficients and the slope indices of inequality for the eHEALS score by socioeconomic status, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 by socioeconomic status, and aORs for the high adherence to preventive behaviors by the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: The mean eHEALS score was 26.10 (SD 7.70). Age was inversely associated with the eHEALS score, but education and personal income were positively associated with the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 (for all, P for trend<.05). Participants who sought web-based information on COVID-19 showed high adherence to the practice of wearing surgical masks (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.13), washing hands (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.71), social distancing (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.93), and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.18). Those with the highest eHEALS score displayed high adherence to the practice of wearing surgical masks (aOR 3.84, 95% CI 1.63-9.05), washing hands (aOR 4.14, 95% CI 2.46-6.96), social distancing (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.39-3.65), and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.19-3.16), compared to those with the lowest eHEALS score. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese adults with a higher socioeconomic status had higher eHealth literacy and sought more web-based information on COVID-19; both these factors were associated with a high adherence to the guidelines for preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Ziqiu; Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Guo, Ningyuan; Wu, Yongda; Weng, Xue; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Lam, Tai Hing; Wang, Man Ping",J Med Internet Res,683,1

Pregnant women represent a risk category for increased abortion rates and vertical transmission with adverse events on the newborns has been recently confirmed. The scientific world is struggling for finding an effective cure for counteracting symptomatology. Today, there are many therapeutic proposes but none of them can effectively counteract the infection. Moreover, many of these compounds show important side effects not justifying their use. Scientific literature reports an immune system over-reaction through interleukins-6 activation. In this regard, the possibility to control the immune system represents a possible strategy for counteracting the onset of COVID-19 symptomatology. Vitamin D deficiency shows increased susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections. Moreover, Vitamin D seems involved in host protection from different virus species by modulating activation and release of cytokines. Myo-inositol down-regulates the expression of IL-6 by phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Furthermore, myo-inositol is the precursor of phospholipids in the surfactant and it is applied for inducing surfactant synthesis in infants for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This review aims to summarize the evidence about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and to encourage the scientific community to investigate the use of Vitamin D and Myo-inositol which could represent a possible preventive treatment for pregnant women or women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART).","Bezerra Espinola, Maria Salome; Bertelli, Matteo; Bizzarri, Mariano; Unfer, Vittorio; Laganà, Antonio Simone; Visconti, Berniero; Aragona, Cesare",J Reprod Immunol,683,20

Coated-platelets, a form of procoagulant platelets, support thrombin formation and are elevated in ischemic stroke patients with increased risk for recurrent infarction. Our goal was to examine changes in coated-platelet levels over the course of COVID-19 infection and determine their association with disease severity, thrombosis, and death. Coated-platelet levels were assayed after admission and repeated weekly in COVID-19 patients, and in COVID-19 negative controls. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to calculate area under the curve (AUC) values for a model including baseline coated-platelets to predict death. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to predict risk for death at 90 days. We enrolled 33 patients (22 with moderate and 11 with severe infection) and 20 controls. Baseline coated-platelet levels were lower among moderate (mean ± SD; 21.3 ± 9.8%) and severe COVID-19 patients (28.5 ± 11.9%) compared to controls (38.1 ± 10.4%, p < 0.0001). Coated-platelet levels increased during follow-up in COVID-19 patients by 7% (relative) per day from symptom onset (95% CI 2-12%, p = 0.007). A cut-off of 33.9% for coated-platelet levels yielded 80% sensitivity and 96% specificity for death at 90 days, with resulting AUC of 0.880 (95% CI 0.680-1.0, p = 0.0002). The adjusted hazard ratio for death in patients with coated-platelet levels > 33.9% was 40.99 when compared to those with levels &#8804; 33.9% (p < 0.0001).

In order to safely care for patients new processes, such as a plan for the airway management of a patient with COVID-19, must be implemented and disseminated in a rapid fashion. The use of in-situ simulation has been used to assist in latent problem identification as part of a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Additionally, simulation is an effective means for training teams to perform high-risk procedures before engaging in the actual procedure. This educational advance seeks to use and study in-situ simulation as a means to rapidly implement a process for airway management in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using an airway algorithm developed by the authors, we designed an in-situ simulation scenario to train physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists in best practices for airway management of patients with COVID-19. Physician participants were surveyed using a five-point Likert scale with regard to their comfort level with various aspects of the airway algorithm both before and after the simulation in a retrospective fashion. Additionally, we obtained feedback from all participants and used it to refine the airway algorithm. RESULTS: Over a two-week period, 93 physicians participated in the simulation. We received 81 responses to the survey (87%), which showed that the average level of comfort with personal protective equipment procedures increased significantly from 2.94 (95% confidence interval, 2.71-3.17) to 4.36 (4.24-4.48), a difference of 1.42 (1.20-1.63, p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in average comfort level in understanding the physician role with scores increasing from 3.51 (3.26-3.77) to 4.55 (2.71-3.17), a difference of 1.04 (0.82-1.25, p < 0.001). There was also increased comfort in performing procedural tasks such as intubation, from 3.08 (2.80-3.35) to 4.38 (4.23-4.52) after the simulation, a difference of 1.30 points (1.06-1.54, p < 0.001). Feedback from the participants also led to refinement of the airway algorithm. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented a new airway management guideline for patients with suspected COVID-19. In-situ simulation is an essential tool for both dissemination and onboarding, as well as process improvement, in the context of an epidemic or pandemic.","Munzer, Brendan W; Bassin, Benjamin S; Peterson, William J; Tucker, Ryan V; Doan, Jessica; Harvey, Carrie; Sefa, Nana; Hsu, Cindy H",West J Emerg Med,683,21

In the host cell, the virus largely depends on the main protease (Mpro ) to regulate infection hence it is one of the most attractive targets for inhibitor design. However, >19,000 mutations in the Mpro have already been reported. The mutations encompassing 282 amino acid positions and these ""hotspots"" might change the Mpro structure, activity and potentially delay therapeutic strategies targeting Mpro . Thus, here we identified 24 mutational ""coldspots"" where mutations have not been observed. We compared the structure-function relationship of these coldspots with several SARS-CoV2 Mpro X-ray crystal structures. We found that three coldspot residues (Leu141, Phe185, and Gln192) help to form the active site, while seven (Gly2, Arg4, Tyr126, Lys137, Leu141, Leu286, and Leu287) contribute to dimer formation that is required for Mpro activity. The surface of the dimer interface is more resistant to mutations compared to the active site. Interestingly, most of the coldspots are found in three clusters and forms conserved patterns when compared with other coronaviruses. Importantly, several conserved coldspots are available on the surface of the active site and at the dimer interface for targeting. The identification and short list of these coldspots offers a new perspective to target the SARS-CoV2 Mpro while avoiding mutation-based drug resistance.","Krishnamoorthy, Navaneethakrishnan; Fakhro, Khalid",IUBMB Life,683,6

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether sphingosine regulates the infection of cultured and freshly isolated ex vivo human epithelial cells with pseudoviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike) that served as a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that exogenously applied sphingosine suspended in 0.9% NaCl prevents cellular infection with pp-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Pretreatment of cultured Vero epithelial cells or freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with low concentrations of sphingosine prevented adhesion of and infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sphingosine binds to ACE2, the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and prevents the interaction of the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein with ACE2. These data indicate that sphingosine prevents at least some viral infections by interfering with the interaction of the virus with its receptor. Our data also suggest that further preclinical and finally clinical examination of sphingosine is warranted for potential use as a prophylactic or early treatment for coronavirus disease-19.","Edwards, Michael J; Becker, Katrin Anne; Gripp, Barbara; Hoffmann, Markus; Keitsch, Simone; Wilker, Barbara; Soddemann, Matthias; Gulbins, Anne; Carpinteiro, Elisa; Patel, Sameer H; Wilson, Gregory C; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Walter, Silke; Fassbender, Klaus; Ahmad, Syed A; Carpinteiro, Alexander; Gulbins, Erich",J Biol Chem,683,16

METHODS: Each VSE was 1-2 weeks long, contained specialty-specific course objectives, and included a variety of teaching modalities. Students completed a post-course survey to assess changes in their interest and understanding of the specialty. Quantitative methods were employed to analyze the results. RESULTS: Eighty-three students participated in the electives and 67 (80.7%) completed the post-course survey. Forty-six (68.7%) respondents reported ""increased"" or ""greatly increased"" interest in the course specialty completed. Survey respondents' post-course understanding of each specialty increased by a statistically significant amount (p-value = <0.0001). CONCLUSION: This initial effort demonstrated that VSEs can be an effective tool for increasing medical students' interest in and understanding of surgical specialties. They should be studied further with more rigorous methods in a larger population.","Pettitt-Schieber, Brian; Kuo, Marissa; Steehler, Andrew; Dong, Andy; Fakunle, Omolola; Manalo, Tad; Mercury, Oblaise; Simpson, Francis; Guissé, Ndéye; Studer, Matthew; Poirier, Marie-Veronique; Philbrick, Brandon; Grady, Zachary; Higgins, Michelle; Gallo, Lindsay; Danko, Dora; Dawoud, Reem; Pettitt, Barbara",Am. j. surg,683,17

The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus. For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization. Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply.","Braithwaite, Ronald; Warren, Rueben",J Health Care Poor Underserved,683,16

APPROACH & RESULTS: This novel systematic review and meta-analysis identified six studies of 586 patients delineating liver chemistries among patients with severe/critical illness versus mild cases of COVID-19 infection. Patients with severe/critical illness with COVID-19 infection have increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as compared to mild cases. A significant association between severe/critical COVID-19 infections with elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (pooled mean difference [MD], 11.70 U/L; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.97, 20.43; P = 0.009), elevated total bilirubin (pooled MD, 0.14 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.22; P = 0.0005), and decreased albumin (pooled MD, -0.68 g/L; 95% CI, -0.81, -0.55; P < 0.00001) was noted. There was also a trend toward elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels among these severe cases (pooled MD, 8.84 U/L; 95% CI, -2.28, 19.97; P = 0.12); however, this did not reach statistical significance. More severe/critically ill cases were associated with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, elevated creatinine kinase, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated prothrombin time (PT). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, including CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD, are more prevalent in hospitalized Chinese patients with severe/critical illness from COVID-19, and these patients are more likely to manifest with abnormal liver chemistries. Further prospective studies are crucial to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the hepatic manifestations of the novel COVID-19 infection and its clinical significance.","Kovalic, Alexander J; Huang, Glen; Thuluvath, Paul J; Satapathy, Sanjaya K",Hepatology (Baltim.),683,29

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. Methods A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. Results Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. Conclusion The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.","Clement, N. D.; Hall, A.

We reviewed recent epidemiological evidence regarding intrauterine exposure to acetaminophen and risk for asthma, neurodevelopment disorders, and reproductive health in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS: An increasing number of cohort studies have suggested that maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with increased risk for asthma; neurodevelopmental disorders, especially ADHD and behavioral problems; and genital malformations in the offspring. Oxidative stress and inflammation or endocrine effects are plausible shared biological mechanisms for the exposure to influence multiple developmental outcomes. We discussed methodological challenges that can threaten the validity of these observational data, including confounding and measurement errors. Novel statistical methods and research designs that can be used to mitigate these issues were introduced. Given the high prevalence of use, findings regarding intrauterine exposure to acetaminophen on multiple child health outcomes raise concerns. Research on causal and non-causal mechanisms that might explain these associations should be a priority.","Liew, Zeyan; Ernst, Andreas",Curr. Environ. Health Rep,683,3

The questionnaire was divided into four domains: personal data, precautionary measures (before patient arrival; in the waiting room; in the operating room), awareness, and perception. Three thousand five hundred ninety-nine questionnaires were analyzed. Five hundred two (14.43%) participants had suffered one or more symptoms referable to COVID-19. Thirty-one subjects were positive to the virus SARS-CoV-2 and 16 subjects developed the disease. Only a small number of dentists (n = 72, 2.00%) were confident of avoiding infection; dentists working in low COVID-19 prevalence areas were more confident than those working in the Milan area and high prevalence area (61.24%, 61.23%, and 64.29%, p < 0.01 respectively). The level of awareness was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Milan area (71.82%) than in the other areas.

The automatic execution of each instruction produces a set of graphical and structural assets, including images, videos, and metadata such as clicked elements for each step. HelpViz then synthesizes a tutorial by combining parsed text instructions with the generated assets, and contextualizes the tutorial to user interaction by tracking the user's progress and highlighting the next step. Our experiments with HelpViz indicate that our pipeline improved tutorial execution robustness and that participants preferred tutorials generated by HelpViz over text-based instructions.

Single cases and small series were reported from 13 countries, the majority from Europe (79.4%) and especially from Italy (30.9%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated by nasopharyngeal swab (85.7%) and serology (14.3%). Median time between COVID-19 and GBS onset in 36 patients was 11.5 days (IQR: 7.7-16). The most common clinical features were: limb weakness (76.2%), hypoareflexia (80.9 %), sensory disturbances (66.7 %) and facial palsy (38.1%). Dysautonomia occurred in 19%, respiratory failure in 33.3% and 40.5% of patients were admitted in intensive care unit. Most patients (71.4%) had the classical clinical presentation but virtually all GBS variants and subtypes were reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albumin-cytological dissociation was found in 28/36 (77.8%) and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in 25/25 patients. Electrodiagnosis was demyelinating in 80.5% and levels 1 and 2 of Brighton criteria of diagnostic certainty, when applicable, were fulfilled in 94.5% patients. Antiganglioside antibodies were positive in only 1/22 patients. Treatments were intravenous immunoglobulin and/or plasma exchange (92.8%) with, at short-time follow-up, definite improvement or recovery in 62.1% of patients. One patient died. In conclusion, the most frequent phenotype of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the classical sensorimotor demyelinating GBS responding to the usual treatments. The time interval between infectious and neuropathic symptoms, absence of CSF pleocytosis and negative PCR support a postinfectious mechanism. The abundance of reports suggests a pathogenic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS but a case-control study is greatly needed.","Uncini, Antonino; Vallat, Jean-Michel; Jacobs, Bart C",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,683,20

At the time of this study, the number of daily new cases in the United States was greater than that in any other country, and the trend was increasing in most states. Google Trends provides data regarding public interest in various topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods may provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to consider the predictive ability of different search terms not directly related to COVID-19 with regard to the increase of daily cases in the United States. In particular, we are concerned with searches related to dine-in restaurants and bars. Data were obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface and the COVID-19 Tracking Project. METHODS: To test the causation of one time series on another, we used the Granger causality test. We considered the causation of two different search query trends related to dine-in restaurants and bars on daily positive cases in the US states and territories with the 10 highest and 10 lowest numbers of daily new cases of COVID-19. In addition, we used Pearson correlations to measure the linear relationships between different trends. RESULTS: Our results showed that for states and territories with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants, which mainly occurred after reopening, significantly affected the number of daily new cases on average. California, for example, showed the most searches for restaurants on June 7, 2020; this affected the number of new cases within two weeks after the peak, with a P value of .004 for the Granger causality test. CONCLUSIONS: Although a limited number of search queries were considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant effect on daily new cases in US states and territories with higher numbers of daily new cases. We showed that these influential search trends can be used to provide additional information for prediction tasks regarding new cases in each region. These predictions can help health care leaders manage and control the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on society and prepare for its outcomes.","Asgari Mehrabadi, Milad; Dutt, Nikil; Rahmani, Amir M",JMIR Public Health Surveill,683,1

In a patient with clinical presentation of acute myocarditis, biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, diffuse biventricular hypokinesia, increased ventricular wall thickness, and severe LV dysfunction has been reported. Among patients with significant clinical improvement in LV structure and function has also been documented. With increasing number of clinical cases, future imaging studies will be instrumental in identifying the various cardiac manifestations, and their relation to clinical outcome.","Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos; Sahu, Kamal Kant; Kranis, Mark; Sargent, Jennifer",Monaldi arch. chest dis,683,21

It is not only the long working hours but also the uncertainty and increase in patient mortality that has affected mental health and staff well-being. Hospitals all around the country have rightly responded with various well-being initiatives to help their staff such as wobble rooms and developing online resources. Our vision was to set up a safe space for staff away from clinical noise to enable and encourage mindfulness and psychological resilience through a calm and serene environment. We used the continuous quality improvement methodology and administered an initial needs assessment survey to see if our trust staff will be interested in having such a space. Within our team, we managed to secure a place, and used donations to hospital charity and set up a space within a week. Since opening the hub, we have had excellent feedback from various staff groups. Immediate feedback was obtained using emoji stickers asking for feelings before and after visit. A mood board was put up allowing anonymous expression of feelings. Delayed feedback was requested using a repeat survey. We believe that while there is a lot of talk about well-being and an increasing number of resources being offered electronically, the need for a neat and quiet space cannot be overlooked. We collect feedback on a weekly basis and adapt the space to meet the needs of staff. Long-term impact of such spaces will be reassessed at a later stage.","Saqib, Aaisha; Rampal, Tarannum",,683,1

As a personality characteristic highly contextualized in stressful circumstances, resilience was expected to have a mediating role in this relationship. Method: A sample of 2,722 Slovene adults, aged from 18 to 82 years filled in the Big Five Inventory, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum. A path analysis with the Bootstrap estimation procedure was performed to evaluate the mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between personality and psychological functioning. Results: Resilience fully or partially mediated the relationships between all the Big Five but extraversion with subjective well-being and stress experienced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outburst. Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of less adaptive psychological functioning both directly and through diminished resilience. Conclusions: Resilience may be a major protective factor required for an adaptive response of an individual in stressful situations such as pandemic and the associated lockdown.

Different clinical trials are still under way. Among them is Ivermectin (IVM), an FDA approved drug which was recently reported as a successful candidate to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load by inhibiting Importin-&#945;1 (IMP-&#945;1) protein which subsequently affects nuclear transport of viral proteins but its basic binding mode and inhibitory mechanism is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to explore the inhibitory mechanism and binding mode of IVM with IMP-&#945;1 via different computational methods. Initially, comparative docking of IVM was performed against two different binding sites (Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) major and minor sites) of IMP-&#945;1 to predict the probable binding mode of IVM. Then, classical MD simulation was performed (IVM/NLS-Major site and IVM/NLS-Minor site), to predict its comparative stability dynamics and probable inhibitory mechanism. The stability dynamics and biophysical analysis of both sites highlighted the stable binding of IVM within NLS-Minor site by establishing and maintaining more hydrophobic contacts with crucial residues, required for IMP-&#945;1 inhibition which were not observed in NLS-major site. Altogether, these results recommended the worth of IVM as a possible drug to limit the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and consequently reduces its progression.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

An underlying immunological mechanism similar to that of spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is suspected, with the identification of antibodies to platelet factor-4 (PF4), but without previous heparin exposure. This unusual mechanism has significant implications for the management approach used, which differs from usual treatment of CVST. We describe the cases of two young males, who developed severe thrombocytopenia and fatal CVST following the first dose of Vaxzevria. Both presented with a headache, with subsequent rapid neurological deterioration. One patient underwent PF4 antibody testing, which was positive. A rapid vaccination programme is essential in helping to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it is vital that such COVID-19 vaccine-associated events, which at this stage appear to be very rare, are viewed through this lens. However, some cases have proved fatal. It is critical that clinicians are alerted to the emergence of such events to facilitate appropriate management. Patients presenting with CVST features and thrombocytopenia post-vaccination should undergo PF4 antibody testing and be managed in a similar fashion to HIT, in particular avoiding heparin and platelet transfusions.","Mehta, Puja R; Apap Mangion, Sean; Benger, Matthew; Stanton, Biba R; Czuprynska, Julia; Arya, Roopen; Sztriha, Laszlo K",Brain behav. immun,683,33

METHODS: Between March 4, 2020 and March 24, 2020, all CXR reports including the Brixia score were retrieved. We enrolled only hospitalized Caucasian patients with COVID-19 for whom the final outcome was available. For each patient, age, sex, underlying comorbidities, immunosuppressive therapies, and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for analysis. These independent variables were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model to extract the predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 302 Caucasian patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In the multivariable logistic regression model, only Brixia score, patient age, and conditions that induced immunosuppression were the significant predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, the optimal cutoff values for Brixia score and patient age were 8 points and 71 years, respectively. Three different models that included the Brixia score showed excellent predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a high Brixia score and at least one other predictive factor had the highest risk of in-hospital death.","Borghesi, Andrea; Zigliani, Angelo; Golemi, Salvatore; Carapella, Nicola; Maculotti, Patrizia; Farina, Davide; Maroldi, Roberto",Int J Infect Dis,683,16

The aim of this study was to demonstrate a possibility of lymphocytic myocarditis and to study its morphological features in patients with the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) with a severe course.Material and methods Postmortem data were studied for 5 elderly patients (74.8±4.4 years; 3 men and 2 women) with the novel coronavirus infection and bilateral, severe polysegmental pneumonia (stage 3-4 by computed tomography). COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the typical clinical presentation and positive polymerase chain reaction test in nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were treated in different hospitals repurposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A standard histological study was performed with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and van Gieson staining. Serial paraffin slices were studied immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD3, Ð¡D68, CD20, perforin, and toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 9.Results In none of the cases, myocarditis was suspected clinically, added to the diagnosis or indicated as a possible cause of death. IHD and acute myocardial infarction were mentioned as error diagnoses not confirmed by the postmortem examination. The morphological examination of the heart identified signs of lymphocytic myocarditis consistent with Dallas criteria for this diagnosis. Myocardial infiltrate was characterized in detail, and a combined inflammatory damage of endocardium and pericardium was described. The immunohistochemical study with cell infiltrate typing confirmed the presence of CD3-positive Ð¢ lymphocytes and the increased expression of TLR-4. A picture of coronaritis, including that with microvascular thrombosis, was found in all cases.Conclusion A possibility for development of lymphocytic viral myocarditis in COVID-19 was confirmed morphologically and immunohistochemically.

Video consultation is one form that enables early detection of deteriorating patients and promotion of self-efficacy in patients who are well but anxious. Abdominal pain is a common symptom presented by patients in emergency departments. These patients could benefit from video consultation, as it enables remote follow-up of patients who do not require admission and facilitates early discharge of patients from overcrowded hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of digital telereview in patients presenting with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain. METHODS: The SAVED study was a prospective randomized controlled trial in which follow-up using existing telephone-based telereview (control) was compared with digital telereview (intervention). Patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain discharged from the emergency department observation ward were studied based on intention-to-treat. The control arm received routine, provider-scheduled telereview with missed reviews actively coordinated and rescheduled by emergency department staff. The intervention arm received access to a platform for digital telereview (asynchronous and synchronous format) that enabled patient-led appointment rescheduling. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks for outcomes of service utilization, efficacy (compliance with their disposition plan), and safety (re-presentation for the same condition). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients participated, with patients randomly assigned to each arm (1:1 ratio). Patients were a mean age of 40.0 (SD 13.8; range 22-71) years, predominantly female (47/70, 67%), and predominantly of Chinese ethnicity (39/70, 56%).

There were no significant differences in safety (P>.99) and efficacy (P>.99) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The application of digital telereview for the follow-up of patients with abdominal pain may be safe and effective. Future studies are needed to evaluate its cost-effectiveness and usefulness for broader clinical application.

However, the role of surface transmission is still debated. The present systematic review aims to summarize all the evidence on surface survival of coronaviruses infecting humans. The analysis of 18 studies showed the longest coronavirus survival time is 28 days at room temperature (RT) on different surfaces: polymer banknotes, vinyl, steel, glass, and paper banknotes. Concerning SARS-CoV-2 human infection from contaminated surfaces, dangerous viral load on surfaces for up to 21 days was determined on polymer banknotes, steel, glass and paper banknotes. For viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, the longest period of survival was 14 days, recorded on glass. Environmental conditions can affect virus survival, and indeed, low temperatures and low humidity support prolonged survival of viruses on contaminated surfaces independently of surface type. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure to sunlight significantly reduces the risk of surface transmission. Although studies are increasingly investigating the topic of coronavirus survival, it is difficult to compare them, given the methodology differences. For this reason, it is advisable to define a reference working protocol for virus survival trials, but, as an immediate measure, there is also a need for further investigations of coronavirus survival on surfaces.","Marzoli, Filippo; Bortolami, Alessio; Pezzuto, Alessandra; Mazzetto, Eva; Piro, Roberto; Terregino, Calogero; Bonfante, Francesco; Belluco, Simone",Sci Total Environ,683,23

At this particular moment in history, these struggles are digitally, ideologically, and organizationally interconnected in their criticism of LIO institutions, amplifying each other.

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns about the management and care for people with dementia and their caregivers. In this context, this work will discuss how social isolation or social distancing caused by the pandemic may impact the clinical management of people with dementia, caregivers' health, and dementia research. The pandemic disrupts all forms of social interaction and may increase the behavioral impairment of people with dementia. Regarding pharmacological treatment, telemedicine is an option, but the context of social isolation raises questions about how to manage people with dementia with lack of cognitive stimulation and non-pharmacological treatment. In addition, the impact of the pandemic on caregivers should be considered. There is some evidence that telephone counseling can reduce depressive symptoms of caregivers of people with dementia. In dementia research, social isolation imposes researchers to modify their study protocols in order to continue collecting data by developing remote tools to assess the participants such as electronic informed consent and online questionnaires and tests. Thus, there is an urgent need for the evaluation and refinement of interventions to address several cognitive, behavioral, and clinical aspects of the long-term impact of the pandemic in dementia.","Dourado, Marcia Cristina Nascimento; Belfort, Tatiana; Monteiro, Alexandre; Lucena, Aline Tavares de; Lacerda, Isabel Barbeito; Gaigher, Julia; Baptista, Maria Alice Tourinho; Brandt, Michelle; Kimura, Nathália Ramos; Souza, Natalie de; Gasparini, Paula; Rangel, Rogéria; Marinho, Valeska",Dement. neuropsychol,683,1

While the field of infodemiology has studied information patterns on the Web and in social media for at least 18 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been referred to as the first social media infodemic. However, there is limited evidence about whether and how the social media infodemic has spread panic and affected the mental health of social media users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine how social media affects self-reported mental health and the spread of panic about COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODS: To carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared and conducted in Iraqi Kurdistan, and a total of 516 social media users were sampled. This study deployed a content analysis method for data analysis. Correspondingly, data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Participants reported that social media has a significant impact on spreading fear and panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a potential negative influence on people's mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most used social media network for spreading panic about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq. We found a significant positive statistical correlation between self-reported social media use and the spread of panic related to COVID-19 (R=.8701). Our results showed that the majority of youths aged 18-35 years are facing psychological anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown, people are using social media platforms to gain information about COVID-19. The nature of the impact of social media panic among people varies depending on an individual's gender, age, and level of education. Social media has played a key role in spreading anxiety about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan.","Ahmad, Araz Ramazan; Murad, Hersh Rasool",J Med Internet Res,683,20

As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on ClinicalTrials.gov and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. RESULTS: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. Tabular results were available on ClinicalTrials.gov for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further 1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report results on ClinicalTrials.gov . Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.","Rodgers, Florence; Pepperrell, Toby; Keestra, Sarai; Pilkington, Victoria",Trials,683,2

RECENT FINDINGS: Overdose due to illicit synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl and fentanyl analogs) continues to rise in the US both preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western USA. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder. SUMMARY: A 'fourth wave' of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the USA. Availability and use of illicit fentanyls are still the major drivers of overdose deaths and the current rise in stimulant-related deaths appears entwined with the ongoing opioid epidemic.","Ciccarone, Daniel",Curr Opin Psychiatry,683,6

It is one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times, with no proven cure or vaccine. In this paper, our focus is on a fractional order approach to modeling and simulations of the novel COVID-19. We introduce a fractional type susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to gain insight into the ongoing pandemic. Our proposed model incorporates transmission rate, testing rates, and transition rate (from asymptomatic to symptomatic population groups) for a holistic study of the coronavirus disease. The impacts of these parameters on the dynamics of the solution profiles for the disease are simulated and discussed in detail. Furthermore, across all the different parameters, the effects of the fractional order derivative are also simulated and discussed in detail. Various simulations carried out enable us gain deep insights into the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19. The simulation results confirm that fractional calculus is an appropriate tool in modeling the spread of a complex infectious disease such as the novel COVID-19. In the absence of vaccine and treatment, our analysis strongly supports the significance reduction in the transmission rate as a valuable strategy to curb the spread of the virus. Our results suggest that tracing and moving testing up has an important benefit. It reduces the number of infected individuals in the general public and thereby reduces the spread of the pandemic. Once the infected individuals are identified and isolated, the interaction between susceptible and infected individuals diminishes and transmission reduces. Furthermore, aggressive testing is also highly recommended.","Owusu-Mensah, Isaac; Akinyemi, Lanre; Oduro, Bismark; Iyiola, Olaniyi S",Adv Differ Equ,683,20

These kinds of statements seem to belie ulterior political motives ahead of a presidential election less than a year away She exposed her political playbook when in early 2019 she had first announced that she saw no need for impeachment to proceed only to reverse her stand a few months later in September 2019 when she called on the House to proceed immediately with hearings to formulate articles of impeachment in order to have the entire process completed by the end of 2019 Urgency became the justification for expediting this traditionally weighty and lengthy process However, once the articles had been passed by the House she held onto them for several weeks into January 2020 before conveying them to the Senate for its process to start So much for the urgency! Republicans locked ranks in support of the president In the Hous , every Republican member voted against impeachment When out of 51 Republican Senators the Democrats could convince only one to support one of the charges the trial ended with the president’s acquittal Remarkably, president Trump has now become the first impeached president to run for re-election He now touts the partisan vote in the House as illegitimate and his Senate acquittal as vindication It bolsters his argument that the Democrats and the media never accepted his 2016 victory and have tried to overrule the verdict of voters ever since Democrats may well have failed to persuade the country: instead they have set a new, low standard for impeaching a president The House articles, on face value, were defective in that they both failed to meet the constitutional threshold of “high crimes and misdemeanors” Eventually the intricate process of impeachment failed to deliver that which the Democrats wanted to achieve at all cost With these high hurdles in place, no president has ever been removed from office by such means, and only three presidents have ever been impeached by the House – Andrew Johnson in 1869, Bill Clinton in 1995 and Donald Trump in 2019 In 1973 president Richard Nixon resigned before the House could vote on articles of impeachment What the USA has experienced in the case of president Trump is of a different order The impeachment proceedings are supposed to be a sober constitutional matter – not a political circus But a politically divided nation, the fractured media environment, the toxicity of social media and a president who feeds on chaos combined to create an atmosphere unlike anything that existed during previous impeachment proceedings With not much more than a party line impeachment vote the Democratic Party seemed motivated by a partisan desire to weaken president Trump during the 2020 election cycle Had Covid-19 not entered the political scene and is bound to occupy centre stage in the months leading up to the presidential election in November 2020, the issue of impeachment would have been a major campaign slogan for the Democrats © 2020 South African Academy for Science and the Arts All rights reserved","EkstEen, R.",Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe,683,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with preexisting MG presenting with concurrent COVID-19 between September 21st and November 4th, 2020 when attending the emergency department or routine neurology consultation at the National Institute Mongi Ben Hamida of Neurology of Tunis, Tunisia. RESULTS: Five patients were identified. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America scores (MGFA) prior to COVID-19 infection were class I in one patient, class II (IIa, IIb) in two patients, and class IIIb in one patient. Four patients had mild to moderate courses of COVID-19 infection. One patient presented a critical infection with acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Two of them also demonstrated signs of MG exacerbation requiring the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in one case. We maintained immunosuppressant therapy to MG in all our patients. All our patients received Azithromycin (AZM) as a part of specific drug treatment of COVID-19 infection. Outcome was favorable in 4 patients and rapidly fatal evolution was observed in the patient with ADRS. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION: The results from our study suggest that prior MG activity could partially influence the subsequent clinical outcomes. It emerged also that ongoing long-term immunosuppressive immunotherapy to MG should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic and that AZM can be used safely in MG patients and concurrent COVID-19 infection.","Saied, Z.; Rachdi, A.; Thamlaoui, S.; Nabli, F.; Jeridi, C.; Baffoun, N.; Kaddour, C.; Belal, S.; Ben Sassi, S.",Acta Neurologica Scandinavica,683,20

Against the background of current debates on competence- and standard-based education from the sociology and history of education as well as from geography education, problem-centred interviews served to explore the perspectives of 15 German secondary school teachers on the alterations their Geography teaching suffered since the COVID-19 lockdown. Analytical categories were general challenges, communication with stakeholders, educational media usage, and the role of COVID-19 in geographical knowledge acquisition. The results uncovered, along with systemic challenges, two main areas in need of consideration to redefine subject-specific knowledge in times of competence-based education, namely geography teachers' professional identity and perspectives on the role of geographical competencies.","Bagoly-Simó, Péter; Hartmann, Johanna; Reinke, Verena",Tijdschr.

However, its severe imaging noise and streaking artifacts turn out to be a major issue in the low dose protocol. In this paper, we propose a dual-domain deep learning-based method that breaks through the limitations of currently prevailing algorithms that merely process single image slices. Since the scanned object usually contains a high degree of spatial continuity, the obtained consecutive imaging slices embody rich information that is largely unexplored. Therefore, we establish a cascade model named LS-AAE which aims to tackle the above problem. In addition, in order to adapt to the social trend of lightweight medical care, our model adopts the inverted residual with linear bottleneck in the module design to make it mobile and lightweight (reduce model parameters to one-eighth of its original) without sacrificing its performance. In our experiments, sparse sampling is conducted at intervals of 4{\deg}, 8{\deg} and 16{\deg}, which appears to be a challenging sparsity that few scholars have attempted before. Nevertheless, our method still exhibits its robustness and achieves the state-of-the-art performance by reaching the PSNR of 40.305 and the SSIM of 0.948, while ensuring high model mobility. Particularly, it still exceeds other current methods when the sampling rate is one-fourth of them, thereby demonstrating its remarkable superiority.","Liu, Yitong; Deng, Ken; Sun, Chang; Yang, Hongwen",,683,26

Subsequently, the question of how the cytokine spectrum is shaped and balanced in the pneumonia context remains a hot topic in medical immunology, particularly in the COVID19 pandemic era. The diversity in cytokine profiles, involved in pneumonia pathogenesis, is determined by the variations in cytokine-receptor interactions, which may lead to severe cytokine storm and functional decline of particular tissues and organs, for example, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Cytokines and their receptors form unique profiles in individual patients, depending on the (a) microenvironmental context (comorbidities and associated treatment), (b) lung monocyte heterogeneity, and (c) genetic variations. These multidisciplinary strategies can be proactively considered beforehand and during the pneumonia course and potentially allow the new age of personalized immunotherapy.","Dukhinova, Marina; Kokinos, Elena; Kuchur, Polina; Komissarov, Alexey; Shtro, Anna",Cytokine growth factor rev,683,1

We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1439 municipalities out of 1507 (95%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20th to April 16th and from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 µg/m3 in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58% and 34% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 µg/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO2 levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality. Our ecological study showed that exposure to PM was significantly associated with the COVID-19 incidence and excess mortality during the first wave of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.","De Angelis, Elena; Renzetti, Stefano; Volta, Marialuisa; Donato, Francesco; Calza, Stefano; Placidi, Donatella; Lucchini, Roberto G; Rota, Matteo",Environ Res,683,20

The proposed chain reactions target the complementary DNA (cDNA) of SARS-CoV-2, with loci corresponding to gold-standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) loci. Four hybridization chain reaction reactions are demonstrated herein, targeting N1/N2/N3 loci and human RNase P. The design of the hybridization chain reaction, herein, is assisted with an algorithm. The algorithm helps to search target sequences with low local secondary structure and high hybridization efficiency. The loop domain of the fuel hairpin molecule H1 and H2, which are the tunable segments in such reactions, are used as an optimization parameter to improve the hybridization efficiency of the chain reaction. The algorithm-derived HCR reactions were validated with gel electrophoresis. All proposed reactions exhibit a hybridization complex with a molecular mass >1.5k base pairs, which is clear evidence of chain reaction. The hybridization efficiency trend revealed by gel electrophoresis corresponds nicely to the simulated data from the algorithm.

The treatment of early glottic cancer includes radiotherapy, open surgery and laryngeal laser microsurgery. However, the preferred treatment for early glottic cancer is still controversial. OBJECTIVES: To study the factors affecting the 5-year survival rate of Tis-2N0M0 early glottis cancer and to demonstrate the oncological safety of different treatments. METHODS: 144 patients with early glottic cancer were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were clinically node negative. 53 patients underwent open surgery, transoral CO2 laser microsurgery in 46 cases and radiotherapy in 45 cases. The patients were followed up for 26â¯-â¯84 months, with an average follow-up period of 62.9 months. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival was 82.6%. The 5â¯year survival rates of open surgery, laser microsurgery and radiotherapy were 83.0%, 82.6% and 82.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival rate among the three treatments (pâ¯=â¯ 0.987). In multivariate analysis, age, T-stage, pathological grading, and anterior commissure involvement were important prognostic factors for early glottic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in 5â¯year survival rate among patients treated by either radiotherapy, laser microsurgery or open surgery for early glottic cancer. We urge more attention to the age, T-stage, pathological grade, and anterior commissure involvement of the patients.","Wang, Guanyu; Li, Guodong; Wu, Jianjun; Song, Penghui",Braz. j. otorhinolaryngol.

Nonetheless, the situation seems to be better controlled with the recent COVID-19 vaccines roll-out globally as active immunisation to prevent COVID-19. The extensive usage and trials done in recent outbreak in China has shown the effectiveness of traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) in improving the wellbeing of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment guidelines has listed a number of recommended concoctions meant for COVID-19 patients. Licorice, more commonly known as Gancao in Chinese Pinyin, is known as one of the most frequently used ingredients in TCM prescriptions for treatment of epidemic diseases. Interestingly, it is deemed as food ingredient as well, where it is normally used in Western cuisines' desserts and sweets. The surprising fact that licorice appeared in the top 10 main ingredients used in TCM prescriptions in COVID-19 has drawn great attention from researchers in revealing its biological potential in overcoming this disease. To date, there are no comprehensive review on licorice and its benefits when used in COVID-19. Thus, in this current review, the possible benefits, mechanism of actions, safety and limitations of licorice were explored in hope to provide a quick reference guide for its preclinical and clinical experimental set-up in this very critical moment of pandemic.","Ng, Swee Li; Khaw, Kooi-Yeong; Ong, Yong Sze; Goh, Hui Poh; Kifli, Nurolaini; Teh, Siew Phooi; Ming, Long Chiau; Kotra, Vijay; Goh, Bey Hing",J Evid Based Integr Med,683,24

However, some serology studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in the United States prior to that, as early as December 2019. The extent of domestic COVID-19 detection prior to 2020 has not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare users in the greater Seattle, Washington area from October 2019 through early April 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We tested residual samples from 766 Seattle-area adults for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies utilizing an ELISA against prefusion-stabilized Spike (S) protein. RESULTS: No antibody-positive samples were found between October 2, 2019 and March 13, 2020. Prevalence rose to 1.2% in late March and early April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples in October 2019 through mid-March, 2020, provides evidence against widespread circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare users in the Seattle area during that time. A small proportion of this metropolitan-area cohort had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by spring of 2020.","McCulloch, Denise J; Jackson, Michael L; Hughes, James P; Lester, Sandra; Mills, Lisa; Freeman, Brandi; Rasheed, Mohammad Ata Ur; Thornburg, Natalie J; Chu, Helen Y",PLoS One,683,15

Because dietary habits are one of the most important modifiable risk factors for inflammation, identification of dietary components associated with inflammation could play a significant role in controlling or reducing the risk of COVID-19. We investigated the inflammatory potential of diets consumed by African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) women of childbearing age (n = 509) who are at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 by being residents of Birmingham, Alabama, a city severely affected by this pandemic. The overall pro- and anti- inflammatory scores were calculated using dietary intake data gathered using Block food frequency questionnaire. The proinflammatory potential of diets consumed by AAs was significantly higher compared to CAs. Several anti- and proinflammatory nutrients and food groups consumed differed by race. With consumption of a greater number of antioxidants and B-vitamins, CAs switched toward an anti-inflammatory score more effectively than AAs while AAs performed better than CAs in improving the anti-inflammatory score with the consumption of a greater number of minerals and vitamin D. Effective race-specific dietary modifications or supplementation with nutrients identified will be useful to improve proinflammatory diets toward anti-inflammatory. This approach could aid in controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics of a similar nature in women at risk for exposure.","Piyathilake, Chandrika J; Badiga, Suguna; Chappell, Ashley R; Johanning, Gary L; Jolly, Pauline E",Nutr Res,683,15

Inference about the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model using data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, which takes into account undocumented infections and allows the epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from six states of the United States: Washington, New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois.

To date, our understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host innate immunity is still limited. Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) was able to suppress interferon-ß (IFN-ß) activation in IFN-ß promoter luciferase reporter assays, which provided insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN-ß promoter mediated luciferase activity was reduced during co-expression of NSP12. However, we could show NSP12 did not affect IRF3 or NF-&#954;B activation. Moreover, IFN-ß production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) infection or other stimulus was not affected by NSP12 at mRNA or protein level. Additionally, type I IFN signaling pathway was not affected by NSP12, as demonstrated by the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Further experiments revealed that different experiment systems, including protein tags and plasmid backbones, could affect the readouts of IFN-ß promoter luciferase assays. In conclusion, unlike previously reported, our study showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein is not an IFN-ß antagonist. It also rings the alarm on the general usage of luciferase reporter assays in studying SARS-CoV-2. Importance Previous studies investigated the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and interferon signaling, and proposed that several SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, including NSP12, could suppress IFN-ß activation. However, most of these results were generated from IFN-ß promoter luciferase reporter assay, and have not been validated functionally. In our study, we found that although NSP12 could suppress IFN-ß promoter luciferase activity, it showed no inhibitory effect on IFN-ß production or it downstream signaling. Further study revealed that contradictory results could generated from different experiment systems. On one hand, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 could not suppress IFN-ß signaling. On the other hand, our study suggests that cautions need to be taken with the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 related luciferase assays.","Li, Aixin; Zhao, Kaitao; Zhang, Bei; Hua, Rong; Fang, Yujie; Jiang, Wuhui; Zhang, Jing; Hui, Lixia; Zheng, Yingcheng; Li, Yan; Zhu, Chengliang; Wang, Pei-Hui; Peng, Ke; Xia, Yuchen",J Virol,683,20

The purpose of the present study was to describe non-respiratory symptoms of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Materials and Methods: All patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital, between 1 August and 30 September 2020, were included in this retrospective study. Data were extracted from medical records. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics at the initial presentation at the hospital were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 44.08 years (age range, 18-87 years) and 59.5% were male. The most common symptoms were fatigue in 60 (75.9%) patients, followed by fever (73.4%), myalgia (51.9%), cough (41.8%), anosmia (38%) and arthralgia (36.7%). The muscles of the upper back and the knee joint were the most painful anatomic region and joint, respectively. The laboratory findings on admission showed that D-dimer, CRP and procalcitonin levels were increased, without significant gender differences (p > 0.05). Chest imaging demonstrated pneumonia in 20 (25.3%) patients. Conclusions: Our results indicate that from the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 patients, musculoskeletal symptoms, such as fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia, were present in three-quarters of all patients. These findings could help elaborate updated triage and admission protocols for suspect COVID-19 patients at the hospital and Emergency Department presentation.","Vasiliadis, Angelo V; Tsatlidou, Maria; Metaxiotis, Dimitrios; Psomiadis, Charalampos; Beletsiotis, Anastasios; Arvaniti, Kostoula",Medicina (Kaunas),683,25

METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study included 406 patients [57% male, aged 56 years] with COVID-19 hospitalized in 26 centers in Brazil. Overall, 36.7% (95% CI 32.1-41.5) presented at admission with severe disease requiring respiratory support. The prevalence of elevated ALT and AST levels at admission [> 2 × ULN] was 14.0% (95% CI 11.0-17.8) and 12.9% (95% CI 10.0-16.6), respectively. Sixty-two patients [15.3% (95% CI 12.1-19.1)] died during hospitalization and the overall mortality rate was 13.4 (10.5-17.2) deaths per 1000 persons-years. The 15-day-overall survival (95% CI) was significantly lower in patients with ALT levels &#8805; 2 × ULN compared to those with ALT < 2 × ULN [67.1% (48.4-80.2) vs 83.4% (76.1-88.6), p = 0.001] and in those with AST levels &#8805; 2 × ULN compared to those with AST < 2 × ULN [61.5% (44.7-74.6) vs 84.2% (76.5-89.5), p < 0.001]. The presence of elevated aminotransferases levels at hospital admission significantly increased the risk of in-hospital all-cause mortality adjusted for age-and-sex. Those findings were present in the subgroup of critically ill patients already admitted in need of respiratory support (n = 149), but not in patients without that requirement at admission (n = 257). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated aminotransferases at hospital admission predicted in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with severe disease. Measurement of transaminases levels at hospital admission should be integrated to the care of patients with COVID-19 as an auxiliary strategy to identify patients at higher death risk.","Pozzobon, Fernanda Manhães; Perazzo, Hugo; Bozza, Fernando Augusto; Rodrigues, Rosana Souza; de Mello Perez, Renata; Chindamo, Maria Chiara",Hepatol. int.

Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. The relative infection risk in a given environment scales with excess CO2 level, and thus, keeping CO2 as low as feasible in a space allows optimization of the protection provided by ventilation. We show that the CO2 level corresponding to a given absolute infection risk varies by &gt;2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring. ©","Peng, Z.; Jimenez, J.

Hospitals in the French Territories in the Americas (FTA) work according to international and French standards. This paper aims to describe different aspects of critical care in the FTA. For this, we reviewed official information about population size and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity in the FTA and literature on FTA ICU specificities. Persons living in or visiting the FTA are exposed to specific risks, mainly severe road traffic injuries, envenoming, stab or ballistic wounds, and emergent tropical infectious diseases. These diseases may require specific knowledge and critical care management. However, there are not enough ICU beds in the FTA. Indeed, there are 7.2 ICU beds/100 000 population in Guadeloupe, 7.2 in Martinique, and 4.5 in French Guiana. In addition, seriously ill patients in remote areas regularly have to be transferred, most often by helicopter, resulting in a delay in admission to intensive care. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the health care system in the FTA is unready to face such an epidemic and that intensive care bed capacity must be increased. In conclusion, the critical care sector in the FTA requires upgrading of infrastructure, human resources, and equipment as well as enhancement of multidisciplinary care. Also needed are promotion of training, research, and regional and international medical and scientific cooperation.","Kallel, Hatem; Resiere, Dabor; Houcke, Stéphanie; Hommel, Didier; Pujo, Jean Marc; Martino, Frederic; Carles, Michel; Mehdaoui, Hossein; Medicine, Antilles-Guyane Association of Critical Care",Rev. panam. salud pública,683,24

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has multiple potential pathophysiologic interconnections with endocrine systems, potentially causing disturbances in glucose metabolism, hypothalamic and pituitary function, adrenal function and mineral metabolism. A growing body of data is revealing both the effects of underlying endocrine disorders on COVID-19 disease outcome and the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on endocrine systems. However, comprehensive assessment of the relationship to endocrine disorders in children has been lacking. Content: In this review, we present the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on endocrine systems and review the current literature on complications of COVID-19 disease in underlying paediatric endocrine disorders. We provide recommendations on management of endocrinopathies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population. Summary and outlook: With the surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is important for paediatric endocrinologists to be aware of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the endocrine system and management considerations for patients with underlying disorders who develop COVID-19 disease. While children and adults share some risk factors that influence risk of complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is becoming clear that responses in the paediatric population are distinct and outcomes from adult studies cannot be extrapolated. Evidence emerging from paediatric studies provides some guidance but highlights the need for more research in this area.","Miller, Ryan; Ashraf, Ambika P; Gourgari, Evgenia; Gupta, Anshu; Kamboj, Manmohan K; Kohn, Brenda; Lahoti, Amit; Mak, Daniel; Mehta, Shilpa; Mitchell, Deborah; Patel, Neha; Raman, Vandana; Reynolds, Danielle G; Yu, Christine; Krishnan, Sowmya",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,683,27

Their accuracy is examined by comparing them to the analytical solution. We used a machine learning framework like PyTorch to implement PINNs. PINNs approach allows training neural networks while respecting the PDEs as a strong constraint in the optimization as apposed to making them part of the loss function. In standard small-scale circulation simulations, it is shown that the conventional approach incorporates a pseudo diffusive effect that is almost as large as the effect of the turbulent diffusion model; hence the numerical solution is rendered inconsistent with the PDEs. This oscillation causes inaccuracy and computational uncertainty. Of all the schemes tested, only the PINNs approximation accurately predicted the outcome. We assume that the PINNs approach can transform the physics simulation area by allowing real-time physics simulation and geometry optimization without costly and time-consuming simulations on large supercomputers.","Vadyala, Shashank Reddy; Betgeri, Sai Nethra",,683,16

Positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates and placental tissue have been reported, and immunoglobulin M antibodies have been detected in neonates born to mothers with infection. CASES: The first case is a woman at 22 3/7 weeks of gestation with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who was admitted to the intensive care unit. In the second case, the patient remained at home with mild symptoms, starting at 20 weeks of gestation. In both cases, fetal skin edema was observed on ultrasound examination while maternal SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test results were positive and resolved when maternal SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test results became negative. The RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid was negative in both cases. The two pregnancies are ongoing and uneventful. CONCLUSION: Transient fetal skin edema noted in these two patients with COVID-19 in the second trimester may represent results of fetal infection or altered fetal physiology due to maternal disease or may be unrelated to the maternal illness.","Garcia-Manau, Pablo; Garcia-Ruiz, Itziar; Rodo, Carlota; Sulleiro, Elena; Maiz, Nerea; Catalan, Marina; Fernández-Hidalgo, Nuria; Balcells, Joan; Antón, Andrés; Carreras, Elena; Suy, Anna",Obstet Gynecol,683,3

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the longitudinal association between HGS and risk of depressive symptoms. METHODS: PubMed, PSYCINFO and EMBASE databases were searched for eligible publications up to April 2020. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects model. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's test and the funnel plot. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of eligible studies. RESULTS: The present meta-analysis included 8 cohort studies with 30,727 participants. Overall, higher HGS was related to a decreased risk of depressive symptoms: the pooled risk ratio (RR) of 0.74 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.65-0.85] with a moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 60.5%, P = 0.013). HGS was significantly associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in males (RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94), but not in females. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HGS was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms.

Given these concerns, we investigated whether the pandemic affected visits to family physicians differently across sociodemographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from family physician practices within the University of Toronto Practice-Based Research Network. We evaluated primary care visits for a fixed cohort of patients who were active within the database as of Jan. 1, 2019, to estimate the number of patients who visited their family physician (visitor rate) and the number of distinct visits (visit volume) between Jan. 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. We compared trends in visitor rate and visit volume during the pandemic (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2020) with the same period in the previous year (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2019) across sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, neighbourhood income, material deprivation and ethnic concentration. RESULTS: We included 365 family physicians and 372 272 patients. Compared with the previous year, visitor rates during the pandemic period dropped by 34.5%, from 357 visitors per 1000 people to 292 visitors per 1000 people. Declines in visit volume during the pandemic were less pronounced (21.8% fewer visits), as the mean number of visits per patient increased during the pandemic (from 1.64 to 1.96). The declines in visitor rate and visit volume varied based on patient age and sex, but not socioeconomic status. INTERPRETATION: Although the number of visits to family physicians dropped substantially during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, patients from communities with low socioeconomic status did not appear to be disproportionately affected. In this primary care setting, the pandemic appears not to have worsened socioeconomic disparities in access to care.","Stephenson, Ellen; O039,; Neill, Braden; Gronsbell, Jessica; Butt, Debra A; Crampton, Noah; Ji, Catherine; Kalia, Sumeet; Meaney, Christopher; Tu, Karen",CMAJ Open,683,16

The aim of this study was to longitudinally assess symptoms of (un-)specific anxiety and depression along different stages of the pandemic to generate knowledge about the progress of psychological consequences of the pandemic and to test the role of potential risk and resilience factors that were derived from cross-sectional studies and official recommendations. METHODS: The present study uses a longitudinal observational design with four waves of online data collection (from March 27 to June 15, 2020) in a convenience sample of the general population in Germany. A total of N = 2376 participants that completed at least two waves of the survey were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: Specific COVID-19-related anxiety and the average daily amount of preoccupation with the pandemic decreased continuously over the four waves. Unspecific worrying and depressive symptoms decreased on average but not on median level. Self-efficacy, normalization, maintaining social contacts, and knowledge, where to get medical support, were associated with fewer symptoms relative to baseline. Suppression, unhealthy habits, and a longer average daily time of thinking about the pandemic were correlated with a relative increase of symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide insight into the longitudinal changes of symptoms of psychological distress along the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Furthermore, we were able to reaffirm the anticipated protective and risk factors that were extracted from previous studies and recommendations.","Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Kunas, Stefanie; Wyka, Sarah; Ströhle, Andreas; Petzold, Moritz Bruno",Brain Behav,683,10

ACE2 protein is expressed highly in the testis. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare male reproductive hormones such as total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulant hormone (FSH), and prolactin between patients with COVID-19, age-matched cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection, and age-matched controls. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study and included 262 men aged between 20 and 65 years. The study comprised 3 groups including patients with COVID-19 (n = 89), cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection (n = 30), and age-matched controls (n = 143). All cases were evaluated using TT, LH, FSH, and prolactin. Correlations between TT and clinical parameters of patient groups were investigated using Pearson's correlation test. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of the study was detection of the difference of TT, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels between the groups. Secondary outcome was to correlate TT and hospitalization time and oxygen saturation on hospital admission (SpO2) of patients. RESULTS: The mean age of study groups was 49.9 ± 12.5 years, 52.7 ± 9.6 years, and 50 ± 7.8 years, respectively (P = .06). Serum TT levels was median 185.52 ng/dL in patients with COVID-19, median 288.67 ng/dL in patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection and median 332 ng/dL in control cases, (P < .0001). The proportion of patients with testosterone deficiency in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 74.2%, 53.3%, and 37.8%, respectively (P < .0001). Serum LH levels (P = 0.0003) and serum prolactin levels (P = .0007) were higher in patients with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection than control cases. Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlation between serum TT levels and hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19 (r = -0.45, P < .0001). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between SpO2 and serum TT levels in patients with COVID-19 ( r = 0.32, P = .0028). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physicians may consider to evaluate male patients with COVID-19 for concomitant androgen deficiency. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include the evidence about the alteration of male reproductive hormones under COVID-19. Limitations include the analysis limited to one general hospital, only a single measurement of TT was available, free and bioavailable testosterone levels were not evaluated. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates COVID-19 is associated with decreased level of TT and increased level of LH and prolactin. More serious COVID-19 causes more reduction in TT levels and prolongs hospitalization period. M Kadihasanoglu, S Aktas, E Yardimci, et al.

In this context, it was necessary to create tools that could aid healthcare facilities in evaluating their HCWM. Therefore, the objective of this article was to elaborate a support tool that helps in identifying the shortcomings of hospitals' HCWM. For this purpose, the Health Service Waste Management Index was developed based on the selection of indicators in the area. The index was applied to six hospitals in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Its application meet the purpose of this research, since the results in the form of an index objectively summarize the reality of the HCWM in healthcare facilities. From the six hospitals investigated, four were classified as highly efficient. However, even though most of them were well evaluated, they still have difficulties with properly training their employees, which can be even a worse problem during a pandemic, when every precaution is extremely important to reduce the spread of the disease. Therefore, beyond this article contribution related to sustainability by demanding the hospitals to check which points of HCWM should be improved, it also adds academically by developing a tool with indicators that evaluate operational, human, economic and environmental factors in an innovative way.","de Aguiar Hugo, Andreza; Lima, Renato da Silva",Waste Manag Res,683,16

The level of bargaining power of workers, the elasticity of the supply of labor to wage in the secondary market, and the composition of the workforce are the main factors in explaining the flattening of the Phillips curve. We argue that the changes we consider in the model, in fact, has plausibly made the Phillips curve flat in recent years.","Aoyama, Hideaki; Guilmi, Corrado Di; Fujiwara, Yoshi; Yoshikawa, Hiroshi",,683,19

AI is increasingly being deployed across multiple domains. In response, a plethora of ethical guidelines and principles for general AI use have been published, with some convergence about which ethical concepts are relevant to this new technology. However, few of these frameworks are healthcare-specific, and there has been limited examination of actual AI applications in healthcare. Our ethical evaluation identifies context- and case-specific healthcare ethical issues for two applications, and investigates the extent to which the general ethical principles for AI-assisted healthcare expressed in existing frameworks capture what is most ethically relevant from the perspective of healthcare ethics. We provide a detailed description and analysis of two AI-based systems for clinical decision support (Painchek® and IDx-DR). Our results identify ethical challenges associated with potentially deceptive promissory claims, lack of patient and public involvement in healthcare AI development and deployment, and lack of attention to the impact of AIs on healthcare relationships. Our analysis also highlights the close connection between evaluation and technical development and reporting. Critical appraisal frameworks for healthcare AIs should include explicit ethical evaluation with benchmarks.

BACKGROUND: In Italy, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was registered on 21 February 2020. As of 20 April, about 250 000 cases were registered, 1143 of which were in the province of Pescara. METHODS: We compared transfusion services provided by the blood centre of Pescara between 1 March and 20 April 2019 and between 1 March and 20 April 2020. We assessed the number and type of blood components donated, those transfused in the various hospital departments and those transfused to Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, we documented a decrease of 32% in the number of donations. The number of transfusions increased by 139% in the infectious diseases department (IDD), dedicated to Covid-19 patients, and by 76% in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas it markedly decreased in the other departments. Of 299 patients with Covid-19, 60 were transfused (20.1%). Transfused patients in the ICU were significantly younger than those in IDD and had a lower number of lymphocytes, lower post-transfusion increment of haemoglobin levels and higher D-dimer and C reactive protein values. Mortality rate was 60.7% among transfused patients in the ICU and 39.0% among those in the IDD (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 epidemic had a profound impact on transfusion activities. The important blood demand for Covid-19 patients was satisfied because of the reduction in activities in other hospital wards. Covid-19-positive transfused patients showed a very poor prognosis.","Quaglietta, Anna; Nicolucci, Antonio; Posata, Raffaella; Frattari, Antonella; Parruti, Giustino; Accorsi, Patrizia",Transfus. med,683,16

Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples. METHODS: A virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS (without enrichment) and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted. RESULTS: The VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also points to the risk of cross-contamination between samples. CONCLUSIONS: The VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector, or research question. The risk of cross-contamination needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user friendly, and even non-experts can easily use the VirBaits workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible as shown for SARS-CoV-2.

Among the 241 screened employees, 32 (13.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 carriers and non-carriers did not differ in term of gender, age or type of staff. Staff carrying SARS-CoV-2 were strictly asymptomatic in 75% of cases while during the days following or before the test, 25% presented mild symptoms of COVID-19. Considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, 66 out of 281 (23.5%) of the home employees had been carriers for COVID-19. Conclusion: Screening for viral carriage of asymptomatic staff in nursing homes can avoid contact and transmission to frequently severely vulnerable residents.","Bayle, Catherine; Cantin, Delphine; Vidal, Jean-Sebastien; Sourdeau, Elise; Slama, Laurence; Dumesges, Nicolas; Trombert, Sabine; Ayllon, Sonia; Nguyen, Jean-Marie; Slama, Dorsaf; Medaghecha, Mohamed; Hanon, Olivier; Salmon, Dominique",,683,15

The immunosuppressive therapy used in heart transplant patients, in theory, could reduce inflammation, thus benefitting patients with COVID-19. So far, however, there is still very little literature on this subject. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study. We described laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes from 11 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 assisted at Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology between March and July 2020. RESULTS: Patients with ages of between 35 and 79 years were enrolled, and heart transplantation ranged from 3 to 264 months. The main comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (9/11; 81.8%), hypertension (10/11; 90.9%), and chronic renal disease (6/11; 54.5%). Cyclosporine A was used in 10 (90.9%) patients, mycophenolate mofetil in 9 (81.8%) patients, and mTOR inhibitor in 5 (45.5%) patients. Fever and cough were observed in 8 (72.7%) patients, and dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms in 5 (45.5%) patients. Lymphopenia was observed in 10 (90.9%) patients and thrombocytopenia in 5 (45.5%) patients. The higher level of troponin associated with chest tomography above 50% of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with ground-glass opacity (GGO) was observed in those with the worst outcomes. Nine patients needed intensive care, and hospital stay ranged from 4 to 21 days, with 2 (18.2%) patients requiring vasopressor drugs and mechanical ventilation, and three (27.3%) patients dying due to COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSION: Heart transplant patients had similar symptoms and outcomes as the general population; immunosuppressive therapy seems not to have protected them. Patients who presented higher levels of troponin and D-dimer, associated with greater GGO pulmonary infiltrates, had worse outcomes. More studies with larger cohorts may clarify immunosuppressive effects on COVID-19 outcomes.","Miranda Soriano, Rafaela Vale de; Rossi Neto, Joao Manoel; Finger, Marco Aurelio; Santos, Carolina Casadei Dos; Lin-Wang, Hui Tzu",Clin Transplant,683,32

METHODS: Anonymized movement data accounting for roughly 10% of devices in the United States at 138,989 unhealthy eating locations from December 1st 2019 through April 2020 and the percentage of adults with obesity, the poverty rate, and the food environment index in 65% of United States counties were collected and merged. A cluster corrected Poisson spline regression was performed predicting patronage by day, the percentage of adults with obesity in the establishment's county, the county's poverty rate, and its food environment index, as well as their interactions. RESULTS: Patronage to unhealthy eating establishments was higher where there was a higher percentage of the adult population with obesity. A similar pattern was observed for counties with a lower food environment index. These disparities appear to have increased as the COVID-19 pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest unhealthy eating patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are higher in already at-risk populations. Policy makers can use these findings to motivate interventions and programs aimed at increasing healthy food intake in at-risk communities during crises.","Ashby, Nathaniel J S",Obesity (Silver Spring),683,24

Given the long history of the comorbidity of alcohol and nicotine use, the rising prevalence of ECs raises the question as to their role in the consumption of alcohol. Of the numerous models of ECs available, JUUL is the most popular. This narrative review aims to determine current trends in literature regarding the relationship between EC and alcohol dual use, as well as hypothesize potential pathogenic tissue damage and summarize areas for future study, including second-hand vapor exposure and calling for standardization among studies. In summary, EC users are more likely to participate in hazardous drinking and are at higher risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We surmise the pathogenic damage of dual use may exhibit an additive effect, particularly in pathogen clearance from the lungs, increased inflammation and decreased immune response, physical damage to epithelial cells, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like illnesses. A better understanding of pathogenic damages is critical to understand the risks placed on dual users when exposed to respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Wetzel, Tanner J; Wyatt, Todd A",Front Physiol,683,24

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is high; as a result, countries worldwide have imposed rigorous public health measures, such as quarantine. This has involved the suspension of medical school classes globally. Medical school attachments are vital to aid the progression of students' confidence and competencies as future physicians. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, medical schools have sought ways to replace medical placements with virtual clinical teaching. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the advantages and disadvantages of virtual medical teaching for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the current emerging literature. METHODS: A brief qualitative review based on the application and effectiveness of virtual teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted by referencing keywords, including medical student virtual teaching COVID-19, virtual undergraduate medical education, and virtual medical education COVID-19, in the electronic databases of PubMed and Google Scholar. A total of 201 articles were found, of which 34 were included in the study. Manual searches of the reference lists of the included articles yielded 5 additional articles. The findings were tabulated and assessed under the following headings: summary of virtual teaching offered, strengths of virtual teaching, and weaknesses of virtual teaching. RESULTS: The strengths of virtual teaching included the variety of web-based resources available. New interactive forms of virtual teaching are being developed to enable students to interact with patients from their homes. Open-access teaching with medical experts has enabled students to remain abreast of the latest medical advancements and to reclaim knowledge lost by the suspension of university classes and clinical attachments.

The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. PURPOSE: To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. RESULTS: Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of ""burden of taking care of patients"" and ""worries about social isolation"" earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, ""worrying about infecting family members and friends"" and ""worrying about being separated from family after being infected"" earned the two highest scores (2.35 ± 0.79 and 2.17 ± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 ± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 ± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 ± 0.92) and depression (1.12 ± 0.94).

The current study is the first nationwide representative study to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health of children and adolescents in Germany from the perspective of children themselves. A representative online survey was conducted among n = 1586 families with 7- to 17-year-old children and adolescents between May 26 and June 10. The survey included internationally established and validated instruments for measuring HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10), mental health problems (SDQ), anxiety (SCARED), and depression (CES-DC). Results were compared with data from the nationwide, longitudinal, representative BELLA cohort study (n = 1556) conducted in Germany before the pandemic. Two-thirds of the children and adolescents reported being highly burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced significantly lower HRQoL (40.2% vs. 15.3%), more mental health problems (17.8% vs. 9.9%) and higher anxiety levels (24.1% vs. 14.9%) than before the pandemic. Children with low socioeconomic status, migration background and limited living space were affected significantly more.

To fill this knowledge gap, we used an inducible mouse model for olfactory inflammation and showed the evidence that this local pathological factor can elicit behavioral abnormalities.","Hasegawa, Yuto; Namkung, Ho; Smith, Amy; Sakamoto, Shinji; Zhu, Xiaolei; Ishizuka, Koko; Lane, Andrew P; Sawa, Akira; Kamiya, Atsushi",Neurosci. res,683,22

A mental health crisis as a second wave has begun to emerge in our front-line health care workers. OBJECTIVE: To address these needs, The Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, based on crisis intervention principles, was developed and launched in 2 weeks. METHODS: Upon reflection of why this worked, we decided it might be useful to describe what we now recognize as 13-steps which led to our success. The process included the following: (1) anticipate mental health needs; (2) use leadership capable of mobilizing the systems and resources; (3) convene a multidisciplinary team; (4) delegate tasks and set timelines; (5) choose a clinical service model; (6) motivate staff as a workforce of volunteers; (7) develop training and educational materials; (8) develop personal, local, and national resources; (9) develop marketing plans; (10) deliver the training; (11) launch a 24 hr/7days per week Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, and launch follow-up sessions for staff; (12) structure data collection to determine effectiveness and outcomes; and (13) obtain funding (not required). DISCUSSION: We believe the process we used is specifically useful for others who may want to develop a COVID-19 hotline services for health care workers and generally useful for the development of other mental health services.

Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients aged under 18 years who were confirmed as coronavirus disease-2019 between March 11, and June 23, 2020, and were admitted to our hospitals was conducted. Results: A total of 220 pediatric patients with coronavirus disease-2019 were evaluated, of which 48.2% were boys, with a median age of 10 years, and 9.5% had underlying diseases. Patients were classified according to severity, with the percentages of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and critical/severe cases determined to be 25.5%, 45%, 26.8%, and 2.7%, respectively. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required in two patients (0.9%) and mechanical ventilation in three (1.4%). Targeted therapies were used in six patients (2.7%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (one patient) or in combination with favipiravir (five patients). Two patients (0.9%) died, and nine (4.1%) were still hospitalized during the study period.

Imminently practical areas, such as pathology, have made traditional teaching based on conventional microscopy more flexible through the synergies of computational tools and image digitization, not only to improve teaching-learning but also to offer alternatives to repetitive and exhaustive histopathological analyzes. In this context, machine learning algorithms capable of recognizing histological patterns in kidney biopsy slides have been developed and validated with a view to building computational models capable of accurately identifying renal pathologies. In practice, the use of such algorithms can contribute to the universalization of teaching, allowing quality training even in regions where there is a lack of good nephropathologists. The purpose of this work is to describe and test the functionality of SmartPathk, a tool to support teaching of glomerulopathies using machine learning. The training for knowledge acquisition was performed automatically by machine learning methods using the J48 algorithm to create a computational model of an appropriate decision tree. RESULTS: An intelligent system, SmartPathk, was developed as a complementary remote tool in the teaching-learning process for pathology teachers and their students (undergraduate and graduate students), showing 89,47% accuracy using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. CONCLUSION: This artificial intelligence system can assist in teaching renal pathology to increase the training capacity of new medical professionals in this area.","Aldeman, Nayze Lucena Sangreman; de Sá Urtiga Aita, Keylla Maria; Machado, Vinícius Ponte; da Mata Sousa, Luiz Claudio Demes; Coelho, Antonio Gilberto Borges; da Silva, Adalberto Socorro; da Silva Mendes, Ana Paula; de Oliveira Neres, Francisco Jair; do Monte, Semíramis Jamil Hadad",BMC Med Educ,683,13

Cross-sectoral communication is pivotal. Involvement of patients may add to intended mechanisms.A randomised controlled trial 'The Partnership Study' tested the effect of bringing together patient, general practitioner (GP) and oncologist for a consultation conducted by video. PURPOSE: As part of the process evaluation, this study aimed to explore experiences, attitudes and perspectives of the oncological department on sharing patient consultations with GPs using video. METHODS: Four semistructured interviews with five oncologists and four nurse specialists were conducted in February 2020. We focused on the informants' experiences and reflections on the potential of future implementation of the concept 'inviting the GP for a shared consultation by video'. The analyses were based on an inductive, open-minded, hermeneutic phenomenological approach. RESULTS: A total of six overall themes were identified: structuring consultation and communication, perceptions of GP involvement in cancer care, stressors, making a difference, alternative ways of cross-sector communication and needs for redesigning the model. The concept made sense and was deemed useful, but solving the many technical and organisational problems is pivotal. Case-specific tasks and relational issues were targeted by pragmatically rethinking protocol expectations and the usual way of communication and structuring patient encounters. Case selection was discussed as one way of maturing the concept. CONCLUSION: This Danish study adds new insight into understanding different aspects of the process, causal mechanisms as well as the potential of future implementation of video-based tripartite encounters. Beyond solving the technical problems, case selection and organisational issues are important. Acknowledging the disruption of the usual workflow, the introduction of new phases of the usual encounter and the variety of patient-GP relationships to be embraced may help to better understand and comply with barriers and facilitators of communication and sharing.

METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 1,459 health care professionals. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analysed with descriptive and multiple linear regression methods. RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p < .001) were identified between all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with each other and both negatively with psychological distress. So, health care professionals, despite presenting psychological distress, perceive their work satisfactorily and positively despite the severity of the situation and the harsh conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Sense of coherence and work engagement are protective factors against psychological distress.

The following manuscript is a commentary article to the recent study by Fox et al, who aimed at investigating the concerns of patients with regard to participating to cancer research, as well as examining potential gender disparities within their sample population. We provide a brief critique of their work, especially focusing on important limitations concerning sample size and under-representation of ethnic minority groups, before discussing their findings in light of current literature on gender differences in anxiety and risk perception, how this might be interpreted in the context of the current pandemic, and its impact on participation in cancer research. We present multiple lines of evidence which support the idea that women might experience greater anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which could have a significant impact on cancer research participation and consequently the external validity of studies in the field. The first attempts to tackle these challenges have shown promise, but further research is required to perfect this process and target those groups who are at greatest need of intervention.","Magni, Francesco; Jhala, Meenakshi; Harky, Amer",Cancer Control,683,26

Here we examined a wide range of cognitive functions critical for daily life (including sustained attention, memory, motor control, planning, semantic reasoning, mental rotation and spatial-visual attention) in people who had previously suffered from COVID-19 but were not significantly different from a control group on self-reported fatigue, forgetfulness, sleep abnormality, motivation, depression, anxiety and personality profile. COVID-19 survivors displayed significantly worse episodic memory (up to 6 months post infection) and greater decline in vigilance and motivation with time on task (for up to 9 months). Overall, the results show that chronic cognitive impairments following COVID-19 are evident on objective testing even amongst those who do not report a greater symptom burden. Importantly, in the sample tested here, these were not significantly different from normal after six-nine months, demonstrating evidence of recovery over time.","Zhao, Sijia; Shibata, Kengo; Hellyer, Peter J.; Trender, William; Manohar, Sanjay; Hampshire, Adam; Husain, Masud",,683,16

It is known to disproportionately impact certain communities due to both biological susceptibility and inequitable exposure. In this study, we investigate the most important health, social, and environmental factors impacting the early phases (before July, 2020) of per capita COVID-19 transmission and per capita all-cause mortality in US counties. We aggregate county-level physical and mental health, environmental pollution, access to health care, demographic characteristics, vulnerable population scores, and other epidemiological data to create a large feature set to analyze per capita COVID-19 outcomes. Because of the high-dimensionality, multicollinearity, and unknown interactions of the data, we use ensemble machine learning and marginal prediction methods to identify the most salient factors associated with several COVID-19 outbreak measure. Our variable importance results show that measures of ethnicity, public transportation and preventable diseases are the strongest predictors for both per capita COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Specifically, the CDC measures for minority populations, CDC measures for limited English, and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county were the most important features for per capita COVID-19 cases within a month after the pandemic started in a county and also at the latest date examined. For per capita all-cause mortality at day 100 and total to date, we find that public transportation use and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county are the strongest predictors. The methods predict that, keeping all other factors fixed, a 10% increase in public transportation use, all other factors remaining fixed at the observed values, is associated with increases mortality at day 100 of 2012 individuals (95% CI [1972, 2356]) and likewise a 10% increase in the proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county is associated with increases total deaths at end of study of 2067 (95% CI [1189, 2654]). Using data until the end of study, the same metric suggests ethnicity has double the association as the next most important factors, which are location, disease prevalence, and transit factors. Our findings shed light on societal patterns that have been reported and experienced in the U.S. by using robust methods to understand the features most responsible for transmission and sectors of society most vulnerable to infection and mortality. In particular, our results provide evidence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority populations. Our results suggest that mitigation measures, including how vaccines are distributed, could have the greatest impact if they are given with priority to the highest risk communities.","McCoy, David; Mgbara, Whitney; Horvitz, Nir; Getz, Wayne M; Hubbard, Alan",Sci Rep,683,1

The intrinsic unequal relationships of such kind, however, are opaque or hidden in numerous real systems.For instance, when a node in a network with limited interaction capacity spends its capacity to its neighboring nodes, the allocation of the total amount of interactions to them can be vastly diverse. Even if such potentially heterogeneous interactions epitomized by weighted networks are observable, as a result of the aforementioned ego-centric allocation of interactions, the relative importance or dependency between two interacting nodes can only be implicitly accessible. In this work, we precisely pinpoint such relative dependency by proposing the framework to discover hidden dependent relations extracted from weighted networks. For a given weighted network, we provide a systematic criterion to select the most essential interactions for individual nodes based on the concept of information entropy. The criterion is symbolized by assigning the effective number of neighbors or the effective out-degree to each node, and the resultant directed subnetwork decodes the hidden dependent relations by leaving only the most essential directed interactions. We apply our methodology to two time-stamped empirical network data, namely the international trade relations between nations in the world trade web (WTW) and the network of people in the historical record of Korea, Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD). Based on the data analysis, we discover that the properties of mutual dependency encoded in the two systems are vastly different.","Lee, Mi Jin; Lee, Eun; Lee, Byunghwee; Jeong, Hawoong; Lee, Deok-Sun; Lee, Sang Hoon",,683,16

The relative average error in estimates of the number of flies by mobile app is about 2% in comparison with the manual counting and the processing time is 6 times shorter.

To assess its impact, we measured changes in physical activity and sleep among community-dwelling older adults, from pre-to post-pandemic declaration. METHOD: Physical activity and sleep in older adults (n = 10, age = 77.3 ± 1.9 years, female = 40%) were remotely assessed within 3-month pre-to 6-month post-pandemic declaration using a pendant-wearable system. Depression was assessed pre-and post-pandemic declaration using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and was compared with 48 h continuous physical activity monitoring data before and during pandemic. RESULTS: Compared to pre-pandemic, post-pandemic time spent in standing declined by 32.7% (Cohen's d = 0.78, p < 0.01), walking by 52.2% (d = 1.1, p < 0.01), step-counts by 55.1% (d = 1.0, p = 0.016), and postural transitions by 44.6% (d = 0.82, p = 0.017) with increase in sitting duration by 20.5% (d = 0.5, p = 0.049). Depression symptoms increased by 150% (d = 0.8, p = 0.046). Interestingly, increase in depression was significantly correlated with unbroken-prolong sitting bout (&#961; = 0.677, p = 0.032), cadence (&#961; = -0.70, p = 0.024), and sleep duration (&#961; = -0.72, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: This is one of the early longitudinal studies highlighting adverse effect of the pandemic on objectively assessed physical activity and sleep in older adults. Our observations showed need for timely intervention to mitigate hard to reverse consequences of decreased physical activity such as depression.","Mishra, Ramkinker; Park, Catherine; York, Michele K; Kunik, Mark E; Wung, Shu-Fen; Naik, Aanand D; Najafi, Bijan",Sensors (Basel),683,16

A concern is that this creates a circumstance, where the possibility of supporting self-transcendence in a wider population will become excluding in this complexity. In this paper, we have undertaken a critical summary review focused primarily on historical foundations of the concept of self-transcendence, and key theoretical approaches in which self-transcendence and self-transcendent experiences are discussed with the motive of finding a clarity to understanding self-transcendence and the pathways towards it.

We provide here the framework for using NLP models to measure ToM expressed in written texts. For this purpose, we introduce ToM-Diary, a crowdsourced 18,238 diaries with 74,014 Korean sentences annotated with different ToM levels. Each diary was annotated with ToM levels by trained psychology students and reviewed by selected psychology experts. The annotators first divided the diaries based on whether they mentioned other people: self-focused and other-focused. Examples of self-focused sentences are""I am feeling good"". The other-focused sentences were further classified into different levels. These levels differ by whether the writer 1) mentions the presence of others without inferring their mental state(e.g., I saw a man walking down the street), 2) fails to take the perspective of others (e.g., I don't understand why they refuse to wear masks), or 3) successfully takes the perspective of others (It must have been hard for them to continue working). We tested whether state-of-the-art transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) could predict underlying ToM levels in sentences. We found that BERT more successfully detected self-focused sentences than other-focused ones. Sentences that successfully take the perspective of others (the highest ToM level) were the most difficult to predict. Our study suggests a promising direction for large-scale and computational approaches for identifying the ability of authors to empathize and take the perspective of others.

Some centers continued elective surgery, including esophageal cancer surgery, with the use of preoperative screening methods; however, there is no evidence supporting the safety of this strategy as postoperative outcomes after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been investigated. METHODS: This multicenter study in four European tertiary esophageal cancer referral centers included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery from a prospectively maintained database in a COVID-19 pandemic cohort (1 March 2020-31 May 2020) and a control cohort (1 October 2019-29 February 2020). The primary outcome was the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The COVID-19 cohort consisted of 139 patients, versus 168 patients in the control cohort. There was no difference in the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (13.7% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.127) and number of pulmonary complications (32.4% vs. 29.9%, p = 0.646) between the COVID-19 cohort and the control cohort. Overall, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were comparable between both cohorts.

We are cognizant that pandemic can be controlled with dedicated contributions from all involved in the healthcare profession. Therefore, it is important to know the pandemic and application of knowledge by the medical students to formulate a further line of management in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: We aimed toinvestigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 and its impact on medical students of Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020 by a validated self-administered questionnaire. The survey instrument was tailored from a published questionnaire comprised of questions on demographics (6), knowledge (14), attitudes (4), and practices (6). RESULTS: Of the 1474 medical students in the study, 576(39.1%) were males, and 898(60.1%) were females. Two-thirds of the participants 1057(71.7%) had adequate knowledge, and almost all the students had positive attitudes (1363(92.5%), and good practices 1406(95.4%) to COVID-19. Two-thirds of the medical students 1023(69%) believed that the COVID-19 outbreak had affected their social, mental, and psychological well-being. One-quarter of the medical students 391(26%) become more religious, 597(40%) realized the importance of life, and 1140(77%) became careless because of the pandemic. The female medical students were 2.545 times (p < .001) and 4.414 times (p < .001) more likely to have positive attitudes and good practices toward COVID-19 as compared to males. CONCLUSION: Medical students, especially females and senior year scholars, were well-versed with desired levels of knowledge, attitudes, and preventive measures toward COVID-19. Most of them recognized COVID 19, is shaping their social, mental, and psychological well-being and encroaching on the healthcare system and economy.

Controversy exists regarding the potential of anticoagulation (AC) to reduce mortality and incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients. The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association between anticoagulants and mortality in adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients using the available published non-randomized studies. METHODS: Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials.gov were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of adjusted and unadjusted estimates was performed. The relative risk was used as a measure of effect. The random-effects model was used to pool estimates using the generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in the quantitative data synthesis. Results showed a statistically significant association between AC and mortality (RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.36; 0.92, p = 0.02). Both therapeutic (Relative risk [RR] = 0.4, 95% CI 0.27; 0.57) and prophylactic AC (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.41; 0.71) were associated with lower risk of mortality. Pre-admission AC was not associated with mortality (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.49; 1.43, p > 0.05) while prophylactic AC was associated with higher risk of mortality compared to therapeutic AC (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.34; 1.87, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings support the association of AC with mortality in Covid-19 patients. The results, synthesized from mostly low-quality studies, show that prophylactic and therapeutic AC might reduce mortality in Covid-19 patients. Findings suggest that therapeutic doses might be associated with better survival compared to prophylactic doses.","Kamel, Ahmed M; Sobhy, Mona; Magdy, Nada; Sabry, Nirmeen; Farid, Samar",Rev Med Virol,683,32

It is important to characterize the differences in disease presentation and trajectory between COVID-19 patients and other patients with common respiratory illnesses. These differences can enhance knowledge of pathogenesis and help in guiding treatment. Methods: Data from electronic medical records were obtained from individuals admitted with respiratory illnesses to Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, between October 1st, 2014 and October 1st, 2020. Four groups of patients were defined: COVID-19 (693), influenza (1,612), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (2,292), and Others (4,054). The variable analyzed include demographics (7), vital signs (8), lab tests (38), and comorbidities (15) from a total of 8,651 hospitalized adult patients. Statistical analysis was performed on biomarkers measured at admission and for their disease trajectory in the first 48 h of hospitalization, and on comorobidity prevalence. Results: COVID-19 patients were overall younger in age and had higher body mass index, compared to influenza and SARI. Comorbidity burden was lower in the COVID-19 group compared to influenza and SARI. Severely- and moderately-ill COVID-19 patients older than 65 years of age suffered higher rate of in-hospital mortality compared to hospitalized influenza patients. At admission, white blood cells and neutrophils were lower among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza and SARI patients, while pulse rate and lymphoctye percentage were higher. Trajectories of variables during the first 2 days of hospitalization revealed that white blood count, neutrophils percentage and glucose in blood increased among COVID-19 patients, while decreasing among other patients. Conclusions: The intrinsic virulence of COVID-19 appeared higher than influenza. In addition, several critical functions, such as immune response, coagulation, heart and respiratory function, and metabolism were uniquely affected by COVID-19.","Reiner Benaim, A.; Sobel, J.

Responses to this pressure are hindered in part by reliance on a limited supply of highly trained health care professionals, creating a need for scalable technological solutions. Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligence-supported software tools that use a conversational ""chatbot"" format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools due to the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity. However, evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large general population. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by a symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: This population-based descriptive study included all web-based symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24, 2019, to February 1, 2020. User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data. RESULTS: A total of 26,646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period. Most assessments (17,816/26,646, 66.9%) were completed by female users. The mean user age was 34.3 years (SD 14.4 years), compared to a median age of 37.3 years of the general population. The most common initial symptom was abdominal pain (2060/26,646, 7.7%). A substantial number of assessments (12,357/26,646, 46.4%) were completed outside of typical physician office hours. Most users were advised to seek medical care on the same day (7299/26,646, 27.4%) or within 2-3 days (6301/26,646, 23.6%). Over a quarter of the assessments indicated a high degree of urgency (7723/26,646, 29.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Users of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population, although they skewed toward younger and female users. The triage recommendations were comparable to those of nurse-staffed telephone triage lines. Although the emergence of COVID-19 has increased the interest in remote medical assessment tools, it is important to take an evidence-based approach to their deployment.","Morse, Keith E; Ostberg, Nicolai P; Jones, Veena G; Chan, Albert S",J Med Internet Res,683,20

Fertility preservation is urgent by definition, performed for social reasons or medical indications, such as impending gonadotoxic therapy or radical gynaecological surgery. One year after the pandemic was declared, the COVID-19 infection imposed several restrictions and limited access to health care for the infertile couple. Ovarian stimulation is a pharmacological treatment used to induce the development of ovarian follicles;FP guidelines provide different options for ovarian stimulation. We performed a systematic search on fertility preservation (FP) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic using the keywords: FP, ovarian stimulation, assisted reproduction techniques (ART), and COVID-19. In order to update the different treatment strategies in ovarian stimulation on fertility preservation studied in the last ten years, we searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) focused on therapeutic agents used in current protocols, gonadotropins, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole, androgens, metformin, tamoxifen, glucocorticoids, aspirin, coenzyme Q10, and sildenafil. Fertility may be influenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection - especially in men;until more evidence confirms the effects on fertility, patients with COVID-19 positive should delay FP procedures if possible. Access to fertility conservation services decreased during the analysed period due to the medical services restrictions and the reorientation of medical resources on patients with COVID-19, without major changes in the current therapeutic protocols. In terms of pharmacotherapy in ovarian stimulation (OS) procedures, letrozole is first line therapy, superior to CC for OS. Similar ovulation and pregnancy rate can be obtained in letrozole - induced ovulation compared to gonadotropin protocol. Adjuvant therapies may be used for OS but lack proven efficacy. Further studies on adjuvant therapies and complementary support are needed, to ensure optimal condition in assisted reproductive interventions for fertility preservation, especially in gonadotoxic therapies.","Varlas, V.

Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.","Geier, Mark R; Geier, David A",Med Hypotheses,683,1

Only age >70 years and C reactive protein >10 mg/dl at admission were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio 34.86, P = .003 and 13.56,P = .03). Persistent viral sheddind was detected in 5 HP. Active chemotherapy, viral load at diagnosis and COVID-19 therapy were not predictors of outcome. CONCLUSION: Mortality of COVID-19 is significantly higher in patients with haematological malignancies compared to non-cancer patients. The impact of persistent viral shedding must be considered in order to re-start therapies and maintain infectious control measures.","Sanchez-Pina, José María; Rodríguez Rodriguez, Mario; Castro Quismondo, Nerea; Gil Manso, Rodrigo; Colmenares, Rafael; Gil Alos, Daniel; Paciello, Mari Liz; Zafra, Denis; Garcia-Sanchez, Cristina; Villegas, Carolina; Cuellar, Clara; Carreño-Tarragona, Gonzalo; Zamanillo, Irene; Poza, María; Iñiguez, Rodrigo; Gutierrez, Xabier; Alonso, Rafael; Rodríguez, Antonia; Folgueira, Maria Dolores; Delgado, Rafael; Ferrari, José Miguel; Lizasoain, Manuel; Aguado, José María; Ayala, Rosa; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquín; Calbacho, María",Eur. j. haematol,683,16

Data was collected using purposive sampling via 47 social media groups and pages, using internet survey as an instrument from 141 teachers, teaching kindergarten and elementary students, from different regions (continents) of the world. Findings revealed, six success themes and eight major challenges from the voice of teachers experiencing a rapid and unprepared shift to virtual education. Suggestions for improving digital education revolve around four areas which suggest that pupils from marginal socioeconomic households were significantly disadvantaged during the COVID-driven virtual education scheme. This research is not preoccupied with identifying universal outcomes but, instead, is focused on how the real virtual teaching experience can help in informing areas of focus for reimagining the approach to education for an uncertain future.","Kundu, Arnab; Bej, Tripti",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),683,24

However, in recent years viable alternatives have become available. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a major re-thinking in medical education worldwide. In this commentary, we examined the current merits and limitations of the direct ophthalmoscope in both the clinical sense and in the context of infection control. Furthermore, we compared the direct ophthalmoscope with alternatives, including commercially available portable non-mydriatic fundus cameras, that would allow a change in focus during ophthalmic teaching. We concluded that the latter will better prepare our medical students for the age of telemedicine and deep-learning systems. While the COVID-19 pandemic will not be the sole reason for the 'death' of the direct ophthalmoscope, the global situation will inevitably serve to expedite long overdue changes in our teaching of ophthalmic skills to non-ophthalmic physicians.","Shih, Kendrick C; Chau, Charlene Y C; Chan, Jonathan C H; Wong, Jasper K W; Lai, Jimmy S M",,683,20

METHODS: Lungs of 12 consecutive COVID-19 decedents consented for autopsy were evaluated for gross and histopathologic abnormalities. A complete Ghon ""en block"" dissection was performed on all cases; lung weights and gross characteristics recorded. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to characterize lymphocytic infiltrates and to assess SARS-CoV-2 capsid protein. RESULTS: Two distinct patterns of pulmonary involvement were identified. Three of 12 cases demonstrated a predominance of acute alveolar damage (DAD) while 9 of 12 cases demonstrated a marked increase in intra-alveolar macrophages in a fashion resembling desquamative interstitial pneumonia or macrophage activation syndrome (DIP/MAS). Two patterns were correlated solely with a statistically significant difference in the duration of illness. The group exhibiting DAD had duration of illness of 5.7 days while the group with DIP/MAS had duration of illness of 21.5 days (t-test p = 0.014).

518897,518897,518897,The emerging plasticity of SARS-CoV-2,10.256457,9.854839,2021,"PhenomenonProfessional identity development is recognised as a core goal of medical education alongside knowledge and skill acquisition. Identity is a complex entity that can be conceptualised as externally influenced, but individually constructed. Integration from legitimate bystander to old timer of the medical community of practice provides a backdrop for individual negotiation of professional identity. During Covid-19, the medical community of practice and education experienced significant disruption. We sought to investigate how these disruptions impacted professional identity development by examining conflicts between students identities highlighted by the pressures of the pandemic. ApproachA mixed-methods survey was distributed to medical students in the UK. The survey was active from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, during the height of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. Operating within the paradigm of constructivism, we conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative responses. Analysis was focused around the disruption to medical education, actions taken by medical students during this disruption, and the tension between student actions where they existed in conflict. FindingsThree themes were constructed to describe the identities that participants felt were in conflict during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic: Status and role as a future doctor; status and role as a student; and status and role as a member of the wider community. Students noted that lack of clinical exposure was detrimental to their education, implicitly recognising that many aspects of professional identity formation are forged in the clinical environment. Participants were keen to volunteer clinically but struggled to balance this with academic work. Participants worried about the risk to their families and the wider community, and wanted to ensure that their skills would add value to the clinical environment. Volunteers felt frustrated when they were unable to perform tasks which aligned with their identities as future doctors, with the exception of participants who worked as interim FY1s (FiY1s), which aligned well with the roles of FY1s. InsightsAs hypothesised, the participants in this study experienced disruptions to their professional identity development during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This work provides early evidence, collected at the beginning of the pandemic, that the effects of disruptions to professional identity development were wide-reaching, often negative, and represent an important topic for future exploration. Given that the pandemic has highlighted areas of identity tension, these findings have the potential to provide insight into how medical training can better nurture professional identity development during and beyond international crises.","Harvey, Anna; Brown, Megan EL; Byrne, Matthew H V; Alexander, Laith; Wan, Jonathan CM; Ashcroft, James; Schindler, Nicholas; Brassett, Cecilia",,683,29

Nepalese make up one of the largest groups of migrants residing in Japan. Crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could disproportionately affect migrants from low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, widening health and economic inequalities. An in-depth, comprehensive assessment is needed to appraise the diverse problems they encounter. Drawing upon qualitative interviews, this study aimed to identify challenges faced by Nepalese migrants in Japan as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss their needs to counter these challenges. METHODS: This qualitative study employed an interpretivist approach to appraise the first-hand experience of Nepalese migrants living in Japan. Fourteen participants (8 males and 6 females, aged 21 to 47 years old) were recruited to participate in semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews (45-60 min) regarding: (a) their perceived current physical and mental health, (b) problems faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (c) perception of available and necessary support structures. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit the participants. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: 1) experiencing psychosomatic symptoms, 2) adoption of new healthy behaviors, 3) financial hardship, 4) family concerns, 5) reflections on discrimination and 6) reflections of existing support and expectations of support systems. The findings of our study illustrate the specific impact of COVID-19 among Nepalese migrants regarding their unstable employment conditions, perceived lack of social support, possible obligation to send money home, difficulty in accessing services due to the language barrier, and a lack of effective governmental support from Nepal. Pandemic-related adversity has negatively impacted migrants' mental well-being, exacerbating their vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive and timely support should be provided to the vulnerable migrant population. Effective coordination among relevant parties in both countries, including the governments concerned, should be facilitated.","Bhandari, Divya; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Ozaki, Akihiko; Abeysinghe, Sudeepa; Kosaka, Makoto; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",BMC Public Health,683,20

METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey included two self-administered questionnaires: one collected personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent epidemic area contact history, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). RESULTS: A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSD among the Chinese public one month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), epidemic area contact history (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictors for PTSD. LIMITATIONS: First, the majority of participants in this study were the general public, with confirmed or suspected patients being a small part. Second, the measurement of PTSD in this study might be vulnerable to selection bias because of an online self-report study, such as participants' recruitment. Third, the prevalence of PTSD in this study was estimated by an online questionnaire rather than a clinical interview. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that some Chinese showed acute PTSD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation.

The outcome measures included the prevalence/incidence of pain (i.e., headache, neck or shoulder pain, upper limb pain, low back pain, and leg pain), pain intensity, and the prevalence of past/present chronic pain. Pain intensity was measured by the pain/discomfort item of the 5-level version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension scale. Odds ratios of pain prevalence/incidence and past/present chronic pain prevalence according to the UCLA-LS3-SF3 scoring groups (tertiles) and the frequency of the perceived increase in social isolation (categories 1–5) were calculated using multinomial logistic regression analysis. The mean pain intensity values among different loneliness and social isolation levels were tested using an analysis of covariance. Increased loneliness and the severity of the perceived social isolation were positively associated with the prevalence/incidence of pain, pain intensity, and the prevalence of past/present chronic pain.","Yamada, Keiko; Wakaizumi, Kenta; Kubota, Yasuhiko; Murayama, Hiroshi; Tabuchi, Takahiro",Sci Rep,683,19

The authors exploit the temporal and geographic variation in U.S. SPOs to investigate their effect on loneliness among online workers. Variation in loneliness is then linked to worker behavior in a simple two-person, collaborative task (a framed stag hunt). The analysis reveals a strong positive relationship between SPOs and loneliness on average, peaking during the wave associated with the most prolonged duration of isolation. SPOs disproportionately impacted workers in occupations not substantially involving teamwork or collaboration. As reported loneliness increases, the probability of an individual collaborating in a simple interactive workplace scenario decreases significantly.

An evaluation of university samples (N = 404, 40.5 ± 15.4 years) of self-reported physical activity, sedentary behavior, and bodyweight prior to the closure of campus due to the pandemic in March of 2020 and again at the time of the survey administration (May–June 2020) during pandemic-related restrictions was performed. Participants also reported whether they did (n = 172) or did not (n = 232) regularly use physical activity monitoring technology. While physical activity was unchanged during the pandemic (p ≥ 0.15), participants significantly increased sitting by 67.8 ± 156.6 min/day and gained 0.64 ± 3.5 kg from pre-campus to post-campus closure (p < 0.001). However, the use of activity monitoring did not moderate these changes. In conclusion, while physical activity was not affected, participants reported significant increases in sedentary behavior and bodyweight during the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes occurred regardless of whether participants regularly used physical activity monitoring or not.","Barkley, Jacob E.; Farnell, Gregory; Boyko, Brianna; Turner, Brooke; Wiet, Ryan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,683,20

Common risk factors include older age, chronic illness, obesity, and non-Caucasian race. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with risk for respiratory infections and failure, susceptibility and response to therapy for enveloped virus infection, and immune-mediated inflammatory reaction. Objective: To test the hypothesis that 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] deficiency is a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 respiratory and inflammatory complications. Design: We examined the relationship between prehospitalization 25(OH)D levels (obtained 1–365 days prior to admission) and COVID-19 clinical outcomes in 700 COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients. Primary Outcomes: Discharge status, mortality, length of stay, intubation status, renal replacement. Secondary Outcomes: Inflammatory markers. Results: 25(OH)D levels were available in 93 patients [25(OH)D:25(IQR:17–33)ng/mL]. Compared to those without 25(OH)D levels, those with measurements did not differ in age, BMI or distribution of sex and race, but were more likely to have comorbidities. Those with 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (n = 35) did not differ from those with 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL in terms of age, sex, race, BMI, or comorbidities. Low 25(OH)D tended to be associated with younger age and lower frequency of preexisting pulmonary disease. There were no significant between-group differences in any outcome. Results were similar in those ≥50 years, in male/female-only cohorts, and when differing 25(OH)D thresholds were used (<15 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL). There was no relationship between 25(OH)D as a continuous variable and any outcome, even after controlling for age and pulmonary disease. Conclusions: These preliminary data do not support a relationship between prehospitalization vitamin D status and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Szeto, Betsy; Zucker, Jason E.; LaSota, Elijah D.; Rubin, Mishaela R.; Walker, Marcella D.; Yin, Michael T.; Cohen, Adi",Endocrine research,683,10

However, no studies explored the effect of persistent allergen exposure on SLIT treatment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restricts outdoor activities of children significantly. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of SLIT during this special period. METHODS: A total of 335 AR children who sensitize to house dust mite (HDM) undergoing SLIT were recruited in this study. The clinical effectiveness and safety were evaluated at different time points using symptom and medication scores. The serum total IgE and specific IgE (sIgE) at different time points were detected by using the Unicap system. RESULTS: The total nasal symptoms score (TNSS) and total medication score (TMS) during the epidemic of COVID-19 increased significantly compared with the same period last year (p < 0.05), despite that they were still significantly lower than baseline levels (p < 0.05). The occurrence of adverse reactions at different time points had no significant differences. We also found that the family of the good response group had more frequent bedding cleaning. Both the tIgE and sIgE levels had no significant changes during SLIT treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that continuous HDM exposure reduced the effectiveness of SLIT, whereas effective reduction of HDM levels by frequent bed cleaning will be helpful during the SLIT treatment.","Liu, Wenlong; Zeng, Qingxiang; Tang, Yiquan; Yan, Shengbao; Li, Yan; Gao, Shengli; Luo, Xi; Luo, Renzhong",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,683,1

Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. METHODS: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. RESULTS: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one’s financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one’s financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08–1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22–1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01–1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55–2.39]). Feeling burdened by thoughts about virus contraction at work was also significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.33 [1.07–1.64]), caring for children (1.33 [1.07–1.66]), depression (1.54 [1.18–2.00]), and anxiety (4.71 [3.71–5.98]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence regarding major SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related stressors among medical assistants and suggests need for special support for medical assistants caring for children and working in specialist practices.","Dreher, Annegret; Pietrowsky, Reinhard; Loerbroks, Adrian",PLoS One,683,16

The aim of this study was to observe clinical characteristics and explore risk factors in COVID-19 patients with liver injury. MATERIAL/METHODS: In this retrospective study, 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients with normal alanine transaminase (ALT) on admission were divided into a group of normal ALT patients whose ALT was always less than 40 U/l during hospitalization and a group of elevated ALT patients whose ALT was at least once more than 40 U/l after admission. Clinical data, especially virus-induced inflammatory parameters, were analyzed for risk factors and predictive value. The Mann-Whitney U test and t test for comparing means and logistic regression were performed for analysis of risk factors. Area under the ROC curve was used for predictive values. RESULTS: Sixteen of 40 (40.0%) patients developed elevated ALT, many of them with more severe COVID-19. The highest ALT level was 101 U/l. The risk factors for liver injury were C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CD8+T cell count, and severity of disease, and CRP (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.045–1.222, p=0.002) was the independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury in COVID-19 patients was mild and associated with inflammatory markers, especially CRP, which suggests that liver injury may be induced by virus-mediated inflammation in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Dali; Zhu, Zhenyu; Bi, Jingfeng; Feng, Danni; Zhang, Lijuan; Liu, Hongling; Gao, Yinjie",Med Sci Monit,683,16

MTLV establishes a persistent infection and can be recovered indefinitely from infected mice, but nothing is known about requirements for this persistent infection. In order to determine whether T lineage lymphocytes are required for infection, young adult athymic nude (nulnu) mice and euthymic littermates were infected with MTLV and tested for virus shedding. Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21 %). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested. These data confirm that the virus is preferentially T lymphotropic and suggest that infection may require T lineage lymphocytes.","Morse, Stephen S.",Virology,683,28

A concomitant of sedentariness is compromised mental health. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations (USA, UK, France, and Australia). METHODS: An online survey was administered in the second quarter of 2020 (N = 2541). We measured planned and unplanned dimensions of PA using the Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire and mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Steps per day were recorded only from participants who used an electronic device for this purpose, and sedentary behavior was reported in hours per day (sitting and screen time). RESULTS: In the USA and Australia samples, there was a significant decline in planned PA from pre- to during lockdown. Among young adults, Australians exhibited the lowest planned PA scores, while in middle-aged groups, the UK recorded the highest. Young adults exhibited the largest reduction in unplanned PA. Across nations, there was a reduction of ~ 2000 steps per day. Large increases in sedentary behavior emerged during lockdown, which were most acute in young adults. Lockdown was associated with a decline in mental health that was more pronounced in women. CONCLUSIONS: The findings illustrate the deleterious effects of lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations. Australian young and lower middle-aged adults appeared to fare particularly badly in terms of planned PA. The reduction in steps per day is equivalent to the non-expenditure of ~ 100 kcal.

Within Europe, the first countries to be strongly affected have been Italy and Spain. In Spain, infection has expanded in highly populated areas, resulting in one of the largest nationwide bursts so far by early April. We analyze the evolution of the growth curve of the epidemic in both the whole of Spain and Madrid Autonomous Region (the second largest conurbation in Europe), based on the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths. We conducted segmented, linear regressions on log-transformed data to identify changes in the slope of these curves and/or sudden shifts in the number of cases (i.e. changes in the intercept) at fitted breaking points, and compared their results with a timeline including both key events of the epidemic and containment measures taken by the national and regional governments. Results were largely consistent in the four curves analyzed (reported infections and deaths for Spain and Madrid, respectively), showing two major shifts in slopes (growth rates) at 14-15 and 26-29 March that resulted in 37-65% reductions of slope, and originated in infection on 4-5 and 16-18 March (for case detections) and 14-23 February and 5-6 March (for deaths). Small upward shifts in the progress of the disease in Madrid were not associated with significant changes in the intercept of the curve, and seem related with unevenness in case reporting. These results evidence an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19 coinciding with personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations, as well as the general awareness of the population; and a second, stronger decrease when harder isolation measures were enforced. The combination of both breakpoints seemingly led to the start of the contention of the disease outbreak by early April, the limit of our time series. This highlights the importance of adopting public health strategies that include disseminating basic knowledge on personal hygiene and reduced social contact at the onset of the epidemic, and the importance of early enforcement of hard contention measures for its subsequent contention.","Santamaria, Luis; Hortal, Joaquin",,683,22

As e-cigarettes are not harmless, concerns exist about e-cigarette use by nonsmokers and youth. E-liquids are available in many different flavors that increase sensory appeal. Flavor preferences may differ between user groups, which could open doors for product regulation. We investigated which e-liquid flavors are attractive to specific user groups by comparing liking between adolescent nonsmokers (n = 41; mean age 16.9 ± 0.8), young adult nonsmokers (n = 42; mean age 22.7 ± 1.7), and adult smokers (n = 56; mean age 39.7 ± 11.1). Participants smelled tobacco- (n = 6) and nontobacco (n = 24)-flavored e-liquids and rated liking on a 9-point labeled hedonic scale, and familiarity, overall intensity, perceived sweetness, perceived bitterness, and irritation of the odors on a 100-unit Visual Analog Scale. Mean liking ranged from 2.3 (whiskey) to 6.7 (peppermint). Within all groups, the typically sweet and minty flavors (e.g., wine gum, watermelon, peppermint, menthol) were liked significantly more than the tobacco-flavored e-liquids. The set of tobacco-flavored e-liquids was significantly, but slightly, less disliked by adult smokers (3.9 ± 0.2) than adolescent (3.1 ± 0.3) and young adult (3.4 ± 0.3) nonsmokers (P < 0.001). No between-group differences were observed for sweet and minty flavors. Liking correlated significantly positively with odor sweetness (R = 0.49) and familiarity (R = 0.48) and negatively with odor bitterness (R = −0.58), irritation (R = −0.47), and overall intensity (R = −0.27). Thus, sweet- and minty-flavored e-liquids are liked equally by young nonsmokers and adult smokers, and more than tobacco flavors. Banning all flavors except tobacco will likely reduce e-cigarette appeal; potentially more for young nonsmokers than adult smokers.","Krüsemann, Erna J Z; van Tiel, Loes; Pennings, Jeroen L A; Vaessen, Wim; de Graaf, Kees; Talhout, Reinskje; Boesveldt, Sanne",Chem Senses,683,26

The gold standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection is a reverse transcription/quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) which targets the viral genome, an assay that has now been performed on millions of patient specimens worldwide regardless of symptomatic status. Recently Zhang et al. suggested the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 N gene could integrate into host cell DNA through the action of the LINE-1 retrotransposon, a mobile element that is potentially active in human somatic cells, thereby calling into question the veracity of N-gene based RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, we assessed the potential impact of these purported integration events on nasal swab specimens tested at our clinical laboratory. Using an N-gene based RT-qPCR assay, we tested 768 arbitrarily selected specimens and identified 2 samples which resulted in a positive detection of viral sequence in the absence of reverse transcriptase, a necessary but not sufficient signal consistent with possible integration of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene into the host genome. Regardless of possible viral N gene integration into the genome, in this small subset of samples, all patients were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as indicated by a much lower Ct value for reactions performed in the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT) versus reactions performed without RT. Moreover, one of the two positives observed in the absence of RT also tested positive when using primers targeting ORF1ab, a gene closer to the 5 prime end of the genome. These data are inconsistent with the N gene integration hypothesis suggested by the studies by Zhang et al., and importantly, our results suggest little to no practical impact of possible SARS-CoV-2 genome integration events on RT-qPCR testing.","Briggs, E.; Ward, W.; Rey, S.; Law, D.; Nelson, K.; Bois, M.; Ostrov, N.; Lee, H.

The possibility of confounding from using aggregated data is substantial due to the neglect of person-level factors. Second, studying the viral transmission of COVID-19 solely on people's residential neighborhoods is problematic because people are also exposed to nonhome locations and environments en-route along their daily mobility path. We caution against an uncritical application of aggregated data and reiterate the importance of stronger research designs (e.g., case-control studies) on an individual level. To address environmental contextual uncertainties due to people's day-to-day mobility, we call for people-centered studies with mobile phone data.","Helbich, Marco; Mute Browning, Matthew H.E.; Kwan, Mei-Po",Sci Total Environ,683,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a caregivers’ skills training program (Supporting Carers of Children and Adolescents with Eating Disorders in Austria, SUCCEAT, workshop or online version) on adolescents with AN delivered as workshops (WS) or online (ONL). Outcomes are Body-Mass-Index (BMI) percentile, eating psychopathology (Eating Disorder Examination, EDE), attitudinal and behavioural dimensions of eating disorders (Eating Disorder Inventory-2), motivation to change (AN Stages of Change Questionnaire), emotional and behavioural problems (Youth Self-Report) and quality of life (KINDL). All outcome variables significantly improved across both SUCCEAT groups (WS and ONL) and were sustained at 12-month follow-up. The online and workshop delivery of SUCCEAT were equally effective. Most effect sizes were in the medium-to-high range. Full or partial remission was observed in 72% (WS) and 87% (ONL) of patients. Caregiver skills trainings, either delivered as workshops or online modules, are highly recommended to complement treatment as usual.","Philipp, Julia; Franta, Claudia; Zeiler, Michael; Truttmann, Stefanie; Wittek, Tanja; Imgart, Hartmut; Zanko, Annika; Auer-Welsbach, Ellen; Mairhofer, Dunja; Mitterer, Michaela; Laczkovics, Clarissa; Schöfbeck, Gabriele; Jilka, Elisabeth; Egermann, Wolfgang B.; Treasure, Janet; Karwautz, Andreas F.

Materials and Methods We retrieved 4,552,652 publicly available tweets posted within the timeline of January 2020 to January 2021. Following extraction, we identified vaccine sentiments and opinions of tweets and compared their progression by time, geographical distribution, main themes, keywords, posts engagement metrics and accounts characteristics. Results We found a slight difference in the prevalence of positive and negative sentiments, with positive being the dominant polarity and having higher engagements. The amount of discussion on vaccine rejection and hesitancy was more than interest in vaccines during the course of the study, but the pattern was different in various countries. We found the accounts producing vaccine opposition content were partly Twitter bots or political activists while well-known individuals and organizations generated the content in favour of vaccination. Conclusion Understanding sentiments and opinions toward vaccination using Twitter may help public health agencies to increase positive messaging and eliminate opposing messages in order to enhance vaccine uptake.","Yousefinaghani, Samira; Dara, Rozita; Mubareka, Samira; Papadopoulos, Andrew; Sharif, Shayan",Int J Infect Dis,683,21

The first person is the administrator, who is separated into two groups of users: the doctor and the patient. The doctor has an app that questions through the patient so he knows the patient that is being visited and extracts the health identity from him, and he questions the patient for sending him an OTP in the event that the patient does not have a mobile screen or an Internet connection. Alternatively, if QR asks him if his laptop is smart and wired to the Internet, the person will be able to access the system after the doctor has examined them. The patient will examine himself through the devices he has, and the system will provide him with the results of his doctor. The doctor can write a prescription every time he sends new readings. If the prescription is correct, then the patient can keep it and increase the dose. Doctors will work on the prescription console that sends the prescription for cloud authentication and obtain an encrypted QR that will then be issued to the recipient of the drug. The patient has the privilege of studying medication details via the recipient's app. The privilege of viewing QR encrypted cloud data is for life.

Nsp1 has been shown to have an important role in the pathogenetic mechanisms of coronaviruses in vivo. To assess the function of a relatively conserved domain (LLRKxGxKG) of MHV nsp1, a mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, with a 27 nts (LLRKxGxKG) deletion in nsp1, was constructed using a reverse genetic system with a vaccinia virus vector. The mutant virus had similar growth kinetics to MHV-A59 wild-type virus in 17CI-1 cells, but was highly attenuated in vivo. Moreover, the mutant virus completely protected C57BL/6 mice from a lethal MHV-A59 challenge. To further analyze the mechanism of the attenuation of the mutant virus, changes in reporter gene expression were measured in nsp1- or nsp1-27D-expressing cells; the results showed that nsp1 inhibited reporter gene expression controlled by different promoters, but that this inhibition was reduced for nsp1-27D. The research in vivo and in vitro suggests that the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 may play an important role in this process.","Lei, Lin; Ying, Sun; Baojun, Luo; Yi, Yang; Xiang, He; Wenli, Su; Zounan, Sun; Deyin, Guo; Qingyu, Zhu; Jingmei, Liu; Guohui, Chang",PLoS One,683,16

AREAS COVERED: Features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents some common points with interstitial lung disease (ILD) both idiopathic and related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), typically characterized by a chronic progression over time and possibly complicated by acute exacerbation (AE). The study of common pathogenetic mechanisms, such as the involvement of toll-like receptor 4, could contribute to the knowledge and treatment of idiopathic and RA-ILD. Moreover, hyperinflammation, mainly characterized by increase of effector T-cells and inflammatory cytokines, and activation of coagulation cascade, observed in COVID-19 related ARDS have been already shown in patients with AE of idiopathic and RA-ILD. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, together with a manual search in COVID-resource centers of the main journals. EXPERT OPINION: Despite the uncertainty about pathogenetic aspects about COVID-19- pneumonia, it could be a possible model for other forms of ILD and AE. The great amount of data from studies on COVID-19 could be helpful in proposing safe therapeutic approaches for RA-ILD, in understanding pathogenesis of usual interstitial pneumonia and to develop new therapeutic strategies for AE.","Manfredi, A; Luppi, F; Cassone, G; Vacchi, C; Salvarani, C; Sebastiani, M",Expert review of clinical immunology,683,30

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (January through March, 2020), 302 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations. The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G) which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. Importance A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether the mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and caused them more infectious, should be paid more attentions to. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase that have increased human ACE2 receptor binding affinity and infectivity. The RBD mutation analysis provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The continuous surveillance of RBD mutations with increased human ACE2 affinity in human or other animals is important and necessary, particularly when the direct correlation between the virus variations and vaccine effectiveness is underdetermined during the sustained COVID-19 pandemic.","Ou, Junxian; Zhou, Zhonghua; Dai, Ruixue; Zhao, Shan; Wu, Xiaowei; Zhang, Jing; Lan, Wendong; Cui, Lilian; Wu, Jianguo; Seto, Donald; Chodosh, James; Zhang, Gong; Zhang, Qiwei",bioRxiv,683,3

We tie the “economic surprise” of the short recession to the speed and size of U.S. stimulus programs during COVID-19 – faster and larger than for the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We connect the “financial surprise” of the resilient banking sector to prudential policies put in place during and after the GFC that fortified U.S. banks prior to COVID-19. These twin “surprises” are also mutually reinforcing – if either the economy or banking system had failed, so would the other. We also review extant COVID-19 banking research and suggest paths for future research.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM/IgG serological RDTs. Methods: Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA). Results: Using the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values [≤] 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission. Conclusion: Antigen and antibody-based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used alone.

In support of this concept, we used a modified form of the transcription factor STAT1 to achieve hyper-responsiveness to interferon without toxicity and markedly improve antiviral function in transgenic mice and transduced human cells. We found that the improvement depended on expression of a PARP9-DTX3L complex with distinct domains for interaction with STAT1 and for activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acted on host histone H2BJ to promote interferon-stimulated gene expression and on viral 3C proteases to degrade these proteases via the immunoproteasome.

Foods are very rich in substances, with a potential beneficial effect on health, and some of these could have an antiviral action or be important in modulating the immune system and in defending cells from the oxidative stress associated with infection. This short review draws the attention on some components of citrus fruits, and especially of the orange (Citrus sinensis), well known for its vitamin and flavonoid content. Among the flavonoids, hesperidin has recently attracted the attention of researchers, because it binds to the key proteins of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several computational methods, independently applied by different researchers, showed that hesperidin has a low binding energy, both with the coronavirus “spike” protein, and with the main protease that transforms the early proteins of the virus (pp1a and ppa1b) into the complex responsible for viral replication. The binding energy of hesperidin to these important components is lower than that of lopinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir, suggesting that it could perform an effective antiviral action. Furthermore, both hesperidin and ascorbic acid counteract the cell damaging effects of the oxygen free radicals triggered by virus infection and inflammation. There is discussion about the preventive efficacy of vitamin C, at the dose achievable by the diet, but recent reviews suggest that this substance can be useful in the case of strong immune system burden caused by viral disease. Computational methods and laboratory studies support the need to undertake apposite preclinical, epidemiological, and experimental studies on the potential benefits of citrus fruit components for the prevention of infectious diseases, including COVID-19.","Bellavite, Paolo; Donzelli, Alberto",Antioxidants (Basel),683,16

Previous research indicates that one’s mindset about health, or the degree to which they view health as fixed or modifiable, influences health behaviors. Current data indicates that American Indians (AIs) are at greater risk for COVID-19. As such, it is important to understand whether mindsets about health may affect behaviors which could prevent spread of the virus in AIs.

The second wave of data was collected approximately one month later, where we collected a measure of physical distancing behavior and a measure of disinfecting behaviors. In AI adults, health mindset predicted frequency of physical distancing behaviors and disinfecting behaviors, with individuals who viewed health as less fixed engaging in more physical distancing and disinfecting behaviors, while individuals who viewed health as more fixed reported less physical distancing and less disinfecting behaviors.

METHODS: Using data from the Premier Healthcare Database on 181,813 hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19 during March–September 2020 we applied multivariable log-binomial regression to assess the associations between age and race/ethnicity and COVID-19 clinical severity (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], and death); and determine whether the impact of age on clinical severity differs by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Overall, 84,497 (47%) patients were admitted to the ICU, 29,078 (16%) received IMV, and 27,864 (15%) died in the hospital. Increased age was strongly associated with clinical severity when controlling for underlying medical conditions and other covariates; the strength of this association differed by race/ethnicity. Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, risk of death was lower among non-Hispanic Black patients (adjusted risk ratio [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.92, 0.99]), and higher among Hispanic/Latino patients (RR [95% CI]: 1.15 [1.09, 1.20]), non-Hispanic Asian patients (RR [95% CI]: 1.16 [1.09, 1.23]), and patients of other racial and ethnic groups (RR [95% CI]: 1.13 [1.06, 1.21]). Risk of ICU admission and IMV was elevated among some racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that age is a driver of poor outcomes among hospitalized persons with COVID-19. Additionally, clinical severity may be elevated among patients of some racial and ethnic minority groups. Public health strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among older adults and racial and ethnic minorities are essential to reduce poor outcomes.","Pennington, Audrey F; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Summers, April D; Danielson, Melissa L; Goodman, Alyson B; Chevinsky, Jennifer R; Preston, Leigh Ellyn; Schieber, Lyna Z; Namulanda, Gonza; Courtney, Joseph; Strosnider, Heather M; Boehmer, Tegan K; Mac Kenzie, William R; Baggs, James; Gundlapalli, Adi V",Open Forum Infect Dis,683,22

However, it is challenging to predict when COVID-19 patients will progress to critical illness. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence system to predict future deterioration to critical illness in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An artificial intelligence (AI) system in a time-to-event analysis framework was developed to integrate chest CT and clinical data for risk prediction of future deterioration to critical illness in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A multi-institutional international cohort of 1,051 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and chest CT was included in this study. Of them, 282 patients developed critical illness, which was defined as requiring ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation and/or reaching death during their hospital stay. The AI system achieved a C-index of 0.80 for predicting individual COVID-19 patients’ to critical illness. The AI system successfully stratified the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with distinct progression risks (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Using CT imaging and clinical data, the AI system successfully predicted time to critical illness for individual patients and identified patients with high risk. AI has the potential to accurately triage patients and facilitate personalized treatment. KEY POINT: • AI system can predict time to critical illness for patients with COVID-19 by using CT imaging and clinical data.

To understand how the United States and Latin American countries achieved success in implementing obesity policies and programs (PAPs) and identify improvement opportunities using implementation science principles. We identified three comparative case studies: (1) front‐of‐food package labeling (Mexico and Chile); (2) Open Streets/play streets (Colombia and the United States); and (3) the Baby‐Friendly Hospital Initiative (Brazil and the United States). Information from multiple sources (e.g., scientific and gray literature and key informant interviews) was synthesized to describe barriers, facilitators, and progress of PAPs across RE‐AIM framework dimensions. Evidence‐based advocacy along with political will and evidence of scalability and impact were key for successful launch and implementation of all PAPs. Diverse adaptations of PAP design and implementation had to be done across contexts. Stronger process and impact monitoring and evaluation systems that track equity indicators are needed to maximize the population benefits of these PAPs. Implementation science offers an important contribution toward addressing knowledge gaps, enhancing obesity policy dialogue, and producing transferable lessons across the Americas and, therefore, should be used for research and evaluation during PAP development and throughout the implementation and maintenance phases.","Pérez‐Escamilla, Rafael; Vilar‐Compte, Mireya; Rhodes, Elizabeth; Sarmiento, Olga L.; Corvalan, Camila; Sturke, Rachel; Vorkoper, Susan",Obes Rev,683,20

We sought to determine COVID-19 outcomes among patients with RMD 6 months into the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients with RMD matched to up to five comparators by age, sex and COVID-19 diagnosis date (between 30 January 2020 and 16 July 2020) and followed until last encounter or 18 August 2020. COVID-19 outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Risk of mechanical ventilation was compared in an early versus a recent cohort of patients with RMD. RESULTS: We identified 143 patients with RMD and with COVID-19 (mean age 60 years; 76% female individuals) and 688 comparators (mean age 59 years; 76% female individuals). There were no significantly higher adjusted risks of hospitalisation (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.68–1.11), intensive care unit admission (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.86–1.86), or mortality (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.53–1.95) in patients with RMD versus comparators. There was a trend towards a higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the RMD cohort versus comparators, although not statistically significant (adjusted HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.93–2.44). There was a trend towards improvement in mechanical ventilation risk in the recent versus early RMD cohort (10% vs 19%, adjusted HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.17–1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RMD and comparators had similar risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes after adjusting for race, smoking and comorbidities. The higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the early RMD cohort was no longer detected in a recent cohort, suggesting improved management over time.","Serling-Boyd, Naomi; D’Silva, Kristin M; Hsu, Tiffany YT; Wallwork, Rachel; Fu, Xiaoqing; Gravallese, Ellen M; Jorge, April M; Zhang, Yuqing; Choi, Hyon; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S",Ann Rheum Dis,683,21

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we aimed to investigate the digital work engagement of Italian neurologists through a survey collected between September 2020 and January 2021. Questionnaires were anonymous and collected demographic characteristics, attitudes towards digital devices and social media, and details about the clinician–patient relationship. We used logistic-regression models to identify characteristics associated with the propensity to communicate with patients using social media. RESULTS: Among the 553 neurologists who participated to the study, smartphones and computers were widely preferred compared with tablets; wearable devices were not common, although some neurologists desired them. A total of 48% of participants reported communicating with patients using social media but only a few were in favor of social friendship with patients; WhatsApp was the social media most popular for professional (86%) and personal (98%) purposes. Propensity to communicate with social media was significantly higher among those who were older (p < 0.001) and lived in regions outside northern Italy (center: p = 0.006; south and the islands: p < 0.001). For 58% of responders, social media improved their relationship with patients, but 72% usually warned patients about unreliable websites. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred social media were those which were rapid and which safeguard privacy more effectively; neurologists made many efforts to disprove fake news circulating online, providing help to patients in various ways.

Understanding how maternal COVID-19 disease can affect placental histopathology has been limited by small study cohorts with mild disease, review by multiple pathologists, and potential confounding by maternal-fetal comorbidities that can also influence placental findings. This study aims to identify pathologic placental findings associated with COVID-19 disease and severity, as well as to distinguish them from changes related to coexisting maternal-fetal comorbidities. METHODS: This is an observational study of 61 pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who delivered and had a placental histological evaluation at NYU Langone Health between March 19, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of placental histopathologic features and their association with maternal-fetal comorbidities and severity of COVID-19 related hypoxia. Analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and t-test with p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Sixty-one placentas were included in the study cohort, 71% from pregnancies complicated by at least one maternal-fetal comorbidity. Twenty-five percent of placentas were small for gestational age and 77% exhibited at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion. None of the histopathologic features in the examined placentas were associated with the presence of any specific maternal-fetal comorbidity. Thirteen percent of the cohort required maternal respiratory support for COVID-19 related hypoxia. Villous trophoblast necrosis was associated with maternal supplemental oxygen requirement (67 vs. 33%, p = 0.04) and intubation (67 vs. 33%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 disease, there was a high prevalence of placental histopathologic changes identified, particularly features of maternal vascular malperfusion, which could not be attributed solely to the presence of maternal-fetal comorbidities. The significantly increased prevalence of villous trophoblast necrosis in women needing respiratory support suggests a connection to the severity of COVID-19 illness.","Meyer, Jessica A; Roman, Ashley S; Limaye, Meghana; Grossman, Tracy B; Flaifel, Abdallah; Vaz, Michelle J; Thomas, Kristen M; Penfield, Christina A",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,683,20

We developed a framework to assess various populations with unstable housing in terms of socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, risk of COVID-19 infection and progression, existing/urgent measures, and remaining challenges. Within the framework, nine groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan were classified into (i) “people without accommodation,” (ii) “people living in temporary or crisis accommodation,” and (iii) populations that include “people living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation.” The assessment revealed that “staying at home” was physically and practically unattainable across groups. The study identified specific institutional, social, and cultural challenges apart from the common economic crisis, whereas the utilization of social welfare was low. Findings suggest that the rapid increase of groups classified as “(i)” and “(ii)” should be addressed by engaging stakeholders to enhance the availability and accessibility of social welfare and rescue measures, and to ensure safe and private accommodations for all groups. It is critical to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to the common and specific vulnerabilities of these population groups from health, socio-economic, and humanitarian perspectives. Under the pandemic, homelessness should be regarded less as a peculiar problem for specific populations but an extension of daily life. The framework can be a reference when planning the comprehensive yet concise assessment of populations with unstable housing in other countries to inform responses to the pandemic.","Fujita, Masami; Matsuoka, Sadatoshi; Kiyohara, Hiroyuki; Kumakura, Yousuke; Takeda, Yuko; Goishi, Norimichi; Tarui, Masayoshi; Inaba, Masaki; Nagai, Mari; Hachiya, Masahiko; Fujita, Noriko",Trop Med Health,683,16

Several types of online mental health services were widely implemented for college students during the outbreak. This study investigated the relationship between college students’ mental health status and psychological help-seeking behavior to test the phases-decision-making model (PDM). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among college students in Guangdong Province using an online platform. In total, 4,164 students were assigned to the “counseling group” or “non-counseling group” according to whether they had sought psychological help because of the COVID-19 outbreak; the groups were matched based on age, sex, and grade. Demographics, perceived mental health, and experience with seeking psychological help were recorded. Fear, depression, and trauma were assessed by the COVID-19 Fear Screening Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Impact of Event Scale-6. RESULTS: The fear, depression, and trauma scores were significantly higher in the counseling group than in the non-counseling group (P(s) < 0.001). Fear (OR = 1.27, p < 0.001), depression (OR = 1.02, p = 0.032), trauma (OR = 1.08, p < 0.001), poor perceived mental health status (OR = 3.61, p = 0.001), and experience with seeking psychological help (OR = 7.06, p < 0.001) increased the odds of seeking psychological help. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the rate of psychological help-seeking was still low, and college students in poor psychological condition sought psychological counseling more. Fear, depression, trauma, experience with seeking psychological help, and perceived mental health can effectively predict psychological help-seeking behavior. These findings emphasized the importance of closely monitoring college students’ psychological status, providing psychological intervention, and improving the probability of seeking psychological help.","Liang, Shun-Wei; Chen, Rong-Ning; Liu, Li-Li; Li, Xue-Guo; Chen, Jian-Bin; Tang, Si-Yao; Zhao, Jing-Bo",Front Psychol,683,30

METHODS: Eighty‐six healthcare workers adhering to the vaccination campaign against COVID‐19 were enrolled in January–February 2021. All subjects underwent two COVID‐19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated by 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected before the 1st and 1–4 weeks after the second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, and vaccine side effects were recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters were measured, and body composition was performed through dual‐energy‐X‐ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Higher waist circumference was associated with lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = −0.324, p = 0.004); smokers had lower levels compared to non‐smokers [1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007], as well as hypertensive versus normotensive [650 ± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001] and dyslipideamic compared to those with normal serum lipids [534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005].

CONCLUSIONS: Central obesity, hypertension, and smoking are associated with lower Ab titres following COVID‐19 vaccination. Although it is currently impossible to determine whether lower SARS‐CoV‐2 Abs lead to higher likelihood of developing COVID‐19, it is well‐established that neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection against several viruses including SARS‐CoV‐2. Our findings, therefore, call for a vigilant approach, as subjects with central obesity, hypertension, and smoking could benefit from earlier vaccine boosters or different vaccine schedules.","Watanabe, Mikiko; Balena, Angela; Tuccinardi, Dario; Tozzi, Rossella; Risi, Renata; Masi, Davide; Caputi, Alessandra; Rossetti, Rebecca; Spoltore, Maria Elena; Filippi, Valeria; Gangitano, Elena; Manfrini, Silvia; Mariani, Stefania; Lubrano, Carla; Lenzi, Andrea; Mastroianni, Claudio; Gnessi, Lucio",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,683,32

We review the physiological functions of ACE2 in the cardiovascular system and the lungs, and how the activation of ACE2/MAS/G protein coupled receptor contributes in reducing acute injury and inhibiting fibrogenesis of the lungs and protecting the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, we predominantly focus on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on ACE2 and dysregulation of the protective effect of ACE2/MAS/G protein pathway vs. the deleterious effect of Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone. We discuss the potential effect of invasion of SARS-CoV-2 on the function of ACE2 and the loss of the protective effect of the ACE2/MAS pathway in alveolar epithelial cells and how this may amplify systemic deleterious effect of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAS) in the host. Furthermore, we speculate the potential of exploiting the modulation of ACE2/MAS pathway as a natural protection of lung injury by modulation of ACE2/MAS axis or by developing targeted drugs to inhibit proteases required for viral entry.","Samavati, Lobelia; Uhal, Bruce D.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,683,1

INTRODUCTION: Because the effectiveness of a healthcare response to a disaster depends on an available, skilled, and motivated healthcare workforce, it is essential to understand and address potential barriers to and reasons for the intentions of medical staff to leave or stay in their profession. METHODS: A qualitative study with a conventional content analysis approach was conducted. The participants included nurses working in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and nurses who had previously left their job or had been absent from work for a period of time. The participants were selected using a purposeful sampling strategy. Data were collected through 19 in-depth, individual semi-structured interviews with 16 nurses. The COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist was used to report the study. FINDINGS: Three categories; commitment and work conscience (with a subcategory of risk-taking), fear (with two subcategories of fear of family infection and fear of protective equipment shortages), and organizational factors (with two subcategories of organizational atmosphere of the hospital and motivational factors), emerged from the analysis. CONCLUSION: The reasons for quitting a nursing job or to keep working as a nurse during the pandemic include both personal and organizational factors. Commitment and work conscience in pandemic conditions is one of the main factors for keeping nurses in their profession. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING PRACTICE AND POLICY: Gaining insight into nurses' understanding of the situation and perspectives is the key to being able to provide appropriate support and keep them in the workforce. Peer support can play an important role in supporting novice nurses in facing challenges posed by a pandemic and should be improved. Also, programs and strategies need to be planned to improve resilience among nurses and to help them to manage their stress and fear.","Varasteh, Saeideh; Esmaeili, Maryam; Mazaheri, Monir",Int. nurs. rev,683,16

We assessed whether the prevalence of symptomatic infections, hospitalization, and deaths in household contacts of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases differed according to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold (Ct) from nasal-pharyngeal swab at diagnosis of linked index cases. Methods: Cross-sectional study on household contacts of COVID-19 cases randomly sampled from all the infections diagnosed in March at our Microbiology Laboratory (Amedeo di Savoia, Turin). Data were retrospectively collected by phone interviews and from the Piedmont regional platform for COVID-19 emergency. Index cases were classified as high (HVl) and low viral load (LVl) according to two exploratory cut-offs of RdRp gene Ct value. Secondary cases were defined as swab confirmed or symptom based likely when not tested but presenting compatible clinical picture. Results: One hundred thirty-two index cases of whom 87.9% symptomatic and 289 household contacts were included. The latter were male and Caucasian in 44.3 and 95.8% of cases, with a median age of 34 years (19–57). Seventy-four were swab confirmed and other 28 were symptom based likely secondary cases. Considering both, the contacts of HVl and LVl did not differ in the prevalence of symptomatic infections nor COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. No difference in median Ct of index cases between symptomatic and asymptomatic, hospitalized and not hospitalized, or deceased and survived secondary cases was found. Negative findings were confirmed after adjusting for differences in time between COVID-19 onset and swab collection of index cases (median 5 days) and after removing pediatric secondary cases. Conclusions: The amount of SARS-CoV-2 of the source at diagnosis does not predict clinical outcomes of linked secondary cases. Considering the impelling release of assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA exact quantification, these negative findings should inform clinical and public health strategies on how to interpret and use the data.","Trunfio, Mattia; Longo, Bianca Maria; Alladio, Francesca; Venuti, Francesco; Cerutti, Francesco; Ghisetti, Valeria; Bonora, Stefano; Di Perri, Giovanni; Calcagno, Andrea",Front Microbiol,683,1

Epithelial cells are the best-known examples of polarized cells, featuring apical and basolateral membrane domains. Mounting evidence suggests that short linear motifs play a major role in protein trafficking to these domains, although the exact rules governing them are still elusive. RESULTS: In this study we prepared neural networks that capture recurrent patterns to classify transmembrane proteins localizing into apical and basolateral membranes. Asymmetric expression of drug transporters results in vectorial drug transport, governing the pharmacokinetics of numerous substances, yet the data on how proteins are sorted in epithelial cells is very scattered.

Forcing University students to stay at home has created enormous stress and uncertainty in their daily life. Objective: This study aimed to assess the perceived stress and coping strategies among undergraduate health science students of Jimma University amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 337 undergraduate health science students from August to September 5, 2020. The perceived stress scale (PSS)-10 and Brief-COPE scale were used to assess the level of stress and coping strategies, respectively. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 22 was employed for data analysis. Logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of high perceived stress. Results: The overall mean [±standard deviation (SD)] age of the participants was 22.88 (±1.78) years. The mean (±SD) PSS score was 22.16 (±1.41), and high perceived stress was reported in 121 (35.9%) participants. The overall mean (±SD) coping score was 72.34 (±12.31), and approach coping was the predominantly used strategy for coping with stress. Personal perception of being stressed by the daily number of COVID-19 cases/deaths in Ethiopia (AOR = 4.61, p < 0.01), rare online talk/chat with friends (AOR = 4.07, p = 0.01), presence of confusion due to the inconsistent strategies developed by the health/government authorities in view of the scientific recommendations (AOR = 2.22, p = 0.01), perception of self/family members being at risk of getting sick (AOR = 0.53, p = 0.03), decreased household income following the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 3.92, p = 0.01), practicing denial (AOR = 1.34, p < 0.01), self-blame (AOR = 1.23, p = 0.02), planning (AOR = 1.28, p = 0.01), and religion (AOR = 1.41, p < 0.01) as means of coping with stress were associated with high perceived stress. Conclusion: Over one-third of the participants had a high level of perceived stress, and the majority of them were practicing effective means of coping with stress.

In addition to the available vaccines, the development of treatments to cure COVID-19 should be done quickly. One of the fastest strategies is to use a drug-repurposing approach. To provide COVID-19 patients with useful information about medicines currently being used in clinical trials, twenty-four compounds, including antiviral agents, were selected and assayed. These compounds were applied to verify the inhibitory activity for the protein function of 3CLpros (main proteases) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, viral reverse-transcriptase inhibitors abacavir and tenofovir revealed a good inhibitory effect on both 3CLpros. Intriguingly, sildenafil, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor also showed significant inhibitory function against them. The in silico docking study suggests that the active-site residues located in the S1 and S2 sites play key roles in the interactions with the inhibitors. The result indicates that 3CLpros are promising targets to cope with SAR-CoV-2 and its variants.

Mutations in recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 result in loss or reduction of V(D)J recombination. It is known that different mutations in RAG genes vary in residual recombinase activity and give rise to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the immunologic mechanisms causing the clinical spectrum of RAG deficiency. METHODS: We included 22 patients with similar RAG1 mutations (c.519delT or c.368_369delAA) resulting in N-terminal truncated RAG1 protein with residual recombination activity but presenting with different clinical phenotypes. We studied precursor B-cell development, immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor repertoire formation, receptor editing, and B- and T-cell numbers. RESULTS: Clinically, patients were divided into 3 main categories: T(−)B(−) severe combined immunodeficiency, Omenn syndrome, and combined immunodeficiency. All patients showed a block in the precursor B-cell development, low B- and T-cell numbers, normal immunoglobulin gene use, limited B- and T-cell repertoires, and slightly impaired receptor editing. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that similar RAG mutations can result in similar immunobiological effects but different clinical phenotypes, indicating that the level of residual recombinase activity is not the only determinant for clinical outcome. We postulate a model in which the type and moment of antigenic pressure affect the clinical phenotypes of these patients.","IJspeert, Hanna; Driessen, Gertjan J.; Moorhouse, Michael J.; Hartwig, Nico G.; Wolska-Kusnierz, Beata; Kalwak, Krzysztof; Pituch-Noworolska, Anna; Kondratenko, Irina; van Montfrans, Joris M.; Mejstrikova, Ester; Lankester, Arjan C.; Langerak, Anton W.; van Gent, Dik C.; Stubbs, Andrew P.; van Dongen, Jacques J.M.; van der Burg, Mirjam",J Allergy Clin Immunol,683,1

However, the COVID-19 vaccine-related conspiracy theories (e.g., falsehoods about birth control, women infertility, surveillance, and microchip humanity, etc.) have built new momentum for vaccine hesitancy. To this end, several nations worldwide, including Pakistan, are struggling to boost public trust and enthusiasm to get vaccinated, especially in an anxious and complicated atmosphere propelled by multiple, new and the deadliest variants of COVID-19. To address this critical research gap during these intensifying conditions of vaccine hesitancy, the present study makes the first attempt to explore the potential effects of various communication strategies, including public service message (safety benefits versus fear appraisals), media types (i.e., traditional versus digital), self-efficacy, perceived benefits and threats (susceptibility and severity), on the willingness to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Importantly, the underlying effects of public skepticism (in a moderating role) on these relationships were empirically examined. Using four fictitious COVID-19 immunization campaigns in a series of experiments with 2 (media type: traditional vs. digital) X 2 (service attribute: health and safety benefits vs. fear) message frames (represented as Group one to Group four), the findings identified fear appraisal as the most viable communication strategy in combating vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, public skepticism negatively moderated the effects of media types and public service message attributes on willingness to get vaccinated in relatively high (i.e., Group two), moderate (i.e., Group one and four), and low intensities (i.e., Group three). The pioneering findings of this research offer new strategic insights for the global health authorities and vaccine promoters to proactively address the downward spiral of people’s willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine.","Jin, Qiang; Raza, Syed Hassan; Yousaf, Muhammad; Zaman, Umer; Siang, Jenny Marisa Lim Dao",Vaccines (Basel),683,1

As a result of the quarantine enforced by governments and authorities worldwide, people had to suddenly adapt their daily routines, including work, study, diet, leisure and fitness activities to the new circumstances. A growing body of research indicates that the engagement with virtual reality (VR) activities can have a positive impact on users’ mental and physical wellbeing. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VR activities on users under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An online survey was carried out to investigate the recreational use of VR during the lockdown period and to gather users’ opinions on its impact on their physical and mental health. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the responses provided by the 646 participants. The results of the survey show that VR use has significantly increased during the lockdown period for most participants, who expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions on the impact of VR activities on their mental and physical wellbeing. Strikingly, self-reported intensity of physical activity was considerably more strenuous in VR users than in console users. Given the current uncertainty as to the duration and course of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of intermittent lockdown in the upcoming years, the outcomes of this study could have a significant impact towards the development and deployment of VR-based strategies aimed at helping the population cope with prolonged social distancing, with particular regards to vulnerable individuals.","Siani, Alessandro; Marley, Sarah Anne",Health Technol (Berl),683,1

Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors. Importance In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.","Nick, Benjamin C.; Pandya, Mansi C.; Lu, Xiaotao; Franke, Megan E.; Callahan, Sean M.; Hasik, Emily F.; Berthrong, Sean T.; Denison, Mark R.; Stobart, Christopher C.",bioRxiv,683,23

Monkey pox epidemics have occurred in remote areas of the Congo Basin. Such outbreaks could potentially become more common with the discontinuation of the cross-protective smallpox vaccination. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in 2002/2003 is another pathogen with significant epidemic potential. Typical for these diseases is a natural circulation between reservoir animals in remote areas. Sporadic transmission to humans can occur through contact with an infected animal.

However, use of these therapies, if ineffective, might delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in some patients. We aimed to determine early predictors of NIRS failure and develop a simple nomogram and online calculator that can identify patients at risk of NIRS failure. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre observational study in 23 hospitals designated for patients with COVID-19 in China. Adult patients (≥18 years) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and acute respiratory failure receiving NIRS were enrolled. A training cohort of 652 patients (21 hospitals) was used to identify early predictors of NIRS failure, defined as subsequent need for IMV or death within 28 days after intensive care unit admission. A nomogram was developed by multivariable logistic regression and concordance statistics (C-statistics) computed. C-statistics were validated internally by cross-validation in the training cohort, and externally in a validation cohort of 107 patients (two hospitals). FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between Jan 1 and Feb 29, 2020. NIV failed in 211 (74%) of 286 patients and HFNC in 204 (56%) of 366 patients in the training cohort. NIV failed in 48 (81%) of 59 patients and HFNC in 26 (54%) of 48 patients in the external validation cohort. Age, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate–oxygenation index (ratio of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate), Glasgow coma scale score, and use of vasopressors on the first day of NIRS in the training cohort were independent risk factors for NIRS failure. Based on the training dataset, the nomogram had a C-statistic of 0·80 (95% CI 0·74–0·85) for predicting NIV failure, and a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·82–0·89) for predicting HFNC failure. C-statistic values were stable in both internal validation (NIV group mean 0·79 [SD 0·10], HFNC group mean 0·85 [0·07]) and external validation (NIV group value 0·88 [95% CI 0·72–0·96], HFNC group value 0·86 [0·72–0·93]). INTERPRETATION: We have developed a nomogram and online calculator that can be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of NIRS failure.

Immune dysregulation is linked to uncontrolled proinflammatory response characterized by the release of cytokines (cytokines storm). A proper control of this response is mandatory to improve clinical prognosis. In this context, glucocorticoids are able to change the expression of several genes involved in the inflammatory response leading to an improvement in acute respiratory distress. Although there are contradictory data in the literature, in this report we highlight the potential benefits of glucocorticoids as adjuvant therapy for hyperinflammation control; emphasizing that adequate dosage, timing, and delivery are crucial to reduce the dysregulated peripheral-and neuro-inflammatory response with minimal adverse effects. We propose the use of the intranasal route for glucocorticoid administration, which has been shown to effectively control the neuro-and peripheral-inflammatory response using low doses without generating unwanted side effects.","Cárdenas, Graciela; Torres-García, Diana; Cervantes, Jaquelynne; Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio; Fleury, Agnes; Fragoso, Gladis; Laclette, Juan Pedro; Sciutto, Edda",Arch Med Res,683,11

Method : Phone interviews were done with 84 patients previously diagnosed with obsession of contamination and compulsive washing. Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was used and the scores of the participants were compared to their prepandemic scores. Results: Only 5 patients (6%) had exacerbation of symptoms after the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the patients did not report any deterioration of symptoms due to the pandemic. Conclusion: Handwashing protocol does not aggravate the washing compulsion of patients. Similarly, the fear of infection with COVID-19 does not increase their fear of contamination.","Chakraborty, Abhijit; Karmakar, Soumen",Iran J Psychiatry,683,1

However, due to limited contact, adequate rehabilitation is difficult to provide for quarantined patients. Telerehabilitation technology could be a solution; however, issues specific to COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, such as strict quarantine and respiratory symptoms, as well as accessibility to deal with rapid increases in need due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation system for patients who are quarantined due to COVID-19 by combining existing commercial devices and computer applications. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has identified the requirements for a telerehabilitation system for COVID-19 and developed the system to satisfy those requirements. In the subsequent feasibility study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=10; mean age 60 years, SD 18 years) were included. A single session of telerehabilitation consisted of stretching exercises, a 15-minute exercise program, and a video exercise program conducted under real-time guidance by a physical therapist through a video call. The system included a tablet computer, a pulse oximeter, videoconferencing software, and remote control software. The feasibility of the system was evaluated using the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ; 14 items) and an additional questionnaire on the telerehabilitation system (5 items). Each item was rated from “1 = strongly disagree” to “5 = strongly agree.” RESULTS: The telerehabilitation system was developed by combining existing devices and applications, including a pulse oximeter and remote control mechanism, to achieve user-friendliness, affordability, and safety, which were determined as the system requirements. In the feasibility study, 9 out of 10 patients were able to use the telerehabilitation system without any on-site help. On the TSQ, the mean score for each item was 4.7 (SD 0.7), and in the additional items regarding telerehabilitation, the mean score for each item was 4.3 (SD 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility of this simple telerehabilitation system in quarantined patients with COVID-19, encouraging further investigation on the merit of the system’s use in clinical practice.","Mukaino, Masahiko; Tatemoto, Tsuyoshi; Kumazawa, Nobuhiro; Tanabe, Shigeo; Katoh, Masaki; Saitoh, Eiichi; Otaka, Yohei",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,683,26

Earlier we showed that the ectodomain of the S protein is not involved in this process. Here we further defined the requirements of the S protein for virion incorporation. We show that the cytoplasmic domain, not the transmembrane domain, determines the association with the M protein and suffices to effect the incorporation into viral particles of chimeric spikes as well as of foreign viral glycoproteins. The essential sequence was mapped to the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain, which is also known to be of critical importance for the fusion function of the S protein. Consistently, only short C-terminal truncations of the S protein were tolerated when introduced into the virus by targeted recombination. The important role of the about 38-residues cytoplasmic domain in the assembly of and membrane fusion by this approximately 1300 amino acids long protein is discussed.","Bosch, Berend Jan; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.; Smits, Saskia L.; Rottier, Peter J.M.",Virology,683,16

Southeast Asia was the first region to be affected outside China, and although COVID-19 cases have been reported in all countries of Southeast Asia, both the policies and epidemic trajectories differ substantially, potentially due to marked differences in social distancing measures that have been implemented by governments in the region. This paper studies the across-country relationships between social distancing and each population’s response to policy, the subsequent effects of these responses to the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis couples COVID-19 case counts with real-time mobility data across Southeast Asia to estimate the effects of host population response to social distancing policy and the subsequent effects on the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. A novel inference strategy for the time-varying reproduction number is developed to allow explicit inference of the effects of social distancing on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 through a regression structure. This framework replicates the observed epidemic trajectories across most Southeast Asian countries, provides estimates of the effects of social distancing on the transmissibility of disease and can simulate epidemic histories conditional on changes in the degree of intervention scenarios and compliance within Southeast Asia.","Lim, Jue Tao; Dickens, Borame Sue Lee; Choo, Esther Li Wen; Chew, Lawrence Zheng Xiong; Koo, Joel Rui Han; Tam, Clarence; Park, Minah; Cook, Alex R",Proc Biol Sci,683,16

Some of them are responsible for cancer formation. In our study we found gene expression from bacteria, archaea, and viruses in the upper female genital tract and this expression was associated with ovarian and endometrial cancer. We also found that the expression from these organisms may be involved in regulatory mechanisms of infection and cancer formation. Some of the processes associated with these organisms may affect cancer heterogeneity and be potential targets for cancer therapy. ABSTRACT: Bacteria, archaea, and viruses are associated with numerous human cancers. To date, microbiome variations in transcription have not been evaluated relative to upper female genital tract cancer risk. Our aim was to assess differences in bacterial, archaea, and viral transcript (BAVT) expression between different gynecological cancers and normal fallopian tubes. In this case-control study we performed RNA sequencing on 12 normal tubes, 112 serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) and 62 endometrioid endometrial cancers (EEC). We used the centrifuge algorithm to classify resultant transcripts into four indexes: bacterial, archaea, viral, and human genomes. We then compared BAVT expression from normal samples, HGSC and EEC. T-test was used for univariate comparisons (correcting for multiple comparison) and lasso for multivariate modelling. For validation we performed DNA sequencing of normal tubes in comparison to HGSC and EEC BAVTs in the TCGA database. Pathway analyses were carried out to evaluate the function of significant BAVTs. Our results show that BAVT expression levels vary between different gynecological cancers. Finally, we mapped some of these BAVTs to the human genome. Numerous map locations were close to regulatory genes and long non-coding RNAs based on the pathway enrichment analysis. BAVTs may affect gynecological cancer risk and may be part of potential targets for cancer therapy.","Gonzalez-Bosquet, Jesus; Pedra-Nobre, Silvana; Devor, Eric J.; Thiel, Kristina W.; Goodheart, Michael J.; Bender, David P.; Leslie, Kimberly K.",Cancers (Basel),683,24

However, conducting a successful RCT has technological and logistical challenges. Defects in randomization processes (e.g., allocation sequence concealment) and flawed masking could bias an RCT’s findings. Moreover, investigators need to address other logistics common to all study designs, such as study invitations, eligibility screening, consenting procedure, and data confidentiality protocols. Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a secure, browser-based web application widely used by researchers for survey data collection. REDCap offers unique features that can be used to conduct rigorous RCTs. METHODS: In September and November 2020, we conducted a parallel group RCT among Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) undergraduate students to understand if receiving the results of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test changed the students’ self-reported protective behavior against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current report, we discuss how we used REDCap to conduct the different components of this RCT. We further share our REDCap project XML file and instructional videos that investigators can use when designing and conducting their RCTs. RESULTS: We reported on the different features that REDCap offers to complete various parts of a large RCT, including sending study invitations and recruitment, eligibility screening, consenting procedures, lab visit appointment and reminders, data collection and confidentiality, randomization, blinding of treatment arm assignment, returning test results, and follow-up surveys. CONCLUSIONS: REDCap offers powerful tools for longitudinal data collection and conduct of rigorous and successful RCTs. Investigators can make use of this electronic data capturing system to successfully complete their RCTs.

This resulted in a lower sugar‐based beverage tax, the Health Promotion Levy (HPL), of approximately 10% coming into effect in April 2018. We provide a synthesis of findings until April 2021. Studies show that despite the lower rate, purchases of unhealthy SSBs and sugar intake consumption from SSBs fell. There were greater reductions in SSB purchases among both lower socioeconomic groups and in subpopulations with higher SSB consumption. These subpopulations bear larger burdens from obesity and related diseases, suggesting that this policy improves health equity. The current COVID‐19 pandemic has impacted food and nutritional security. Increased pandemic mortality among people with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension highlight the importance of intersectoral public health disease‐prevention policies like the HPL, which should be strengthened.","Hofman, Karen J.; Stacey, Nicholas; Swart, Elizabeth C.; Popkin, Barry M.; Ng, Shu Wen",Obes Rev,683,9

Chiropterans are known for hosting a large diversity of viruses, in some cases with little or no effect to their health. Here, we report on the results of a screening for DNA (Herpesviridae) and RNA viruses (Rhabdovirus and Pneumovirus), finding a high prevalence and wide diversity of both Beta- and Gamma-Herpesvirus in insectivorous and hematophagous bats of the southern cone of South America. Our findings suggest that bats in the southern neotropics harbor a high diversity of herpesviruses and, at least in some cases, the viral community in the bat species is more strongly associated with ecological traits of the hosts, rather than their taxonomy. The presence of a separate clade into the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily in the common vampire bat suggests the independent circulation of herpesviruses in hematophagous and insectivorous bats and highlights the properness of these viruses to track vampire bats’ population structure for rabies studies. Hence, we suggest that as other pathogens viruses may be used to track the population dynamics of their hosts, including movement and demographics.

In this study, 106 bioactive terpenoids from African medicinal plants were screened through molecular docking analysis against human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In silico absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion-toxicity (ADMET) and drug-likeness prediction, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, binding free energy calculations, and clustering analysis of MD simulation trajectories were performed on the top docked terpenoids to respective protein targets. RESULTS: The results revealed eight terpenoids with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of different targets. Two pentacyclic terpenoids (24-methylene cycloartenol and isoiguesteri) interacted with the hACE2 binding hotspots for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while the abietane diterpenes were found accommodated within the S1-specificity pocket, interacting strongly with the active site residues TMPRSS2. 3-benzoylhosloppone and cucurbitacin interacted with the RBD and S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein respectively. These interactions were preserved in a simulated dynamic environment, thereby, demonstrating high structural stability. The MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations corroborated the docking interactions. The top docked terpenoids showed favorable drug-likeness and ADMET properties over a wide range of molecular descriptors. CONCLUSION: The identified terpenoids from this study provides core structure that can be exploited for further lead optimization to design drugs against SARS-CoV-2 cell-mediated entry proteins. They are therefore recommended for further in vitro and in vivo studies towards developing entry inhibitors against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

However, some states, such as Connecticut, followed an age-based strategy without considering occupations or co-morbid conditions due to its simplicity in implementation. This strategy raised concerns about exacerbating health inequities because it did not prioritize vulnerable communities, specifically, minorities and low-income groups. The study aims to examine the vaccination inequities among different population groups for people aged 65+. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of quantile-based independent sample t-test was employed to examine the relationship between eight social vulnerability indices (SVIs, i.e., below poverty, unemployed, without high school diploma, disability, minority, speaks English less than well, no vehicle, and mobile homes) and vaccination rates at the town level in Connecticut during the second phase of the vaccine distribution plan when individuals aged 65 and over were eligible. Negative binomial regressions were employed to further justify the relationships between SVIs and vaccination rates. RESULTS: The report shows that the differences in vaccination rates were statistically significant between the most vulnerable and the least vulnerable towns with respect to six SVIs (i.e., below poverty, without high school diploma, disability, minority, speaks English less than well, and no vehicle). The vaccination gap was greater for people aged 75+ than people aged 65–74. Among the selected SVIs, below poverty was negatively correlated with the vaccination rate for 75+, and without high school diploma was negatively correlated with both rates. CONCLUSIONS: This report reveals the significant health inequities in COVID-19 vaccination among the elderly population at the early vaccination phase. It can shed insights into health policy initiatives to improve vaccination coverage in the elderly communities, such as promoting onsite scheduling and increasing at-home vaccination services.","Wang, Hui; Xu, Ran; Qu, Shijin; Schwartz, Marlene; Adams, Aaron; Chen, Xiang",J Infect Public Health,683,26

However, the effect of workflow changes on stroke patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has not been systematically studied. METHODS: A prospective international study was launched at the initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic. All included centers participated in the Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry (STAR) and Endovascular Neurosurgery Research Group (ENRG). Data was collected during the peak months of the COVID-19 surge at each site. Collected data included patient and disease characteristics. A generalized linear model with logit link function was used to estimate the effect of general anesthesia (GA) on in-hospital mortality and discharge outcome controlling for confounders. RESULTS: 458 patients and 28 centers were included from North America, South America, and Europe. Five centers were in high-COVID burden counties (HCC) in which 9/104 (8.7%) of patients were positive for COVID-19 compared with 4/354 (1.1%) in low-COVID burden counties (LCC) (P<0.001). 241 patients underwent pre-procedure GA. Compared with patients treated awake, GA patients had longer door to reperfusion time (138 vs 100 min, P=<0.001). On multivariate analysis, GA was associated with higher probability of in-hospital mortality (RR 1.871, P=0.029) and lower probability of functional independence at discharge (RR 0.53, P=0.015). CONCLUSION: We observed a low rate of COVID-19 infection among stroke patients undergoing MT in LCC. Overall, more than half of the patients underwent intubation prior to MT, leading to prolonged door to reperfusion time, higher in-hospital mortality, and lower likelihood of functional independence at discharge.","Al Kasab, Sami; Almallouhi, Eyad; Alawieh, Ali; Levitt, Michael R; Jabbour, Pascal; Sweid, Ahmad; Starke, Robert M; Saini, Vasu; Wolfe, Stacey Q; Fargen, Kyle M; Arthur, Adam S; Goyal, Nitin; Pandhi, Abhi; Fragata, Isabel; Maier, Ilko; Matouk, Charles; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Howard, Brian M; Kan, Peter; Hafeez, Muhammad; Schirmer, Clemens M; Crowley, R Webster; Joshi, Krishna C; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Chowdry, Shakeel; Ares, William; Ogilvy, Christopher; Gomez-Paz, Santiago; Rai, Ansaar T.; Mokin, Maxim; Guerrero, Waldo; Park, Min S; Mascitelli, Justin R; Yoo, Albert; Williamson, Richard; Grande, Andrew Walker; Crosa, Roberto Javier; Webb, Sharon; Psychogios, Marios N; Ducruet, Andrew F; Holmstedt, Christine A; Ringer, Andrew J; Spiotta, Alejandro M",J Neurointerv Surg,683,16

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. METHODS: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)) or normoxic (21% O(2)/5% CO(2)) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P < 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-α−converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/TACE.

The measures included domestic quarantine (not leaving home) for infected or potentially infected people. Due to the need for social distancing, online activity increased in spring 2020. This could foster the risk for addictive social media use (SMU). The present study investigated tendencies of addictive SMU and their relationship with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms specifically among individuals who stayed in domestic quarantine due to COVID-19 in Germany and Lithuania. METHODS: In Germany (N = 529; quarantine group: n = 157, non-quarantine group: n = 372) and in Lithuania (N = 325; quarantine group: n = 54, non-quarantine group: n = 271), data were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020. RESULTS: In both countries, persons in quarantine had higher levels of addictive SMU, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than individuals who were not in quarantine. The difference was significant only for addictive SMU in the German sample. The significant positive correlations between addictive SMU and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were stronger in both quarantine groups than in the non-quarantine groups. LIMITATIONS: The mostly female, young and well-educated composition of both investigated samples limits generalizability of the current findings. CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal first evidence that the use of social media during domestic COVID-19 quarantine might contribute to the increase of addictive tendencies and negatively impact well-being.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatened to interrupt ART Surge progress following the detection of the first case in Nigeria in February 2020. To overcome this disruption, CDC Nigeria designed and implemented adapted ART Surge strategies during February–September 2020. METHODS: Adapted ART Surge strategies focused on continuing expansion of HIV services while mitigating COVID-19 transmission. Key strategies included an intensified focus on community-based, rather than facility-based, HIV case-finding; immediate initiation of newly-diagnosed PLHIV on 3-month ART starter packs (first ART dispense of 3 months of ART); expansion of ART distribution through community refill sites; and broadened access to multi-month dispensing (MMD) (3–6 months ART) among PLHIV established in care. State-level weekly data reporting through an Excel-based dashboard and individual PLHIV-level data from the Nigeria National Data Repository facilitated program monitoring. RESULTS: During February–September 2020, the reported number of PLHIV initiating ART per month increased from 11,407 to 25,560, with the proportion found in the community increasing from 59 to 75%. The percentage of newly-identified PLHIV initiating ART with a 3-month ART starter pack increased from 60 to 98%. The percentage of on-time ART refill pick-ups increased from 89 to 100%. The percentage of PLHIV established in care receiving at least 3-month MMD increased from 77 to 93%. Among PLHIV initiating ART, 6-month retention increased from 74 to 92%. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid and flexible HIV program response, focused on reducing facility-based interactions while ensuring delivery of lifesaving ART, was critical in overcoming COVID-19-related service disruptions to expand access to HIV services in Nigeria during the first eight months of the pandemic. High retention on ART among PLHIV initiating treatment indicates immediate MMD in this population may be a sustainable practice. HIV program infrastructure can be leveraged and adapted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Boyd, Andrew T.; Jahun, Ibrahim; Dirlikov, Emilio; Greby, Stacie; Odafe, Solomon; Abdulkadir, Alhassan; Odeyemi, Olugbenga; Dalhatu, Ibrahim; Ogbanufe, Obinna; Abutu, Andrew; Asaolu, Olugbenga; Bamidele, Moyosola; Onyenuobi, Chibuzor; Efuntoye, Timothy; Fagbamigbe, Johnson O.; Ene, Uzoma; Fagbemi, Ayodele; Tingir, Nguhemen; Meribe, Chidozie; Ayo, Adeola; Bassey, Orji; Nnadozie, Obinna; Boyd, Mary Adetinuke; Onotu, Dennis; Gwamna, Jerry; Okoye, McPaul; Abrams, William; Alagi, Matthias; Oladipo, Ademola; Williams-Sherlock, Michelle; Bachanas, Pamela; Chun, Helen; Carpenter, Deborah; Miller, David A.; Ijeoma, Ugonna; Nwaohiri, Anuli; Dakum, Patrick; Mensah, Charles O.; Aliyu, Ahmad; Oyeledun, Bolanle; Okonkwo, Prosper; Oko, John O.; Ikpeazu, Akudo; Aliyu, Gambo; Ellerbrock, Tedd; Swaminathan, Mahesh",AIDS Res Ther,683,20

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2,826 participants working in hospitals and Fire and Police services in England, UK during the pandemic (ISRCTN5660922). Of these, 2,672 were unselected volunteers recruited irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results, and 154 others were recruited separately specifically because they previously tested positive. At recruitment in June 2020, we measured numbers of interferon-y; secreting, SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells using T-SPOT Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kits (Oxford Immunotec Ltd), and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins using commercial immunoassays. We then described time to microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, stratified by immunological parameters. Results: T cells responsive to the spike (S), nuclear (N) and membrane proteins (M) dominated the responses measured. Using the sum of the spots (responsive cells within each well of 250,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) for S, N and M antigens minus the control, the 2,672 unselected participants were divided into those with higher responses (n=669, 25.4%; median 30 spots (IQR 18,54)) and those with low responses (n=2016, 76.7%, median 3 (IQR 1,6)), the cutoff we derived being 12 spots. Of the participants with higher T cell responses, 367 (53%) had detectable antibodies against the N or S proteins. During a median of 118 days follow-up, 20 participants with lower T cell responses developed COVID-19, compared with none in the population with high T cell responses (log-rank test, p=6x10-3). Conclusions: Peripheral blood SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell numbers are associated with risk of developing COVID-19.","WYLLIE, D. H.; Mulchandani, R.; Jones, H.

This study explored the socioecological factors that influence work–life balance (WLB) and how they operate. The relationships between WLB, subjective wellbeing, employee wellbeing and quality time allocation were examined. A total of 1063 responses were received, using an online survey. The results show that relational, community and societal factors directly influenced the individual factors and were indirectly associated with perceived WLB. Individual factors (i.e., personal feelings, behaviours and health) were found to be the crucial determinants of an individual’s perceived WLB. It was found that WLB positively correlated with employee wellbeing and quality and quantity of personal life-time. Subjective wellbeing was found to be a significant moderator in the relationship between WLB and its outcomes.

The high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) make it a significant threat to global public health. Elucidating its pathogenesis is essential to finding effective therapy. A retrospective study was conducted on 71 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on cytokines, T lymphocytes, and other clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from patients with variable disease severity. The effects of cytokines on the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients were analyzed. The critically severe and severe patients had higher infection indexes and significant multiple organ function abnormalities than the mild patients (P<0.05). IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critically severe patients than in the severe and mild patients (P<0.05).

In severe COVID-19 cases, an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines has been observed in the bloodstream, forming the so-called “cytokine storm”. Generally, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation intensely induces cytokine production as an inflammatory response to viral infection. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome can be a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, this review first introduces the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway. Second, we review the cellular/molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., viroporins, ion flux and the complement cascade). Furthermore, we describe the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (e.g., cytokine storm, respiratory manifestations, cardiovascular comorbidity and neurological symptoms).

METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase with the keywords: inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and COVID‐19, novel coronavirus and SARS‐CoV‐2. We included studies reporting the frequency of COVID‐19 infection and outcomes (hospitalisation, need for intensive care unit care and mortality) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We estimated the pooled incidence of COVID‐19 in inflammatory bowel disease and comparative risk vis‐a‐vis the general population. We also estimated the pooled frequency of outcomes and compared them in patients who received and did not receive drugs for inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Twenty‐four studies were included. The pooled incidence rate of COVID‐19 per 1000 patients of inflammatory bowel disease and the general population were 4.02 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1.44–11.17]) and 6.59 [3.25–13.35], respectively, with no increase in relative risk (0.47, 0.18–1.26) in inflammatory bowel disease. The relative risk of the acquisition of COVID‐19 was not different between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (1.03, 0.62–1.71). The pooled proportion of COVID‐19‐positive inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit care was 27.29% and 5.33% while pooled mortality was 4.27%. The risk of adverse outcomes was higher in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease. The relative risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were lower for patients on biological agents (0.34, 0.19–0.61; 0.49, 0.33–0.72 and 0.22, 0.13–0.38, respectively) but higher with steroids (1.99, 1.64–2.40; 3.41, 2.28–5.11 and 2.70, 1.61–4.55) or 5‐aminosalicylate (1.59, 1.39–1.82; 2.38, 1.26–4.48 and 2.62, 1.67–4.11) use. CONCLUSION: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is comparable to the general population.

Given the high asymptomatic rate of COVID-19, as well as unreliable temperature checking and contact history taking, it is important to understand the role of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction (OGD) in the diagnosis of COVID-19. The aim of this study is to determine how initial symptoms of OGD can be used to screen patients for COVID-19 laboratory testing. METHODS: We followed recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement to conduct this systematic review study. We used OGD-related key words to search for literature published between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 on Pubmed, Ovid Medline databases. We estimated the prevalence of OGD and compared it with that of other OGD-related symptoms. The weighted summary proportion under the fixed and random effects model was assessed using MedCalc statistical software. Whenever there was heterogeneity, a random effects model was selected. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. RESULTS: A total of 25 articles (evidence level III:5; IV:20) were identified and reviewed. Data synthesis of 19 articles revealed that the pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 is 53.56% (range 5.6-100%, 95% CI 40.25-66.61%). The pooled prevalence of gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 is 43.93% (range 1.5-85.18%, 95% CI 28.72-59.74%), just behind fever (62.22%, range 18.18-95.83%, 95% CI 54.82-69.33%), cough (64.74%, range 38.89-87.5%, 95% CI 57.97-71.22%), and fatigue (56.74%, range 6.25-93.62%, 95% CI 32.53-79.35%). The prevalence of gustatory dysfunction in subgroup with objective evaluation is lower than those without (9.91% vs. 49.21%, relive risk 2.82, p<0.001).

This study examines the role of localized urban SIPO policy in curbing COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we explore (i) the comparative effectiveness of county-level SIPOs in urbanized as compared to non-urbanized areas, (ii) the mechanisms through which SIPO adoption in urban counties yields COVID-related health benefits, and (iii) whether late adoption of a statewide SIPO yields health benefits beyond those achieved from early adopting counties. We exploit the unique laboratory of Texas, a state in which the early adoption of local SIPOs by densely populated counties covered almost two-thirds of the state's population prior to adoption of a statewide SIPO on April 2, 2020. Using an event study framework, we document that countywide SIPO adoption is associated with an 8 percent increase in the percent of residents who remain at home full-time and between a 13 to 19 percent decrease in foot-traffic at venues that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 such as restaurants, bars, hotels, and entertainment venues. These social distancing effects are largest in urbanized and densely populated counties. Then, we find that in early adopting urban counties, COVID-19 case growth fell by 21 to 26 percentage points two-and-a-half weeks following adoption of a SIPO, a result robust to controls for county-level heterogeneity in COVID-19 outbreak timing, coronavirus testing, the age distribution, and political preferences. We find that approximately 90 percent of the curbed growth in COVID-19 cases in Texas came from the early adoption of SIPOs by urbanized counties, suggesting that the later statewide shelter-in-place mandate yielded relatively few health benefits.","Dave, Dhaval; Friedson, Andrew; Matsuzawa, Kyutaro; Sabia, Joseph J.; Safford, Samuel",J Urban Econ,683,16

IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5′ end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and subsequent 40S recruitment. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 interacts rapidly and strongly with IFIT3 forming a stable heterotetramer. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that associates with IFIT1, forming an IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 trimer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a C-terminal ‘YxxxL’ motif in IFIT1 that mediates its association with IFIT3. Using various reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate for the first time that IFIT3 stabilises IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA and enhances its translation inhibition activity. Disrupting the binding interface between IFIT1 and IFIT3 abrogated this enhancement. This work reveals molecular aspects of IFIT assembly and provides an important ‘missing link’ between IFIT interaction and function.","Fleith, Renata C; Mears, Harriet V; Emmott, Edward; Graham, Stephen C; Mansur, Daniel S; Sweeney, Trevor R",bioRxiv,683,1

All patients were tested for ferritin, interleukin-6, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, calcitonin, and C-reactive protein. According to the diagnostic criteria, three groups of patients with different subtypes of cytokine storm syndrome were identified: MAS, CRS or sepsis. In the MAS and CRS groups, treatment results were assessed depending on whether or not tocilizumab was used. Results: MAS was diagnosed in 9.1% of the patients examined, CRS in 81.8%, and sepsis in 9.1%. Median serum ferritin in patients with MAS was significantly higher (5894 vs. 984 vs. 957 ng/mL, p < 0.001) than in those with CRS or sepsis. Hypofibrinogenemia and pancytopenia were also observed in MAS patients. In CRS patients, a higher mortality rate was observed among those who received tocilizumab, 21 vs. 10 patients (p = 0.043), RR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.0–4.3). In MAS patients, tocilizumab decreased the mortality, 13 vs. 6 patients (p = 0.013), RR = 0.50 (95% CI 0.25–0.99). Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy in patients with COVID-19 and CRS was associated with increased mortality, while in MAS patients, it contributed to reduced mortality.","Oliynyk, Oleksandr; Barg, Wojciech; Slifirczyk, Anna; Oliynyk, Yanina; Gurianov, Vitaliy; Rorat, Marta",Viruses,683,1

Hepcidin plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Thus, ERFE was suggested to protect against ACD in various diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is commonly involved with ACD and high hepcidin levels, with a further increase of the latter in active states. The present study is a case-control study that aimed to determine the pattern of ERFE expression in RA patients with concomitant ACD and study its relationship with hepcidin, erythropoietin (EPO) and disease activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five RA patients with ACD were categorized into active and inactive RA using the disease activity score (DAS28); 15 healthy subjects were included as control subjects. ERFE was measured for patients and control subjects using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, in addition to testing for CBC, ESR, CRP, iron profile parameters and hepcidin. EPO was assessed for patients of both active and inactive RA groups. RESULTS: ERFE and hepcidin showed the highest levels in active RA; ERFE values were similar in control subjects and inactive RA patients, while hepcidin was significantly higher in inactive RA than control subjects. Patients with high ERFE levels had higher RBC, Hct, MCV, hepcidin and EPO levels. Stepwise regression analysis has identified DAS28 and disease duration as the best predictors of ERFE values, whereas ERFE and hepcidin were independent predictors of disease activity. CONCLUSION: We introduce ERFE as a novel marker of RA activity. Although the inhibitory effect of ERFE on hepcidin is not evident, our results still indicate that ERFE may have a beneficial erythropoietic effect in the context of ACD in RA disease activity.","Youssef, Soha R; Hassan, Esraa H; Morad, Caroline S; Elazab Elged, Adel A; El-Gamal, Rasha A",J Inflamm Res,683,26

METHODS: We describe 5 patients with probable CAA-RI according to a validation study of proposed criteria for the diagnosis of CAA-RI at University Hospital Josep Trueta of Girona. We consider some clinical characteristics which include the response to immunotherapy, CSF findings, and MRI features. The patient’s neurologic outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: We collected 5 patients admitted for probable CAA-RI. Most were women and the median age was 72 years. The median mRS score at the onset of disease was 1. Parietal lobes were most affected clinically as well as radiologically. Two patients had intracranial hemorrhage. Decreased levels of CSF amyloid beta 42 and 40 protein were observed. Corticosteroids were used in four patients and a remarkable improvement was observed in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: CAA-RI is a condition that predominantly affects parietal lobes according to our case series and this involvement seems to be directly related to a greater burden of microbleeds, cortical siderosis, WMH, and lobar hemorrhages on these lobes. Decreased levels of CSF amyloid beta protein plus increased total tau protein should be considered as part of the diagnostic criteria of CAA-RI. We recommend corticosteroids using, as they have been demonstrated to be very effective in managing CAA-RI.","Bravo, Gary Álvarez; Cirera, Laura Sánchez; Torrentà, Lluís Ramió",Neurol Sci,683,16

The likelihood of SARS infection was strongly associated with the amount of personal protection equipment perceived to be inadequate, having <2 hours of infection control training, and not understanding infection control procedures. No significant differences existed between the case and control groups in the proportion of workers who performed high-risk procedures, reported minor protection equipment problems, or had social contact with SARS-infected persons.

In several countries, waiting time guarantees mandate set time limits for assessment and treatment. High-quality waiting time data are necessary to evaluate and improve waiting times. This study’s aim was to investigate health care providers and administrative management professionals’ perceptions of validity and usefulness of waiting time reporting in specialist care. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 28) were conducted with administrative management and care professionals (line managers and care providers) in specialized clinics in the Stockholm Region, Sweden. Clinic-specific data from the waiting time registry was used in the care provider interviews to assess face validity. Clinics were purposefully sampled for maximum variation in complexity of care, volume of production, geographical location, private or public ownership, and local waiting times. Thematic analysis was used. RESULTS: The waiting time registry was perceived to have low validity and usefulness. Perceived validity and usefulness were interconnected, with mechanisms that reinforced the connection. Structural and cognitive barriers to validity included technical and procedural errors, errors caused by role division, misinterpretation of guidelines, diverging interpretations of nonregulated cases and extensive willful manipulation of data. CONCLUSIONS: We identify four misconceptions underpinning the current waiting time reporting system: passive dissemination of guidelines is sufficient as implemented, cognitive load of care providers to report waiting times is negligible, soft-law regulation and presentation of outcome data is sufficient to drive improvement, and self-reported data linked to incentives poses a low risk of data corruption. To counter low validity and usefulness, we propose the following for policy makers and administrative management when developing and implementing waiting time monitoring: communicate guidelines with instructions for operationalization, address barriers to implementation, ensure quality through monitoring of implementation and adherence to guidelines, develop IT ontology together with professionals, avoid parallel measurement infrastructures, ensure waiting times are presented to suit management needs, provide timely waiting time data, enable the study of single cases, minimize manual data entry, and perform spot-checks or external validity checks. Several of these strategies should be transferable to waiting time monitoring in other contexts.

Few studies, however, have characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections in households. METHODS: We conducted a case-ascertained study of household transmission in Nashville, TN starting in April 2020, after recommendations to stay at home were enacted. Index cases were ambulatory patients identified through clinical RT-PCR testing at Vanderbilt walk-in-clinics dispersed across the Nashville metropolitan area. For this study, the index case was the first person presenting with respiratory or compatible symptoms in a household and who lived with at least one other household member. After informed consent was obtained, household members were remotely trained in the self-collection of nasal swabs and use of REDCap electronic questionnaires. Household members completed daily symptom diaries and collected daily nasal swabs for 14 days. Contact patterns within households before and after disease onset were ascertained. Nasal swab samples were tested using RT-PCR at an academic research laboratory. RESULTS: At the time of writing, 18 families were enrolled (including 18 index cases and 34 household members) with at least 1 follow-up nasal swab tested. The median age of index cases and household members was 37 years (IQR: 26–46) and 27 years (15–39), respectively. The median number of days from index patient onset of symptoms to first sample collected in the household was 4 (2–5). Before onset of symptoms, 83% of index cases spent >4 hours in the same room with at least one other household member, whereas after disease onset and diagnosis, 44% did. Among 34 non-index household members, 18 (53%) had a positive test during follow-up; the median number of days from index case’s symptoms onset to first positive detection in a household member was 4.5 (3–5) days. Interestingly, 13 (72%) of 18 secondary infections were detected within the first 3 days of follow-up, whereas 5 (28%) were detected during subsequent days. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households is high, with many infections detected during the initial days of study follow-up. DISCLOSURES: Carlos G.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 47 maintenance hemodialysis patients who infected with COVID-19 and admitted to our hospital. According to their clinical outcome, these patients were divided into a survival group (n = 38) and a fatality group (n = 9). Information on the general condition and laboratory parameters of the patients were collected. Laboratory parameters were compared between different groups. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis patients. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in age, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on admission (P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the values of AUC of CRP, neutrophil count, LDH, white blood cell count, albumin, and procalcitonin were 0.895, 0.813, 0.758, 0.757, 0.743, and 0.728, respectively.

Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 1,036,030 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 30,806 NGS datasets from GISAID and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 2.5% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.6% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 5,472 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only 21 and 14 recurrent variants were found in at least 1% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 2.6% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition. These findings demonstrate the continuous importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Schrörs, Barbara; Riesgo-Ferreiro, Pablo; Sorn, Patrick; Gudimella, Ranganath; Bukur, Thomas; Rösler, Thomas; Löwer, Martin; Sahin, Ugur",PLoS One,683,5

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Linton, Natalie M; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.",,683,1

Here we identify a consensus peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated Covid-19 patients who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The core signature conspicuously blended adaptive B cell responses typical of virus infection or vaccination with discrete traits hitherto associated with sepsis, including monocyte and dendritic cell dampening, and hyperactivation and depletion of discrete T cell subsets. This blending of immuno-protective and immuno-pathogenic potentials was exemplified by near-universal CXCL10/IP10 upregulation, as occurred in SARS1 and MERS. Moreover, specific parameters including CXCL10/IP10 over-expression, T cell proliferation, and basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion correlated, often prognostically, with Covid-19 progression, collectively composing a resource to inform SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and risk-based patient stratification.","Laing, A.

Methods Participants’ sociodemographic and medical data were collected, and they were also assessed for physical function (handgrip and walking speed), cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and frailty (Frail-NH scale) before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (October to December 2019, ""pre-COVID-19"") and after (June to July 2020, ""post-COVID-19""). COVID-19 symptoms and clinical course were recorded for the cases. Results Between the pre- and post-COVID-19 assessments, we found a 19% greater deterioration in handgrip, a 22% greater increase in walking speed, and a 21% greater increase in Frail-NH scores in cases compared with controls. In both cases and controls, on the other hand, there was a significant 10% decrease in MMSE scores over the study period. Multivariable logistic regression showed that COVID-19 survivors had a four-fold increased chance of developing frailty compared with controls (OR = 4.95, 95% CI: 1.13-21.6, p=0.03), but not cognitive decline. Conclusions and implications COVID-19 can accelerate the aging process of institutionalized older adults in terms of physical performance and frailty by around 20%. However, we found similar levels of decline in cognitive performance in both cases and controls, likely due to the burden of social isolation and containment measures on neuropsychological health.","Greco, Giada Ida; Noale, Marianna; Trevisan, Caterina; Zatti, Giancarlo; Pozza, Martino Dalla; Lazzarin, Martina; Haxhiaj, Labjona; Ramon, Roberto; Imoscopi, Alessandra; Bellon, Stefano; Maggi, Stefania; Sergi, Giuseppe",J Am Med Dir Assoc,683,1

The rationale for current and potential therapies for the common cold are reviewed in the context of current concepts of the pathogenesis of these illnesses. Data sources and study selection A MEDLINE literature search was done using the search terms common cold, rhinovirus, and viral respiratory infection. The search was restricted to the English language. Articles were selected for review if the title and/or abstract suggested the content was relevant to the subject of this review. The bibliographies of selected articles were used as a source of additional literature. Results Recent studies suggest that the host response to the virus is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of the common cold. Inflammatory mediators, especially the pro-inflammatory cytokines, appear to be an important component of this response and present an attractive target for new interventions for common cold therapies. Currently available treatments for the common cold have limited efficacy against specific symptoms. These therapies should be selected to treat the specific symptoms that are perceived to be the most bothersome by the patient.","Turner, Ronald B","Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",683,16

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular.","Elia, Uri; Ramishetti, Srinivas; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Dammes, Niels; Bar-Haim, Erez; Naidu, Gonna Somu; Makdasi, Efi; Yahalom-Ronen, Yfat; Tamir, Hadas; Paran, Nir; Cohen, Ofer; Peer, Dan",ACS Nano,683,15

Exosomes offer a diverse range of opportunities that can be exploited in the treatment of various diseases post-functionalization. This membrane engineering is recently being used in the management of bacteria-associated diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is among the most crippling disease of society with a large share of its imposing economic burden. DM in a chronic state is associated with the development of micro- and macrovascular complications. DFU is among the diabetic microvascular complications with the consequent occurrence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived exosomes post-tailoring hold promise to accelerate the diabetic wound repair in DFU associated with bacterial inhabitant. These exosomes promote the antibacterial properties with regenerative activity by loading bioactive molecules like growth factors, nucleic acids, and proteins, and non-bioactive substances like antibiotics. Functionalization of MSC-derived exosomes is mediated by various physical, chemical, and biological processes that effectively load the desired cargo into the exosomes for targeted delivery at specific bacterial DFUs and wound. The present study focused on the application of the cargo-loaded exosomes in the treatment of DFU and also emphasizes the different approaches for loading the desired cargo/drug inside exosomes. However, more studies and clinical trials are needed in the domain to explore this membrane engineering.","Raghav, Alok; Tripathi, Prashant; Mishra, Brijesh Kumar; Jeong, Goo-Bo; Banday, Shahid; Gautam, Kirti Amresh; Mateen, Qazi Noorul; Singh, Prem; Singh, Manish; Singla, Akhil; Ahmad, Jamal",Front Microbiol,683,33

Alginate (2% m/v) functionalized with green extracts from hop (Humulus lupulus L.) cones (HE; 0.5 and 1%, v/v) was used as a coating material in order to assess the best performing strategy, leading to the most stable product. At the concentrations used to formulate the edible coatings, no contribution related to hop bitterness on the final product was recorded. The results were compared to control samples (without edible coating and coated only with alginate at 2% m/v). The plant extract was characterized by its main chemical traits and by (1)H NMR profiling, revealing the presence of antioxidant and antimicrobial bioactive compounds (i.e., alpha and beta hop acids, xanthohumol). Furthermore, the characteristics of the samples during cold storage were evaluated by physico-chemical (i.e., weight loss, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, pH, color attributes) and nutraceutical (i.e., total polyphenol, ascorbic acid content, total carotenoids, chlorophylls) traits.

Yet, there is growing evidence of their specific distress associated with facing multiple abrupt changes and the need for rapid adaptation to a variety of academic, social, and financial challenges. The extent of their exposure to COVID-19 media and the associated media-related stress may further impair students’ perceived coping. Objective: This study assessed COVID-19-related functional difficulties and perceived coping among higher education students in Israel and explored the moderating role played by media coverage of the pandemic in inducing stress and exacerbating COVID-19-related difficulties in perceived coping among students. Method: Data was collected from 7,446 students from seven academic centres in Israel through online questionnaires about four to six weeks after the outbreak of the pandemic in Israel. Results: The findings showed positive associations between COVID-19-related difficulties, media exposure, media-related stress, and decreased levels of perceived coping with the pandemic. Moreover, media-related stress (but not the level of media exposure) moderated the relationship between COVID-19-related difficulties and perceived coping: the associations were significantly stronger for students reporting high media-related stress in comparison to individuals reporting low media-related stress. Conclusions: These results highlight the specific role of media-related stress and the need to distinguish this risk factor from the global impact of exposure to media coverage. The need for self-monitoring of the subjective level of stress associated with media exposure should be part of the psychoeducation efforts provided by public health authorities for promoting self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pat-Horenczyk, Ruth; Bergman, Yoav S.; Schiff, Miriam; Goldberg, Alon; Cohen, Ayala; Leshem, Becky; Jubran, Hisham; Worku- Mengisto, Wovit; Berkowitz, Ruth; Benbenishty, Rami",European journal of psychotraumatology,683,24

The causative pathogen is a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with genomic similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The disease is transmitted among humans either through direct contact or via droplets from sneeze or cough. Most infected persons remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but some patients may develop severe clinical features, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis and even death. People of advanced age and/or with underlying diseases (including diabetes mellitus) are at greater risk. The innate and adaptive immune system are responsible for protecting the body against viral infection. Nevertheless, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the immune system through immunomodulating mechanisms which intensify its pathogenesis. A delayed or reduced response of the innate immune system is critical for the development of pathogenesis of the virus. People with diabetes are more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. The present article speculates that special aspects of the immune dysfunction caused by chronic hyperglycaemia is the main reason for this susceptibility.","Milionis, Charalampos; Milioni, Stella Olga",J Diabetes Metab Disord,683,4

However, compared to high-end analyzers in hospitals, LFA devices, in particular, paper- based LFA tests, fall short in accuracy. This study focuses on two ways to improve LFAs: (1) using cellulose fibers, rather than glass fibers for a sample pad, and (2) incorporating a one-step simple, facile, and low cost PVA dam into the LFA. Both strategies (cellulose fiber as a sample pad and water dissolvable PVA dam) contributed to delaying the controlled biomolecule’s flow through the nitrocellulose membrane’s capillary channels resulting in increased bio-recognition time, thus contributing to the enhancement of LFA sensitivity. PVA modified cellulose fiber-based LFA demonstrated 10 times higher sensitivity than the cellulose fiber-based unmodified LFA, whereas 2 times enhancement was obtained in the cellulose fiber-based sample pad LFA compared to the glass fiber-based sample pad LFA. Ultimately, 20 times increase in sensitivity was achieved in the modified LFA device.

Several predictive factors of mortality have been identified; however, none has been validated in patients presenting with mild disease. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, presenting with mild symptoms, and requiring hospitalization in a non‐intensive care unit with known discharge status were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed. Demographical, clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded, as need for non‐invasive mechanical ventilation and admission in intensive care unit. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of death. RESULTS: Between 28 February and 10 April 2020, 229 consecutive patients were included in the study cohort; the majority were males with a mean age of 60 years. 54% of patients had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension being the most commonly represented, followed by diabetes mellitus. 196 patients were discharged after a mean of 9 days, while 14.4% died during hospitalization because of respiratory failure. Age higher than 75 years, low platelet count (<150 × 10(3)/mm(3)) and higher ferritin levels (>750 ng/mL) were independent predictors of death. Comorbidities were not independently associated with in‐hospital mortality.

Matériels et méthodes Une enquête épidémiologique transversale a été mis en place en février et mars 2021 à destination de l’ensembles des soignants de Guyane à l’aide d’un questionnaire en ligne sur le site wepi.org, diffusé par mailing larges en partenariat avec les structures de santé du territoire, les URPS et les ordres médecins et infirmiers, la lettre de l’ARS, les groupes What'sApp de professionnels, sous forme de QR code affichés et sur les fonds d’écran des ordinateurs professionnels et sur support papier dans les services du CH de Cayenne et les 17 centres délocalisés de prévention et de soins (CDPS) des communes de l’intérieur. Résultats Au total, 578 professionnels de santé ont répondu à l’enquête, dont 42 % de médecins ou sage femmes, 37 % d’infirmiers et 20 % d’autres professionnels de santé. Les médecins et les infirmiers exerçaient en libéral (30 % et 23 %), en milieu hospitalier (48 % et 51 %) et en CDPS (10 % et 18 %, respectivement). Dans l’ensemble, 91 % des soignants interrogés se déclaraient favorables aux vaccinations en général, mais 26 % défavorables à certains vaccins. Concernant la vaccination contre le COVID-19, 65 % étaient déjà vaccinés ou envisageaient probablement de se faire vacciner, 11 % étaient indécis et 24 % déclaraient ne pas vouloir se faire vacciner. L’intention vaccinale était plus élevée parmi les médecins (87 %) que parmi les infirmiers et les autres professions de santé (50 % et 46 %, p <0,001). Le refus du vaccin n’était pas différent selon le mode d’exercice, libéral ou hospitalier. L’opposition au vaccin était plus fréquente parmi les femmes (30 %), les moins de 35 ans (37 %) et parmi les professionnels de santé originaires de Guyane et des Antilles françaises (48 %). Ces facteurs restaient associés en analyse multivariée par régression logistique. À l’inverse, parmi les professionnels originaires de métropole ou de l’étranger, elle n’était pas différente en fonction de l’ancienneté d’arrivée en Guyane (qui était en médiane de 8 ans, IIQ [19–2]). Elle ne variait pas non plus en fonction du lieu d’exercice. Conclusion Les intentions vaccinales des professionnels de santé de Guyane française dans la période initiale de mise à disposition des vaccins sont assez contrastées, avec près d’un soignant sur quatre ne souhaitant pas se faire vacciner.","Vignier, N.; Brureau, K.; Granier, S.; Breton, J.; Agostini, C.; Epelboin, L.; Valdes, A.; Abboud, P.; Djossou, F.; Douine, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,683,1

METHODS: We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes. RESULTS: Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1–10(2), on hands in the order of 10(3). Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. CONCLUSIONS: The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.","Weber, Thomas P.; Stilianakis, Nikolaos I.",J Infect,683,33

By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokine–cytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from the literature and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated the literature information on cell–cytokine interactions from two systems of immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell–cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine–cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink, we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify cell types and cytokine interactions following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting important cytokine interactions that might contribute to severe illness in a subgroup of patients. Such findings have the potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies. CytokineLink is freely available for the scientific community through the NDEx platform and the project github repository.","Olbei, Marton; Thomas, John P.; Hautefort, Isabelle; Treveil, Agatha; Bohar, Balazs; Madgwick, Matthew; Gul, Lejla; Csabai, Luca; Modos, Dezso; Korcsmaros, Tamas",Cells,683,26

METHODS: A survey was designed by Lupus Europe’s patient advisory network and distributed through its social media, newsflash and members' network. People with lupus were asked about their last HCQ purchases and their level of anxiety (on a 0–10 scale) with regard to not being able to have access to HCQ, once in April 2020 (first wave) and after 11 August (second wave). The results were compared. RESULTS: 2075 patients responded during the first wave; 1001 (48.2%) could get HCQ from the first place they asked, 230 (11.1%) could get the drug by going to more than one pharmacy, 498 (24.0%) obtained HCQ later from their usual pharmacy and 126 (6.1%) from other sources. 188 (9.1%) could not get any; 32 (1.5%) did not respond to this question. All countries showed significant improvement in HCQ availability during the second wave. 562 (27.4%) patients reported an extremely high level of anxiety in wave 1 and 162 (10.3%) patients in wave 2; 589 (28.7%) and 268 (17.1%) patients reported a high level of anxiety in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The HCQ shortage had a significant impact on patients with SLE and has been responsible for psychological consequences including anxiety. Indeed, despite an objective improvement in drug availability, the event is leaving significant traces in patients’ mind and behaviours.","Cornet, Alain; Andersen, Jeanette; Tani, Chiara; Mosca, Marta",Lupus Sci Med,683,15

This is expensive in terms of lost jobs, lost economic productivity, and lost freedoms. So it is of interest to ask: What is the optimal intensity with which to lockdown, and how should that intensity vary dynamically over the course of an epidemic? This paper explores such questions with an optimal control model that recognizes the particular risks when infection rates surge beyond the healthcare system’s capacity to deliver appropriate care. The analysis shows that four broad strategies emerge, ranging from brief lockdowns that only “smooth the curve” to sustained lockdowns that prevent infections from spiking beyond the healthcare system’s capacity. Within this model, it can be optimal to have two separate periods of locking down, so returning to a lockdown after initial restrictions have been lifted is not necessarily a sign of failure. Relatively small changes in judgments about how to balance health and economic harms can alter dramatically which strategy prevails. Indeed, there are constellations of parameters for which two or even three of these distinct strategies can all perform equally well for the same set of initial conditions; these correspond to so-called triple Skiba points. The performance of trajectories can be highly nonlinear in the state variables, such that for various times [Formula: see text] , the optimal unemployment rate could be low, medium, or high, but not anywhere in between. These complex dynamics emerge naturally from modeling the COVID-19 epidemic and suggest a degree of humility in policy debates. Even people who share a common understanding of the problem’s economics and epidemiology can prefer dramatically different policies. Conversely, favoring very different policies is not evidence that there are fundamental disagreements.","Caulkins, Jonathan P.; Grass, Dieter; Feichtinger, Gustav; Hartl, Richard F.; Kort, Peter M.; Prskawetz, Alexia; Seidl, Andrea; Wrzaczek, Stefan",J Math Econ,683,32

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO(2) and PaCO(2), pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

In this paper, we report a case of a 39-year-old male with excessive body weight and a history of borderline values of arterial hypertension without therapy, who was mainly complaining of progressive dyspnea after being diagnosed with mild COVID-19. According to the recent guidelines on the holistic assessment and management of patients who had COVID-19, all preferred diagnostic procedures, including multidetector computed tomography (CT), CT pulmonary angiogram, and echocardiography, should be conducted. However, in our patient, no underlying cardiopulmonary disorder has been established. Therefore, considering all additional symptoms our patient had beyond dyspnea, our initial differential diagnosis included anxiety-related dysfunctional breathing. However, psychiatric evaluation revealed that our patient had only a mild anxiety level, which was unlikely to provoke somatic complaints. We decided to perform further investigations considering that cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) represents a reliable diagnostic tool for patients with unexplained dyspnea. Finally, the CPET elucidated the diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, which was the most probable cause of progressive dyspnea in our patient. We suggested that, based on uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors our patient had, COVID-19 triggered a subclinical form of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) to become clinically manifest.

Amidst many critical issues, work-family conflict (WFC) remains a central topic, due to the hardships in separating different life domains, the pervasiveness of technology, and decreased opportunities for recovery, all considering new, emerging job demands. Although many studies have involved healthcare workers, less attention has been paid to technical-administrative staff (TA); moreover, previous studies about the impact of remote working on WFC have provided mixed results. OBJECTIVES: The study aims at examining the relationships between WFC and cognitive demands, off-work hours technology assisted job demands (off-TAJD) and recovery, in the TA of a hospital in northwest Italy. METHODS: A sample of 211 individuals (response rate of 58%), in line with the population, filled in an online self-report questionnaire in the second half of April 2020. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed a positive relationship between WFC and perceived ICT stress, off-TAJD and cognitive demands, and a negative relationship with recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the role of cognitive demands, technology overload and invasiveness, as potential predictors of WFC. The results also indicate the mitigating role of recovery, even in the face of a prolonged and forced experience of remote work. The study emphasises the need for transparent policies, based on trust, autonomy and right to disconnect, and the centrality of training, especially for supervisors, on topics such as evaluation of results, proper recovery management and correct use of technology.","Ghislieri, Chiara; Molino, Monica; Dolce, Valentina; Sanseverino, Domenico; Presutti, Michele",Med Lav,683,10

Some patients also experience neurological signs and symptoms ranging from anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, and vomiting to confusion, encephalitis, and stroke. Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies.

Our aim was to determine whether the administration of adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSC) is safe and potentially useful in these patients. METHODS: Thirteen COVID-19 adult patients under invasive mechanical ventilation who had received previous antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory treatments (including steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and/or tocilizumab, among others) were treated with allogeneic AT-MSC. Ten patients received two doses, with the second dose administered a median of 3 days (interquartile range-IQR- 1 day) after the first one. Two patients received a single dose and another patient received 3 doses. Median number of cells per dose was 0.98 × 10(6) (IQR 0.50 × 10(6)) AT-MSC/kg of recipient's body weight. Potential adverse effects related to cell infusion and clinical outcome were assessed. Additional parameters analyzed included changes in imaging, analytical and inflammatory parameters. FINDINGS: First dose of AT-MSC was administered at a median of 7 days (IQR 12 days) after mechanical ventilation. No adverse events were related to cell therapy. With a median follow-up of 16 days (IQR 9 days) after the first dose, clinical improvement was observed in nine patients (70%). Seven patients were extubated and discharged from ICU while four patients remained intubated (two with an improvement in their ventilatory and radiological parameters and two in stable condition). Two patients died (one due to massive gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to MSC therapy).

Since then, the scientific work regarding the transmission risk factors of COVID-19 has been intense. The relationship between COVID-19 and environmental conditions is becoming an increasingly popular research topic. Based on the findings of the early research, we focused on the community of Madrid, Spain, which is one of the world’s most significant pandemic hotspots. We employed different multivariate statistical analyses, including principal component analysis, analysis of variance, clustering, and linear regression models. Principal component analysis was employed in order to reduce the number of risk factors down to three new components that explained 71% of the original variance. Cluster analysis was used to delimit the territory of Madrid according to these new risk components. An ANOVA test revealed different incidence rates between the territories delimited by the previously identified components. Finally, a set of linear models was applied to demonstrate how environmental factors present a greater influence on COVID-19 infections than socioeconomic dimensions. This type of local research provides valuable information that could help societies become more resilient in the face of future pandemics.","Pérez-Segura, Víctor; Caro-Carretero, Raquel; Rua, Antonio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,683,16

METHODS: Mental health clinicians (N = 117) completed the Clinician Virtual‐Care Experience Survey assessing the following domains: ease of technology use, client/patient‐provider interaction quality, and clinician wellbeing. RESULTS: Although over 70% of clinicians had not used virtual‐care to deliver mental health services prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, more than 80% felt it was easy to operate the virtual platforms. Clinicians were divided in their perceptions of the effectiveness of virtual‐care, with only 42% reporting that they felt they were as effective in delivering healthcare services virtually as compared to in‐person. Virtual‐care was described as being more effective for specific populations, while challenges were described in building rapport and when delivering difficult or unexpected feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians felt there were some benefits of adopting virtual‐care practices, while challenges were also identified. Understanding of the impact of virtual‐care on service providers is essential in order to strengthen mental healthcare for children, adolescents, and their families even beyond the pandemic.","Romanchych, Erin; Desai, Riddhi; Bartha, Christina; Carson, Neill; Korenblum, Marshall; Monga, Suneeta",Early Interv Psychiatry,683,26

Aspirin is often prescribed for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities that might increase mortality, thus, may falsely demonstrate increased mortality. To reduce bias, we only enrolled studies that performed the adjusted analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov from the inception of the database up until 16 April 2021. The exposure was active prescription of low-dose aspirin during or prior to hospitalization. The primary outcome was mortality. The pooled adjusted effect estimate was reported as relative risk (RR). RESULTS: There were 6 eligible studies that were included in this meta-analysis, comprising of 13,993 patients. The studies have a low-moderate risk of bias based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis indicates that low-dose aspirin use was independently associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.46 [0.35, 0.61], p < 0.001; I(2): 36.2%). Subgroup analysis on in-hospital low-dose aspirin administration also showed statistically significant mortality reduction (RR 0.39 [0.16, 0.96], p < 0.001; I(2): 47.0%). CONCLUSION: Low-dose aspirin use is independently associated with reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19 with a low certainty of evidence.

This is particularly relevant during the non-specific innate stage of the immune response; as such, the quality of this response may dictate specific adaptive responses and conferred memory/protection to that specific antigen or pathogen. Therefore, adjuvants may optimise this response in the most appropriate way for a specific disease. The most commonly used traditional adjuvants are aluminium salts; however, a biodegradable adjuvant, MCT(®), was developed for application in the niche area of allergy immunotherapy (AIT), also in combination with a TLR-4 adjuvant—Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL(®))—producing the first adjuvant system approach for AIT in the clinic. In the last decade, the use and effectiveness of MCT(®) across a variety of disease models in the preclinical setting highlight it as a promising platform for adjuvant systems, to help overcome the challenges of modern vaccines. A consequence of bringing together, for the first time, a unified view of MCT(®) mode-of-action from multiple experiments and adjuvant systems will help facilitate future rational design of vaccines while shaping their success.","Heath, Matthew D.; Mohsen, Mona O.; de Kam, Pieter-Jan; Carreno Velazquez, Thalia L.; Hewings, Simon J.; Kramer, Matthias F.; Kündig, Thomas M.; Bachmann, Martin F.; Skinner, Murray A.",Front Immunol,683,16

The aim of this study was to explore the protective effects of modafinil on gastric erosions induced by indomethacin, water-immersion stress, and alcohol in rats and to evaluate the role of nitric oxide (NO) pathway. Animals were allocated to the three experimental models of gastric ulcer – indomethacin (30 mg/kg PO), water-immersion stress, and ethanol (5 ml/kg PO). Induction of gastric ulcer in all models caused an increase in J-score (macroscopic assessment), biochemical markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and microscopic destructions. Administration of modafinil (50 and 100 mg/kg i. p) significantly improved J-score in the indomethacin (P < 0.05) and stress models (P < 0.001). Moreover, the level of TNF-α IL-1β, and MPO was deceased after modafinil administration (P < 0.001). However, modafinil did not have any effects on gastric injury induced by ethanol. In addition, co-administration of L-NAME (a non-specific NO synthase inhibitor) and aminoguanidine (an inducible NO synthase inhibitor) with modafinil significantly neutralized the gastroprotective effect of modafinil in the indomethacin and water-immersion stress groups (P < 0.05, and P < 0.01; respectively), while 7-nitroindazole (a neuronal NO synthase inhibitor) did not show such reversing effects. In conclusion, modafinil possesses gastroprotective effects on the gastric lesions induced by indomethacin and stress, which are probably mediated via the inflammation inhibition and NO pathway modulation.","Dejban, Pegah; Eslami, Faezeh; Rahimi, Nastaran; Takzare, Nasrin; Jahansouz, Mohamadmostafa; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza",Eur J Pharmacol,683,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were directly involved in the development using a User Center Design (UCD) approach. We conducted usability interviews prior to hospital discharge, before a user started using the application. A technology acceptance questionnaire was administered to evaluate user self-perception after 2 weeks of use. RESULTS: The following features were developed; pill identification, patient-friendly drug information leaflet, side effect checker, and interaction checker, adherence monitoring and alerts, weekly medication schedule, daily pill reminders, messaging service, and patient medication reviews. The usability interviews show a 98.3% total success rate for all features, severity (on a scale of 1–4) 1.4 (SD 0.79).

We aimed to determine if vaccination reduces hospital visits in breakthrough COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort analysis compared unvaccinated (UV), partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV) adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring emergency care(EC)/hospitalization within an eight-hospital system in Michigan. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from the electronic record. Vaccination data was obtained from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry and Centers for Disease Control vaccine tracker. Primary endpoint was rate of emergency care/hospitalization encounters among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Secondary outcome was severe disease-composite outcome (ICU, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death). FINDINGS: Between December 15,2020 and April 30,2021, 11,834 EC encounters were included:10,880 (91.9%) UV, 825 (7%) PV, 129 (1.1%) FV. Average age was 53.0 ± 18.2 and 52.8% were female. Accounting for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination population groups in Michigan, the ED encounters/hospitalizations rate relevant to COVID-19 was 96% lower in FV versus UV (multiplicative effect:0.04, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.06, p < 0.001) in negative binomial regression. COVID-19 EC visits rate peaked at 22.61, 12.88, and 1.29 visits per 100000 for the UV, PV, and FV groups, respectively. In the propensity-score matching weights analysis, FV had a lower risk of composite disease compared to UV but statistically insignificant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). INTERPRETATION: The need for emergency care/hospitalization due to breakthrough COVID-19 is an exceedingly rare event in fully vaccinated patients. As vaccination has increased regionally, EC visits amongst fully vaccinated individuals have remained low and occur much less frequently than unvaccinated individuals. If hospital-based treatment is required, elderly patients with significant comorbidities are at high-risk for severe outcomes regardless of vaccination status.","Bahl, Amit; Johnson, Steven; Maine, Gabriel; Garcia, Martha Hernandez; Nimmagadda, Srinivasa; Qu, Lihua; Chen, Nai-Wei",Lancet Reg Health Am,683,16

Several tumor-suppressors have been shown to be excluded from the cell nucleus in cancer cells by the nuclear export receptor CRM1 and abnormal expression of CRM1 is oncogenic. Inhibition of CRM1 has long been postulated as potential approach for the treatment of cancer and to overcome therapy resistance. Furthermore, the nuclear export of viral components mediated by the CRM1 is crucial in various stages of the viral lifecycle and assembly of many viruses from diverse families, including coronavirus. However, the first nuclear export inhibitors failed or never entered into clinical trials. More recently CRM1 reemerged as a cancer target and a successful proof of concept was achieved with the clinical approval of Selinexor. The chemical complexity of natural products is a promising perspective for the discovery of new nuclear export inhibitors with a favorable toxicity profile. Several screening campaigns have been performed and several natural product-based nuclear export inhibitors have been identified. With this review we give an overview over the role of CRM1-mediated nuclear export in cancer and the effort made to identify and develop nuclear export inhibitors in particular from natural sources.","Ferreira, Bibiana I.; Cautain, Bastien; Grenho, Inês; Link, Wolfgang",Front Pharmacol,683,24

New SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) are emerging all over the world, with the threat of being more readily transmitted, being more virulent, or escaping naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the United Kingdom, UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1) variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. FINDINGS: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected.

Methods: Fourth year medical students completed a questionnaire regarding knowledge, skills, and attitudes on patient safety and quality improvement in medical care. The questionnaire was voluntarily answered online prior to and after the course. Results: In total, 213 students completed the questionnaires. Most students were able to understand medical error, recognize failure and the nature of causation, perform root-cause analysis, and appreciate the role of patient safety interventions. Conversely, a disapproving perspective prevailed among students concerning the preventability of medical errors, utility of reporting systems, just culture and infrastructure (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We found students had a positive perspective concerning learning quality in healthcare and patient safety during our course; nevertheless, their perception of the usefulness of reporting systems to prevent future adverse events and prevent medical errors is uncomplimentary.

Among all, the recent discoveries relating to RNA-G4s, including their potential involvement as antiviral targets against COVID-19, have triggered the ever-increasing need to develop selective molecules able to interact with parallel G4s. Naphthalene diimides (NDIs) are widely exploited as G4 ligands, being able to induce and strongly stabilize these structures. Sometimes, a reversible NDI-G4 interaction is also associated with an irreversible one, due to the cleavage and/or modification of G4s by functional-NDIs. This is the case of NDI-Cu-DETA, a copper(II) complex able to cleave G4s in the closest proximity to the target binding site. Herein, we present two original Cu(II)-NDI complexes, inspired by NDI-Cu-DETA, differently functionalized with 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol side-chains, to selectively drive redox-catalyzed activity towards parallel G4s. The selective interaction toward parallel G4 topology, controlled by the presence of 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol side chains, was already firmly demonstrated by us using core-extended NDIs. In the present study, the presence of protonable moieties and the copper(II) cavity, increases the binding affinity and specificity of these two NDIs for a telomeric RNA-G4. Once defined the copper coordination relationship and binding constants by competition titrations, ability in G4 stabilization, and ROS-induced cleavage were analyzed. The propensity in the stabilization of parallel topology was highlighted for both of the new compounds HP2Cu and PE2Cu. The results obtained are particularly promising, paving the way for the development of new selective functional ligands for binding and destructuring parallel G4s.","Pirota, Valentina; Lunghi, Enrico; Benassi, Alessandra; Crespan, Emmanuele; Freccero, Mauro; Doria, Filippo",Molecules,683,16

The prevalence in children is high, and it potentially contributes to significant morbidity. Iota-carragenan, a polymer derived from red seaweed, has reduced viral load in nasal secretions and alleviated symptoms in adults with common cold. METHODS: We have assessed the antiviral and therapeutic activity of a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan in children with acute symptoms of common cold. A cohort of 153 children between 1–18 years (mean age 5 years), displaying acute symptoms of common cold were randomly assigned to treatment with a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan (0.12%) as verum or 0.9% sodium chloride solution as placebo for seven days. Symptoms of common cold were recorded and the viral load of respiratory viruses in nasal secretions was determined at two consecutive visits. RESULTS: The results of the present study showed no significant difference between the iota carrageenan and the placebo group on the mean of TSS between study days 2–7. Secondary endpoints, such as reduced time to clearance of disease (7.6 vs 9.4 days; p = 0.038), reduction of viral load (p = 0.026), and lower incidence of secondary infections with other respiratory viruses (p = 0.046) indicated beneficial effects of iota-carrageenan in this population. The treatment was safe and well tolerated, with less side effects observed in the verum group compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this study iota-carrageenan did not alleviate symptoms in children with acute symptoms of common cold, but significantly reduced viral load in nasal secretions that may have important implications for future studies.

Our main contribution is to quantify this gap by calibrating the model with unique survey data from Germany on social distancing and impure altruism from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal policy is to drastically reduce contacts at the beginning to almost eradicate the epidemic and keep them at levels that contain the pandemic at a low prevalence level. We find that also in laissez faire, private protection efforts by forward-looking, risk averse individuals would have stabilized the epidemic, but at a much higher prevalence of infection than optimal.

Several critical genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are specifically expressed in GT. However, the molecular mechanism of differential gene expression between GT and other tissue types remains elusive. Chromatin accessibility, defined as the degree to which nuclear molecules are able to interact with chromatin DNA, reflects gene expression capacity to a certain extent. Here, we investigated and compared the landscape of chromatin accessibility in Artemisia annua leaf and GT using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) technique. We identified 5413 GT high accessible and 4045 GT low accessible regions, and these GT high accessible regions may contribute to GT-specific biological functions. Several GT-specific artemisinin biosynthetic genes, such as DBR2 and CYP71AV1, showed higher accessible regions in GT compared to that in leaf, implying that they might be regulated by chromatin accessibility. In addition, transcription factor binding motifs for MYB, bZIP, C2H2, and AP2 were overrepresented in the highly accessible chromatin regions associated with artemisinin biosynthetic genes in glandular trichomes. Finally, we proposed a working model illustrating the chromatin accessibility dynamics in regulating artemisinin biosynthetic gene expression. This work provided new insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression in GT.","Zhou, Limeng; Huang, Yingzhang; Wang, Qi; Guo, Dianjing",Molecules,683,24

Therefore, it is imperative to review the existing agendas, vision, mission, and objectives of well-known public health associations across the globe and how COVID-19 might change these agendas in the future. We appraised the existing agendas, vision, mission, scope, objectives, and priorities of public health associations and highlighted how these agendas might change over time following this pandemic. Majority of these associations have changed their style of working, they have adapted and modified their strategies, list of priorities, modes, and means of communication, approaches for collaboration, ways of training and educating professionals, and to greater extent associations have also changed their way of researching with special focus on COVID-19. Public health associations have become prime bodies to spread true information to communities and also to take a leadership role in the research, training, and communication. Although public health associations need to revisit their vision, mission, and priorities by developing some strategies, these associations should not deviate from their goals of promoting wellbeing, preventing diseases and disability, and providing equitable health care to the masses mainly during COVID-19 pandemic. These transitions are relevant for primary care physicians as they can be involved in research in an area that is germane to both public health and clinical practice.

More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A(2A) receptor signaling for the treatment of COVID-19.","Abouelkhair, Mohamed A.",Med Hypotheses,683,1

Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host.

The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets in the course of COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective study, the levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets including CD4(+), CD8(+), CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+), CD38(+), CD3(+)HLA-DR(+), CD19(+), CD20(+), and CD16(+)CD56(+) cells were measured by flow cytometry in 52 confirmed hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at the day of admission and after 7 days of care. Clinical response was defined as improvement in symptoms (fever, dyspnea, and cough as well as blood oxygen saturation), and patients who met these criteria after 1 week of admission were classified as early responders; others who survived and finally discharged from the hospital were classified as late responders and patients who died were categorized as nonresponders. Immunophenotyping of studied cell changes on the first day of admission and 7 days after treatment were compared. Besides, the correlation between cellular subset variation and clinical response and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Total counts of white blood cell, T cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD38(+) lymphocytes, and CD3(+)HLA-DR(+) lymphocytes were significantly increased in both early and late responders. No statistically significant difference was observed in CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, B cells, FOXP3(+)Treg lymphocytes, and FOXP3 median fluorescence intensity among studied groups. According to the multivariate analysis, an increase in CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.019), CD8(+) T cells (p = 0.001), and administration of interferon (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of clinical response.

The Genecards and OMIM databases were used for identifying the targets related to COVID-19. The STRING database was used to analyze the intersection targets. Compound - target interaction and protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape to decipher the anti-COVID-19 mechanisms of action of the prescription. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action. Finally, the interaction between the targets and the active compounds was verified by molecular docking technology. RESULTS: A total of 66 targets were identified.

Based on the chemical structure of a lead compound from a previous screening, we have designed and synthesized a number of non-peptidyl inhibitors, some of which have shown significantly improved inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M(pro) with IC(50) values of ∼60 nM. In the absence of SARS-CoV M(pro) crystal structures in complex with these synthetic inhibitors, molecular docking tools have been employed to study possible interactions between these inhibitors and SARS-CoV M(pro). The docking results suggest two major modes for the initial binding of these inhibitors to the active site of SARS-CoV M(pro). They also establish a structural basis for the ‘core design’ of these inhibitors by showing that the 3-chloropyridine functions common to all of the present inhibitors tend to cluster in the S1 specificity pocket. In addition, intrinsic flexibility in the S4 pocket allows for the accommodation of bulky groups such as benzene rings, suggesting that this structural plasticity can be further exploited for optimizing inhibitor–enzyme interactions that should promote a tighter binding mode. Most importantly, our results provide the structural basis for rational design of wide-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases from coronaviruses and picornaviruses.","Niu, Chunying; Yin, Jiang; Zhang, Jianmin; Vederas, John C.; James, Michael N.G.",Bioorg Med Chem,683,20

METHODS: To specifically assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in late pregnancy, we prospectively recruited 315 consecutive women delivering in a referral hospital located in Lombardy, Italy in the early phase of the epidemic. Restriction of the recruitment to this peculiar historical time period allowed to exclude infections occurring early in pregnancy and to limit the recall bias. All recruited subjects underwent a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of Sars-Cov-2 using Real-time PCR. In addition, two different types of antibodies for the virus were evaluated in peripheral blood, those against the spike proteins S1 and S2 of the envelope and those against the nucleoprotein of the nucleocapsid. Women were considered to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy if at least one of the three assessments was positive. RESULTS: Overall, 28 women had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy (8.9%). Women diagnosed with the infection were more likely to report one or more episodes of symptoms suggestive for Covid-19 (n = 11, 39.3%) compared to unaffected women (n = 39, 13.6%). The corresponding OR was 4.11 (95%CI: 1.79–9.44). Symptoms significantly associated with Covid-19 in pregnancy included fever, cough, dyspnea and anosmia. Only one woman necessitated intensive care. Pregnancy outcome in women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection did not also differ. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is asymptomatic in three out of five women in late pregnancy and is rarely severe.

Available evidence demonstrates clearly that viral infection of the CNS results in a dramatic increase in chemokine gene expression. Moreover, production of chemokines in response to infection is highly focused within areas of viral replication early in the disease process and areas of viral RNA persistence during the chronic stages of disease. Resident glial cells are capable of generating a robust chemokine response following viral infection in the absence of inflammatory cells suggesting that this response may reflect an innate CNS response against viral infection analogous to the response of phagocytic cells in the periphery. Differences in virus and cellular tropism are likely explanations for the slight differences in chemokine profiles and duration of expression observed in the different models. The non-ELR CXC chemokine CXCL10 is often the predominant chemokine expressed early following viral infection suggesting an important role as a sentinel molecule in initiating neuroinflammation. Based on the studies presented in this chapter, it is clear that targeting chemokines during either acute or chronic viral-induced CNS disease may offer exciting new insights into potentially novel interventional mechanisms in treating human neuroinflammatory diseases.","Lane, Thomas E.; Buchmeier, Michael J.",Universes in Delicate Balance,683,19

Obesity is one of the leading comorbidities, which is associated with many other diseases. In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis estimating the effects of overweight and obesity on COVID-19 disease severity. Methodology: Two electronic databases (Medline and Cochrane library) and one grey literature database (Grey Literature Report) were searched using the following keywords: overweight, obesity, body mass index, respiratory disease, coronavirus, COVID-19. The risks of bias of the selected studies were assessed by using the Navigation Guide method for human data. Both random and fixed effect meta-analysis were determined using Review Manager (RevMan) software version 5.4. Results: After initial screening, 12 studies (7 cohort studies, four case-control studies, and one cross-sectional study) were fulfilled the eligibility criteria, comprising a total of 405359 patients and included in the systematic review. The pooled risk of disease severity was 1.31 times higher based on both fixed and random effect model among those overweight patients, I2 0% and 2.09 and 2.41 times higher based on fixed and random effect respectively among obese patients, I2 42% compared to healthy individuals. Conclusion: Overweight and obesity are common risk factors for disease severity of COVID-19 patients. However, further assessment of metabolic parameters included BMI, waist-hip ratio, and insulin levels, are required to estimate the risk factors of COVID-19 patients and understanding the mechanism between COVID-19 and body mass index.","Chowdhury, A.

The lifestyle of adolescents has undergone severe changes. Almost every school started online education for the first time. Some adolescents have shown low resilience when faced with these changes. Most previous research has focused on mindfulness training and resilience by using cross-sectional or two-point tracking designs. However, little is known about the developmental trajectories of the impact of mindfulness training on resilience, particularly during this epidemic. Therefore, this study aims to explore how the developmental trajectories of resilience are impacted by mindfulness training. After administering the CD-RISC, we recruited 90 students with low levels of resilience in intervention group. Finally, 84 adolescents provided data at each assessment. At the same time, we selected 90 students in the control group. Paired sample t-test was used to compare every factor defined above by time. The result showed that mindfulness training increased students' resilience and emotional intelligence in experiment group. Then in the experiment group, latent growth modeling was used to (1) examine initial levels and changes in resilience over time and (2) predict initial levels and growth in resilience based on emotional intelligence. The findings of this study are as follows: during a mindfulness training intervention, (1) individual resilience tends to increase, and rate of increase grows gradually; there are also significant individual differences in the initial level and development speed; (2) individual emotional intelligence can promote the growth of resilience. With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, more and more attention is paid to the mental health of students.

The aim of this study was to determine whether different muscle adipose tissue depots are associated with mortality and muscle damage in patients affected by COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. METHODS: CT images were obtained in 153 ICU patients with COVID-19 (121 males and 32 females). Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, Creatine PhosphoKinase (CPK), muscle density, and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were measured. RESULTS: Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle had the shorter 28-day survival from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the first tertile. Estimates derived from the Cox proportional hazard models, after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR 3.94, 95% CI: 1.03–15.09). Participants in the lowest tertile of muscle density had the shorter survival at 28 days from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the highest tertile (HR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.18–4.61), but the relationship was no longer significant when age was included in the model. Subjects in the second muscle density tertile did not show an increased risk. Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle and those in the lowest tertile of muscle density showed both significantly higher CPK adjusted for weight values as evaluated during the first 8 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our data seem to suggest that higher levels of IMAT/muscle and low muscle density are both associated with higher risk of ICU mortality and muscle injury as evaluated with CPK level.","Rossi, Andrea P.; Gottin, Leonardo; Donadello, Katia; Schweiger, Vittorio; Brandimarte, Piero; Zamboni, Giulia A.; Florio, Alessandro; Boetti, Riccardo; Pavan, Gaia; Zamboni, Mauro; Polati, Enrico",Front Physiol,683,29

The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated growing concerns about the burden of anxiety due to the confluence of physical health risks, economic stressors, social isolation, and general disruption of daily activities. OBJECTIVE: This study examines differences in anxiety outcomes by care modality (coaching, teletherapy and telepsychiatry, and combined care) within an on-demand mental health system. We also explore the association between levels of engagement within each care modality and odds of improvement in symptoms of anxiety. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of individuals who accessed Ginger, an on-demand mental health system. Data were collected from 1611 Ginger members between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used logistic regression to assess the association between care modality and improvement in anxiety symptoms. Within each modality, we assessed the association between level of engagement and improvement. RESULTS: Of 1611 Ginger members, 761 (47.0%) experienced a decrease in anxiety symptoms, as measured by a change from a positive to a negative 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screen. Among members who still screened positive at follow-up (865/1611, 53%), a total of 192 members (11.9%) experienced a clinically significant score reduction in the full GAD-7 (ie, a score reduction of >5 points), even though their GAD-2 scores were still positive. All modalities showed increased odds of improvement compared to those who were not engaged with coaching or clinical services (“app-only”). Higher GAD-7 intake scores were also associated with decreased odds of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This study found increased odds of anxiety improvement for all care modalities compared to those who did not engage in care, with larger effect sizes for higher utilization within all care modalities. Additionally, there is a promising observation that those engaged in combined care (teletherapy and text-based coaching) had the greatest odds of anxiety improvement. Future directions include more detailed classifications of utilization patterns and an exploration of explanations and solutions for lower-utilization members.","Kunkle, Sarah; Yip, Manny; Hunt, Justin; Ξ, Watson; Udall, Dana; Arean, Patricia; Nierenberg, Andrew; Naslund, John A",JMIR Form Res,683,29

The aim of this research is to test the feasibility of such a system and its ability to detect risk factors and to assess ILI-related behaviors. Participants filled in a web-based socio-demographic and behavioral questionnaire upon registration, and a weekly symptoms survey during the influenza season. ILI incidence was calculated weekly, and risk factors associated to ILI were analyzed at the end of each season. From November 2016 to May 2019, 1247 participants were included. The crossing of the Sentinel System (Sentinella) epidemic threshold was associated with an increase or decrease of Grippenet ILI incidence, within the same week or earlier. The number of active users varied according to ILI incidence. Factors associated with ILI were: ages 0–4 compared with 5–14 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.99), 15–29 (AOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15–0.60), and 65+ (AOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16–0.93); female sex (male AOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.7–0.95); respiratory allergies (AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.38–1.96), not being vaccinated (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.9–3.04); and self-employment (AOR 1.97, 95% CI 1.33–3.03). Vaccination rates were higher than those of the general population but not high enough to meet the Swiss recommendations. Approximately, 36.2% to 42.5% of users who reported one or more ILIs did not seek medical attention. These results illustrate the potential of Grippenet in complementing Sentinella for ILI monitoring in Switzerland.","Richard, Aude; Müller, Laura; Wisniak, Ania; Thiabaud, Amaury; Merle, Thibaut; Dietrich, Damien; Paolotti, Daniela; Jeannot, Emilien; Flahault, Antoine",Vaccines (Basel),683,11

Guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided a framework for gradual reopening of outpatient clinical operations. As the infrastructure to restart endoscopy has been more clearly described, patient concerns regarding viral transmission during the procedure have been identified. Moreover, the efficacy of the measures in preventing transmission have not been clearly delineated. METHODS: We identified patients with pandemic-related procedure cancellations from 3/16/2020 to 4/20/2020. Patients were stratified into tier groups (1–4) by urgency. Procedures were performed using our hospital risk mitigation strategies to minimize transmission risk. Patients who subsequently developed symptoms or tested for COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS: Among patients requiring emergent procedures, 57.14% could be scheduled at their originally intended interval. COVID-19 concerns represented the most common rescheduling barrier. No patients who underwent post-procedure testing were positive for COVID-19. No cases of endoscopy staff transmission were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Non-COVID-19 related patient care during the pandemic is a challenging process that evolved with the spread of infection, requiring dynamic monitoring and protocol optimization. We describe our successful model for reopening endoscopy suites using a tier-based system for safe reintroduction of elective procedures while minimizing transmission to patients and staff. Important barriers included financial and transmission concerns that need to be addressed to enable the return to pre-pandemic utilization of elective endoscopic procedures.","Nguyen, Christopher; Kline, Kevin T.; Merwat, Shehzad; Merwat, Sheharyar; Luthra, Gurinder; Parupudi, Sreeram; Cohn, Steven",BMC Gastroenterol,683,11

Here we assess ten available HCV protease inhibitor drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. There is a striking structural similarity of the substrate binding clefts of SARS- CoV-2 Mpro and HCV NS3/4A proteases, and virtual docking experiments show that all ten HCV drugs can potentially bind into the Mpro binding cleft. Seven of these HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity, while four dock well into the PLpro substrate binding cleft and inhibit PLpro protease activity. These same seven HCV drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in Vero and/or human cells, demonstrating that HCV drugs that inhibit Mpro, or both Mpro and PLpro, suppress virus replication.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a survey of published NMAs on drug interventions. SETTING: NMAs indexed in PubMed (searches updated in May 2020). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Lag times were measured as the time between the last systematic search and the article submission, acceptance, online publication, indexing and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) allocation dates. Time-to-event analyses were performed considering independent variables (geographical origin, Journal Impact Factor, Scopus CiteScore, open access status) (SPSS V.24, R/RStudio). RESULTS: We included 1245 NMAs. The median time from last search to article submission was 6.8 months (204 days (IQR 95–381)), and to publication was 11.6 months. Only 5% of authors updated their search after first submission. There is a very slightly decreasing historical trend of acceptance (rho=−0.087; p=0.010), online publication (rho=−0.080; p=0.008) and indexing (rho=−0.080; p=0.007) lag times. Journal Impact Factor influenced the MeSH allocation process, but not the other lag times. The comparison between open access versus subscription journals confirmed meaningless differences in acceptance, online publication and indexing lag times. CONCLUSION: Efforts by authors to update their search before submission are needed to reduce evidence production time. Peer reviewers and editors should ensure authors’ compliance with NMA standards. The accuracy of these findings depends on the accuracy of the metadata used; as we evaluated only NMA on drug interventions, results may not be generalisable to all types of studies.","Tonin, Fernanda S; Araujo, Ariane G; Fachi, Mariana M; Ferreira, Vinicius L; Pontarolo, Roberto; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando",BMJ Open,683,30

An additional target enrichment step is generally needed for high-sensitivity pathogen identification in low-titre infections, yet available methods using PCR or capture probes can be limited by high cost, narrow scope of detection, lengthy protocols and/or cross-contamination. Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while simultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We evaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment and mean 47% (±16%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone. Virus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was comparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the detection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma samples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or co-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including Powassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE.

Despite decades of study, the behavior of the pulmonary surfactant at the molecular scale is poorly understood, which hinders the development of effective surfactant replacement therapies, useful in the treatment of several lung-related diseases. In this work, we combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, Langmuir trough measurements, and AFM imaging to study synthetic four-component lipid monolayers designed to model protein-free pulmonary surfactant. We characterized the structural and dynamic properties of the monolayers with a special focus on lateral heterogeneity. Remarkably, simulations reproduce almost quantitatively the experimental data on pressure-area isotherms and the presence of lateral heterogeneities highlighted by AFM. Quite surprisingly, the pressure-area isotherms do not show a plateau region, despite the presence of liquid-condensed nanometer-sized domains at surface pressures larger than 20 mN/m. In the simulations, the liquid-condensed domains were small and transient, but they did not coalesce to yield a separate phase. They were only slightly enriched in DPPC and cholesterol, and their chemical composition remained very similar to the overall composition of the monolayer membrane. Instead, they differed from liquid-expanded regions in terms of membrane thickness (in agreement with AFM data), diffusion rates, as well as acyl chain packing and orientation. We hypothesize that such lateral heterogeneities are crucial for lung surfactant function, as they allow both efficient packing, to achieve low surface tension, and sufficient fluidity, critical for rapid adsorption to the air–liquid interface during the breathing cycle.","Liekkinen, Juho; de Santos Moreno, Berta; Paananen, Riku O.; Vattulainen, Ilpo; Monticelli, Luca; Bernardino de la Serna, Jorge; Javanainen, Matti",Front Cell Dev Biol,683,8

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases.

Our objective was to understand mechanisms of persistence of PRRS virus (PRRSV) in tonsil. Transcriptome data from tonsil samples collected at 42 days post infection (dpi) were generated by RNA-seq and NanoString on 51 pigs that were selected to contrast the two PRRSV isolates used, NVSL and KS06, high and low tonsil viral level at 42 dpi, and the favorable and unfavorable genotypes at a genetic marker (WUR) for the putative PRRSV resistance gene GBP5. RESULTS: The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) differed markedly between models with and without accounting for cell-type enrichments (CE) in the samples that were predicted from the RNA-seq data. This indicates that differences in cell composition in tissues that consist of multiple cell types, such as tonsil, can have a large impact on observed differences in gene expression. Based on both the NanoString and the RNA-seq data, KS06-infected pigs showed greater activation, or less inhibition, of immune response in tonsils at 42 dpi than NVSL-infected pigs, with and without accounting for CE. This suggests that the NVSL virus may be better than the KS06 virus at evading host immune response and persists in tonsils by weakening, or preventing, host immune responses. Pigs with high viral levels showed larger CE of immune cells than low viral level pigs, potentially to trigger stronger immune responses. Presence of high tonsil virus was associated with a stronger immune response, especially innate immune response through interferon signaling, but these differences were not significant when accounting for CE. Genotype at WUR was associated with different effects on immune response in tonsils of pigs during the persistence stage, depending on viral isolate and tonsil viral level. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study provide insights into the effects of PRRSV isolate, tonsil viral level, and WUR genotype on host immune response and into potential mechanisms of PRRSV persistence in tonsils that could be targeted to improve strategies to reduce viral rebreaks. Finally, to understand transcriptome responses in tissues that consist of multiple cell types, it is important to consider differences in cell composition.

Exposure to contaminated surfaces is one of the main routes of respiratory diseases transmission. Therefore, it is very important for epidemic prevention and control to study the law of virus decay and the environmental coupling effect on various surfaces. Based on the analysis of the influencing mechanism, a large amount of experimental evidence on the survival of viruses on the surface of objects were excavated in this paper, and the effects of various factors, such as surface peripheral temperature, relative humidity, virus-containing droplet volume, surface materials and virus types, on the decay rate constants of viruses were comprehensively analyzed. It was found that although the experimental methods, virus types and experimental conditions varied widely in different experiments, the virus concentrations on the surface of objects all followed the exponential decay law, and the coupling effect of various factors was reflected in the decay rate constant k. Under different experimental conditions, k values ranged from 0.001 to 100 h(−1), with a difference of 5 orders of magnitude, corresponding to the characteristic time t(99) between 500 and 0.1 h when the virus concentration decreased by 99%. This indicates a large variation in the risk of virus transmission in different scenarios. By revealing the common law and individuality of the virus decay on the surface of objects, the essential relationship between the experimental observation phenomenon and virus decay was analyzed. This paper points out the huge difference in virus transmission risk on the surface at different time nodes, and discusses the prevention and control strategies to grasp the main contradictions in the different situations.","Guo, Luyao; Yang, Zhao; Guo, Lei; Chen, Linlin; Cheng, Zhu; Zhang, Li; Long, Enshen",Environ Res,683,1

Patients at risk for leprosy represent an interesting model for assessing the effects of these therapies on the occurrence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assessed the influence of leprosy-related variables in the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a 14-month prospective real-world cohort study in which the main risk factor was 2 previous vaccinations with BCG and the main outcome was COVID-19 detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A Cox proportional hazards model was used. Among the 406 included patients, 113 were diagnosed with leprosy. During follow-up, 69 (16.99%) patients contracted COVID-19. Survival analysis showed that leprosy was associated with COVID-19 (p<0.001), but multivariate analysis showed that only COVID-19-positive household contacts (hazard ratio (HR) = 8.04; 95% CI = 4.93–13.11) and diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.04–4.06) were significant risk factors for COVID-19.

Our model showed that the use of corticosteroids, thalidomide, pentoxifylline, clofazimine, or dapsone or BCG vaccination did not affect the occurrence or severity of COVID-19.","Cerqueira, Selma Regina Penha Silva; Deps, Patrícia Duarte; Cunha, Débora Vilela; Bezerra, Natanael Victor Furtunato; Barroso, Daniel Holanda; Pinheiro, Ana Bárbara Sapienza; Pillegi, Gecilmara Salviato; Repsold, Taynah Alves Rocha; Kurizky, Patrícia Shu; Collin, Simon M.; Gomes, Ciro Martins",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,683,20

This milieu is reported to cause acute lung injury, oxygen deprivation, multiorgan damage, critical illness, and often death. Post SARS–CoV–2(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection, the fight between the invading virus and the host's immune system would either terminate in recovery, with eradication of the infection and regulation of the immune system; or there would be a continuation of immune attacks even after the virus has been cleared, leading to immune dysregulation and disease. This outcome is chiefly dependent on two factors: (1) the patient's immune response, and (2) sufficiency plus efficiency of the regulator(s). Concerning the first, the present research introduces a framework based on different types of immune responses to COVID–19 along with known disease examples,and how this relatesto varying clinical outcomes and treatment needs for COVID–19 patients. About the second factor of ‘regulator(s)’, part 1 of the manuscript described in depth the regulatory role of progesterone in COVID–19.The present study investigates the two immunity patterns and the status of the regulatory hormone progesterone with respect to the two established demographic risk factors for high-severity COVID–19: male sex, and old age. The study evaluates the status of progesterone as a credible participant of immune regulationand dysregulation. It duly relates the immunity patterns to clinical outcomes and evinces indications for clinical use of progesterone in COVID–19.It proposes a clear answer to the question: why are males and old patients most likely to have critical illness due to COVID–19? The study highlights clinical domains for the use of progesterone in COVID–19. Part 2 of this research introducing the concept of immunity patterns and immunity grading. These concepts herewith provided for the clinical course of COVID–19 also applies to other hyperinflammatory conditions. Possible clinical applications of progesterone to treat critically ill COVID–19 patients will open an avenue for hormonal treatments of infections and other immune-related diseases.","Shah, Shilpa Bhuaptrai",Endocr Metab Sci,683,20

The measures often include physical distancing that aims to reduce the number of contacts in the population. Little is known about the actual reduction in number of contacts as a consequence of physical distancing measures. Methods In the Netherlands, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2016/2017 in which 8179 participants retrospectively reported the number, age and gender of different persons they had contacted (spoken to in person or touched) during the previous day. The survey was repeated among 2830 of the original participants, using the same questionnaire, in March and April 2020 after physical distancing measures had been implemented. Results The average number of contacts in the community was reduced from on average 12.5 (interquartile range: 2-17) to 3.7 (interquartile range: 0-4) different persons per participant, a reduction of 71% (95% confidence interval: 71-71). The reduction in the number of community contacts was highest for children and adolescents (between 5 and 20 years) and smallest for elderly persons of 80 years and older. The reduction in the effective number of total contacts, measured as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with community and household contacts, was 62% (95% confidence interval: 48 - 72). Conclusion The substantial reduction in contacts has contributed greatly in halting the COVID-19 epidemic. This reduction was unevenly distributed over age groups, household sizes and occupations. These findings offer guidance for the lifting of age-group targeted measures.","Backer, J. A.; Mollema, L.; Klinkenberg, D.; van der Klis, F. R. M.; de Melker, H.

The high mutation rates of viruses, coupled with short generation times and large population sizes, allow viruses to rapidly adapt to the host environment. However, this high mutation rate also comes at a cost to the viral population, as deleterious mutations are constantly created, leading to a plethora of defective genomes. Here, we will discuss the basic tenets that govern the evolution of viruses: mutation rates, population size, selection, the multiplicity of infection, and how these factors modulate infection as viruses evolve within a host, during transmission to novel susceptible hosts, and as viruses establish infections in new host species.","Stern, Adi; Andino, Raul",Viral Pathogenesis,683,16

We uncovered the protein domains most frequently lacked or occurred in the splice variants. Proteins presented by several isoforms participate in such processes as transcription regulation, immune response, etc. Our results displayed the association of alternative splicing with branched regulatory pathways. By considering the published data on the protein proteins encoded by the 18th human chromosome, we noted that alternative products display the differences in several functional features, such as phosphorylation, subcellular location, ligand specificity, protein-protein interactions, etc. The investigation of alternative variants referred to the protein kinase domain was performed by comparing the alternative sequences with 3D structures. It was shown that large enough insertions/deletions could be compatible with the kinase fold if they match between the conserved secondary structures. Using the 3D data on human proteins, we showed that conformational flexibility could accommodate fold alterations in splice variants. The investigations of structural and functional differences in splice isoforms are required to understand how to distinguish the isoforms expressed as functioning proteins from the non-realized transcripts.

In this study, we examined the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by health care workers, their concerns about it, and the reasons that might prevent them from getting vaccinated. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey from December 25, 2020, to January 6, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics (age, gender, profession, sector, medical history, and general health), COVID-19 related knowledge, and personal history of influenza vaccination. The intention to get the vaccine once it is available was directly asked, and attitudes towards the diseases and the vaccine were studied using a four-point Likert scale statement based on the health belief model's constructs. The study included 1159 HCWs; 62.9% were females, and 52.5% were between the ages of 30–49 years. The intention to get vaccinated was only 37.8% [95%CI: 35.0%–40.6%], while 31.5% were undecided, and 30.7% planned to refuse it. Higher levels of intention were reported among males (OR; 2.7, 95%CI: 2.0–3.7), younger ages (OR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1–2.8), physicians (OR; 2.9, 95%CI: 2.0–4.0), HCWs at non-governmental settings (OR; 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1–1.9), those who previously received the influenza vaccine (OR 4.0, 95%CI: 2.3–7.1), and those who had higher COVID-19 related knowledge (OR; 1.7, 95%CI: 2.3–7.1).

The government is strategically expanding the scope of community ownership and increasing understanding in the population through risk communication and engagement; still, the situation remains very austere and is even affecting the psychological health of caregivers. We, therefore, sought to determine the impact of psychosocial job demands and resources associated with the psychological health of nurses in a time lag duration of 3 months, i.e., since the start of the pandemic, from January to March 2020. We hypothesized the significant mediating roles of stress and eustress in a direct relationship with psychosocial work environment job demands, job resources, and nurses’ wellbeing. METHODS: In this cross-sectional self-administrated study, we distributed the survey in two parts by using a time-lag strategy to collect data at the start of pandemic (Time 1) and then again 3 months later (Time 2). Data on 53 items was collected from 208 female nurses who had participated in both the time phases and met the eligibility protocols of the study (such as being certified female nurses who have a registration number (RN) through the Pakistan Nursing Council (PNC), having 4 years of a generic nursing degree, and 2 years of nursing experience). FINDINGS: We have achieved three stages through our analytic study on the nurses’ samples to determine the predictive abilities for the quality of the psychosocial work environment model. The coefficient of determination is R2, while the effect size is f2. We found 29.0% variance, 0.05 and 0.03 effect size, and 0.153 predictive abilities on stress as explained by job demands, and 53.4% variance, 0.19 and 0.39 effect size, and 0.275 predictive abilities on eustress as explained by job resources. And finally, there was 71.2% variance, 0.00, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.42, and 0.07 effect sizes, and 0.545 predictive abilities on our third endogenous construct, wellbeing, which is explained by both the psychosocial job demands and job resource variables.

Based on this viewpoint, we extended our miRNA search to medicinal plants like Ocimum tenuiflorum, Zingiber officinale and Piper nigrum, which are well-known to possess antiviral properties, and are often consumed raw or as herbal decoctions. Such an approach, that makes use of miRNA of one species to interact and silence genes of another species including viruses is broadly categorized as cross-kingdom interactions. As a part of our genomics study on host-virus-plant interaction, we identified one unique 3′UTR conserved site ‘GGAAGAG’ amongst 5024 globally submitted SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes, which can be targeted by the human miRNA ‘hsa-miR-1236–3p’ and by Z. officinale miRNA ‘zof-miR2673b’. Additionally, we also predicted that the members of miR477 family commonly found in these three plant genomes possess an inherent potential to silence viral genome RNA and facilitate antiviral defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These cultures were infected at the apical side with one of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Each virus was shown to replicate to high titers for extended periods of time (at least 8 days) and, in particular an isolate with the D614G in the spike (S) protein did so more efficiently at 35 °C than 37 °C.

A growing number of disinfection products have been consumed during this period. However, the flaw of disinfection has not received enough attention, especially in water treatment processes. While cutting down the quantity of microorganisms, disinfection processes exert a considerable selection effect on bacteria and thus reshape the microbial community structure to a great extent, causing the problem of disinfection-residual-bacteria (DRB). These systematic and profound changes could lead to the shift in regrowth potential, biofouling potential, as well as antibiotic resistance level and might cause a series of potential risks. In this review, we collected and summarized the data from the literature in recent 10 years about the microbial community structure shifting of natural water or wastewater in full-scale treatment plants caused by disinfection. Based on these data, typical DRB with the most reporting frequency after disinfection by chlorine-containing disinfectants, ozone disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection were identified and summarized, which were the bacteria with a relative abundance of over 5% in the residual bacteria community and the bacteria with an increasing rate of relative abundance over 100% after disinfection. Furthermore, the phylogenic relationship and potential risks of these typical DRB were also analyzed. Twelve out of fifteen typical DRB genera contain pathogenic strains, and many were reported of great secretion ability. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter possess multiple disinfection resistance and could be considered as model bacteria in future studies of disinfection. We also discussed the growth, secretion, and antibiotic resistance characteristics of DRB, as well as possible control strategies.

This is largely achieved by the concerted action of regulatory structural elements on viral RNAs and a subset of host proteins, whose dedicated function across all stages of the infection steps is critical to complete the viral cycle. Importantly, not only the RNA sequence but also the RNA architecture imposed by the presence of specific structural domains mediates the interaction with host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), ultimately affecting virus multiplication and spreading. In marked difference with other biological systems, the genome of positive strand RNA viruses is also the mRNA.

We aim to understand the views of patients with mental illness and wish to die with regard to the possibility of PAD in the Netherlands. The data for this qualitative study were collected through 21 in-depth interviews with Dutch patients who have a wish for PAD as a result of suffering from a mental illness. We identified four themes in relation to the meaning of PAD for the patients suffering from mental illness and wish to die. These themes are (1) Autonomy and self-determination, (2) ending the suffering, (3) recognition, and (4) a dignified end-of-life. The option of PAD for patients suffering from mental illnesses was considered of great importance to the patients who have a wish to die. We highlight the importance of ‘recognition’ for the situation of the patient, as this could lead to new perspective. We argue that psychiatrists need to reflect on providing this recognition in earlier phases of treatment, taking seriously and discussing a wish for PAD in treatment is beneficial to patients.

The intensity of interventions needed to achieve this for local epidemics is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of HIV interventions at the city level. DESIGN: A compartmental model of city-level HIV transmission stratified by age, race, sex, and HIV risk factor was developed and calibrated. SETTING: 32 priority metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). PATIENTS: Simulated populations in each MSA. INTERVENTION: Combinations of HIV testing and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) coverage among those at risk for HIV, plus viral suppression in persons with diagnosed HIV infection. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the projected reduction in incident cases from 2020 to 2030. RESULTS: Absent intervention, HIV incidence was projected to decrease by 19% across all 32 MSAs. Modest increases in testing (1.25-fold per year), PrEP coverage (5 percentage points), and viral suppression (10 percentage points) across the population could achieve reductions of 34% to 67% by 2030. Twenty-five percent PrEP coverage, testing twice a year on average, and 90% viral suppression among young Black and Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) achieved similar reductions (13% to 68%). Including all MSM and persons who inject drugs could reduce incidence by 48% to 90%. Thirteen of 32 MSAs could achieve greater than 90% reductions in HIV incidence with large-scale interventions that include heterosexuals. A web application with location-specific results is publicly available (www.jheem.org). LIMITATION: The COVID-19 pandemic was not represented. CONCLUSION: Large reductions in HIV incidence are achievable with substantial investment, but the EHE goals will be difficult to achieve in most locations. An interactive model that can help policymakers maximize the effect in their local environments is presented.

We investigated the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). After the first dose of the vaccine, on D22, WM/CLL/NHL patients had lower NAb titers compared to controls: the median NAb inhibition titer was 17% (range 0–91%, IQR 8–27%) for WM/CLL/NHL patients versus 32% (range 2–98%, IQR 19–48%) for controls (P < 0.001). Only 8 (14%) patients versus 114 (54%) controls developed NAb titers ≥ 30% on D22 (p < 0.001). Our data indicate that the first dose of both BNT162b2 and AZD1222 leads to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WM/CLL/NHL compared to controls of similar age and gender and without malignant disease. Even though the response rates were not optimal, vaccination is still considered essential and if possible should be performed before treatment initiation.

This allows us to predict the location of origin of a genetic sample by comparing it to a set of samples of known geographic origin. Here, we describe a deep learning method, which we call Locator, to accomplish this task faster and more accurately than existing approaches. In simulations, Locator infers sample location to within 4.1 generations of dispersal and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than a recent model-based approach. We leverage Locator’s computational efficiency to predict locations separately in windows across the genome, which allows us to both quantify uncertainty and describe the mosaic ancestry and patterns of geographic mixing that characterize many populations.

An oligo‐based microarray was employed to analyse mRNAs from rhabdomyosarcoma cells infected with the MS/7423/87 strain of enterovirus 71 (EV71) at 20 h post infection. Using Acuity software and LOWESS normalization, 152 genes were found to be downregulated while 39 were upregulated by greater than twofold. Altered transcripts include those encoding components of cytoskeleton, protein translation and modification; cellular transport proteins; protein degradation mediators; cell death mediators; mitochondrial‐related and metabolism proteins; cellular receptors and signal transducers. Changes in expression profiles of 15 representative genes were authenticated by real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which also compared the transcriptional responses of cells infected with EV71 strain 5865/Sin/000009 isolated from a fatal case during the Singapore outbreak in 2000. Western blot analyses of APOB, CLU, DCAMKL1 and ODC1 proteins correlated protein and transcript levels. Two‐dimensional proteomic maps highlighted differences in expression of cellular proteins (CCT5, CFL1, ENO1, HSPB1, PSMA2 and STMN1) following EV71 infection. Expression of several apoptosis‐associated genes was modified, coinciding with apoptosis attenuation observed in poliovirus infection. Interestingly, doublecortin and CaM kinase‐like 1 (DCAMKL1) involved in brain development, was highly expressed during infection. Thus, microarray, real‐time RT‐PCR and proteomic analyses can elucidate the global view of the numerous and complex cellular responses that contribute towards EV71 pathogenesis.","Leong, Wai Fook; Chow, Vincent T.

METHODS: A case-control study in which 701 confirmed COVID-19 patients (of which 41 were intensive care unit [ICU]-admitted) and 250 control subjects were enrolled. The study was conducted retrospectively in October on patients admitted to 3 separate hospitals in Saudi Arabia namely: King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz University Hospital (Riyadh), Ohud Hospital (Madinah), and Nojood Medical Center (Madinah) between May and September 2020. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was calculated based on absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count. Institutional ethical approval was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: Patients (median age 35 years), of which 54.8% were females, were younger than the control cohort (median age 48 years). Patients had significantly higher NLR compared to the control group. Intensive care unit admitted patients had significantly higher platelet, WBC and neutrophil counts. The ICU patients’ NLR was almost twice as of the non-intensive patients. The NLR value of 5.5 was found to be of high specificity (96.4%) and positive predictive value (91.4%) in diagnosing COVID-19. Furthermore, it had a very good sensitivity (86.4%) in predicting severe forms of disease, such as, ICU admission. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an important tool in determining the COVID-19 clinical status. This study further confirms the prognostic value of NLR in detecting severe infection, and those patients with high NLR should be closely monitored and managed.","Sayed, Anwar A.; Allam, Assem A.; Sayed, Ayman I.; Alraey, Mohammed A.; Joseph, Mercy V.",Saudi Med J,683,32

The use of antibiotics remains highly prevalent in young children, but can lead to antimicrobial resistance as well as reinforcing the idea that parents should re-consult for similar symptoms. One of the main drivers of indiscriminate antimicrobial use is the lack of evidence for, and therefore uncertainty regarding, which children are at risk of poor outcome. This paper describes the protocol for the TARGET cohort study, which aims to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule to identify children presenting to primary care with respiratory tract infections who are at risk of hospitalisation. METHODS/DESIGN: The TARGET cohort study is a large, multicentre prospective observational study aiming to recruit 8,300 children aged ≥3 months and <16 years presenting to primary care with a cough and respiratory tract infection symptoms from 4 study centres (Bristol, London, Oxford and Southampton). Following informed consent, symptoms, signs and demographics will be measured. In around a quarter of children from the Bristol centre, a single sweep, dual bacterial-viral throat swab will be taken and parents asked to complete a symptom diary until the child is completely well or for 28 days, whichever is sooner. A review of medical notes including clinical history, re-consultation and hospitalisations will be undertaken. Multivariable logistic regression will be used to identify the independent clinical predictors of hospitalisation as well as the prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes. The clinical prediction rule will be internally validated using various methods including bootstrapping. DISCUSSION: The clinical prediction rule for hospitalisation has the potential to help identify a small group of children for hospitalisation and a much larger group where hospitalisation is very unlikely and antibiotic prescribing would be less warranted. This study will also be the largest natural history study to date of children presenting to primary care with acute cough and respiratory tract infections, and will provide important information on symptom duration, re-consultations and the microbiology of the upper respiratory tract.","Redmond, Niamh M; Davies, Rachel; Christensen, Hannah; Blair, Peter S; Lovering, Andrew M; Leeming, John P; Muir, Peter; Vipond, Barry; Thornton, Hannah; Fletcher, Margaret; Delaney, Brendan; Little, Paul; Thompson, Matthew; Peters, Tim J; Hay, Alastair D",BMC Health Serv Res,683,16

This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death. METHODS: Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements. RESULTS: We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1%), cough (76.1%), fatigue (36.1%), and shortness of breath (27.6%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality.

Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8%), headaches (12.6%), and dizziness (11.9%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (n = 10) and status epilepticus (n = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2% after 8 weeks and 97.3% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9%) and phantosmia (9.0%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge.

Thus, the current study examined the role of self‐isolation on feelings of stress, the perception and reception of social support, and mental health problems during the COVID‐19 pandemic. A sample of 405 college students were asked to report on the amount of self‐isolation in which they were engaging, worry about COVID‐19, psychological health, and received and perceived social support. Results indicated that when the length of time in self‐isolation was taken into account, perceived social support buffered the connection between worry about COVID‐19 and psychological health.

However, with the current prevalence of information communication technology, we can surmise that study abroad difficulties should be minimal.

Data were collected from 1870 volunteer study abroad students in Taiwan. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that when controlling for the effects of age, gender, duration of stay, student status (short-term exchange or degree-seeking), and internet use motives (online benefits, habits, and facilitation), the personality trait neuroticism consistently showed significant relationships with the various study abroad difficulties. Moreover, moderation analyses revealed that all the personality traits except conscientiousness showed significant interactions with internet use, while simple slope comparisons showed significant differences between the high personality traits and their lower counterparts.

Psychological and physical well-being of health personnel has been significantly affected by COVID-19. Work overload and continuous exposure to positive COVID-19 cases have caused them fatigue, stress, anxiety, insomnia and other detriments. This research aims: 1) to analyze whether the use of cognitive reevaluation and emotional suppression strategies decreases and increases, respectively, stress levels of health personnel, 2) to quantify the impact of contact with patients with COVID-19 on stress s level of medical staff. Method. Emotion regulation strategies and stress level were evaluated in 155 Dominican physicians by means of psychological tests with adequate levels of reliability. In addition, a questionnaire created by the researchers quantified the impact that contact with those infected had on their stress levels. Results. Contact with patients with COVID-19 predicts increased use of emotion suppression strategies, although is not associated with the use of cognitive reevaluation. These findings lead to an even greater increase in stress on health care providers. Conclusions. Contextual contingencies demand immediate responses and may not allow health personnel to use cognitive re-evaluation strategies, leaning more towards emotion suppression. However, findings regarding high levels of stress require the implementation of intervention programs focused on the promotion of more functional emotion regulation strategies. Such programs may reduce current stress and prevent post-traumatic symptoms.","Garcia-Batista, Z. E.; Guerra-Pena, K.; Vahid Nouri Kandany, V.; Marte, M. I.; Garrido, L. E.; Cantisano-Guzman, L.

Therefore, we aimed to compare the pattern of abnormal liver tests in SARS-CoV-2 patients with those of patients infected with influenza, a non-hepatotropic respiratory virus, and their association with worse outcomes during hospitalization. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1737 hospitalized patients (865 with influenza and 872 with SARS-Cov-2) in a tertiary medical center. We defined abnormal liver tests as GPT or GOT ≥40IU/ML at any time-point during hospitalization. RESULTS: Abnormal liver tests were mild-moderate in the majority of patients regardless of infection type, but the majority of patients with influenza had a transaminases peak earlier during hospitalization compared to patients with SARS-Cov-2. Abnormal liver tests correlated with markers of severe disease in either influenza or SARS-Cov-2 infections, and were associated with death, occurring mainly in patients with severe liver tests abnormalities (>200IU/L) (38.7% and 60% of patients with influenza or SARS-Cov-2, respectively). In multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, lymphopenia and CRP, liver tests abnormalities remained significantly associated with death for influenza (OR= 4.344, 95% CI 2.218-8.508) and SARS-Cov-2 (OR= 3.898, 95% CI 2.203-6.896). These results were confirmed upon propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal liver tests during hospitalization with SARS-Cov-2 or influenza infections are common, may differ in their time-course and reflect disease severity.

Methods: This study spanned from December 1, 2020 to January 23, 2021 and included the populations of Ontario (including Toronto) and Quebec (including Montreal). The intervention of interest was a nighttime curfew implemented across Quebec on January 9, 2021. Unadjusted and adjusted difference-in-differences models (DID) were used to measure the incremental impact of the curfew on nighttime mobility in Quebec as compared to Ontario. Results: The implementation of the curfew was associated with an immediate reduction in nighttime mobility. The adjusted DID analysis indicated that Quebec experienced a 31% relative reduction in nighttime mobility (95%CI: -36% to -25%) compared to Ontario, and that Montreal experienced a 39% relative reduction compared to Toronto (95%CI: -43, -34). Discussion: However, this natural experiment among two neighbouring provinces provides useful evidence that curfews lead to an immediate and substantial decrease nighttime mobility, particularly in these provinces' largest urban areas hardest hit by COVID-19.","Ghasemi, A.; Daneman, N.; Berry, I.; Buchan, S.

The results of the meta-analysis showed that the total effective rate OR = 4.61 (95% CI 2.92, 7.25, p = 1.00/ I(2) = 0%); the cough disappearance time SMD –1.23 (–1.37, –1.09, p < 0.00001/ I(2) = 94%); the antipyretic time SMD –1.26 (–1.40, –1.11, p < 0.00001/ I(2)=94%); lung rhomboid disappearance time SMD –1.17 (–1.33, –1.02, p < 0.00001/ I(2) = 89%); and adverse drug reaction was OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.20, 0.64, p = 0.21/ I(2) = 30%). From the results, the treatment group (TCM injection) showed better efficacy than the control group (Western medication). CONCLUSION: Xiyanping, Reduning, and Tanreqing injections may yield benefits as COVID-19 treatments. However, clinical trials on TCM injections for the treatment of COVID-19 are still lacking. More high-quality clinical trials are still required.","Chun, Hea Sun; Choi, Su Hyeon; Song, Ho Sueb",J Pharmacopuncture,683,20

Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19. They must face high-risk infection conditions, insufficient anti-epidemic material supplies, mental pressure, and so on. COVID-19 seriously affects their dietary and behavioral habits, and poor habits make them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, their baseline dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of COVID-19 remain unclear for these workers in China. This study aimed to explore the baseline dietary and behavioral habits of frontline workers and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of the epidemic; in addition, susceptible subgroups were identified by stratified analyses as targets of protective measures to keep them from being infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a sample of 22,459 valid individuals living in China, including 9402 frontline epidemic prevention workers. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 23.9% of the frontline epidemic prevention workers reported a high-salt diet, 46.9% of them reported a high frequency of fried foods intake, and 50.9% of them smoked cigarettes. After the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% of them expressed a willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% of them wanted to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetables intake. A total of 37.9% of them expressed a willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% of them wanted to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline dietary and behavioral habits and the willingness to change their habits were observed between frontline epidemic prevention workers and other participants. Among the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19, frontline epidemic prevention experience was a promoting factor for adopting worse dietary and behavioral habits, including those in the high-salt intake subgroup (OR, 2.824; 95% CI, 2.341–3.405) and the 11–20 cigarettes/day subgroup (OR, 2.067; 95% CI, 1.359–3.143). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary and behavioral habits of frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than that those of other participants before COVID-19. They had a greater willingness to adopt healthy dietary and behavioral habits after experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19. However, frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 continued in engage in these poor habits. Dietary and behavioral intervention policies should be drafted to protect their health, especially frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor habits at baseline.","Yu, Weijun; Xu, Ying; Zhang, Jianhua; Yuan, Qing; Guo, Yanfang; Li, Zhixue; He, Xiangyang; Ma, Yan; Cai, Fengmin; Liu, Zheng; Zhao, Rencheng; Wang, Dewang; Chen, Jialong; Guo, Quanwei",Environ Health Prev Med,683,5

COVID-19 precaution measures are essential for highly susceptible groups. However, it was not known previously to what extent chronic disease patients were perceived to know about the efficacy of prevention measures. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess perception of patients with chronic disease toward the efficacy of COVID-19 preventive measures and their intention to carry out those measures. METHODS: A multicentered institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 413 patients attended in selected hospitals of Dessie town from July 21 to August 5, 2020. Hospitals were selected using the lottery method and systematic random sampling was utilized to select study participants. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect the data and the tool had four dimensions which include sociodemographic, clinical profile and risk assessment, perceived efficacy of prevention measures, and patient’s intention to carry out measures. In multivariable analysis, variables were declared statistically significant at a p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: In this study, the mean age of participants was 48.2 years (SD ±15.8 years) and 52.1% were females. In overall, 42.1% of participants had low perception on the efficacy of prevention measures and 28.3% had low intention to carry out measures. In this study, young adults (AOR=2.48; 95%CI: 1.42–4.31), male gender (AOR=2.75; 95%CI: 1.73–4.37), low literacy (AOR=3.42; 95%CI: 1.47–7.94) and face mask nonusers (AOR=1.64; 95%CI: 1.03–2.61) were significantly associated with low perceived efficacy of COVID-19 prevention methods. CONCLUSION: In this study, a significant proportion of patients had low perception about the efficacy of COVID-19 prevention measures and nearly one-third of them had low intention to carry out prevention measures. Therefore, health education programs about efficacy of preventive measures should be provided by health professionals targeting high risk groups.","Dires, Abebe; Gedamu, Sisay; Getachew, Yemiamrew",J Multidiscip Healthc,683,22

We review the literature to investigate: 1) Are PD patients at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and are there specific contributing factors to that risk? 2) How does COVID-19 affect PD symptoms? 3) How does COVID-19 present in PD patients? 4) What are the outcomes in PD patients who contract COVID-19? 5) What is the impact of COVID-19 on PD care? 6) Does COVID-19 increase the risk of developing PD? A literature search was performed from 1979 to 2020 using the terms: ‘Parkinson’s disease’ and ‘parkinsonism’ combined with: ‘COVID-19’; ‘SARS-CoV-2’ and ‘coronavirus’. It does not appear that PD is a specific risk factor for COVID-19. There is evidence for direct/indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on motor/non-motor symptoms of PD. Although many PD patients present with typical COVID-19 symptoms, some present atypically with isolated worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, requiring increased anti-PD therapy and having worse outcomes. Mortality data on PD patients with COVID-19 is inconclusive (ranging from 5.2%to 100%). Patients with advanced PD appear to be particularly vulnerable. Single cases of acute hypokinetic-rigid syndrome have been described but no other convincing data has been reported. The rapidity with which COVID-19 has swept across the globe has favored the proliferation of studies which lack scientific rigor and the PD literature has not been immune. A coordinated effort is required to assimilate data and answer these questions in larger PD cohorts.","Fearon, Conor; Fasano, Alfonso",Journal of Parkinson's disease,683,16

Herein, we show a case of an infant with PFAA and severe aortic coarctation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-day-old female infant was admitted for sustained fever. Initially, the patient was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, and echocardiography showed PFAA with severe aortic coarctation. Because the patient presented progressive oliguria and metabolic acidosis, she was transferred for emergency cardiac surgical intervention. The aortic arch was reconstructed using end-to-side anastomosis between the fifth aortic arch and the descending aorta without any artificial conduit or patching material. CONCLUSIONS: PFAA with aortic coarctation can be repaired by various surgical methods. Among them, our surgical approach is easy and effective, has growth potential, and an additional surgery is not needed.","Kim, Chang Hun; Kim, Hyungtae; Choi, Kwang Ho; Sung, Si Chan; Ko, Hoon; Choo, Ki Seok",J Cardiothorac Surg,683,16

Hospital on‐duty schedules lead to long working hours and short sleeping hours; both are common factors associated with burnout. We examined the dose‐response relationship and the potential mediating role of sleeping hours on the association between working hours and burnout among health care workers. METHODS: We collected data on the burnout status, using the Mandarin version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (subscales measure work‐related and personal burnouts), working hours, sleeping hours, and relevant measures for 2081 health care personnel who underwent a routine health examination in a medical center in Taiwan during 2016‐2017. Four subgroups were compared: physicians (n = 369), nurses (n = 973), technicians (n = 391), and administrators (n = 348). RESULTS: Average weekly working hours are associated with burnout scores in a non‐linear dose‐response manner. Compared with a work week of 40 hours, the odds ratio of work‐related burnout doubled when hours exceeded 60, tripled when hours exceeded 74, and quadrupled when hours exceeded 84. Physicians’ burnout is less susceptible to incremental increases in working hours, compared to the situations in other health care workers. The proportions eliminated by reducing sleeping hours were 25%‐73% for physicians and 7%‐29% for nurses respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that working hours are associated with burnout, and the association was partially mediated by sleeping hours.","Lin, Ro‐Ting; Lin, Yu‐Ting; Hsia, Ying‐Fang; Kuo, Chin‐Chi",J Occup Health,683,21

Neutralizing nanobodies (VHH) represent a promising therapeutic intervention strategy to address the current SARS-2 pandemic and provide a powerful toolkit to address future virus outbreaks. Using a synthetic, high-diversity VHH bacteriophage library, several potent neutralizing VHH antibodies were identified and evaluated for their capacity to tightly bind to the SARS-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), to prevent binding of SARS-2 spike (S) to the cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and to neutralize viral infection. Preliminary preclinical evaluation of multiple nanobody candidates demonstrate that they are prophylactically and therapeutically effective in vivo against wildtype SARS-2. The identified and characterized nanobodies described herein represent viable candidates for further preclinical evaluation and another tool to add to our therapeutic arsenal to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Author Summary To fully address the on-going pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-2), it will be important to have both vaccines and therapeutic strategies to prevent and mitigate the effects of SARS-2. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of potently neutralizing humanized single domain heavy chain (VHH) antibodies that have binding affinity for both the original Wuhan strain and widely circulating B.1.1.7/UK strain. VHH antibodies have the same therapeutic potential as conventional antibodies in half the size and with greater stability and solubility. Using a synthetic humanized high-diversity VHH phage library we identified several candidates with strong affinity for the SARS-2 spike that block the interaction of SARS-2 spike with the cellular receptor ACE2, and effectively neutralize infection with SARS-2 in vitro. By sequencing viral escape mutants generated in the presence of each VHH we mapped the binding sites of the VHH antibodies and assessed their affinity against newly emerging SARS-2 variants. Finally, we demonstrate that two of these VHH antibodies show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo against challenge with SARS-2. This study establishes that screening highly diverse VHH phage libraries against viral threats can yield highly effective therapeutic agents in real time.","Stefan, Maxwell A.; Light, Yooli K.; Schwedler, Jennifer L.; McIlroy, Peter R.; Courtney, Colleen M.; Saada, Edwin A.; Thatcher, Christine E.; Phillips, Ashlee M.; Bourguet, Feliza A.; Mageeney, Catherine M.; McCloy, Summer A.; Collette, Nicole M.; Negrete, Oscar A.; Schoeniger, Joseph S.; Weilhammer, Dina R.; Harmon, Brooke",bioRxiv,683,1

In this review, the authors attempt to highlight the biological and pharmacological properties of CUR in addition to emphasizing aspects relating to the biosynthesis, encapsulation and therapeutic effects of the compound. The information contained in this review was generated by considering published information in which evidence of enhanced biological and pharmacological properties of nano-encapsulated CUR was reported. CUR has contributed to a significant improvement in melanoma, breast, lung, gastro-intestinal, and genito-urinary cancer therapy. We highlight the impact of nano-encapsulated CUR for efficient inhibition of cell proliferation, even at low concentrations compared to the free CUR when considering anti-proliferation. Furthermore nano-encapsulated CUR exhibited bioactive properties, exerted cytotoxic and anti-oxidant effects by acting on endogenous and cholinergic anti-oxidant systems. CUR was reported to block Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into hepatic cells, inhibit MRSA proliferation, enhance wound healing and reduce bacterial load. Nano-encapsulated CUR has also shown bioactive properties when acting on antioxidant systems (endogenous and cholinergic). Future research is necessary and must focus on investigation of encapsulated CUR nano-particles in different models of human pathology.","Witika, Bwalya Angel; Makoni, Pedzisai Anotida; Matafwali, Scott Kaba; Mweetwa, Larry Lawrence; Shandele, Ginnethon Chaamba; Walker, Roderick Bryan",Molecules,683,24

SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 111 million people worldwide and caused over 2.47 million deaths. Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 show symptoms of fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue with severe cases that can develop into pneumonia, myocarditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, and even multi-organ failure. Current clinical management consists largely of supportive care as commonly administered treatments, including convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and high-dose glucocorticoids. These have demonstrated modest benefits in a small subset of hospitalized patients, with only dexamethasone showing demonstrable efficacy in reducing mortality and length of hospitalization. At this time, no SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs are available, although several vaccines have been approved for use in recent months. In this review, we will evaluate the efficacy of preclinical and clinical drugs that precisely target three different, essential steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle: the spike protein during entry, main protease (M(Pro)) during proteolytic activation, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during transcription. We will assess the advantages and limitations of drugs that precisely target evolutionarily well-conserved domains, which are less likely to mutate, and therefore less likely to escape the effects of these drugs. We propose that a multi-drug cocktail targeting precise proteins, critical to the viral replication cycle, such as spike protein, M(Pro), and RdRp, will be the most effective strategy of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and limiting its spread in the general population.

While large scale disasters may have an impact on substance use and addictions, the use of some substances is also likely to modify the risk of COVID-19 infection or course. Many countries have imposed lockdowns. Whether this quarantine or the end of lockdown measures will have an impact on substance use is discussed. The aim of this review is to gather knowledge for clinicians and to guide public health policies during/after lockdown. METHODS: PubMed was reviewed in August 6th (2020), to determine the current evidences and observations concerning the addictions and SARS-CoV2. We used all the names of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common substances of abuse. For the physiopathological parts, searches were conducted using key words such as “infection” or “pneumonia”. For the lockdown effects, key words such as “quarantine”, “disaster” or “outbreak” were used. RESULTS: Overall, pathophysiological data showed an increased risk of infections for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and a possible protective role of nicotine. During lockdown, there is a substantial risk of increasing SUDs. Individuals with opioid use disorder are particularly at risk of relapse or of involuntary withdrawal. After lockdown, increase of use may be observed as far as years after. Individuals with addictions are at higher risk of multimorbidity and mortality during COVID outbreak. CONCLUSION: This review describes useful strategies in clinical practice, including a systematic assessment of addiction comorbidity during this almost worldwide lockdown/pandemic.

Digital surveillance has been shown to be useful to supplement the traditional surveillance. Google Trends (GT) is one such platform reported to be useful during pandemics of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. Objective: We used GT to correlate the information seeking behaviour regarding COVID-19 of Indians with curiosity and apprehensiveness generated through media coverage as well as status of the epidemic both at national and state levels. Methods: We retrieved GT data between 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020 for India using a comprehensive search strategy. We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org websites. We explored the trends of COVID-19 in the form of relative search volume (RSV) from GT platform and correlated them with media reports. We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between Google search terms and daily new COVID-19 cases and daily tests for 14 days. Results: Peaks in RSV correlated with media coverage or government declarations suggestive of curiosity and apprehensiveness both at national level and high-burden states. High time-lag correlation was observed between both the daily reported number of tests and cases and RSV for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'' and ''lockdown'' at national level. Similar high time-lag correlation was observed for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''Corona'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'', ''lockdown'' in five high-burden states. Conclusion: This study reveals the advantages of infodemiology using GT to monitor an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 in India. Google searches in India during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reflects mostly curiosity and apprehension of citizens. GT can also complement traditional surveillance in India as well as high burden states.","Satpathy, Parmeshwar D; Kumar, Sanjeev; Prasad, Pankaj",,683,16

We used descriptive statistics to evaluate their experiences with telehealth and identify techniques that were effective to facilitate learning during a telehealth visit. Results: Surveys from 12 pediatric and Adolescent Medicine trainees were received, a 75% response rate. Most trainees (83.3%) reported no prior experience with telehealth before the onset of the pandemic. By the end of their rotation, trainees identified techniques that helped facilitate learning during a telehealth visit. The majority of trainees (83.3%) rated their experience as effective or very effective, and all reported interest in incorporating telehealth into their future practice. Conclusions: Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine trainees reported overall positive experiences with telehealth in clinical education and an interest in incorporating this tool into future practice.

METHODS: We assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive. Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class. A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference. RESULTS: Among 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness. A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness. There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test. None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: We found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.","Reynolds, Harmony R.; Adhikari, Samrachana; Pulgarin, Claudia; Troxel, Andrea B.; Iturrate, Eduardo; Johnson, Stephen B.; Hausvater, Anaïs; Newman, Jonathan D.; Berger, Jeffrey S.; Bangalore, Sripal; Katz, Stuart D.; Fishman, Glenn I.; Kunichoff, Dennis; Chen, Yu; Ogedegbe, Gbenga; Hochman, Judith S.",N Engl J Med,683,20

We measure the overall welfare effect by examining their labor market activities, family formation, and household finances. Using data from 20 waves of the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study, we find a substantial and persistent reduction in employment, earnings, marriage, fertility, and asset building among men who graduated during the recession. For women, limited job opportunities at graduation resulted in an increase in childbearing. We also find evidence that family provides a risk-sharing mechanism for recession graduates. Our results suggest that labor market entry in a large-scale recession has prolonged effects on a young worker’s life course even after the penalties in the labor market have disappeared.","Choi, Eleanor Jawon; Choi, Jaewoo; Son, Hyelim",Labour Econ,683,16

Based on the evolution law of PHEs and the meta-scenario representation of basic knowledge, this study established a DBN scenario deduction model for scenario deduction and evolution path analysis of PHEs. At the same time, based on the average field dynamics model of the SIR network, the dimensionality reduction process was performed to calculate the epidemic scale and epidemic time based on the IDD model, so as to determine the calculation methods of threshold value and epidemic time under emergency measures (quarantine). The Corona Virus Disease (COVID) epidemic was undertaken as an example to analyze the results of DBN scenario deduction, and the infectious disease dynamics model was used to analyze the number of reproductive numbers, peak arrival time, epidemic time, and latency time of the COVID epidemic. It was found that after the M1 measure was used to process the S1 state, the state probability and the probability of being true (T) were the highest, which were 91.05 and 90.21, respectively. In the sixth stage of the development of the epidemic, the epidemic had developed to level 5, the number of infected people was about 26, and the estimated loss was about 220 million yuan. The comprehensive cumulative foreground (CF) values of O1 [Formula: see text] O3 schemes were -1.34, -1.21, and -0.77, respectively, and the final CF values were -1.35, 0.01, and -0.08, respectively. The final CF value of O2 was significantly higher than the other two options. The household infection probability was the highest, which was 0.37 and 0.35 in Wuhan and China, respectively. Under the measures of home quarantine, the numbers of confirmed cases of COVID in China and Wuhan were 1.503 (95% confidential interval (CI) = 1.328 [Formula: see text] 1.518) and 1.729 (95% CI = 1.107 [Formula: see text] 1.264), respectively, showing good fits with the real data. On the 21st day after the quarantine measures were taken, the number of COVID across the country had an obvious peak, with the confirmed cases of 24495, and the model prediction value was 24085 (95% CI = 23988 [Formula: see text] 25056). The incubation period 1/q was shortened from 8 days to 3 days, and the number of confirmed cases showed an upward trend. The peak period of confirmed cases was advanced, shortening the overall epidemic time. It showed that the prediction results of scenario deduction based on DBN were basically consistent with the actual development scenario and development status of the epidemic. It could provide corresponding decisions for the prevention and control of COVID based on the relevant parameters of the infectious disease dynamic model, which verified the rationality and feasibility of the scenario deduction method proposed in this study.","Gao, Shan; Wang, Hanyi",Future Gener Comput Syst,683,16

This has been brought into sharp focus by the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, constantly changing hospital policies and surgical guidelines in reducing access to established screening and treatment regimens. Nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), is thought to provide a unique window into the biological processes occurring within the breast, particularly in the context of a developing neoplasm. Evaluation of NAF in asymptomatic women, for novel chemical biomarkers of either early disease and/or cancer risk offers tremendous promise as a tool to facilitate early detection and to supplement screening. However, it is acceptability as a method of collection and screening by women is critical and yet unknown. A breast health questionnaire was disseminated to women through breast cancer charities, patient support groups and social media platforms, with the aim of collecting opinions on the acceptability of use of NAF as a potential screening tool. METHOD: Following ethical approval a questionnaire was prepared using online surveys consisting of four parts: (a) introduction on breast health screening in the UK, (b) core demographic data, (c) questions regarding screening and the acceptability of using NAF and (d) opinions about the process of collecting and using nipple fluid for screening. The voluntary and anonymous questionnaire was disseminated through social media, professional networks, charity websites and by individuals between October 2019 and December 2020. Survey responses were collected electronically, and the data analysed using online surveys statistical tools. RESULTS: A total of 3178 women completed the questionnaire (65.9% Caucasian, 27.7% Asian/British Asian, 0.6% black and 5.0% other). Of these, 2650 women (83.4%) had no prior knowledge of NAF and 89.4% were unaware that NAF can be expressed in up to 90% of all women. Concerning their risk of breast cancer, 89.8% of women were keen to know their future risk of breast cancer, 8.5% were unsure whether they wanted to know their risk and a further, 1.6% did not want to know. Regarding screening, 944 women (29.8%) were unaware of the lack of routine National Health Service Breast Screening for those under the age of 47 years. Furthermore, 53.0% of women were unaware that mammographic screening is affected by breast density. In terms of the acceptability of home testing for breast health, 92.0% were keen to undergo a home test. Both 79.7% and 70.9% stated they would consider hand massage and a breast pump to acquire nipple fluid samples, respectively. A further 48.6% of women would consider the use of a hormonal nasal spray for the same purpose. However, with regards to acquiring results from NAF testing, 42.6% of women would prefer to receive results at home and 34.2% in a medical facility. Finally, 91.6% of women believed that breast health should be incorporated as part of school education curriculum. CONCLUSION: Public awareness regarding breast screening protocols and limitations of mammography could be improved. Many women were unaware that NAF might be a useful biofluid for future risk prediction, and yet the concept of self-testing of nipple fluid, with either hand massage or a breast pump was well received. Efforts should be made to increase awareness of the benefits of alternative and supplementary tests, especially in the context of high-risk individuals and younger patients.","Jiwa, Natasha; Takats, Zoltan; Leff, Daniel R; Sutton, Christopher",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,683,23

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median −50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median −50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7–5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22–4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6–10) versus 3 (3–4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeated multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.","Torzilli, Guido; Viganò, Luca; Galvanin, Jacopo; Castoro, Carlo; Quagliuolo, Vittorio; Spinelli, Antonino; Zerbi, Alessandro; Donadon, Matteo; Montorsi, Marco",Ann Surg,683,15

METHODS: A total of 207 of the 318 Black participants (65%) in the RAND American Life Panel, a nationally representative internet panel, were surveyed about COVID-19 vaccine intentions in November-December 2020. Participants’ census tracts were geocoded using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index. RESULTS: Overall, 35% agreed or strongly agreed that they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, 40% agreed or strongly agreed that they would get vaccinated, and 25% reported “don't know.” Significant multivariable predictors of not wanting to get vaccinated included high mistrust of the vaccine itself (e.g., concerns about harm and side effects), OR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.2–3.9), p = .007, and weak subjective norms for vaccination in one's close social network, OR (95% CI) = 0.6 (0.4–0.7), p < .001. Residence in an area of higher socioeconomic vulnerability was a marginally significant predictor, OR (95% CI) = 3.1 (0.9–11.0), p = .08. CONCLUSIONS: High mistrust around COVID-19 vaccines may lower vaccine confidence. Social network members’ attitudes can be influential in encouraging vaccination. Public health communications could use transparent and clear messaging on safety and efficacy, and acknowledge historical and ongoing discrimination and racism as understandable reasons for low confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Future research is needed to consider vaccine access challenges in tandem with mistrust as contributing to low vaccination rates across health conditions.","Bogart, Laura M.; Dong, Lu; Gandhi, Priya; Klein, David J.; Smith, Terry L.; Ryan, Samantha; Ojikutu, Bisola O.",J Natl Med Assoc,683,20

Specifically, changes are measured in chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and case detection among patients aged 14–49 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: U.S. chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and positivity were analyzed on the basis of >18.6 million tests (13.6 million tests for female patients and 4.7 million tests for male patients) performed by a national reference clinical laboratory from January 2019 through June 2020. RESULTS: Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing reached a nadir in early April 2020, with decreases (relative to the baseline level) of 59% for female patients and 63% for male patients. Declines in testing were strongly associated with increases in weekly positivity rates for chlamydia (R(2)=0.96) and gonorrhea (R(2)=0.85). From March 2020 through June 2020, an expected 27,659 (26.4%) chlamydia and 5,577 (16.5%) gonorrhea cases were potentially missed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted routine sexually transmitted infection services, suggesting an increase in syndromic sexually transmitted infection testing and missed asymptomatic cases. Follow-up analyses will be needed to assess the long-term implications of missed screening opportunities. These findings should serve as a warning for the potential sexual and reproductive health implications that can be expected from the overall decline in testing and potential missed cases.","Pinto, Casey N.; Niles, Justin K.; Kaufman, Harvey W.; Marlowe, Elizabeth M.; Alagia, Damian P.; Chi, Guangqing; Van Der Pol, Barbara",Am J Prev Med,683,16

The precipitously increased death rates, its impact on livelihood and trembling economies warrant the urgent development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesized avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of AOaV-1 was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and a major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of a recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in a cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagations in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies.","Rohaim, Mohammed A.; Munir, Muhammad",Vaccines (Basel),683,16

Mindfulness is the ability to focus on the present moment without evaluation. Findings on the effects of 8-week mindfulness trainings in patients with PS reveal positive effects on the severity of the disease and quality of life. However, it remained unclear what distinguishes patients with PS interested in psychological interventions from those without interest and whether also a shorter, namely 2-week mindfulness-based intervention is beneficial in this patient group. This will be investigated with this study. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Data will be collected at a rehabilitation clinic in Germany. The study is divided into two parts: study 1a is an observational study. Its aim is to investigate whether sociodemographic, skin-related and psychological factors are significant predictors of interest in a brief psychological intervention in 127 patients with PS. Study 1b is a randomised controlled trial, in which 60 patients (retrieved from study 1a) will be randomised to an intervention or control group (treatment as usual). The main outcome variables are mindfulness and self-compassion. In addition, mediation analyses will be used in an explorative manner to test whether there is a relationship between mindfulness/self-compassion and the severity of PS and whether it is mediated by itch catastrophising and fear of negative evaluation (first model) or perceived stress (second model).

Methods: From January 13 to February 27, 2020, 166 hospitalized patients meeting our criteria were included. The scores of fibrotic patterns on follow-up CT were evaluated. Patients were designated as group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrotic pattern) and group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrotic pattern). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore risk factors for fibrotic change in patients with COVID-19. Results: The follow-up CTs were obtained on 56 days (median, IQR 51–63 days) after symptom onset. Of the 166 patients (mean age, 57 ± 15 years; 69/166 male), 46% (76/166) had CT evidence of fibrotic change and 77% (127/166) were severe or critical cases. Among patients with fibrotic change on CT, 84% (64/76) got a minimal or mild score of fibrosis.

CLs do not only improve the quality of life by correcting, but also providing a better appearance and less activity restriction. Patients’ failure to comply with the hygienic practices prescribed in using CLs is often considered an important risk factor for eye complications and it is not often clarified to CLs consumers at the time of dispensation. Aim The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and practices towards the use of CLs in a sample of the Saudi population in Riyadh. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed using an online questionnaire among adult residents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from April to May of 2020. The statistical analysis was performed using R v 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Ordinal (Likert-scale) variables were summarized using mean ± standard deviation, or median and interquartile range (IQR) as needed. Results The majority of current users of CLs had no sight problem (P < 0.001). Using CLs was thought to be harmful in non-users (12.4%) versus CL users (2.93%) (P < 0.001). The main reason for using CLs in all groups was the emulation of others. Dryness was a well-known complication in current users (P < 0.05) and evening discomfort was a well-known one in previous users (P < 0.05). Social circle was the main source of information in 40% of users. High monthly income has a significant association with knowledge regarding the complications of CLs compared with low income (B = 0.94, P < 0.05). Education has a major effect on the users’ knowledge regarding the increase of refractive error and infection by CLs (P < 0.05). Conclusions Knowledge and practice were less than desired among CLs users. Many use CLs without prescription and solely for cosmetic purposes. More education is needed to lessen eye complications among CLs users.","Alzahrani, Othman; Alshehri, Fayez A; Alali, Abdulrahman O; Alzahrani, Omar H; Alzahrani, Zaid A; AlZahrani, Abdulrahman; Almazrou, Abdulrahman A",Cureus,683,19

Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV evolved in Africa and later spread to Asia, and that the Asian lineage is responsible for the recent epidemics in the South Pacific and Americas. However, the reasons for the sudden emergence of ZIKV remain enigmatic. Here we report evolutionary analyses that revealed four mutations, which occurred just before ZIKV introduction to the Americas, represent direct reversions of previous mutations that accompanied earlier spread from Africa to Asia and early circulation there. Our experimental infections of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, human cells, and mice using ZIKV strains with and without these mutations demonstrate that the original mutations reduced fitness for urban, human-amplifed transmission, while the reversions restored fitness, increasing epidemic risk. These findings include characterization of three transmission-adaptive ZIKV mutations, and demonstration that these and one identified previously restored fitness for epidemic transmission soon before introduction into the Americas. The initial mutations may have followed founder effects and/or drift when the virus was introduced decades ago into Asia.","Liu, Jianying; Liu, Yang; Shan, Chao; Nunes, Bruno T.

This was reflected in many early western discourses, French in particular, about the pandemic in Africa. These discourses unveiled old colonial antagonism, projection, stigmatization, and paternalism. The articulation of such discourses among well-informed and sometimes well-meaning people calls for deeper introspection on archaeological practices and modalities of community engagement. Building on archaeology’s multiple contributions to Africa’s past and observed practices of resilience in Senegal by ordinary people in the face of the spread of COVID-19, this essay reflects on the relevance of the archives, including the archaeological record, as usable resources for managing the problems of our times.","Thiaw, Ibrahima",Afr Archaeol Rev,683,16

SARS-COV2 (Severe-acute-respiratory syndrome caused by Coronavirus-type 2) pneumonia can be fatal. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether admittance dysnatremia is associated with mortality, sepsis, or intensive therapy (IT) in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia. This is a retrospective study of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry, with data collected from January 1(th) through April 31(th), 2020. We selected all hospitalized adult patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-COV2 pneumonia and a registered admission serum sodium level (SNa). Patients were classified as hyponatremic (SNa <135 mmol/L), eunatremic (SNa 135–145 mmol/L), or hypernatremic (SNa >145 mmol/L). Multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate independent relationships of admission hyponatremia and hypernatremia, with mortality, sepsis, or IT during hospitalization. Four thousand six hundred sixty-four patients were analyzed, median age 66 (52–77), 58% males. Death occurred in 988 (21.2%) patients, sepsis was diagnosed in 551 (12%) and IT in 838 (18.4%). Hyponatremia was present in 957/4,664 (20.5%) patients, and hypernatremia in 174/4,664 (3.7%). Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia were associated with mortality and sepsis. Only hyponatremia was associated with IT. In conclusion, hyponatremia and hypernatremia at admission are factors independently associated with mortality and sepsis in patients hospitalized with SARS-COV2 pneumonia.

An in-depth literature review showed that studies about bioterrorism preparedness amongst healthcare providers are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the knowledge and preparedness level of first emergency respondents towards bioterrorism events. METHODS: This study has a cross-sectional design and was carried out at the Emergency departments and poison control centers/clinical laboratories three in major tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The subjects were randomly selected to complete the self-administered questionnaire to collect study outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1030 participants were included in the final data analysis. The mean knowledge score in the basic concepts of bioterrorism and introductory clinical presentations of bioterrorism-related agents was 4.92 ± 1.86 out of 12 points. Moreover, the findings showed a mean knowledge score of 22.80 ± 3.92 out of 38 in the bioterrorism preparedness and governing policies and procedures. Respondents who received previous training in bioterrorism preparedness had a significantly higher number of perceived benefits than those not sure and without prior training (z = − 2.67, p = 0.008) and (z = − 4.4, p < 0.0001), respectively. About 79.4% of participants did not have previous training in bioterrorism preparedness, but 68.7% expressed willingness in the institution’s response and control to assist in a bioterrorist attack incident.

Inoculation of IDV to naïve calves resulted in mild respiratory disease histologically characterized by tracheitis. As several studies have associated the presence of IDV with acute bovine respiratory disease (BRD), we sought to investigate the efficacy of an inactivated IDV vaccine. Vaccinated calves seroconverted with hemagglutination inhibition titers 137–169 following two doses. Non-vaccinated calves challenged with a homologous virus exhibited signs of mild respiratory disease from days four to ten post challenge which was significantly different than negative controls at days five and nine post challenge. Peak viral shedding of approximately 5 TCID(50)/mL was measured in nasal and tracheal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids four to six days post challenge. Viral titers were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased 1.4 TCID(50)/mL, 3.6 TCID(50)/mL and 5.0 TCID(50)/mL, respectively, in the aforementioned samples collected from vaccinated animals compared to non-vaccinated controls at peak shedding. Viral antigen was detected in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates and trachea by immunohistochemistry from all unvaccinated calves but in significantly fewer vaccinates. Inflammation characterized by neutrophils was observed in the nasal turbinate and trachea but not appreciably in lungs. Together these results support an etiologic role for IDV in BRD and demonstrate that partial protection is afforded by an inactivated vaccine.","Hause, Ben M.; Huntimer, Lucas; Falkenberg, Shollie; Henningson, Jamie; Lechtenberg, Kelly; Halbur, Tom",Vet Microbiol,683,5

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patient’s close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS text messages and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: For this study, we aim to perform a preliminary evaluation of the use of the TellYourContacts website, a digital contact notification tool for COVID-19 that can be used confidentially and anonymously. We will gather information about the number of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative Inc (a COVID-19 testing laboratory) and Healthvana (a results disclosure app). Included in the notification was a link to the TellYourContacts website and a message encouraging the person who tested positive for COVID-19 to use the website to alert their close contacts of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18, 2020, to August 17, 2020, we used Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the number of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9130 users accessed the website and 1474 unique senders sent a total of 1957 messages, which included 1820 (93%) SMS text messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 US states, with the majority of US senders residing in California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will use the TellYourContacts website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages. The TellYourContacts website offers an additional method that individuals can and will use to notify their close contacts about a recent COVID-19 diagnosis.","Okpara, Kelechi S; Hecht, Jennifer; Wohlfeiler, Dan; Prior, Matthew; Klausner, Jeffrey D",JMIR Form Res,683,20

Although no study has been done on malnutrition among a general cohort of patients with COVID 19, it has long been associated with increased mortality and poor long-term outcomes. We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with COVID 19 admitted in a tertiary government hospital. Methods Cross-sectional study on COVID 19-confirmed patients admitted to the COVID 19 wards from July 15 to September 15, 2020. Nutritional status was assessed using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (PhilSPEN) modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade (SGA) tool. Malnutrition was defined as those with SGA grades B and C. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test of association, as appropriate, was used to identify factors that have a significant association with malnutrition. Furthermore, logistic regression was done on factors with significant association. Results Among the 355 adult patients in the study, 71.83% (255/355) were malnourished [SGA B: 48.73% (173/255); SGA C: 23.10% (82/255)]. The following were shown to have significant association with malnutrition: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [p-value < 0.001], hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [p-value 0.002], and chronic kidney disease (p-value 0.033). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that age [OR 1.02, CI 95% 1.00, 1.04, p-value 0.027] and CAP-Moderate Risk (MR) [OR 3.02, CI 95% 1.73, 5.27, p-value < 0.001] are significant predictors of malnutrition. All patients with CAP- High Risk and HAP were malnourished. Conclusion The prevalence of malnutrition was high (71.83%) in a general cohort of COVID 19 patients as measured by the modified SGA tool. The following are risk factors of malnutrition among patients with COVID 19: age, CAP, and HAP. Nutritional support and management of comorbidities are of paramount importance in the care of patients with COVID 19.","Larrazabal, Ramon B.; Perez, Blessie Marie; Masamayor, Ella Mae; Chiu, Harold Henrison; Palileo-Villanueva, Lia M.",Clin Nutr ESPEN,683,16

However, their effectiveness under oblique impacts, which produce more strains in the brain in comparison with vertical impacts adopted by helmet standards, is still unclear. Here we used a new method to assess the brain injury prevention effects of 27 bicycle helmets in oblique impacts, including helmets fitted with a friction-reducing layer (MIPS), a shearing pad (SPIN), a wavy cellular liner (WaveCel), an airbag helmet (Hövding) and a number of conventional helmets. We tested whether helmets fitted with the new technologies can provide better brain protection than conventional helmets. Each helmeted headform was dropped onto a 45° inclined anvil at 6.3 m/s at three locations, with each impact location producing a dominant head rotation about one anatomical axes of the head. A detailed computational model of TBI was used to determine strain distribution across the brain and in key anatomical regions, the corpus callosum and sulci. Our results show that, in comparison with conventional helmets, the majority of helmets incorporating new technologies significantly reduced peak rotational acceleration and velocity and maximal strain in corpus callosum and sulci. Only one helmet with MIPS significantly increased strain in the corpus collosum. The helmets fitted with MIPS and WaveCel were more effective in reducing strain in impacts producing sagittal rotations and a helmet fitted with SPIN in coronal rotations. The airbag helmet was effective in reducing brain strain in all impacts, however, peak rotational velocity and brain strain heavily depended on the analysis time. These results suggest that incorporating different impact locations in future oblique impact test methods and designing helmet technologies for the mitigation of head rotation in different planes are key to reducing brain injuries in bicycle accidents.","Abayazid, Fady; Ding, Ke; Zimmerman, Karl; Stigson, Helena; Ghajari, Mazdak",Ann Biomed Eng,683,30

OBJECTIVE: Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress. METHODS: We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians, resident physicians, and nursing staff, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. RESULTS: Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members, and the stress of social distancing. Later the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease, and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, and peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt, to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.","Viswanathan, Ramaswamy; Myers, Michael; Fanous, Ayman",Psychosomatics,683,23

This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3–16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.","Rizzo, Francesca; Edenborough, Kathryn M.; Toffoli, Roberto; Culasso, Paola; Zoppi, Simona; Dondo, Alessandro; Robetto, Serena; Rosati, Sergio; Lander, Angelika; Kurth, Andreas; Orusa, Riccardo; Bertolotti, Luigi; Mandola, Maria Lucia",BMC Vet Res,683,5

In response, we developed a nurse-led program to screen and triage patients with MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: A formal educational program was implemented to ensure a standardized approach to care planning and delivery. The essential skills that were included were the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, gloves, head cover and N95 mask, hand hygiene, the practice of donning and doffing and the collection of MERS-CoV nasopharyngeal specimens. RESULTS: A core group of nurses were identified from high-risk units. The education program consisted of four skill-days. Nurses were assigned a pre-course work from Mosby’s Nursing Skills, an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and the process for obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab. The skill lab incorporated multiple methods such group discussion, watching an on-line video, and a simulated demonstration and practice on a mannequin. In total, 450 nurses attended the Nasopharyngeal Skills Day and 1000 nurses received training. Donning and doffing PPE and N95 mask fit testing has become an annual mandatory competency requirement for staff in nursing and clinical services. CONCLUSION: The application of specified protocols minimizes the risks of cross infection, placing emphasis on patient and staff safety as well as expediting the patient to definitive treatment.

FBGs being intrinsically sensitive to temperature and strain, the calibration should tackle three variables, and, therefore, consists of a three-variable, two-level factorial design tailored to assess the three main sensitivities, as well as the five cross-sensitivities. FBG sensing information is encoded in the reflection spectrum from which the Bragg wavelength should be extracted. We tested six classical peak tracking methods on the results of the factorial design of the experiment applied to a homemade FBG humidity sensor. We used Python programming to compute, from the raw spectral data with six typical peak search algorithms, the temperature, strain and humidity sensitivities, as well as the cross-sensitivities, and showed that results are consistent for all algorithms, provided that the points selected to make the computation are correctly chosen. The best results for this particular sensor are obtained with a 3 dB threshold, whatever the peak search method used, and allow to compute the effective humidity sensitivity taking into account the combined effect of temperature and strain. The calibration procedure presented here is nevertheless generic and can thus be adapted to other sensors.","Safari Yazd, Nazila; Kawakami, Jennifer; Izaddoost, Alireza; Mégret, Patrice",Sensors (Basel),683,18

The main difficulty is the level of novelty imposed by these phenomena. Information from previous epidemics is only partially relevant. Further, the spread is local-dependent, reflecting a number of social, political, economic, and environmental dynamic factors. The present paper aims to provide a relatively simple way to model, forecast, and evaluate the time incidence of a pandemic. The proposed framework makes use of the non-central beta (NCB) probability density function. Specifically, a probabilistic optimisation algorithm searches for the best NCB model of the pandemic, according to the mean square error metric. The resulting model allows one to infer, among others, the general peak date, the ending date, and the total number of cases as well as to compare the level of difficult imposed by the pandemic among territories. Case studies involving COVID-19 incidence time series from countries around the world suggest the usefulness of the proposed framework in comparison with some of the main epidemic models from the literature (e.g. SIR, SIS, SEIR) and established time series formalisms (e.g. exponential smoothing - ETS, autoregressive integrated moving average - ARIMA).","Firmino, Paulo Renato Alves; de Sales, Jair Paulino; Gonçalves Júnior, Jucier; da Silva, Taciana Araújo",Chaos Solitons Fractals,683,1

Among the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 is myocardial injury, which is associated with a high risk of mortality. Myocardial injury, caused directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be triggered by inflammatory processes that cause damage to the heart tissue. Since one of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 is the “cytokine storm”, strategies to control inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been considered. Cannabinoids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties by negatively modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Herein, we investigated the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. WIN did not modify angiotensin-converting enzyme II protein levels, nor reduced viral infection and replication in hiPSC-CMs. On the other hand, WIN reduced the levels of interleukins 6, 8, 18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) released by infected cells, and attenuated cytotoxic damage measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Our findings suggest that cannabinoids should be further explored as a complementary therapeutic tool for reducing inflammation in COVID-19 patients.","Aragão, Luiz Guilherme H.

Here, we used porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model of coronaviruses (CoVs) to illustrate the reciprocal regulation between CoVs infection and pyroptosis. For the first time, we clarified the molecular mechanism of porcine Gasdermin D (pGSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis and demonstrated that amino acids T239 and F240 within pGSDMD-p30 are critical for pyroptosis. Furthermore, 3C-like protease Nsp5 from SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, PDCoV and PEDV can cleave human/porcine GSDMD at the Q193-G194 junction upstream of the caspase-1 cleavage site to produce two fragments which fail to trigger pyroptosis or inhibit viral replication. Thus, we provide clear evidence that coronoviruses may utilize viral Nsp5-GSDMD pathway to help their host cells escaping from pyroptosis, protecting the replication of the virus during the initial period, which suggest an important strategy for coronoviruses infection and sustain.","Shi, Fushan; Lv, Qian; Wang, Tingjun; Xu, Jidong; Xu, Wei; Shi, Yuhua; Fu, Xinyu; Yang, Tianming; Yang, Yang; Zhuang, Lenan; Fang, Weihuan; Gu, Jinyan; Li, Xiaoliang",bioRxiv,683,26

A respiratory system is modeled as a combination of a blower-hose-patient system and a single compartmental lung system with nonlinear lung compliance. For comparison purposes, the classical PID controller is also designed and simulated on the same system. According to the proposed control strategy, the ventilator will provide airway flow that maintains the peak pressure below critical levels when there are unknown parameters of the patient's hose leak and patient breathing effort. Results show that FPID is a better controller in the sense of quicker response, lower overshoot, and smaller tracking error.

COVID-19 statistics from China fall outside of recognized and accepted medical norms. As the epicenter of the COVID-19 initial outbreak, the epidemiological information from Wuhan affects the response and preparation of other parts of China and rest of the world. Here we estimated the incidence, death and starting time of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and China based on medical literature from China, official and non-official Chinese data sources. Methods: Data sources included literature on COVID-19 in China, official Chinese government figures, state-run and non state-run media reports. Our estimates are based on investigative media reports of crematory operations in Wuhan, which is considered as a common data end point to life. A range of estimates is presented by an exponential growth rate model from lockdown (Jan 23,2020) until the intervention started to show effects, which was estimated 14.5 days after lockdown. Results: For the cumulative infections and total deaths, under different assumptions of death rates (from 2.5% to 10%) and doubling time 6.4 days, the estimates projected on February 7, 2020 in Wuhan range from 305,000 to 1,272,000 for infections and from 6,811 to 7,223 for deaths - on the order of at least 10 times the official figures (13,603 and 545). The implied starting time of the outbreak is October 2019. Under the assumption of the official 3.14% death rate and doubling time of 2.54 days (which was derived based on Chinese official data), the infection cases reached 2.2 million on February 7. The estimates of cumulative deaths, based on both funeral urns distribution and continuous full capacity operation of cremation services up to March 23, 2020, give results around 36,000, more than 10 times of the official death toll of 2,524. Conclusions: Our study indicates a significant under-reporting in Chinese official data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. The magnitude of discrepancy between our estimates based on cremation related data and Chinese official figures in early February, the critical time for response to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests the need to reevaluate official statistics from China and consider all available and reasonable data sources for a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.","He, M.; Li, L.; Dehner, L.

This response to COVID-19 can be monitored based on the production of antibodies and, thus, serologic tests have become available for diagnostic purposes. Despite progress in this area, concerns have been raised that too many of the commercially available serologic detection systems are not completely reliable. To address this issue, Western blots should be considered for confirming a positive or borderline-positive result from a screening test, such as an ELISA. An additional benefit of Western blots would be to identify antigens that could form the basis for developing a vaccine. Little is known about the cell-mediated immune response against COVID-19.

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 μM. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles, which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Importance The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in cultured cells. The inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS, and COVID-19.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Kawase, Miyuki; Nao, Naganori; Shirato, Kazuya; Ujike, Makoto; Kamitani, Wataru; Shimojima, Masayuki; Fukushi, Shuetsu",bioRxiv,683,20

Almost sixty percent of the pathogens that have emerged in humans during the last 30–40 years are of animal origin and about sixty percent of them show an important variety of host species besides humans (3 or more possible host species). In this review, we focus on zoonotic infections with vector-borne transmission and dissect the contrasting effects that a multiplicity of host reservoirs and vectors can have on their disease dynamics. We discuss the effects exerted by host and vector species richness and composition on pathogen prevalence (i.e., reduction, including the dilution effect, or amplification). We emphasize that, in multiple host systems and for vector-borne zoonotic pathogens, host reservoir species and vector species can exert contrasting effect locally. The outcome on disease dynamics (reduced pathogen prevalence in vectors when the host reservoir species is rich and increased pathogen prevalence when the vector species richness increases) may be highly heterogeneous in both space and time. We then ask briefly how a shift towards a more systemic perspective in the study of emerging infectious diseases, which are driven by a multiplicity of hosts, may stimulate further research developments. Finally, we propose some research avenues that take better into account the multi-host species reality in the transmission of the most important emerging infectious diseases, and, particularly, suggest, as a possible orientation, the careful assessment of the life-history characteristics of hosts and vectors in a community ecology-based perspective.","Roche, Benjamin; Guégan, Jean-François",C R Biol,683,9

It can be a diagnostic challenge to identify COVID-19 patients without bacterial co-infection in whom antibiotics can be safely stopped. We sought to evaluate the validity of a guideline that recommends withholding antibiotics in patients with a low serum procalcitonin (PCT). Methods. We retrospectively collected 28-day outcome data on patients admitted to Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK, between 5 March and 15 April 2020, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCT within 48 hours of diagnosis. PCT was considered negative if [≤]0.25ng/ml and positive if >0.25ng/ml. Primary outcomes included antibiotic consumption, mortality, intensive care admission and length of hospital stay. Results. 368 patients met the inclusion criteria; 218 (59%) had a negative PCT and 150 (41%) positive. At 48 hours post-diagnosis, 73 (33%) of those with a negative PCT were receiving antimicrobials compared to 126 (84%) with a positive PCT (p<0.001), with a corresponding reduction in antimicrobial usage over 28 days (median DDD of 3.0 vs 6.8 (p<0.001); median DOT 2 vs 5 days (p<0.001) between the negative and positive PCT groups.) In the negative PCT group, there were fewer deaths (62 (28%) vs. 54 (36%), (p=0.021)) and critical care admissions (19 (9%) vs. 28 (19%), (p=0.007)) than in the positive PCT group. Median length of hospital stay was 8.7 and 9 days in the negative and positive PCT groups respectively. Conclusions.

Previous studies revealed that Abisil has geroprotective, anti-tumorigenic, and anti-angiogenic effects. Abisil decreased the expression of cyclin D1, E1, A2, and increased the phosphorylation rate of AMPK. Objective: In the present study, we analyzed the effect of Abisil on autophagy, the mitochondrial potential of embryonic human lung fibroblasts. We evaluated its antioxidant activity and analyzed the transcriptomic and proteomic effects of Abisil treatment. Results: Abisil treatment resulted in activation of autophagy, reversal of rotenone-induced elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and several-fold decrease of mitochondrial potential. Lower doses of Abisil (25 μg/ml) showed a better oxidative effect than high doses (50 or 125 μg/ml). Estimation of metabolic changes after treatment with 50 μg/ml has not shown any changes in oxygen consumption rate, but extracellular acidification rate decreased significantly. Abisil treatment (5 and 50 μg/ml) of MRC5-SV40 cells induced a strong transcriptomic shift spanning several thousand genes (predominantly, expression decrease). Among down-regulated genes, we noticed an over-representation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Additionally, we observed predominant downregulation of genes encoding for kinases. Proteome profiling also revealed that the content of hundreds of proteins is altered after Abisil treatment (mainly, decreased). These proteins were involved in cell cycle regulation, intracellular transport, RNA processing, translation, mitochondrial organization. Conclusions: Abisil demonstrated antioxidant and autophagy stimulating activity.

Growing evidence suggests that protective immunity can indeed be acquired post-infection—although a handful of reinfection cases have been reported. However, it is still unknown whether the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to some degree of long-lasting protection against the disease or the infection. This review draws insights from previous knowledge regarding the nature and longevity of immunity to the related virus, SARS-CoV, to fill the gaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

Here we detail the benefits and challenges of plant-based and cell-based meat alternatives with regard to production efficiency, product characteristics and impact categories.","Rubio, Natalie R.; Xiang, Ning; Kaplan, David L.",Nat Commun,683,16

Initial concern was focused on …H5N1…. More recently…a devastating outbreak of Ebola virus..(and) several other emerging viruses are believed to seriously threaten global health and global security. To prepare, scientists have been urged to discover new vaccines and treatments for these emerging viruses. At the same time, political leaders have been urged by global health experts to invest millions in a “top down” restructuring of the global health system. This article takes a different view. It focuses on an alternative approach to the scientific discovery of treatments for individual patients, reviews the mechanisms of action and clinical experience with specific drugs that might be useful, and considers whether or not recent lessons regarding this “bottom up” approach to treatment have been learned”. Now with a new virus and pandemic upon us, Fedson's 2016 comments appear chilling, are cause for reflection on what we have learnt and importantly offer focus on an immediate opportunity in the area of treating the host (Fedson DS, Ann Transl Med, 2016;4:421).","Martin, Jennifer H.; Clark, Julian; Head, Richard",Pharmacol Res Perspect,683,33
