The present study investigated associations between specific illness perceptions due to RA and HRQoL features. METHODS: For 191 patients with RA, illness perceptions were measured using the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (BIPQ) comprising 8 domains. HRQoL was determined with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The overall BIPQ of patients with RA was 49.09 ± 11.06. The highest and lowest scores were for concern (9.15 ± 1.81) and personal control (4.30 ± 2.52), respectively. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses showed that the overall BIPQ was significantly negatively associated with each HRQoL feature, and HRQoL total score (β = − 0.343, P < 0.001, 95% CI − 7.080 to − 4.077). Positive associations between BIPQ features and HRQoL included personal control (β = 0.119, P = 0.004, 95% CI 2.857–14.194) and treatment control (β = 0.084, P = 0.029, 95% CI 0.640–12.391). Negative associations with HRQoL were identity (β = − 0.105, P = 0.034, 95% CI − 13.159 to − 0.430) and emotional response (β = − 0.207, P < 0.001, 95% CI − 18.334 to − 6.811). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RA in China perceive their illness in ways that affect their HRQoL. These results suggest that strategies that target these perceptions may improve the quality of life of these patients.","Wang, Juan; Yang, Zhe; Zheng, Yan; Peng, Yaling; Wang, Qing; Xia, Hongli; Wang, Yan; Ding, Jin; Zhu, Ping; Shang, Lei; Zheng, Zhaohui",Health Qual Life Outcomes,681,1

In Italy diagnosis of CMPA is often over estimated. The double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge(DBPCFC) is widely considered as the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of food allergy. Methods: 14 patients, (12 months-12 yrs) previously diagnosed as having CMPA, underwent our diagnostic algorithm in order to confirm or to exclude diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithm includes: total blood cell count, serum IgE assay, RAST, betalactotest, Prick by prick with fresh milk, chemical examination and eosinophilic cell count of the stools. DBPCFC was performed with extensively hydrolyzed formula (as placebo) VS a lactose-free, cow milk derived formula. At discharge a post challenge form was given to parents to record delayed symptoms that might occur at home. Results: 12 out of 14 patients had positive results for skin prick test (prick by prick) and four out of them also presented specific IgE against CMPs. 13 patients showed tolerance to CMP during and after DBPCFC and had no symptoms also in the next 72h. Only one patient, aged 30 months, had to keep CMP avoidance. Conclusion: In our survey DBPCFC demonstrated tolerance to CMP for all but one patients. DBPCFC is effective also to disconfirm diagnosis of CMPA. Skin prick tests and serological specific IgE do not always correlate with oral tolerance test. Subjects with positive skin prick test and high serological specific IgE against CMP but tolerant at DBPCFC may reintroduce cow milk proteins in to their dietary meals.","Accomando, S; Serraino, F; Antona, R; Ferlisi, A; Pellitteri, V; Leone, S; Matina, F; Liotta, A; Corsello, G",Pediatr Res,681,1

Oral non-absorbable antibiotic prophylaxis (OAP) can be administered preoperatively to reduce the risk of SSIs. Its efficacy without simultaneous mechanical cleaning is unknown. METHODS: The Precaution trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted in six Dutch hospitals. Adult patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were randomized to receive either a three-day course of preoperative OAP with tobramycin and colistin or placebo. The primary composite endpoint was the incidence of deep SSI or mortality within 30 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included both infectious and non-infectious complications at 30 days and six months after surgery. RESULTS: The study was prematurely ended due to the loss of clinical equipoise. At that time, 39 patients had been randomized to active OAP and 39 to placebo, which reflected 8.1% of the initially pursued sample size. Nine (11.5%) patients developed the primary outcome, of whom four had been randomized to OAP (4/39; 10.3%) and five to placebo (5/39; 12.8%). This corresponds to a risk ratio in the intention-to-treat analysis of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23–2.78). In the per-protocol analysis, the relative risk was 0.64 (95% CI 0.12–3.46). CONCLUSIONS: Observational data emerging during the study provided new evidence for the effectiveness of OAP that changed both the clinical and medical ethical landscape for infection prevention in colorectal surgery. We therefore consider it unethical to continue randomizing patients to placebo. We recommend the implementation of OAP in clinical practice and continuing monitoring of infection rates and antibiotic susceptibilities.

The feed-based vaccination may be an alternative to minimize major infectious diseases in tilapia. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the haemato-immunological responses and effectiveness of a newly developed feed-based killed bivalent vaccine against Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas hydrophila in hybrid red tilapia. A total of 495 hybrid red tilapia of 61.23 ± 4.95 g were distributed into 5 groups (each with triplicate). The fish were immunized orally through bivalent (combined S. iniae and A. hydrophila) spray vaccine (BS group), bivalent formulate vaccine (BF group), monovalent S. iniae vaccine (MS group), monovalent A. hydrophila vaccine (MA group) and unvaccinated as a control group. The vaccine was orally administered on days 0, 14 and 42 applied feed-based bacterin at 5% body weight. The blood and spleen samples were collected from all groups on 7, 21 and 49 days post-vaccination, and also 96 h post-infection to assess their haemato-immune responses. RESULTS: Compared with the unvaccinated group, leukocyte, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes counts in vaccinated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) increased on 21, 49 days post-vaccination and also 96 h post-infection, while erythrocytes, haemoglobin and haematocrit in vaccinated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced only 96 h post-infection. Additionally, the lysozyme and phagocytic activity and, serum antibody (IgM) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) against S. iniae and A. hydrophila in vaccinated groups compared to the unvaccinated group in the pre- and post-infection. Results from the challenge through co-infection with S. iniae and A. hydrophila showed the relative percent survival (RPS) in BF group was 76.67 ± 4.71%, which had the capacity to induce significant protection (P < 0.05) compared to others groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the bivalent formulate (BF) group could elicit significant non-specific and specific immunological responses with higher protection in hybrid red tilapia. In addition, this newly developed feed-based bivalent vaccination can be a promising technique for effective and large scale fish immunization in the aquaculture industry.","Monir, Md Shirajum; Yusoff, Sabri bin Mohd; Zulperi, Zarirah binti Mohamed; Hassim, Hasliza binti Abu; Mohamad, Aslah; Ngoo, Muhamad Sofie bin Mohd Hafiz; Ina-Salwany, Md Yasin",BMC Vet Res,681,13

Nevertheless, due to changes in users’ contexts (e.g. noisy environment, preferred language, public place, etc.), restrictions on correct access to these documents may be imposed. One possible solution is to adapt their contents using adaptation services so that they comply, as far as possible, with the current constraints. In this respect, several adaptation approaches have been proposed. However, when it comes to selecting the required adaptation services, they often carry out this task according to predefined configurations or deterministic algorithms. Actually, the efficient selection of adaptation services is one of the key-elements involved in improving the quality of service in adaptation processes. To deal with this issue (i.e. the efficient selection of adaptation services), we first provide an enriched problem formulation as well as methods that we use in problem-solving. Then, we involve standard and compact evolutionary algorithms to find efficient adaptation plans. The standard version is usually adopted in systems that are not subject to specific constraints. The compact one is used in systems for which constraints on computational resources and execution time are considered. The proposal is validated through simulation, experiments and comparisons according to performance, execution time and energy consumption. The obtained results are satisfactory and encouraging.","Laboudi, Zakaria; Moudjari, Abdelkader; Saighi, Asma; Hamri, Hamana Nazim",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,681,1

TFL parameters differ in several fundamental ways from Holmium laser, including smaller fiber delivery, more strongly absorbed wavelength, low pulse energy/high pulse rate operation, and more uniform temporal pulse structure. High speed imaging of laser induced bubbles was performed at 105,000 frames per second and 10 μm spatial resolution to determine influence of these laser parameters on bubble formation and needle hydrophone data was also used to measure pressure transients. The TFL was operated at 1908 nm with pulse energies of 5-65 mJ, and pulse durations of 200-1000 μs, delivered through 105-μm-core and 270-μm-core silica optical fibers. Bubble dynamics using Holmium laser at a wavelength of 2100 nm with pulse energies of 200-1000 mJ and pulse duration of 350 μs was studied, for comparison. A single, 500 μs TFL pulse produced a bubble stream extending 1200 ± 90 μm and 1070 ± 50 μm from fiber tip, with maximum bubble widths averaging 650 ± 20 μm and 870 ± 40 μm (n = 4), for 105 μm and 270 μm fibers, respectively. These observations are consistent with previous studies which reported TFL ablation stallout at working distances beyond 1.0 mm. TFL bubble dimensions were four times smaller than for Holmium laser due to lower peak power and smaller fiber diameter used. The maximum pressure transients measured 0.6 bars at 35 mJ pulse energy for TFL and 7.5 bars at 600 mJ pulse energy for Holmium laser. These fundamental studies of bubble dynamics as a function of specific laser and fiber parameters may assist with optimization of the TFL parameters for safe and efficient lithotripsy in the clinic.

In the etiology of POCD, many factors have been cited, including thromboembolic complications. The incidence of cerebral embolization after lower extremity arthroplasty may be as high as 40-60%. The potential events of cerebral embolization could lead to a decrease in the regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) and increased serum levels of biochemical markers of brain damage. The objective of the study was to test whether there are any changes in the rSO2 values and serum markers of brain damage in patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifteen patients who underwent primary hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were analyzed. The rSO2 was monitored using infrared spectroscopy. Biochemical analyses of S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) protein and fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) serum concentrations were performed using immunoassay methods. RESULTS The values of rSO2 decreased during the surgery, but this was not related to mean arterial pressure variations or hemoglobin saturation. The concentration of S100B was increased compared to its preoperative values, and there were no changes in GFAP values. The changes in rSO2 readings correlated with the biomarkers' levels just after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that S100B may be a more specific marker of astroglial damage in patients after primary total hip arthroplasty. The decrease in rSO2 readings may be due to micro-thromboembolic events that occurred during the surgery. However, the results of this study are preliminary, and further studies are needed to establish its clinical efficacy.","Tomaszewski, Dariusz; Bałkota, Mariusz; Rybicki, Zbigniew",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,681,1

AIM Following the development of the Performance and Fitness (PERF-FIT) battery, this study investigated the construct validity with the ultimate aim of identifying attributes that discriminate between different levels of motor abilities and anaerobic or musculoskeletal fitness. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 34 children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and 34 matched typically developing children participated (7-10 years). The PERF-FIT was used to examine known group validity. The PERF-FIT items were also compared to test items of well-known standardized tests to examine concurrent validity. RESULTS Concurrent validity was found to be of the expected low to moderate magnitude. Children with DCD were consistently found to have lower levels of motor skill-related fitness compared to typically developing children. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS The PERF-FIT seems to be a valid test to measure movement skills, musculoskeletal fitness and agility in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years in low resourced communities. The test seems to discriminate between gross motor skills, and agility and power in children with and without DCD.","Smits-Engelsman, Bouwien; Cavalcante Neto, Jorge Lopes; Draghi, Tatiane Targino Gomes; Rohr, Liz Araújo; Jelsma, Dorothee",Research in developmental disabilities,681,16

Fibrosis, the excessive and inappropriate deposition of extracellular matrix in various tissues, is commonly found in patients with advanced type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and may contribute to organ dysfunction. Hyperglycemia, lipotoxic injury and insulin resistance activate a fibrotic response, not only through direct stimulation of matrix synthesis by fibroblasts, but also by promoting a fibrogenic phenotype in immune and vascular cells, and possibly also by triggering epithelial and endothelial cell conversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. High glucose stimulates several fibrogenic pathways, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, stimulating neurohumoral responses, activating growth factor cascades (such as TGF-β/Smad3 and PDGFs), inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, generating advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and stimulating the AGE-RAGE axis, and upregulating fibrogenic matricellular proteins. Although diabetes-activated fibrogenic signaling has common characteristics in various tissues, some organs, such as the heart, kidney and liver develop more pronounced and clinically significant fibrosis. This review manuscript summarizes current knowledge on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in diabetic fibrosis, discussing the fundamental links between metabolic perturbations and fibrogenic activation, the basis for organ-specific differences, and the promises and challenges of anti-fibrotic therapies for diabetic patients.","Tuleta, Izabela; Frangogiannis, Nikolaos G",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

STUDY DESIGN Cohort study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kırdar City Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey, from March to May 2020. METHODOLOGY One hundred and forty-four patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19, confirmed by Rt-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), were restrospectively reviewed. Patients who were hospitalised, received HQ or HQ plus AZ treatment, had a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), and had at least one ECG after treatment were included in the study. Patients with missing data were excluded. RESULTS Fifty-one (35.4%) patients were given hydroxychloroquine monoterapy (HQ), 93 (64.6%) were given hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (HA), and 70 (48.6%) were women. Pre-treatment mean QTc measurements were calculated as 410.61 ± 29.44 milliseconds (ms) for HQ group and 412.02 ± 25.37 ms for HA group, while the mean values of post-treatment QTc measurements were calculated as 432.31 ± 33.97 ms for HQ group and 432.03 ± 27.0 ms for the HA group. Post-treatment QTc measurements of both HA group and HQ group were prolonged compared to pre-treatment measurements. Ventricular arrhythmia was not observed in any patient. CONCLUSION For COVID-19, no globally accepted definite treatment has yet been found. Both of hydroxychloroquine monotherapy and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin treatment regimens cause QTc measurement to increase at a statistically significant level. We concluded that this increase in QTc did not cause ventricular arrhythmia.

Although it causes a wide range of abnormalities, cellular and molecular mechanisms of its action are not-well-understood. Oxidation of DNA, proteins, lipids, as well as depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), antioxidants and increase of intracellular calcium are the hypothesized mechanisms of its action at the acute phase of injury. In this review, the proteome analysis of SM toxicity has been considered. We selected articles that considered proteomics analysis of SM toxicity with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) followed by mass spectrometry. Our search yielded nine related articles, four original in vitro and five human studies. The results of these studies have revealed a change in expression pattern of various proteins such as haptoglobin, amyloid A1, surfactant proteins, S100 proteins, apolipoprotein, Vit D binding protein, transferrin, alpha 1 antitrypsin, protein disulfide isomerase and antioxidant enzymes in patients who were exposed to SM about 30 years ago. Most of these proteins are up- or down-regulated in response to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS). There is a tight link between the expression pattern of these proteins with accumulation of leukocytes, inflammatory conditions, antioxidant depletion, mitochondrial deficiency, as well as increased expression or activity of several proteases such as caspases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Therefore, excessive production of ROS and OS along with chronic inflammatory may be the long-term toxic effects of SM following acute exposure.","Borna, Hojat; Hosseini Qale Noe, Seyed Hojjat; Harchegani, Asghar Beigi; Talatappe, Nima Rahmani; Ghatrehsamani, Mahdi; Ghanei, Mostafa; Shahriary, Alireza",Inhalation toxicology,681,25

The aim of this study was to assess the morphologic changes in excised vein fragments after different durations of RF ablation exposure. METHODS In the first part of the study, we performed a morphologic analysis of eight cases of great saphenous vein (GSV) recanalization 6 months after RF ablation. The second part was performed on a suprafascial segment of the GSV with a length of >22 cm and a minimum diameter of 5 mm in 10 patients, who had given their consent to intraoperative excision of suprafascial GSV segments after RF ablation treatment through four 1-cm-long diametrical cuts. Prior ultrasound analysis had shown an average 6.9-mm diameter of the suprafascial segments. The segment was divided into three 7-cm-long subsegments and one control segment. The first, second, and third segments were treated with three, two, and one RF ablation cycles (ClosureFast; Covidien, Mansfield, Mass), respectively; the control segment was not exposed to RF ablation at all. Morphologic study of 160 sections of the vein (five sections of each segment and 10 control specimens) was carried out. The specimens were dyed with hematoxylin and orcein. The ensuing analysis was performed by an experienced expert with the blind study method (the specimens were numbered without any hint as to the quantity of RF ablation cycles performed on them). The intergroup comparison of the depth of venous wall damage was based on comparison of the coefficient of alteration, which is calculated as the relation of damage depth to thickness of the vein. RESULTS After one RF ablation cycle, the depth of blurring of the structural elements only on some portions reached the middle of the muscle layer of the wall (coefficient of alteration, α = 26%). After two cycles, blurring of the structural elements on some portions extended to the adventitia (α = 53%). After three cycles, uniform blurring of the structural elements of all layers of the venous wall up to the adventitia was seen (α = 92%). The statistically significant difference in the alteration coefficient, depending on the number of cycles of RF ablation (P < .005), was established. CONCLUSIONS The number of RF ablation cycles has an impact on the depth of vein wall damage. One and two cycles do not cause damage to all layers of the vein wall. Three cycles cause damage to all vein wall layers.","Shaidakov, Evgeny V; Grigoryan, Arsen G; Korzhevskii, Dmitriy E; Ilyukhin, Evgeny A; Rosukhovski, Dmitriy A; Bulatov, Vasiliy L; Tsarev, Oleg I",Journal of vascular surgery.

Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) is the most used tool to identify microvascular status in a large spectrum in a cohort of COVID-19 patients (no controls used) [2]. Objectives: To assess microvascular damage in recovered COVID-19 patients (range of 40-270 days from recovery) by considering the previous severity of the disease, and, as mandatory, the comparison with matched individuals suffering from primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PRP) and healthy volunteers (HV). Methods: NVC investigations were performed during standard clinical assessments in forty-four recovered COVID-19 patients (mean age 58±14 years, mean days from disease onset 129±54, mean days from disease recovery 106±52), twenty-two patients with PRP (mean age 60±15 years, mean years from disease onset 11±10) and twenty-two HV (mean age 60±14 years). COVID-19 patients were divided into two subgroups, according to the need of oxygen supplementation: twenty-two patients with severe lung involvement (need of Continuous Positive Airways Pressure and/or mechanical ventilation, mean age 57±12 years) vs twenty-two patients with mild-moderate lung involvement (need of Venturi mask or no need of oxygen supplementation, mean age 59±15 years). Clinical and demographic data of all the enrolled subjects were collected, during NVC examination. The following capillaroscopic parameters were evaluated: capillary number, dilated capillaries, giant capillaries, microhemorrhages, angiogenesis, disorganization of the microvascular array. A validated semiquantitative scoring (0-3) was adopted for NVC abnormalities [3-5]. Statistical analysis was carried out by non-parametric tests. Results: After COVID-19 recovery, no statistically significant difference was observed between COVID-19 patients and control groups of subjects concerning the score for the following NVC parameters: dilated capillaries, giant capillaries, disorganization of the microvascular array, angiogenesis. However, the capillary number per linear millimeter was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients (8.3±0.9) than in PRP (8.8±0.7, p=0.05) and HV (9.3±0.6, p<0.0001). Surprisingly, recovered COVID-19 patients showed significantly less microhemorrhages (score 0.4±0.3) than subjects of the other groups (PRP 0.6±0.5, p=0.01;HV 0.6±0.6, p=0.05). In particular, recovered patients who had more severe COVID-19 showed less microhemorrhages than patients with mild/moderate disease (score 0.18±0.4 vs 0.36±0.5), but this didn't reach the statistical significance (p=0.18). On the other hand, patients recovered from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection also showed higher rate of angiogenesis (0.18±0.4) than patients with mild/ moderate disease (no case, p=0.04). Conclusion: COVID-19 doesn't seem to significantly induce, in short-term, specific alterations in peripheral microvascular array as evaluated by NVC, despite the severity of the disease, except for a significant reduction of the absolute number of nailfold capillaries. The topic needs longer time of evaluation and larger number of COVID-19 recovered cases to also assess the role of concomitant therapies.","Gotelli, E.; Bica, P.

Several ‘virucidal’ products exist, including hand soaps, gels and surface disinfectants. Resin acids, which can be derived from Tall oil produced from trees, have been shown to exhibit anti-bacterial activity. However, whether these products or their derivatives have virucidal activity is unknown. Here, we assessed the capacity of Rosin soap to inactivate a panel of pathogenic mammalian viruses in vitro. We show that Rosin soap can inactivate the human enveloped viruses: influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For IAV, rosin soap could provide a 100,000-fold reduction in infectivity. However, Rosin soap failed to affect the non-enveloped encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The inhibitory effect of Rosin soap against IAV infectivity was dependent on its concentration but not dependent on incubation time nor temperature. Together, we demonstrate a novel chemical inactivation method against enveloped viruses, which could be of use in preventing virus infections in certain settings. Importance Viruses remain a significant cause of human disease and death, most notably illustrated through the current Covid-19 pandemic. Control of virus infection continues to pose a significant global health challenge to the human population. Viruses can spread through multiple routes, including via environmental and surface contamination where viruses can remain infectious for days.

Such typical actions apparently help slow down the spreading of infection. Thanks to today's broad public media coverage, the fear factor may even contribute to prevent an outbreak from happening. We are motivated to study such effects by adopting a complex network approach. Firstly we evaluate the simple case where connections between individuals are randomly removed due to fear factor. Then we consider a different case where each individual keeps at least a few connections after contact reduction. Such a case is arguably more realistic since people may choose to keep a few social contacts, e.g., with their family members and closest friends, at any cost. Finally a study is conducted on the case where connection removals are carried out dynamically while the infection is spreading out. Analytical and simulation results show that the fear factor may not easily prevent an epidemic outbreak from happening in scale-free networks. However, it significantly reduces the fraction of the nodes ever getting infected during the outbreak.","Wang, Yubo; Xiao, Gaoxi; Wong, Limsoon; Fu, Xiuju; Ma, Stefan; Cheng, Tee Hiang",,681,1

Likewise, monitoring efforts directed either at tracking trends in natural systems or documenting the environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities were largely curtailed. In addition, lockdowns have affected human activity in natural environments in ways that impact the systems under investigation, rendering many widely used approaches for handling missing data (e.g., available case analysis, mean substitution) inadequate. Failure to properly address missing data will lead to bias and weak inference. Researchers and environmental monitors must ensure that lost data are handled robustly by diagnosing patterns and mechanisms of missingness and applying appropriate tools like multiple imputation, full-information maximum likelihood, or Bayesian approaches. The pandemic has altered many aspects of society and it is timely that we critically reassess how we treat missing data in ecological research and environmental monitoring, and plan future data collection to ensure robust inference when faced with missing data. These efforts will help ensure the integrity of inference derived from datasets spanning the COVID-19 lockdown and beyond.","Hossie, T. J.; Gobin, J.; Murray, D.

Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters, such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions, are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as a constrained, multi-dimensional, multi-objective, dynamic optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework for the identification of optimal designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and the approach to numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.","Cheng, Qu; Collender, Philip A.; Heaney, Alexandra K.; Li, Xintong; Dasan, Rohini; Li, Charles; Lewnard, Joseph; Zelner, Jon; Liang, Song; Chang, Howard H.; Waller, Lance A.; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Yang, Changhong; Remais, Justin V.",,681,20

In order for online learning to be effective, students have to blends in with the new norms and adjust accordingly including balancing their self-learning skills and behaviour, which is crucial. Thus, this quantitative study demonstrates how the sociodemographic factors and socioeconomic status of a student could influence the students' self-learning necessity and effectiveness as well as their learning habits during Covid-19. The data for this study was collected through online questionnaires distributed via an online platform to a public university community in Malaysia across different faculties, whose learning was disrupted due to the crisis. From the survey, 668 respondents have consented to join the survey. As a result, this study reported that there is a slight increase of 3.2% of students' self-learning hours before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Besides, the study also found that there is a weak association between the five (5) sociodemographic independent variables consist of gender, current year of study, level of study, area of residence, and total family income per month in student's self-learning necessity and student's self-learning effectiveness during COVID-19 pandemic.

Existing influenza surveillance programs have relied heavily on reporting of medically attended influenza (MAI). Continuously monitoring cause-specific school absenteeism may identify local activity acceleration of seasonal influenza. The Oregon Child Absenteeism Due to Respiratory Disease Study (ORCHARDS; Oregon, WI) implements daily school-based monitoring of influenza-like illness-specific student absenteeism (a-ILI) in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools and assesses this approach for early detection of accelerated influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmission in schools and surrounding communities. Methods: Starting in September 2014, ORCHARDS has combined reporting of daily absenteeism though automated processes within 6 schools and home visits to school children with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Demographic, epidemiological, and symptom data are collected along with respiratory specimens. Specimens are tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Household members may participate in a supplementary household transmission study. Community comparisons are made possible using a pre-existing, long-standing, and highly effective influenza surveillance program, based on MAI at 5 primary care clinics in the same geographical area. Results: Over the first 5 years, a-ILI occurred on 6,634 (0.20%) of 3,260,461 student school days. Viral pathogens were detected in 64.5% of 1,728 children visited at home with ARI. Influenza was the most commonly detected virus, noted in 23.3% of ill students. Influenza (p<0.001) and adenovirus (P=0.004) were significantly associated with a-ILI. Discussion: ORCHARDS uses a community-based design to detect and evaluate influenza trends over multiple seasons and to evaluate the utility of absenteeism for early detection of accelerated influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmission in schools and surrounding communities. Initial findings suggest the study design is succeeding in collecting appropriate data to achieve study objectives.","Temte, J.

In the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 (H2020) project PROSNOW, a service to enable real-time optimization of grooming and snow-making in ski resorts was developed. We applied snow management strategies integrated in the snowpack simulations of AMUNDSEN, Crocus, and SNOWPACK–Alpine3D for nine PROSNOW ski resorts located in the European Alps. We assessed the performance of the snow simulations for five winter seasons (2015–2020) using both ground-based data (GNSS-measured snow depth) and spaceborne snow maps (Copernicus Sentinel-2). Particular attention has been devoted to characterizing the spatial performance of the simulated piste snow management at a resolution of 10 m. The simulated results showed a high overall accuracy of more than 80 % for snow-covered areas compared to the Sentinel-2 data. Moreover, the correlation to the ground observation data was high. Potential sources for local differences in the snow depth between the simulations and the measurements are mainly the impact of snow redistribution by skiers;compensation of uneven terrain when grooming;or spontaneous local adaptions of the snow management, which were not reflected in the simulations. Subdividing each individual ski resort into differently sized ski resort reference units (SRUs) based on topography showed a slight decrease in mean deviation. Although this work shows plausible and robust results on the ski slope scale by all three snowpack models, the accuracy of the results is mainly dependent on the detailed representation of the real-world snow management practices in the models. As snow management assessment and prediction systems get integrated into the workflow of resort managers, the formulation of snow management can be refined in the future.","Ebner, Pirmin Philipp Koch Franziska Premier Valentina Marin Carlo Hanzer Florian Carmagnola Carlo Maria Hugues François Günther Daniel Monti Fabiano Hargoaa Olivier Strasser Ulrich Morin Samuel Lehning Michael",The Cryosphere,681,16

It scales up in the face of pandemics that give rise to multiple sources of uncertainty and where various contextual factors interact with each other and with policy parameters that combine to yield outcome distributions. This paper proposes a unified agent-based modeling framework to derive qualitative insights that assist and inform policy decisions related to pandemics. The general framework comprises a contagion model that explicates exogenous policy-relevant variables, as well as their links with features of the environment in which the policy decisions will be implemented. Furthermore, the framework identifies sources of uncertainty at different system layers. The characterization of the macro level, for example, as manifested in the network structure, encompasses two constitutive factors. These two factors, in turn, capture much of the stochasticity that results from the network’s inherent randomness. By synthesizing the model components further into a broader agent-based model, the current framework also accounts for heterogeneous micro-level attributes that collectively yield macro-level outcomes. Several stylized examples help establish insights into the overall tendency of complex systems to produce multidimensional outputs.

An online survey which was carried out between 30 March 2020 and 18 April 2020. A total of 367 responses were collected during this period. Findings of the study indicate that economic nationalism, lockdown sentiments and sustainable approach (LSSA), and product-specific ethnocentric behaviour (PSEB) tendency significantly influence the willingness to buy country’s own brands and products. Present study results reveal that during pandemic consumers have realized the importance of hygiene products, environment-friendly products, regional (local) products, and satisfaction beyond shopping;these factors determine their willingness to buy Indian brands (WBIB)/made-in-India products. Further, post lockdown and post COVID era, consumers feel that buying Indian-made products and encouraging others to buy them would impact and revive the Indian economy constructively. It was also found that the influence of factors such as economic nationalism, LSSA, and PSEB on the WBIB is mediated by attitude towards foreign products.

The accuracy and precision that our model receives is on par with the best performing non-interpretable deep learning models when we tested the models on the dataset of X-ray images. Our model attains the highest accuracy of 87.27% on classification of three classes of images, that is close to the accuracy of 88.42% attained by a non-interpretable model on the classification of the given dataset.","Singh, G.; Yow, K.

COVID-19 pandemic has neither clinically proven vaccine nor drugs so far. It is now obvious that the world is in dire need for non-clinical, real-time, faster and cost-effective and secure smart solutions for monitoring, contact tracing, and diagnosing/detecting COVID-19 patients and hence mitigating the burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, Machine learning approaches can be leveraged in all aspects that could impact the patients and the future care guidelines. However, ensuring the data privacy, security and the conformity to data protection regulations will become even more of a challenge. This leads to the requirement for secured and privacy-preserving machine learning mechanisms for COVID-19-based healthcare applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based privacy-preserving support vector machine (SVM) classification over vertically partitioned IoMT data for a clinical decision support (CDS) system. The proposed system does not require any intervention or direct interactions between data owners. Both local training and building the global classification model run on verifiable and private smart contracts rather than relying on untrusted third parties. We find that the proposed system is more secure and efficient. © 2021 ACM.","Smahi, A.; Xia, Q.; Gao, J.; Xia, H.","6th International Conference on Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, ICMAI 2021",681,22

If the agents can be trained to demonstrate optimal behaviour in a pandemic, their actions can possibly be replicated to improve spread in a real-life scenario. The aim of this research is to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents to survive in a rule-based AI environment that simulates the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa. The RL agents used in the training environment were created using Unity's ML agent SDK. The ML agent SDK supports the usage of two RL-specific algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). This study contributes to the AI space by providing insight into how a virus and its interaction with a population can be modelled using Unity and machine learning. The agents were able to combat COVID-19 effectively and did so by self-Training how to maintain social distance and have regular check-ups at the hospital. It was also observed that susceptible agents pay frequent visits to the hospital without ever being rewarded for doing so.

Objective: Estimate incidence of breakthrough infections and assess associations with risk factors using self-reported data from a large NC population sample. Design: Prospective observational cohort study utilizing daily online survey data to capture information about COVID-19 symptoms, testing, and vaccination status. Setting: Six health care systems in North Carolina with data collected between January 15, 2021 and September 24, 2021. Participants: Adult study participants who reported full vaccination with a COVID-19 mRNA or J&J non-replicating viral vector vaccine (n = 16,020). Exposures: Potential community exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcome and Measures: Self-reported breakthrough infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination was self-reported in 1.9% of participants, with an incidence rate of 7.3 per 100,000 person-years. Younger age (45-64 vs. 18-44: HR (95% CI) = 0.65 (0.51-0.82); 65+ vs. 18-44: HR (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.39-0.90)), and vaccination with J&J Ad26.COV2.S were associated with a higher risk of breakthrough infection compared to vaccination with Pfizer BNT162b2 (Ad26.COV2.S vs. BNT162b2: HR (95% CI) = 2.23 (1.40-3.56)), while participants vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (mRNA-1273 vs. BNT162b2: HR (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.50-0.96) and those residing in urban counties experienced a lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection compared with those from suburban (HR (95% CI) = 1.39 (1.01-1.90)) or rural (HR (95% CI) = 1.57 (1.16-2.11)) counties. There was no significant association between breakthrough infection and participant sex, race, healthcare worker status, prior COVID-19 infection, routine mask use, or overall vaccination rate in the county of residence. Conclusions and Relevance: This NC community-based observational study showed that the proportion of the cohort who self-report breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections was 7.3 events per 100,000 person-years. Younger adults, those vaccinated with J&J Ad26.COV2.S, and those residing in suburban or rural counties were at higher risk of breakthrough infections and should be targeted for additional risk mitigation strategies to decrease community transmission.","Uschner, D.; Bott, M.; Santacatterina, M.; Gunaratne, M.

These changes are deemed as evolutionary and would bring a new phase of transformation. However, current practices of both people and businesses might cease once the crisis dis-appears. In the tourism context, going back to unsustainable and irresponsible practices would lead to the re-emergence of tourism aversion. This research note addresses the possibility that COVID-19 has only brought a temporary halt to the pre-existing issue of over-tourism and its related unsustainable practices. Even though the travel restrictions imposed by several countries amidst the spread of coronavirus have created a situation of “zero tourism”, the tourism sector has now resumed its operations in most of the world. By presenting a conceptual framework, this note stresses that if the sector continues to act in the same way as before the virus, the situation of overtourism will re-emerge in the post-COVID-19 phase. Therefore, to prevent this issue, emphasising quality tourism, inculcating responsible behaviour, and the incorporation of technology are suggested. © 2021, Lodz University Press.

It is possible to use online to prevent the accumulation of patients in the hospital. Management emphasizes non-surgical solutions such as lifestyle, nutritional patterns, behavioral concepts, and periodic drug administration. Implementation is carried out with preconditions, namely patient safety, an integrated system related to payment and prescription of drugs. Things that need to be underlined in telemedicine governance are the need for adequate counseling and good cooperation between doctors and patients because this will affect diagnosis and management.

This paper presents the necessary enablers for setting up RVS and its influence on cognitive aspects of assessing practical competences. Data were gathered through observations, questionnaires, and interviews from students and instructors, using action-case research methodology. The results show the potential of RVS for supporting higher cognitive processes, such as recognition, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, and allowed students to demonstrate whether they had achieved the required learning objectives. Other reported benefits were the value of not gathering people (imposed by the pandemic), experiencing new, challenging incident scenarios, increased motivation for applying RVS based training both for students and instructors, and reduced traveling (corresponding to 15,400 km for a class). While further research is needed for defining how to integrate RVS in practical training and assessment for IC education and for increased generalizability, this research pinpoints current benefits and limitations, in relation to the cognitive aspects and in comparison, to previous examination formats. © 2021 by the authors.

Many governments have moved education completely online, with the idea that although schools are shut, classes can continue;however, the question regarding whether teachers are prepared for this massive shift in educational practice remains unanswered. This study addresses this issue through the lens of teachers’ technology, learners, pedagogy, academic discipline content, and content knowledge (TLPACK). Two groups of 250 teachers (n = 500) who teach various levels of students participated in a two-phase survey. The phases of the survey took place in 2017 and 2020 (i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). Participants answered 38 reliable and valid questions about TLPACK to address three research questions, and the collected data were subjected to frequentist and Bayesian statistical analysis. The analysis indicated that teachers’ TLPACKs were significantly different before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study revealed significant correlations among teachers’ TLPACK constructs and found that, among these constructs, the strongest relationship was that between learner knowledge (i.e., knowledge about the learners) and pedagogy knowledge.

Limited clinical information about COVID-19 on solid organ transplant (SOT) are available so far. We herein report our preliminary experience with COVID-19 in SOT recipients in the first few weeks of the outbreak in Qatar. Method: All SOT recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 up to 23 May 2020 were included. Baseline characteristics, antivirals and immunosuppressive management, complications, and outcomes were retrospectively extracted from the electronic health system. Categorical data are summarized as frequency and percentages, while continuous variables are presented as medians and ranges. Results: Twenty-four SOT patients with COVID-19 were included in this report (kidney: 16, liver: 6, heart: 1, and combined liver and kidney: 1). The median age was 57 years (range 24–72). Thanks to proactive screening, five (21%) asymptomatic cases were diagnosed (Table S1). Among the other 19 symptomatic patients, fever (15/19) and cough (13/19) were the most frequent presenting symptoms (Table S1). All patients were hospitalized;5 (21%) required invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) (Table S2). Eleven (46%) patients developed acute kidney injury as a complication, including 3 in association with drug-drug interactions involving investigational COVID-19 therapies (Table S2). Maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy was changed in 18 (75%) patients, but systemic corticosteroids were not withdrawn in any. After a median follow up of 43 days (26–89), 18 (75%) patients had been discharged home, 3 (12.3%) were still hospitalized, 2 (8.3%) were still in ICU, and 1 (4.2%) had died (Table S2). Conclusion: Although higher mortality rates were observed in other reports,2,3 our results suggest that asymptomatic COVID-19 is possible in SOT recipients and that overall outcomes are not consistently worse than other immunocompetent patients.

Most patients with implantable cardiac devices (pacemakers and defibrillators) have significant cardiovascular co-morbidities, which would suggest a higher mortality in device patients during the pandemic. AimTo review inpatient mortality of patients with cardiac devices in our hospital before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodA retrospective analysis of all in-hospital deaths over 12 months, between 1st November 2019 and 31st October 2020, at a district general hospital in the UK. All patients with implantable cardiac devices were identified and their COVID-19 infection status determined from the death certificate. Results 131 in-patients (76% male) with implantable cardiac devices (64% pacemakers, 23% biventricular pacemakers, and 13% defibrillators) died during the study period. Mean age of death was 84 years (SD ± 8 years). Most deaths (91%) occurred on the medical ward (including level 2 respiratory care unit). There were more deaths from March 2020, peaking in April 2020, before gradually declining in May 2020, correlating with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (figure 1). The majority of patients who died in April 2020 were COVID positive. From early September 2020 onwards, the number of COVID positive deaths started to increase again, correlating with the second wave. Following the declaration of the pandemic, deaths occurred mostly amongst COVID negative patients (figure 2). Conclusion Inpatient mortality of patients with cardiac device were highest in the elderly population which predominantly occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic.","Manorekang, R.; Nayar, V.",Heart,681,28

It considers its use to define design strategies aiming at mitigating the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some governments have made use of identified citizens' data as well as stored population data collected through telephone companies. In search of new strategies to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic, data such as statistical surveys of the population have been collected and used for communication. As a result, new services are offering digital applications which can help contain the pandemic. Designers are amongst the categories of professionals involved in this new development. When monitoring a community, aspects such as data privacy and surveillance capitalism need to be considered. What will happen to the data collected once the pandemic is over is also a matter of concern. In this context, how and what aspects designers should consider in this scenario are questions that need to be addressed. This study attempts to answer these questions based upon the results of a systematic literature review on the topic.

As it is certain that this pandemic is not the last one that the World is to experience, there are ongoing massive efforts to strengthen the resilience of today's globalised economy against the effects of future pandemics. One such measure, which has deployed widely, is the use of infrared cameras to detect febrile persons at e.g. border crossings. However, infrared thermography suffers from a number of shortcomings, which lead to high sensitivity but very poor specificity of detection. In this paper we outline our proposed method of full-body sub-mm wave thermography. The method builds on the fact that most clothing materials are relatively transmissive to submm-waves, while the skin emissivity is high, giving access to full-body thermal images. Highly specific detection of fever is possible thanks to the human body's physiological response to infections.

A survey administered after the course experience obtained 67 valid responses revealing a high level of positivity towards the PA course design. Additionally, the course succeeded in building students’ self-efficacy and language use in a more strategic manner. Students also acknowledged the differences in the functionality between the test and PA methods, signifying a higher level of learning attained.

Repurposing existing medications may offer the best hope for treating COVID 19 patients to curb the pandemic. IMU-838 is a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, which is an effective mechanism for antiviral effects against respiratory viruses. When used synergistically with Oseltamivir, therapeutic effects have been observed against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in rodents.(13) The IONIC trial is a randomized control trial that will investigate whether time to clinical improvement in COVID 19 patients is improved following a 14 day course of IMU-838 + Oseltamivir versus Oseltamivir alone. Methods: IONIC trial is an open label study in which participants will be randomised 1:1 in two parallel arms; the intervention arm (IMU-838 + Oseltamivir) and control arm (Oseltamivir only). The primary outcome is time-to-clinical improvement; defined as the time from randomisation to: a 2-point improvement on WHO ordinal scale; discharge from hospital, or death (whichever occurs first). The study is sponsored by UHCW NHS Trust and funded by LifeArc. Discussion: The IONIC Protocol describes an overarching trial design to provide reliable evidence on the efficacy of IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) when delivered in combination with an antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir) [IONIC Intervention] for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection in adult patients receiving usual standard of care. Trial Registration: The trial was registered with EudraCT (2020-001805-21) on 09.04.2020 and ISRCTN on 23.09.2020 (ISRCTN53038326) and Clinicaltrials.gov on 17.08.2020 (NCT04516915) Strengths and Limitations: This study is the first to recruit participants in the trial exploring the effectiveness of IMU-838 in COVID-19. In addition, we believe it is the only trial exploring the effectiveness of IMU-838 in combination with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

In addition it was unclear if race and socioeconomic status affected hospitalization rates. Methods: We describe a cohort of 25 solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) within a single-center who were subsequently hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. In addition, we compared baseline characteristics of our cohort with all of our transplants from 1/2/2015 until 11/5/2020. Results: Transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 have many comorbidities (96% with hypertension, 60% with heart failure or ischemic heart disease, and 60% with diabetes). Overall SOTR patients frequently presented with AKI (44%), frequently required ICU stay (52%), and frequently required intubation (36%). We discovered a statistically significant racial disparity in COVID-19 infection in minorities within our cohort compared to our baseline transplant recipient population. Conclusion: Transplant recipients tended to have more atypical symptoms such as diarrhea and tolerated a stepwise reduction of immunosuppression. Solid organ transplant recipients - particularly minorities and low income patients-may benefit from additional COVID-19 precautions such as earlier access to vaccination.

More than one year after the first reported case, significant knowledge gaps remain, highlighting the need for a coordinated approach. To address this need, the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Working Group (MNCH WG) of the COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition conducted an international survey to identify global research priorities for COVID-19 in maternal, reproductive and child health. Method This project was undertaken using a modified Delphi method. An electronic questionnaire was disseminated to clinicians and researchers in three different languages (English, French and Spanish) via MNCH WG affiliated networks. Respondents were asked to select the five most urgent research priorities among a list of 17 identified by the MNCH WG. Analysis of questionnaire data was undertaken to identify key similarities and differences among respondents according to questionnaire language, location and specialty. Following elimination of the seven lowest ranking priorities, the questionnaire was recirculated to the original pool of respondents. Thematic analysis of final questionnaire data was undertaken by the MNCH WG from which four priority research themes emerged. Results Questionnaire 1 was completed by 225 respondents from 29 countries. Questionnaire 2 was returned by 49 respondents. The four priority research themes were 1) access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) the direct and 3) indirect effects of COVID-19 on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children and 4) the transmission of COVID-19 and protection from infection. Conclusion The results of these questionnaires indicated a high level of concordance among continents and specialties regarding priority research themes. This prioritized list of research uncertainties, developed to specifically highlight the most urgent clinical needs as perceived by healthcare professionals and researchers, could help funding organizations and researchers to answer the most pressing questions for clinicians and public health professionals during the pandemic. It is hoped that these identified priority research themes can help focus the discussion regarding the allocation of limited resources to enhance COVID-19 research in MNCH globally.","Etti, M.; Alger, J.; Salas, S.

While several research groups have made strides in developing candidate vaccines and therapeutics against henipaviruses, such countermeasures have not been licensed for human use, and significant gaps in knowledge about the human immune response to these viruses exist. To address these gaps, we isolated a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of an individual with prior occupation-related exposure to the equine HeV vaccine (Equivac® HeV). Competition-binding and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies identified at least six distinct antigenic sites on the HeV/NiV receptor binding protein (RBP) that are recognized by human mAbs. Antibodies recognizing multiple antigenic sites potently neutralized NiV and/or HeV isolates in vitro. The most potent class of cross-reactive antibodies achieved neutralization by blocking viral attachment to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. Antibodies from this class mimic receptor binding by inducing a receptor-bound conformation to the HeV-RBP protein tetramer, exposing an epitope that appears to lie hidden in the interface between protomers within the HeV-RBP tetramer. Antibodies that recognize this cryptic epitope potently neutralized HeV and NiV. Flow cytometric studies using cell-surface-displayed HeV-RBP protein showed that cross-reactive, neutralizing mAbs from each of these classes cooperate for binding. In a highly stringent hamster model of NiVB infection, antibodies from both classes reduced morbidity and mortality and achieved synergistic protection in combination and provided therapeutic benefit when combined into two bispecific platforms. These studies identified multiple candidate mAbs that might be suitable for use in a cocktail therapeutic approach to achieve synergistic antiviral potency and reduce the risk of virus escape during treatment.","Doyle, Michael P.; Kose, Nurgun; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Binshtein, Elad; Amaya, Moushimi; Nagel, Marcus; Annand, Edward J.; Armstrong, Erica; Bombardi, Robin; Dong, Jinhui; Schey, Kevin L.; Broder, Christopher C.; Zeitlin, Larry; Kuang, Erin A.; Bornholdt, Zachary A.; West, Brandyn R.; Geisbert, Thomas W.; Cross, Robert W.; Crowe, James E.",bioRxiv,681,20

To assure proper sample collection, sample adequacy controls (SACs) are needed that detect substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity. This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized Youdens index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of 34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa, along with air swabs collected as negative controls (total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlockTM swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabsTM (p = 0.012). The results indicate that quantification of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the mouth. However, it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally., which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis.","Deviaene, M.; Weigel, K. M.; Wood, R.

Methods: The levels of plasma SAM and SAH were determined in patients admitted with COVID-19 (n = 56, mean age = 61). Lung injury was identified by computed tomography (CT) in accordance with the CT0-4 classification. Results: SAM was found to be a potential marker of lung damage risk in COVID-19 patients (SAM > 80 nM; CT3,4 vs. CT 0-2: relative ratio (RR) was 3.0; p = 0.0029). SAM/SAH > 6.0 was also found to be a marker of lung injury (CT2-4 vs. CT0,1: RR = 3.47, p = 0.0004). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were associated with SAM (r= 0.44, p = 0.01) and SAH (r= 0.534, p = 0.001) levels. Conclusions: High SAM levels and high methylation index are associated with the risk of lung injury in COVID-19 patients.

It is often reported by patients with migraine and co-occurs with conditions like tinnitus and tremor. The underlying pathophysiology of the condition is poorly understood. Previously we hypothesised, that VSS may be characterised by disruptions to rhythmical activity within the visual system1. To test this, data from 18 patients diagnosed with visual snow syndrome (VSS), and 16 matched controls, were acquired using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants were presented with visual grating stimuli, known to elicit decreases in alpha-band (8-13Hz) power and increases in gamma-band power (40-70Hz). Data were mapped to source-space using a beamformer. Across both groups, decreased alpha power and increased gamma power localised to early visual cortex. Data from primary visual cortex (V1) were compared between groups. No differences were found in either alpha or gamma peak frequency or the magnitude of alpha power, p>.05. However, compared with controls, our VSS cohort displayed significantly increased V1 gamma power, p=.035. This new electromagnetic finding concurs with previous fMRI and PET findings suggesting that in VSS, the visual cortex is hyper-excitable. The coupling of alpha-phase to gamma amplitude (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC) within V1 was also quantified. Compared with controls, the VSS group had significantly reduced alpha-gamma PAC, p<.05, indicating a potential excitation-inhibition imbalance in VSS, as well as a potential disruption to top-down “noise-cancellation” mechanisms. Overall, these results suggest that rhythmical brain activity in primary visual cortex is both hyperexcitable and disorganised in VSS, consistent with visual snow being a condition of thalamocortical dysrhythmia.","Hepschke, Jenny L.; Seymour, Robert A; He, Wei; Etchell, Andrew; Sowman, Paul F; Fraser, Clare L",bioRxiv,681,17

Still, Covid-19 could not have come at a worse time owing to a myriad of crises the country was going through. As a result, the Covid-19 pandemic was much more than a public health crisis as it threatened already vulnerable people, putting lives and livelihoods at risk. This article focuses on the socioeconomic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, examining the social pattern of its unfolding and impact, analyzing the institutional and communal responses to the disease, and marking the effects of its aftermath in Harare’s high-density residential spaces. The research design captures a broad empirical picture of what was happening by specifically drawing on case study examples from Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe. The broad objective of the research brings out how low-income households experienced the Covid-19 pandemic compared to higher-income households as informed by sex-based differences, access to healthcare, and food. It also captures the differential impacts and inequalities in socioeconomic outcomes, livelihoods, poverty reduction, and human development informing these household experiences. Beyond this, the study captures and highlights how the Covid-19 crisis led to widespread instances of food insecurity, economic anxiety, and general disenfranchisement from alternative sources of income that, in turn, created further social upheaval. The last strand of this article exposes the implications of some of the public health measures instituted in attempts to tackle Covid-19.

Then, we eliminated author name ambiguity and integrated articles’ publication information as well as authors’ affiliation information into the graph. By this way, connections are established between authors, articles, entities and affiliations. Our model which aims at named entity recognition achieved an F1 score of 92.57% on average. This graph not only allows us to seek out hotspots, utilize specific knowledge and transfer research results quickly, but also helps us understand the research development process. It can also aid scholars to focus on specific authors and entities.

It is known that in early June 2020, Indonesia has claimed to open activities during the pandemic with the new normal system. Though the number of COVID-19 cases is still increasing in almost infected areas, normal activities are coming back with health care protocols where public areas are opened as usual with certain restrictions. In order to have observations of spreading impact of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number (Ro) i.e. the reproduction number (Ro) is the ratio between 2 parameters of SIR model where SIR stands for Susceptible individuals, Infected individuals, and Recovered individuals respectively. The reproduction numbers are computed as discrete values depending on time. The used research method is finite difference scheme for computing rate of change parameters in SIR models based on the COVID-19 cases in Indonesia (global area), Jakarta (medium area) and Salatiga (small area) by considering the number of people in these areas respectively. The simple forward finite difference is employed to the SIR model to have time dependent of parameters. The second approach is using the governing linear system to obtain the values of parameter daily. These parameters are computed for each day such that the values of Ro are obtained as function of time. The research result shows that 3 types areas give the same profiles of parameters that the rate of changes of reproduction numbers are decreasing with respect to time. This concludes that the reproduction numbers are most likely decreasing.","Trihandaru, Suryasatriya; Parhusip, Hanna Arini; Susanto, Bambang; Sardjono, Yohanes; en,",JTAM (Jurnal Teori Dan Aplikasi Matematika),681,16

We have used yeast DNA polymerases η, ζ, and Rev1 to study translesion synthesis (TLS) past a nitrogen mustard-based ICL with an 8-atom linker between the crosslinked bases. The Rev1-Pol ζ complex was most efficient in complete bypass synthesis, by 2-3 fold, compared to Pol ζ alone or Pol η. Rev1 protein, but not its catalytic activity, was required for efficient TLS. A dCMP residue was faithfully inserted across the ICL-G by Pol η, Pol ζ, and Rev1-Pol ζ. Rev1-Pol ζ, and particularly Pol ζ alone showed a tendency to stall before the ICL, whereas Pol η stalled just after insertion across the ICL. The stalling of Pol η directly past the ICL is attributed to its autoinhibitory activity, caused by elongation of the short ICL-unhooked oligonucleotide (a six-mer in our study) by Pol η providing a barrier to further elongation of the correct primer. No stalling by Rev1-Pol ζ directly past the ICL was observed, suggesting that the proposed function of Pol ζ as an extender DNA polymerase is also required for ICL repair.","Bezalel-Buch, Rachel; Cheun, Young K.; Roy, Upasana; Schärer, Orlando D.; Burgers, Peter M.",bioRxiv,681,20

Recent advances in organoid technology offer a unique opportunity to grow different human “organs” in vitro, including the human airway, that faithfully recapitulate tissue architecture and function. We have explored the potential of human airway organoids (AOs) as a novel system in which to model tuberculosis infection. To this end, we adapted biosafety containment level 3–approved procedures to allow successful microinjection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, into AOs. We reveal that mycobacteria infected epithelial cells with low efficiency, and that the organoid microenvironment was able to control, but not eliminate the pathogen. We demonstrate that AOs responded to infection by inducing cytokine and antimicrobial peptide production, and inhibiting mucins. Given the importance of myeloid cells in tuberculosis infection, we co-cultured mycobacteria-infected organoids with human monocyte-derived macrophages, and found that these cells were recruited to the organoid epithelium. We conclude that adult stem cell–derived airway organoids can be used to model early events of tuberculosis infection and offer new avenues for fundamental and therapeutic research.","Iakobachvili, Nino; Leon Icaza, Stephen Adonai; Knoops, Kèvin; Sachs, Norman; Mazères, Serge; Simeone, Roxane; Peixoto, Antonio; Murris-Espin, Marlène; Mazières, Julien; López-Iglesias, Carmen; Ravelli, Raimond B.G.; Neyrolles, Olivier; Meunier, Etienne; Lugo-Villarino, Geanncarlo; Clevers, Hans; Cougoule, Céline; Peters, Peter J.",bioRxiv,681,1

These generators satisfy the superconformal algebra of $\mathcal N=4$ SYM theory. We also compute the three-point and four-point celestial super-amplitude explicitly. They can be identified as the correlation functions of the celestial superfields living at the celestial sphere. We further study the soft and collinear limits which give rise to the super-Ward identity and super-OPE on the celestial sphere, respectively.

People are in close vicinity to one another when in closed spaces like shops, restaurants, classrooms, etc. There is also a cause for worry in workplaces regarding the safety of the workplace. This paper discusses about two models which can be used to detect the distance between people to ensure social distancing and to detect if people are wearing a mask which can be implemented to follow safety measures. To implement these models deep learning techniques are used. For the social distancing model object detection is done to detect humans and this is done through the YOLOv3. For the mask detection model, the MobileNetV2 is the algorithm which is used for classification. This is used to detect if the people are wearing a mask. These two models can be used for the purpose of prevention against widely spreading diseases. For example, if the people of an organization have to request their customers to stay 6 feet apart or wear a mask in cases where the customers are not following the standard safety protocols, the people of the organization should go directly up to them and request for it. This increases the contact between people and at the same time increases the risk factor for the people working in that organization. When these models are implemented, it reduces unnecessary human contact while also ensuring to alert the customers if they break these protocols. © 2021 IEEE.","Rakhsith, L. A.; Karthik, B.

In this paper, four Jump-GARCH models are used to forecast the jump diffusion volatility, which is used as the risk factor. The linear and asymmetric nonlinear effects are considered, and the value at risk of banks is estimated by support vector quantile regression. There are three main findings. First, in terms of the volatility process of bank stock price, the Jump Diffusion GARCH model is better than the Continuous Diffusion GARCH model, and the discrete jump volatility is significant. Secondly, due to the difference of the sensitivity of abnormal information shock, the jump behavior of bank stock price is heterogeneous. Moreover, CJ-GARCH models are suitable for most banks, while ARJI-R2-GARCH models are more suitable for small and medium sized banks.

Recently, however, evidence has accumulated that points toward a nontrivial relation between the CDR and distal sites on the antibody structure: variations in the binding strengths have been observed upon mutating amino acids separated from the paratope by several nanometers, thus suggesting the existence of a communication network within antibodies whose extension and relevance might be deeper than insofar expected. In this work, we test this hypothesis by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the IgG4 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab, an approved drug that targets the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The molecule is simulated in both the apo and holo states, totalling 4μs of MD trajectory. The analysis of these simulations shows that the bound antibody explores a restricted range of conformations with respect to the apo one, and that the global conformation of the molecule correlates with that of the CDR; a pivotal role in this relationship is played by the relatively short hinge, which mechanically couples Fab and Fc domains. These results support the hypothesis that pembrolizumab behaves as a complex machinery, with a multi-scale hierarchy of global and local conformational changes that communicate with one another. The analysis pipeline developed in this work is general, and it can help shed further light on the mechanistic aspects of antibody function. Synopsis Antigen binding restricts the conformational variability of the therapeutic antibody pembrolizumab in an interplay between the paratope and hinge region, mediated by a full-scale interaction network.

Here we show that the conserved poly-U specific endoribonuclease ENDU-2 is secreted from the soma and taken-up by the germline to ensure germline immortality at elevated temperature in C. elegans. ENDU-2 binds to mature mRNAs and negatively regulates mRNA abundance both in the soma and the germline. While ENDU-2 promotes RNA decay in the soma directly via its endoribonuclease activity, ENDU-2 prevents misexpression of soma-specific genes in the germline and preserves germline immortality independent of its RNA-cleavage activity. In summary, our results suggest that the secreted RNase ENDU-2 transmits environmental information across tissue boundaries and contributes to maintenance of stem cell immortality probably via retaining a stem cell specific program of gene expression.","Qi, Wenjing; Gromoff, Erika D v.; Xu, Fan; Zhao, Qian; Yang, Wei; Pfeifer, Dietmar; Maier, Wolfgang; Long, Lijiang; Baumeister, Ralf",bioRxiv,681,16

The current model depicts that the T6SS spear-like Hcp tube is powered by the contraction of an outer sheath to drill through the envelope of a neighboring cell, achieving cytosol to cytosol delivery. However, gram-positive bacteria seem to be impenetrable to such T6SS action. Here we report that a plant pathogen Acidovorax citrulli (AC) deploys a highly potent T6SS to kill a range of bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis as well as fungal species including Candida albicans and Pichia pastoris. Using bioinformatic and biochemical assays, we identified a group of T6SS effectors and characterized one effector RhsB that is critical for interspecies interaction. We report that RhsB contains a conserved YD-repeat domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain. Toxicity of RhsB was neutralized by its downstream immunity proteins through direct interaction. RhsB was cleaved at the C-terminal end and a catalytic mutation within the internal aspartic protease abolished such cleavage. Collectively, the T6SS of AC displays potent activities to penetrate the cell envelope barriers of gram-positive and fungal species, highlighting the greatly expanded capabilities of T6SS in modulating microbiome compositions in complex environments.","Pei, Tong-Tong; Kan, Yumin; Wang, Zeng-Hang; Tang, Ming-Xuan; Li, Hao; Yan, Shuangquan; Cui, Yang; Zheng, Hao-Yu; Luo, Han; Dong, Tao G.",bioRxiv,681,1

This contrasts with the preceding epidemics of the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which evolved adaptively. It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a unique or adaptive feature which deviates from other coronaviruses. Alternatively, the virus may have been cryptically circulating in humans for a sufficient time to have acquired adaptive changes for efficient transmission before the onset of the current pandemic. In order to test the above scenarios, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from minks (Neovision vision) and parenteral human strains. In the early phase of the mink epidemic (April to May 2020), nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratios per site within the spike protein was 2.93, indicating a selection process favoring adaptive amino acid changes. In addition, mutations within this protein concentrated within its receptor binding domain and receptor binding motif. Positive selection also left a trace on linked neutral variation. An excess of high frequency derived variants produced by genetic hitchhiking was found during middle (June to July 2020) and early late (August to September 2020) phases of the mink epidemic, but quickly diminished in October and November 2020. Strong positive selection found in SARS-CoV-2 from minks implies that the virus may be not unique in super-adapting to a wide range of new hosts. The mink study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 already went through adaptive evolution in humans, and likely been circulating in humans at least six months before the first case found in Wuhan, China. We also discuss circumstances under which the virus can be well-adapted to its host but fail to induce an outbreak.","Tai, Jui-Hung; Chaw, Shu-Miaw; Sun, Hsiao-Yu; Tseng, Yi-Cheng; Li, Guanghao; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Chen, Pei-Jer; Wang, Hurng-Yi",bioRxiv,681,1

People with higher levels of well-being are more resilient after stressful life events or trauma and vice versa. Less is known about the underlying sources of overlap and causality between the constructs. In a sample of 11.304 twins and 2.572 siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register, we investigated the overlap and possible direction of causation between resilience (i.e. the absence of psychiatric symptoms despite negative life events) and well-being (i.e. satisfaction with life) using polygenic score (PGS) prediction, twin-sibling modelling, and the Mendelian Randomization Direction of Causality (MR-DoC) model. Longitudinal twin-sibling models showed significant phenotypic correlations between resilience and well-being (.41/.51 at time 1 and 2). Well-being PGS were predictive for both well-being and resilience, indicating that genetic factors influencing well-being also predict resilience. Twin-sibling modeling confirmed this genetic correlation (.71) and showed a strong environmental correlation (.93). In line with causality, both genetic (51%) and environmental (49%) factors contributed significantly to the covariance between resilience and well-being. Furthermore, the results of within-subject and MZ twin differences analyses were in line with bidirectional causality. Additionally, we used the MR-DoC model combining both molecular and twin data to test causality, while correcting for pleiotropy. We confirmed the causal effect from well-being to resilience, with the direct effect of well-being explaining 11% (T1) and 20% (T2) of the variance in resilience. Data limitations prevented us to test the directional effect from resilience to well-being with the MR-DoC model. To conclude, we showed a strong relation between well-being and resilience. A first attempt to quantify the direction of this relationship points towards a bidirectional causal effect. If replicated, the potential mutual effects can have implications for interventions to lower psychopathology vulnerability, as resilience and well-being are both negatively related to psychopathology.","de Vries, L.P.; Baselmans, B.M.L.; Luykx, J.J.; de Zeeuw, E.L.; Minică, C.; de Geus, E.J.C.; Vinkers, C.H.; Bartels, M.",bioRxiv,681,20

Consequently, novel and more efficacious agents are urgently needed. We have developed a bispecific antibody, 2022, consisting of two antibodies, 2F8 and VHH18. 2F8 was isolated from our proprietary fully synthetic human IDEAL (Intelligently Designed and Engineered Antibody Library)-VH/VL library and VHH18 is a single domain antibody isolated from IDEAL-nanobody library. 2022 was constructed by attaching VHH18 to the C-terminal of Fc of 2F8. 2022 binds two non-overlapping epitopes simultaneously on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocks the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 2022 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and all of the variants tested in both pseudovirus and live virus assays, including variants carrying mutations known to resist neutralizing antibodies approved under EUA and that reduce the protection efficiency of current effective vaccines. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2022 is 270 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, and 1 pM, for wild-type, alpha, beta, and delta pseudovirus, respectively. In the live virus assay, 2022 has an IC50 of 26.4 pM, 13.3 pM, and 88.6 pM, for wild-type, beta, and delta live virus, respectively. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, 2022 showed strong prophylactic and therapeutic effects. A single administration of 2022 intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) 24 hours before virus challenge completely protected all mice from bodyweight loss, as compared with up to 20% loss of bodyweight in placebo treated mice. In addition, the lung viral titers were undetectable (FRNT assay) in all mice treated with 2022 either prophylactically or therapeutically, as compared with around 1×105 pfu/g lung tissue in placebo treated mice.

However, this group of proteins are generally considered undruggable as they lack an enzymatic catalytic site or a ligand binding pocket. PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology has been developed by engineering a bifunctional small molecule chimera to bring a protein of interest (POI) to the proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus inducing the ubiquitination of POI and further degradation through proteasome pathway. Here we report the development of Oligonucleotide-based PROTAC (O’PROTACs), a class of noncanonical PROTACs in which a TF-recognizing double-stranded oligonucleotide is incorporated as a binding moiety of POI. We demonstrate that O’PROTACs of ERG and LEF1, two highly cancer-related transcription factors selectively promote degradation of these proteins and inhibit their transcriptional activity in cancer cells. The programmable nature of O’PROTACs indicates that this approach is applicable to destruct other TFs. O’PROTACs not only can serve as a research tool, but also can be harnessed as a therapeutic arsenal to target DNA binding proteins for effective treatment of diseases such as cancer.","Shao, Jingwei; Yan, Yuqian; Ding, Donglin; Wang, Dejie; He, Yundong; Pan, Yunqian; Yan, Wei; Kharbanda, Anupreet; Li, Hong-yu; Huang, Haojie",bioRxiv,681,28

One of these is remdesivir, which was originally repurposed from its use against Ebola and functions by causing early RNA chain termination. We used this as justification to evaluate three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg. Out of these we previously identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. Herein, the in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 µM) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC50 of 2.4 µM). We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PLpro inhibition.

We aimed to create a pipeline that manages the complex temporality of real-life data using a data-driven strategy (i.e., without any hypothesis on the potential side effects to search for) to highlight the safety profile of a given drug. We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and its co-prescription in a real-life database to illustrate this pipeline. Methods: We incorporated a weighted cumulative exposure statistical model into a data-driven strategy. This pipeline makes it possible to highlight both long-term and short-term side effects, while avoiding false positives due to the natural course of the underlying disease. We applied the proposed pipeline to a cohort of 2,010 patients with a prescription of HCQ and used their drug prescription as the source of data to highlight the HCQ safety profile. Results: The proposed pipeline introduces a bootstrap strategy into weighted cumulative-exposure statistics estimates to highlight significant drug signals. As applied to HCQ, the proposed pipeline showed nine drugs to be significantly associated with HCQ exposure. Of note, one of them has therapeutic indications for known HCQ side effects. Other associations could be explained by therapeutic indications linked to conditions associated with HCQ indications in France. Conclusion: We propose a data-driven pipeline that makes it possible to provide a broad picture of the side effects of a given drug.

Results showed that NPKM and NPKF treatments significantly increased the average yields of maize (7.9 and 6.4%, respectively) and wheat (15.7 and 12.9%, respectively) relative to NPK treatment. The highest sustainable yield index value of maize and wheat was observed in NPKF treatment. The long-term application of fungal residue (NPKF) significantly increased soil organic C and available P contents, relative to NPK、NPKS and NPKG treatments, and soil organic C content increased from 6.95 to 9.12 ± 1.06 g kg−1 and available P content from 6.87 to 12.26 ± 2.23 mg kg−1. Relative to NPK treatment, NPKF treatment significantly enhanced soil microbial biomasses (C, N, and P) and soil C-, N- and P-cycling enzyme activities but significantly decreased soil pH. The soil enzyme index following NPKF treatment was significantly higher relative to other treatments and was 208.6% higher than NPK treatment. Additionally, relative to NPK treatment, NPKF treatment altered soil microbial community structure, and significantly increased the rate of G+/G− and cy19/18:1ω7c. Soil microbial biomasses N, Nitrate N, and available P were the main factors regulating the change of microbial community in purple soil. We, therefore, conclude that NPKF treatment is an effective fertilization strategy for improving purple soil quality and crop yields. • NPKM and NPKF treatments significantly increased average yields of wheat and maize. • NPKF treatment significantly increased soil organic C and available P contents. • NPKF treatment significantly enhanced soil C-, N- and P-cycling enzyme activities and microbial biomasses. • NPKF treatment altered soil microbial community, and significantly increased the rate of G+/G− and cy19/18:1ω7c.

During the peak of COVID-19 pandemic crisis in the New York city, our outpatient oncology infusion center, located within a public teaching hospital in the South Bronx remained active. We implemented twice daily team huddle, staff and patient education, and infection screening tools and modified treatment plans based on social, personal and disease related factors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the above strategies in timely delivery of critical oncological care. Methods: Patients treated from the March 1, 2020 to the May 8, 2020 were included. De-identified data from medical charts were analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 27.0. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with COVID-19. Results: In total, 170 patients were treated in 576 visits. Median age was 60.7 years, 44% Hispanic and 41% Black, median Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) was 6.6. Fifty percent received cytotoxic chemotherapy, 44% targeted therapies and the remaining received immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Of the 170 patients, six developed severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Their median age was 63 years with average of 10.5 days from infusion center visit to COVID-19 and median CCI score was 9, higher than the rest of the cohort. Two patients died, 3 made complete recovery, 1 enrolled in hospice. Two patients contracted mild COVID-19 managed in the outpatient setting. Diabetes mellitus was associated with severe COVID-19 [OR: 25.9 (95%CI: 1.3-519, p=0.03)]. Age, gender, type of cancer and oncological treatment, smoking, CCI, growth factor support, nursing home residence, statin use were not associated with risk of developing severe COVID-19 Conclusions: Cancer treatment in the outpatient setting using an approach focused on careful patient selection, infection prevention strategies and strong team communication is feasible and allows for continuity of critical oncological care. Receipt of cancer directed therapy was not associated with higher risk for infection compared to risks associated with communitybased transmission. In communities with high community-based transmission, careful selection of patients for oncological based treatment is paramount.","Pathak, S.; Narurkar, R.; Khan, M. H.; Jiang, B.; Soe, M. N.

The second purpose of the study was to identify the connections between the experience of God's silence and depressive mood disorders and the impact of God's silence on other spiritual experiences. The study was conducted online on a group of 771 people, mostly Christians. The experience of God's silence was declared by 82.1% of the respondents. This experience does not depend on the sex of the respondents, but correlates with their age. The experience of God's silence is commensurate with the joy that comes from having a relationship with God through daily spiritual experiences. Additionally, the conducted research shows that experience of God's silence resembles a state rather than a permanent feature with a visible ending, which is associated with a change in the image of God. The consequences of experiencing God's silence need not to be negative. The conducted research shows that the most frequently mentioned effect of this experience is the strengthening and consolidation of faith.

Another significant predictors of compliance with restrictive measures are explaining the reasons for the spread of coronavirus by lack of responsibility of people and violation of quarantine measures (positive predictor), as well as downplaying the risk of the disease (negative predictor).ConclusionsCluster analysis identified two most common motivational profiles: unmotivated and motivated.Unmotivated people are less willing to comply with Covid-19 preventive measures. Unmotivated people trust various sources of information less often, use unproductive coping strategies (denial), and are more likely to believe that the coronavirus is used to hide the presence of other problems in the society and to increase the control over citizens by the state.","Kiseleva, M.",European Psychiatry,681,1

Hong Kong’s experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 helped to prepare the health system for a pandemic, allowing it to avoid a complete lockdown of the city. Social-distancing measures, aggressive testing, and contact tracing have also been critical in controlling the local transmission of the disease. However, when historians and health policy researchers look back at the early days of the outbreak, they are likely to cite the impact of the five-day strike of healthcare professionals in February 2020 as a critical turning point in Hong Kong’s initially hesitant response. The chapter then focuses on this strike and the role of the healthcare profession in shaping public health policy. It argues that the striking healthcare professionals used their standing in Hong Kong to revive the city’s collective memory of the SARS outbreak, mobilizing public action, and possibly triggering a stronger public health intervention by the government. © the several contributors 2021.","Ho, C.

Current methods of establishing viral aetiology, assessing response to therapy and clinical monitoring rest on tissue biopsy, clinical examination and post-treatment imaging. However, tissue biopsy is invasive and carries significant risk of morbidity, and post-treatment scans are frequently indeterminate. Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the circulation provides a minimally invasive method for detecting and monitoring cancer-derived DNA fragments, with the potential for enhancing clinical care. Through the longitudinal collection of 166 blood samples in 67 OPSCC patients we evaluate the utility of three cfDNA analysis methods: droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and fragment size analysis in both HPV+ve and HPV-ve disease, and ultra-deep sequencing in patients with HPV-ve disease. We show that ddPCR analysis of cfDNA for five HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33 & 35) is strongly concordant with existing clinical assays (p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative PCR analysis of solid tumour tissue) and that cfDNA fragment size was reduced in OPSCC patients compared to healthy controls. Sequential ddPCR measurements of cfDNA HPV copy number showed a decrease to undetectable levels in all 30 HPV+ve patients in at least one of their post-treatment samples and a corresponding increase in cfDNA fragment size in patients who had a complete response to chemoradiotherapy. In two HPV+ve patients, clinical decision-making based on HPV ddPCR of cfDNA may have led to earlier detection of relapse in one patient or avoided surgical exploration in a second patient, which led to resection of tissue that did not harbour malignancy. In HPV-ve disease, ultra-deep sequencing identified tumour-derived somatic mutations of circulating cfDNA in genes such as TP53 and members of the ERBB family that are potential markers of therapeutic responsiveness and patient prognosis. Together our data suggest that analysis of circulating cfDNA can enhance current clinical strategies for assessing therapeutic response and disease monitoring in both HPV+ve and HPV-ve OPSCC.","Thomson, J.

This study of bilingual public health campaign posters during the COVID-19 pandemic focuses on how the evolution of neologisms and linguistic strategies in public health campaigns adapts to different societal contexts. A baseline meaning of the re-purposed linguistic expressions was established according to the BNC corpus for English and the Chinese Gigaword Corpus for Chinese. To establish the link between linguistic expressions and public health events, we converted them to eventive structures using the Module-Attribute Representation of Verbs and added interpersonal meaning interpretations based on Systemic Functional Linguistics. The two cities are found to have taken divergent approaches. Guangzhou prefers “contact prevention” with behavior-inhibiting imperatives and high value modality. Conversely, the original use of “contact prevention” in Hong Kong was gradually replaced by the neologism social distancing in English, triggering competing loan translations in Chinese. In Hong Kong, behavior-encouraging expressions are predominantly used with positive polarity and varying modality and mood devices, which fluctuate to track the epidemic curve of COVID-19. We conclude that lexical evolution interacts with social realities. Different speech acts, prohibition in Guangzhou but advice and warning in Hong Kong, are constructed with a careful bilingual reconfiguration of eventive information, mood, modality, and polarity to tactfully address the social dynamics in the two cities. © The Author(s) 2021.","Wang, X.; Huang, C.

Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates act by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in bone-resorbing osteoclasts but, surprisingly, also appear to reduce the risk of death from pneumonia. We overturn the long-held belief that these drugs act only in the skeleton and show that a fluorescently-labelled bisphosphonate is internalised by alveolar macrophages and peritoneal macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, a single dose of a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in mice was sufficient to inhibit the mevalonate pathway in tissue-resident macrophages, causing the build-up of a mevalonate metabolite and preventing protein prenylation. Importantly, one dose of bisphosphonate enhanced the immune response to bacterial endotoxin in the lung and increased the level of cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar fluid. These studies suggest that bisphosphonates, as well as preventing bone loss, may boost immune responses to infection in the lung and provide a mechanistic basis to fully examine the potential of bisphosphonates to help combat respiratory infections that cause pneumonia.","Munoz, Marcia A.; Fletcher, Emma K.; Skinner, Oliver P.; Jurczyluk, Julie; Kristianto, Esther; Hodson, Mark P.; Sun, Shuting; Ebetino, Frank H.; Croucher, David R.; Hansbro, Philip M.; Center, Jacqueline R.; Rogers, Michael J.",bioRxiv,681,5

To curb its spread, it is hence of vital importance to detect those who have been in contact with the virus for a sustained period of time, the so-called close contacts. Most of the existing digital approaches for contact tracing focus only on direct face-to-face contacts. There has been little work on detecting indirect environmental contact, which is to detect people coming into a contaminated area with the live virus, i.e., an area last visited by an infected person within the virus lifespan. In this work, we study automatic IoT contact tracing when the virus has a lifespan which may depend on the disinfection frequency at a location. Leveraging the ubiquity of WiFi signals, we propose vContact, a novel, private, pervasive and fully distributed WiFi-based IoT contact tracing approach. Users carrying an IoT device (phone, wearable, dongle, etc.) continuously scan WiFi access points (APs) and store their hashed IDs. Given a confirmed case, the signals are then uploaded to a server for other users to match in their local IoT devices for virus exposure notification. vContact is not based on device pairing, and no information of other users is stored locally. The confirmed case does not need to have the device for it to work properly. As WiFi data are sampled sporadically and asynchronously, vContact uses novel and effective signal processing approaches and a similarity metric to align and match signals at any time. We conduct extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate vContact performance. Our results demonstrate that vContact is effective and accurate for contact detection. The precision, recall and F1-score of contact detection are high (up to 90%) for close contact proximity (2m). Its performance is robust against AP numbers, AP changes and phone heterogeneity. Having implemented vContact as an Android SDK and installed it on phones and smart watches, we present a case study to demonstrate the validity and implementability of our design in notifying its users about their exposure to the virus with a specific lifespan.

Accordingly, increasing the content of polyphenols in peanuts makes possible to produce useful substances that are harmless to the human body as well as the environment. Therefore, I conducted research to find an effective way to increase the content of polyphenols. This study projects an effective way to secure peanuts with high polyphenol content based on the characteristics that the content of polyphenols increases when plants are wounded. Comparative studies were conducted through wounding, and it was confirmed that the polyphenol content increased in the wounded plants. Subsequently, it was confirmed that the content of polyphenol increased through the DPPH experiment, and the content of flavonoids also increased. Using the data of this study can be used to produce peanuts with high polyphenol content. To find an effective method for cultivating peanuts containing high concentration of phenolic compounds, I compared two groups of plants with different conditions. First group was consisted of normal plants with no treatment and second group was consisted of wounded plants. I treated by using these conditions in each group for two days and the results showed that group 2 has high concentration of flavonoid and phenolic compounds. To verify this result, I conducted DPPH assay which provides convincing evidence that group 2 has justifiable anti-inflammatory effects. However, due to the difference of the effects in group 1 and 2 was not that standing out, successively added silver ion to observe synergic effect of anti-inflammatory substances. Combined phenolic compound and silver ion showed dramatic effects in nitric oxide (NO) assay for increasing anti-inflammatory effects compared to other examined groups.","Jung, Yeonjo",bioRxiv,681,16

E-learning refers to the use of information technology to disseminate knowledge for education and training. With today's e-learning boom necessitated for the most part by COVID-19, its adoption has become increasingly mandatory. Thus, a systematic review should help focus and accelerate future research. This study systematically reviews, compiles, analyzes, and synthesizes the D&M model studies in the e-learning context. This review adopts automatic and manual search methods to collect related studies from 2010 to 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 92 primary studies are identified. The findings show that most of reviewed studies were conducted in the education field. The success category was the most highly investigated area from among the selected studies. Most studies developed a hybrid/extended model. Additionally, this study also identified gaps in the literature and recommends seven potential future areas requiring further investigation, such as conducting studies to examine the net benefits at the organizational level of analysis. To that end, the findings of this systematic review study provide an impactful contribution through offering a holistic review of the current state of D&M model studies in an e-learning context, providing an essential reference for scholars in this field.","Sabeh, H.

This is facilitated through analysis of the adequacy of climate- and pandemic-related risk reporting in three industries that are both significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are at risk from climate change. The pervasiveness of pandemic and climate-change risks have been highlighted in 2020, the hottest year on record and the year the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Stakeholders might reasonably expect reporting on these risks to have prepared them for the consequences. Design/methodology/approach The current debate on the ""complexity"" of sustainability and NFR frameworks/standards is critically analysed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and calls to ""build back better"". Context is provided through analysis of risk reporting by the ten largest airlines and the five largest companies in each of the hotel and cruise industries. Findings Risk reporting on two significant issues, pandemics and climate change, is woefully inadequate. While very little consideration has been given to pandemic risks, disclosures on climate-related risks focus predominantly on ""risks"" of increased regulation rather than physical risks, indicating a short-term focus. The disclosures are dispersed across different corporate reporting media and fail to appreciate the long-term consequences or offer solutions. Mindful that a conceptual framework for NFR must address this, the authors propose a new definition of materiality and recommend that sustainable development risks and opportunities be placed at the core of a future framework for connected/integrated reporting. Research limitations/implications For sustainable development risks to be perceived as ""real"" by managers, further research is needed to determine the nature and extent of key sustainable development risks and the most effective mitigation strategies. Social implications This paper highlights the importance of recognising the complexity of the issues facing organisations, society and the planet and addressing them by encouraging robust consideration of the interdependencies in evolving approaches to corporate reporting. Originality/value This study contributes to the current debate on the future of corporate reporting in light of two significant interconnected crises that threaten business and society - the pandemic and climate change. It provides evidence to support a long-term oriented and holistic approach to risk management and reporting.","Abhayawansa, S.; Adams, C.",Meditari Accountancy Research,681,0

Initial reports from the early weeks of lockdown in the UK and worldwide suggested that uptake could fall putting children at risk from multiple other infectious diseases. In Scotland and England, enhanced surveillance of national data for childhood immunisations was established to inform and rapidly assess the impact of the pandemic on infant and preschool immunisation uptake rates. Methods and findings We undertook an observational study using routinely collected data for the year prior to the pandemic (2019), and immediately before, during and after the first period of the UK lockdown in 2020. Data were obtained for Scotland from the Public Health Scotland COVID19 wider impacts on the health care system dashboard (https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/) and for England from ImmForm. Five vaccinations delivered at different ages were evaluated; three doses of the 6-in-1 DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine and two doses of MMR. Uptake in the periods in 2020 compared to that in the baseline year of 2019 using binary logistic regression analysis. For Scotland, we analysed timely uptake of immunisations, defined as uptake within four weeks of the child becoming eligible by age for each immunisation and data were also analysed by geographical region and indices of deprivation. For both Scotland and England, we assessed whether immunisations were up to date at approximately 6 months (all doses 6-in-1) and 16-18 months (first MMR) of age. We found that uptake rates within four weeks of eligibility in Scotland for all the five vaccine visits were higher during the 2020 lockdown period than in 2019. The difference ranged from 1.3% for the first dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine (95.3 vs 94%, OR 1.28, CI 1.18-1.39) to 14.3% for the second MMR dose (66.1 vs 51.8 %, OR 1.8, CI 1.74-1.87). Significant increases in uptake were seen across all deprivation levels, though, for MMR, there was evidence of greater improvement for children living in the least deprived areas. In England, fewer children who had been due to receive their immunisations during the lockdown period were up to date at 6 months (6-in-1) or 18 months (first dose MMR). The fall in percentage uptake ranged from 0.5% for first 6-in1 (95.8 vs 96.3%, OR 0.89, CI 0.86-0.91) to 2.1% for third 6-in-1 (86.6 vs 88.7%, OR 0.82, CI 0.81-0.83). Conclusions This study suggests that the national lockdown in Scotland was associated with a positive effect on timely childhood immunisation uptake, however in England a lower percentage of children were up to date at 6 and 18 months. Reason for the improve uptake in Scotland may include active measures taken to promote immunisation at local and national level during this period. Promoting immunisation uptake and addressing potential vaccine hesitancy is particularly important given the ongoing pandemic and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","McQuaid, F.; Mulholland, R.; Rai, Y.

This PACU area serves 10 OR/Endoscopy rooms. The daily census average is 26 patients with a range of acuity. The traditional model was to recover patients in Phase I and Phase II in the same area. The back log of cases from the COVID pandemic presented a challenge where we were seeing an increase in the daily census. Historically we have had challenges when the daily surgical patient census was more than 35 patients. Our multiple rapid, high turnover cases along with a lack of space in PACU, caused delays and a decrease in number of cases performed each day and dissatisfaction among surgeons, staff, and families. Goal was to increase efficiency by freeing up space in the PACU department, create Phase II recovery with cross-trained Acute Care Nurses, maintain a revenue stream, and improve physician, staff, patient and family satisfaction. Utilizing ASPAN's Practice Recommendation and American Society of Anesthesiologists Standards for Post-anesthesia Care, we developed criteria that identified patients who met criteria for transfer to Phase II supported by the Aldrete Scoring System. Through collaboration with nursing leaders, we cross-trained Acute Care nurses to Phase II. Leadership identified hours of Phase II operation, which patients we would send to Phase II, and developed a plan to support the Phase II staff. Department leadership reviewed the schedule one week in advance to determine the most appropriate days for Phase II. Successfully able to accommodate more ENT patients on a daily basis, increase efficiency, prevent delays related to PACU saturation. Using resources from multiple areas, AORN/ASPAN, perianesthesia nursing can increase productivity with this practice, by identifying patients that are appropriate to transfer to Phase II. Patient families can be with children earlier. It will decrease the RN's divided attention with a mix of patients and supports the mission of nursing as life-long learners, and improved PACU RN's efficiency with appropriately assessing the Aldrete scoring system.","Valentine, Team Leaders Kimberly Mercier Molly Schroeder Team Members Sarah Johnson Karen",Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing,681,1

During such process, in which the stacking of layers occurs, the complex thermal activity of metal deposition affects the part geometry, microstructure, physical and mechanical properties. The correlation between deposition path, bead stepover, and the direct effect on the part density, microstructure and geometry distortions are yet to be found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of deposition paths and bead stepover on the final part geometry form, microhardness and density. In order to do so, four deposition paths (linear, zigzag, chessboard and contour) and beads stepover of 0.44 mm and 0.55 mm were performed on the production of Stainless Steel 316L cubes by a 5-axis laser based DED BeAM Machine Magic800 with laser spot size of 0.80 mm. The paths shown considerable influence on the variation of both final part geometry and density. Contour (spiral-like) was the path, which produced workpieces with finer form and finishing, with density and microhardness closer to the conventional AISI 316L material. The bead stepover was also found to influence the surface finishing, as larger critical valleys between adjacent beads were noticed when using the higher stepover value.","Ribeiro, Kandice S.B.; Mariani, Fábio E.; Coelho, Reginaldo T.",Procedia Manufacturing,681,7

The present study was undertaken to get better insights into the extent of secondary bacterial and fungal infections in Indian hospitalized patients and to assess how these alter the course of COVID19 so that the control measures can be suggested. Methods: This is a retrospective multicentre study where data of all RTPCR positive COVID19 patients was accessed from Electronic Health Records (EHR) of a network of 10 hospitals across 5 North Indian states admitted during the period from March 2020 to July 2021.The data included demographic profile of patients, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters treatment modalities and outcome in those with secondary infections (SIs) and those without SIs. Spectrum of SIS was also studied in detail. Results: Of 19852 RTPCR positive SARSCO2 patients admitted during the study period, 1940 (9.8%) patients developed SIs. Patients with SIs were 8 years older on average (median age 62.6 years versus 54.3 years P<0.001) than those without SIs. The risk of SIs was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with age, severity of disease at admission, diabetes, ICU admission, and ventilator use. The most common site of infection was urinary tract infection (UTI) (41.7%), followed by blood stream infection (BSI) (30.8%), sputum/BAL/ET fluid (24.8%), and the least was pus/wound discharge (2.6%). As many as 13.4% had infections with more than organism and 34.1% patients had positive cultures from more than one site. Gram negative bacilli (GNB) were the commonest organisms (63.2%), followed by Gram positive cocci (GPC) (19.6%) and fungus (17.3%). Most of the patients with SIs were on multiple antimicrobials the most commonly used were the BL BLI for GNBs (76.9%) followed by carbapenems (57.7%), cephalosporins (53.9%) and antibiotics carbapenem resistant entreobacteriace (47.1%). The usage of emperical antibiotics for GPCs was in 58.9% and of antifungals in 56.9% of cases, and substantially more than the results obtained by culture. The average stay in hospital for patients with SIs was twice than those without SIs (median 13 days versus 7 days). The overall mortality in the group with SIs (40.3%) was more than 8 times of that in those without SIs (4.6%). Only 1.2% of SI patients with mild COVID 19 at presentation died, while 17.5% of those with moderate disease and 58.5% of those with severe COVID 19 died (P< 0.001). The mortality was highest in those with BSI (49.8%), closely followed by those with HAP (47.9%), and then UTI and SSTI (29.4% each). The mortality rate where only one microorganism was identified was 37.8% and rose to 56.3% in those with more than one microorganism. The mortality in cases with only one site of infection was 28.8%, which steeply rose to 62.5% in cases with multiple sites of infection. The mortality in diabetic patients with SIs was 45.2% while in non-diabetics it was 34.3% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Secondary bacterial and fungal infections can complicate the course of almost 10% of COVID19 hospitalised patients. These patients tend to not only have a much longer stay in hospital, but also a higher requirement for oxygen and ICU care. The mortality in this group rises steeply by as much as 8 times. The group most vulnerable to this complication are those with more severe COVID19 illness, elderly, and diabetic patients. Varying results in different studies suggest that a region or country specific guideline be developed for appropriate use of antibiotics and antifungals to prevent their overuse in such cases. Judicious empiric use of combination antimicrobials in this set of vulnerable COVID19 patients can save lives.","Budhiraja, S.; TARAI, B.; JAIN, D.; AGGARWAL, M.; INDRAYAN, A.; DAS, P.; MISHRA, R.

COVID-19 surveillance in the Philippines relies on clinical monitoring and contact tracing, with both having limited use in early detection or prediction of community outbreaks. Complementary public health surveillance methods that can provide community-level infection data faster and using lesser resources must be explored. Objectives: This study piloted and assessed WBE and WGS as approaches for COVID-19 surveillance in low-resource and low-sanitation communities in Davao City, Philippines. Methods: Weekly wastewater samples were collected from six barangay community sewer pipes or creeks from November to December 2020. Samples were concentrated using a PEG-NaCl precipitation method and analyzed by RT-PCR to detect the SARS-CoV-2 N, RdRP, and E genes. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive samples were subjected to WGS for genomic mutation surveillance. Public data from clinical surveillance were also reviewed to interpret WBE data. Results: Twenty-two of the 24 samples (91.7%) obtained from the six barangays tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were correlated with RNA concentration and attack rate. Thirty-two SARS-CoV-2 mutations were detected in WGS, including novel non-synonymous mutations or indels in seven SARS-CoV-2 genes and ten mutations previously reported in the Philippines. Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in community wastewater from the six barangays of Davao City, even when the barangays were classified as having a low risk of COVID-19 transmission and no new cases were reported. Despite the fragmented genome sequences analyzed, our genomic surveillance in wastewater confirmed the presence of previously reported mutations while identifying mutations not yet registered in clinical surveillance. The local context of a community must be considered when planning to adopt WBE and WGS as complementary COVID-19 surveillance methodologies, especially in low-sanitation and low-resource settings.

MEG’s spatial resolution critically depends on the approach used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem in order to transform sensor signals into cortical activation maps. Over recent years non-globally optimized solutions based on the use of adaptive beamformers (BF) gained popularity. When operating in the environment with a small number of uncorrelated sources the BFs perform optimally and yield spatial super-resolution. However, the BFs are known to fail when dealing with correlated sources acting like poorly tuned spatial filters with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output timeseries and often meaningless cortical maps of power distribution. This fact poses a serious limitation on the broader use of this promising technique especially since fundamental mechanisms of brain functioning, its inherent symmetry and task-based experimental paradigms result into a great deal of correlation in the activity of cortical sources. To cope with this problem, we developed a novel beamformer approach that preserves high spatial resolution in the environments with correlated sources. At the core of our method is a projection operation applied to the vectorized sensor-space covariance matrix. This projection does not remove the activity of the correlated sources from the sensor-space covariance matrix but rather selectively handles their contributions to the covariance matrix and creates a sufficiently accurate approximation of an ideal data covariance that could hypothetically be observed should these sources be uncorrelated. Since the projection operation is reciprocal to the PSIICOS method developed by us earlier (Ossadtchi et al. (2018)) we refer to the family of algorithms presented here as ReciPSIICOS. We asses the performance of the novel approach using realistically simulated MEG data and show its superior performance in comparison to the well established MNE and classical BF approaches. We have also applied our approach to the MEG datasets from the two experiments involving two different auditory tasks. The analysis of experimental MEG datasets showed that beamformers from ReciPSIICOS family, but not MNE and the classical BF, discovered the expected bilateral focal sources in the primary auditory cortex and detected motor cortex activity associated with the audio-motor task. Moreover, ReciPSIICOS beamformers yielded cortical activity estimates with amplitude an order of magnitude higher than that obtained with the classical BF, which indicates the severeness of the signal cancellation problem when applying classical beamformers to MEG signals generated by synchronous sources.","Kuznetsova, Aleksandra; Nurislamova, Yulia; Ossadtchi, Alexei",bioRxiv,681,13

Since the established techniques of chopping and nodding need to be modified for observations with the future mid-infrared ELT imager and spectrograph (METIS), we investigate the sources of thermal background subtraction residuals. Our aim is to either remove or at least minimise the need for nodding in order to increase the observing efficiency for METIS. To this end we need to improve our knowledge about the origin of chop residuals and devise observing methods to remove them most efficiently, i.e. with the slowest possible nodding frequency. Thanks to dedicated observations with VLT/VISIR and GranTeCan/CanariCam, we have successfully traced the origin of three kinds of chopping residuals to (1) the entrance window, (2) the spiders and (3) other warm emitters in the pupil, in particular the VLT M3 mirror cell in its parking position. We conclude that, in order to keep chopping residuals stable over a long time (and therefore allow for slower nodding cycles), the pupil illumination needs to be kept constant, i.e. (imaging) observations should be performed in pupil-stabilised, rather than field-stabilised mode, with image de-rotation in the post-processing pipeline.

Embecovirus particles are studded with two types of surface projections called S (for spike) and HE (for haemagglutinin-esterase), with S mediating receptor-binding and membrane fusion and HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Together, they promote dynamic virion attachment to glycan-based receptors with 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as main constituent. We recently showed that adaptation of HKU1 and OC43 to replication in the human respiratory tract involved loss-of-function mutations in the lectin domain of HE.

Studies have shown the requirement of host cellular proteases for priming the surface spike protein during viral entry and transmission in coronaviruses. The metzincin family of metal-dependent endopeptidases called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is involved in virus encephalitis, enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability, or cell-to-cell fusion upon viral infection. Here we show the role of MMPs as mediators of virus-induced host neuroinflammatory response in the MHV model. Infection of mice with wild-type MHV-A59 or its isogenic recombinant strains, RSA59 or RSMHV2 significantly upregulated MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-14 transcript levels. Functional network assessment with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed a direct involvement of these MMPs in disrupting junctional assembly between endothelial cells via interaction with junctional adhesion molecules and thereby facilitating transmigration of peripheral lymphocytes. Our findings also suggest mRNA upregulation of Park7, which is involved in NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, following RSA59 infection. RSA59 infection resulted in elevated mRNA levels of RelA, a subunit of NF-κB. Infection with MHV-A59 is known to generate ROS, and oxidative stress can activate NF-κB. Thus, our findings indicate the existence of a possible nexus between ROS, NF-κB, and MMPs in RSA59-induced neuroinflammation. We also assessed the expression of endogenously produced regulators of MMP activities. Elevated mRNA and protein levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) in MHV-A59 infection are suggestive of a TIMP-1 mediated host antiviral response. Importance The newly emergent coronavirus has brought the world to a near standstill. In the past, studies have focused on the function of host proteases in virus attachment and entry. Our research indicates the involvement of a group of metal-dependent host proteases in inflammation associated with coronavirus infection. Inflammation is the first response of the host to virus infection. While it helps in restricting the spread and clearance of viral particles, uncontrolled inflammation results in several inflammatory consequences. Therefore, it becomes vital to limit unchecked host immune response.

Global crises are opportunities for macro resets of policy settings that might deliver lower crime and better justice. Justice Reinvestment is important, but far from enough, as investment beyond the levels of capital sunk into criminal justice is required to establish a just society. Neoliberal policies have produced steep declines in public and social housing stock. This matters because many rehabilitation programmes only work when clients have secure housing. Getting housing policies right is also fundamental because we know the combined effect on crime of being truly disadvantaged, and living in a deeply disadvantaged neighbourhood, is not additive, but multiplicative. A Treaty with First Nations Australians is unlikely to return the stolen land on which white mansions stand. Are there other options for Treaty negotiations? Excellence and generosity in social housing policies might open some paths to partial healing for genocide and ecocide.","Braithwaite, J.",Journal of Criminology,681,16

However, it remains unclear if longevity-enhancing factors modulate immunity and longevity by distinct or shared mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans pro-longevity factor, NHR-49, also promotes resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but modulates immunity and longevity by spatially and mechanistically distinct mechanisms. Fenofibrate, an agonist of NHR-49’s mammalian functional homolog, PPARα, enhanced worm immunoresistance in an NHR-49-dependent manner. NHR-49 expression is increased by germline ablation, an intervention that extends lifespan, but lowered by pathogen exposure. NHR-49 acted in multiple somatic tissues to promote longevity, whereas, it’s pro-immunity function was mediated by neuronal expression. The canonical NHR-49 target genes, acs-2 and fmo-2, were upregulated by germline loss, but infection triggered fmo-2 downregulation and acs-2 upregulation. Interestingly, neither gene conferred resistance against Gram-negative Pseudomonas, unlike their reported roles in immunity against Gram-positive pathogens. Thus, NHR-49 is differentially regulated by interventions that bring about long-term changes (lifespan extension) vs. short-term stress (pathogen exposure) and in response it orchestrates distinct outputs, including pathogen-specific transcriptional programs. Overall, our study demonstrates the independent control of immunity and longevity by a conserved regulatory protein.","Naim, Nikki; Amrit, Francis RG; Ratnappan, Ramesh; DelBuono, Nicholas; Loose, Julia A; Ghazi, Arjumand",bioRxiv,681,11

Positive development has been achieved since the last decade by the collective effort of scientists. In this regard, renewable energy sources (RES) are being deployed in the power system to meet the energy demand. The microgrid concept (AC, DC) is introduced, in which distributed energy resources (DERs), the energy storage system (ESS) and loads are interconnected. DC microgrids are appreciated due to their high efficiency and reliability performance. Despite its significant growth, the DC microgrid is still relatively novel in terms of grid architecture and control systems. In this context, an energy management system (EMS) is essential for the optimal use of DERs in secure, reliable, and intelligent ways. Therefore, this paper strives to shed light on DC microgrid architecture, control structure, and EMS. With an extensive literature survey on EMSs’ role, different methods and strategies related to microgrid energy management are covered in this article.

Among the exercises affected by this change is the way to record student participation and collaboration through web addresses, rather than the usual way of being in a similar classroom while talking. Global Positioning System (GPS) is a global satellite path frame that provides area and time synchronization. This methodology can help teachers monitor their students' attitudes throughout the learning meeting. GPS activity is based on the triangulation technique where the area is determined by estimating the distance to the satellites. Accordingly, iHadir was recommended to overcome the issue of pursuing student participation. iHadir is a versatile application framework that can find the student's area during a learning meeting.

We determined the prevalence and stability of nucleocapsid antibodies - the standard assay for detection of prior infection - in staff and residents from 201 LTCFs. Methods Prospective cohort study of residents aged >65 years and staff of LTCFs in England (11 June 2020-7 May 2021). Serial blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Prevalence and cumulative incidence of antibody-positivity were weighted to the LTCF population. Cumulative incidence of sero-reversion was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves. Results 9488 samples were included, 8636 (91%) of which could be individually-linked to 1434 residents or 3288 staff members. The cumulative incidence of nucleocapsid seropositivity was 35% (95% CI: 30-40%) in residents and 26% (95% CI: 23-30%) in staff over 11 months. The incidence rate of loss of antibodies (sero-reversion) was 2.1 per 1000 person-days at risk, and median time to reversion was around 8 months. Interpretation At least one-quarter of staff and one-third of surviving residents were infected during the first two pandemic waves. Nucleocapsid-specific antibodies often become undetectable within the first year following infection which is likely to lead to marked underestimation of the true proportion of those with prior infection. Since natural infection may act to boost vaccine responses, better assays to identify natural infection should be developed.

However, the impact of such coinfections on immune responses remains poorly understood. Here we reveal that systemic infection results in an inflammation-induced suppression of local immunity. During localized infection or vaccination in barrier tissues including the skin or respiratory tract, concurrent systemic infection induced a type I interferon-dependent lymphopenia that impairs lymphocyte recruitment to the draining lymph node (dLN). This leads to suppressed lymphoid stromal cell expansion and dLN remodeling and impaired induction of B cell responses and antibody production.

To fabricate robust and reproducible immunosensors with high sensitivity, the covalent immobilization of immunoglobulins (IgGs) in a site-specific manner contributes to better performance. Instead of the random IgG orientations result from the direct yet non-selective immobilization techniques, this review for the first time introduces the advances of stepwise yet site-selective conjugation strategies to give better biosensing efficiency. Noncovalently adsorbing IgGs is the first but decisive step to interact specifically with the Fc fragment, then following covalent conjugate can fix this uniform and antigens-favorable orientation irreversibly. In this review, we first categorized this stepwise strategy into two parts based on the different noncovalent interactions, respectively introducing adhesive layer-mediated interaction onto homofunctional support and layer-free interaction onto heterofunctional support (which displays several different functionalities on its surface that are capable to interact with IgGs). Further, the influence of ligands characteristics (synthesis strategies, spacer requirements and matrices selection) on the heterofunctional support has also been discussed. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives for the real-world application of stepwise covalent conjugation are discussed. This review provides more insights into the fabrication of high-efficiency immunosensor, and special attention has been devoted to the well-orientation of full-length IgGs onto the sensing platform.","Gao, Shipeng Guisán José M.; Rocha-Martin, Javier",Analytica Chimica Acta,681,1

Here we show that, during activation with an exogenous pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), dendritic cells (DCs) epigenetically remodel heterochromatin at TEs by depleting the methyltransferase Suv39h1 and reducing histone-3 lysine-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). TLR4 signaling activates TE expression to enhance innate responses through the DNA sensor cGAS. Cytosolic cGAS-bound DNA comprised LINE1 TEs as the predominant endogenous ligands. Concordantly, LINE1 inhibition attenuated the type-I IFN response to LPS and rescued influenza virus infection. We propose that in healthy cells, exogenous PAMPs epigenetically activate self-derived PAMPs (LINE1) that engage cGAS to enhance responses. These data explain why pathogens employ redundant and broad innate immune countermeasures, to suppress activation of host PAMPs and illustrate a hitherto unappreciated role for host genome-derived PAMPs in response to pathogens.","Rookhuizen, Derek C.; Bonte, Pierre-Emmanuel; Ye, Mengliang; Hoyler, Thomas; Gentili, Matteo; Burgdorf, Nina; Durand, Sylvère; Aprahamian, Fanny; Kroemer, Guido; Manel, Nicolas; Waterfall, Joshua J; Milne, Richard; Goudot, Christel; Towers, Greg J.; Amigorena, Sebastian",bioRxiv,681,10

Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.

Influenza-like illness (ILI), a disease caused by respiratory pathogens including but not exclusively by influenza virus, is a major health concern in this population. However, there is little information on changes in the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota of older adults associated with respiratory infections identified by/ reported as ILI, as well as its dynamics during recovery. Here, we compared the NP microbiota in older adults who presented with ILI (n= 240) to the NP microbiota in older adults not reporting an ILI event (n= 157) during the 2014-2015 influenza season. To investigate the dynamics of the microbiota from the acute phase to the recovery phase of the infection, participants reporting an ILI event were sampled at onset of infection (<72 hours), at 14 days and at 7-9 weeks after infection (recovery sample). Results Cross-sectional analysis of the microbiota at the different time-points showed no differences in alpha diversity between the groups. A small but significant effect of the ILI was observed on the microbiota community and structure when compared to controls and recovery samples. Furthermore, the NP microbiota exhibited inter-individual differences in dynamics from onset of ILI to recovery. Corynebacterium, one of the keystone species in the upper respiratory tract, was negatively associated with ILI and its abundance increased after recovery. Potential pathobionts such as Haemophilus, Porphyromonas and Gemella had higher abundances during acute-ILI. Stability and changes in the NP microbial community showed individual dynamics. Key core genera, Corynebacterium, Moraxella and Dolosigranulum exhibited higher inter-individual variability in acute-ILI, but showed comparable variability to controls after recovery. Participants in the ILI group with higher core microbiota abundances at the acute phase showed higher microbiota stability after recovery. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that acute-ILI is associated with small but significant alterations in the phylogenetic structure of the NP microbiota in older adults. The observed variation in the core microbiota suggests potential imbalances in the ecosystem, which could play a role in the recovery of the NP microbiota after an ILI event.","Shetty, Sudarshan A.; van Beek, Josine; Bijvank, Elske; Groot, James; Kuiling, Sjoerd; Bosch, Thijs; van Baarle, Debbie; Fuentes, Susana",bioRxiv,681,13

The objective pursued herein is to equip students with the appropriate tools and strategies required to empirically determine the parameters of the rate law including reaction orders, rate constant (k), frequency factor (A), and activation energy (Ea). Typical results of the proposed protocol are shown and discussed in the framework of the bleaching reaction of food dye allura red (RD40) and hypochlorite, as a representative example. A graphical approach of the concentration vs time data measured under the experimental condition where [RD40] ≪ [ClO–] (isolation method) suggests a first-order kinetics with respect to the dye. In addition, the analysis of the pseudo-first-order constant (kobs) shows a first-order relationship with respect to ClO–. In addition, using the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation, values of 3.22 × 107 s/M and 44.55 kJ/mol were obtained for A and Ea, respectively. Interestingly, all the kinetic parameters (reaction orders, k, A, and Ea) are on the same order of magnitude as those previously reported in the literature and acquired with more sophisticated and accurate equipment. This experience provides evidence that it is possible to proceed with remote experimental activities to deepen the collection and analysis of kinetic data during a pandemic.","Madriz, Lorean Cabrerizo Franco M.; Vargas, Ronald",Journal of Chemical Education,681,1

This paper starts with the premise that the use of urban forests and green spaces - where and for who they were available and accessible - increased, when social restrictions were most stringent. It takes an explorative approach to examine changes in attitude towards urban forests and urban green spaces in terms of attraction (i.e., as the actual use behaviour), intended use (i.e., intention of going to green spaces), and civic engagement in relation to green spaces. In particular, it analyses the responses to a survey of 1987 respondents in Belgium and statistically examines the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics, urbanisation characteristics, actual and intended green space use, and changes in attitudes towards green spaces and civic engagement. The findings show that highly educated citizens experienced an increase in actual and intended use of green spaces during the pandemic, but that this increase differs among sociodemographic profiles such as impact of age or access to private green, and depends on their local built environment characteristics. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has strongly impacted citizens’ attitudes, as well as (intended) behaviour and civil engagement with respect to the green spaces in their area. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","da Schio, N.; Phillips, A.; Fransen, K.; Wolff, M.; Haase, D.; Ostoić, S.

However, the higher airflow region is generally limited to the zone below the fan. The non-uniform distribution of airflow is also affected by the furniture layout and airflow from window openings. This study attempts to evaluate the effect of the different window-opening patterns on the airflow inside naturally ventilated bedrooms, having a ceiling fan for air movement with numerical simulations and on-site measurements. The airflow pattern created by a ceiling fan in a room with furniture is modelled and simulated with ANSYS Fluent 2019 R3. The results were validated with on-site measurements and compared with the literature. The air velocity was measured in bedrooms of three different sizes. It was observed that the opening of windows created a better distribution of air irrespective of room size. The non-uniformity of the air velocity is reduced from 76% to 39% with the opening of windows in the larger-sized room. The reduction in non-uniformity is influenced by the location of windows also. The practice of opening windows along with the induced air movement by ceiling fans results in a better distribution of air in the space.Practical application: People tend to depend mainly on ceiling fans even if windows are open in naturally ventilated rooms. A study of patterns of non-uniform distribution of airflow can help designers to improve comfort conditions by specifying the number and location of fans and windows while designing room furniture layout.

The program targets high school students from underrepresented backgrounds in AI and gives them a chance to learn about AI with a focus on biomedicine. In 2020, the UCSF AI4ALL three-week program was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus students participated virtually to gain experience with AI, interact with diverse role models in AI, and learn about advancing health through AI. Specifically, they attended lectures in coding and AI, received an in-depth research experience through hands-on projects exploring COVID-19, and engaged in mentoring and personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were women and from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds.

While most epigenetic studies have been performed in severely ill COVID-19 patients, studies on individuals who have recovered from mild-to-moderate disease remain scarce. The aim of this study was to assess epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in COVID-19 convalescents compared to uninfected controls from before and after the pandemic outbreak began. Methods: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells originating from uninfected controls before (Pre20, n=5) and after (Con, n=18) 2020, COVID-19 convalescents (CC19, n=14) and symptom-free individuals with a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response (SFT, n=6), as well as from Pre20 (n=4) samples stimulated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, epigenome-wide DNA methylation analyses were performed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K array, and statistical and bioinformatic analyses comprised differential DNA methylation, pathway over-representation and module identification network analyses. Results: DNA methylation patterns of COVID-19 convalescents were altered as compared to uninfected controls, with similar results observed in in vitro stimulations of PBMC with SARS-CoV-2. Differentially methylated genes from the in vivo comparison constituted the foundation for the identification of a possibly SARS-CoV-2-induced module, containing 66 genes of which six could also be identified in corresponding analyses of the in vitro data (TP53, INS, HSPA4, SP1, ESR1 and FAS). Pathway over-representation analyses revealed involvement of Wnt, cadherin and apoptosis signalling pathways amongst others. Furthermore, numerous interactions were found between the obtained differentially methylated genes from both settings and the network analyses when overlaying the data unto the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Conclusions: Epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns of individuals that have recovered from mild-to-moderate COVID-19 are different from those of non-infected controls. The observed alterations during both in vivo and in vitro exposure to SARS-CoV-2 showed involvement in interactions and pathways that are highly relevant to COVID-19. The present study provides indications that DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic mechanisms that is altered upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies on the mechanistic underpinnings should determine whether the observed effects are reflecting host-protective antiviral defence or targeted viral hijacking to evade host defence.","Huoman, J.; Sayyab, S.; Apostolou, E.; Karlsson, L.; Porcile, L.; Rizwan, M.; Sharma, S.; Das, J.; Rosen, A.; Lerm, M.",,681,16

In addition to the logistical difficulties of effectively conserving wide-ranging marine species, shark conservation is believed to have been hindered in the past by public perceptions of sharks as dangerous to humans. Shark Week is a high-profile, international programming event that has potentially enormous influence on public perceptions of sharks, shark research, shark researchers, and shark conservation. However, Shark Week has received regular criticism for poor factual accuracy, fearmongering, bias, and inaccurate representations of science and scientists. This research analyzes the content and titles of Shark Week episodes across its entire 32 years of programming to determine if there are trends in species covered, research techniques featured, expert identity, conservation messaging, type of programming, and portrayal of sharks. We analyzed titles from 272 episodes (100%) of Shark Week programming and the content of all available (201; 73.9%) episodes. Our data demonstrate that the majority of episodes are not focused on shark bites, although such shows are common and many Shark Week programs frame sharks around fear, risk, and adrenaline. While anecdotal descriptions of disproportionate attention to particular charismatic species (e.g. great whites, bull sharks, and tiger sharks) are accurate and supported by data, 79 shark species have been featured briefly at least once. Shark Week’s depictions of research and of scientists are biased towards a small set of (typically visual and expensive) research methodologies and (mostly white, mostly male) scientists, including presentation of many white male non-scientists as experts. While sharks are more often portrayed negatively than positively, limited conservation messaging does appear in 53% of episodes analyzed. Results suggest that as a whole, while Shark Week is likely contributing to the collective perception of sharks as monsters, even relatively small alterations to programming decisions could substantially improve the presentation of sharks and shark science and conservation issues.","Whitenack, Lisa B.; Mickley, Brady L.; Saltzman, Julia; Kajiura, Stephen M.; Macdonald, Catherine C.; Shiffman, David S.",bioRxiv,681,16

Drawing on interviews across three UK cities, this article attends to the changing household routines of individuals living in different types of small home, exploring daily life before and during ‘lockdown’. Using the concept of urban rhythms, the data show that the lockdown has intensified existing pressures of living in a smaller home – lack of space for different functions and household members – whilst constraining coping strategies, like spending time outside the home. Lockdown restrictions governing mobility and contact acted as a mechanism of exception, disrupting habitual patterns of life and sociability, and forcing people to spend more time in smaller homes that struggled to accommodate different functions, affecting home atmospheres. For some, the loss of normal strategies was so significant that they sought to challenge the new rules governing daily life to protect their wellbeing.

Several factors impact the development of this disease. This study aimed to determine the relationship between some risk factors in the development of COVID-19 among community dwellers of >= 50 years of age. This cross-sectional study was performed at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences from April 1, 2019, to June 20, 2020. Methods & Materials This cross-sectional study was conducted on individuals aged >= 50 years, including middle-aged and aging suspected of COVID-19 referring to registration centers in Shahroud University of Medical Sciences from Feb. 20th to Jun. 20th, 2020. The basis for diagnosing COVID-19 in suspected cases was a positive Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test based on a nasopharyngeal swab or Computed Tomography (CT) scan. The data used included demographic information, a history of smoking, and comorbidities. Data analysis was performed in SPSS by descriptive statistis, Chi-squared test, Independent Samples t-test, and logistic regression model. Results In the first 4 months of the COVID-19 outbreak, 3945 suspicious cases were referred to Shahroud healthcare centers. After removing the missing cases, of the 3119 registered cases, 1348 participants were aged >= 50 years. Of all eligible participants, 602 cases were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 303 were males. The obtained data suggested that the Mean +/- SD age of the study subjects was 66.62 +/- 11.33 years. Diabetes (P=0.014) and other comorbidities, such as asthma, acute respiratory, hepatic and kidney diseases, and cancer in borderline significantly increased the incidence of COVID-19 by 38% and 32%, respectively. An increase of one unit in Body Mass Index (BMI) (P=0.002) enhanced the odds of infection by 4%. Conclusion Based on the multivariate logistic regression results, high BMI and diabetes were significant risk factors in the development of COVID-19 among aged subjects. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of BMI and diabetes in the assessment of patients in middle-aged and aging groups.","Dadgari, A.; Mirrezaei, S. M.; Talebi, S. S.; Gheshlaghi, Y.

The omnipresence of smart Internet-of-things (IoT) devices can play a predominant role in designing advanced techniques helping in minimizing the risk of contamination. In this paper, we propose a practical framework that uses the Social IoT (SIoT) concept to improve pedestrians safely navigate through a real-wold map of a smart city. The objective is to mitigate the risks of exposure to the virus in high-dense areas where social distancing might not be well-practiced. The proposed routing approach recommends pedestrians' route in a real-time manner while considering other devices' mobility. First, the IoT devices are clustered into communities according to two SIoT relations that consider the devices' locations and the friendship levels among their owners. Accordingly, the city map roads are assigned weights representing their safety levels. Afterward, a navigation algorithm, namely the Dijkstra algorithm, is applied to recommend the safest route to follow. Simulation results applied on a real-world IoT data set have shown the ability of the proposed approach in achieving trade-offs between both safest and shortest paths according to the pedestrian preference.","Khanfor, A.; Friji, H.; Ghazzai, H.; Massoud, Y.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Global Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things,681,16

Legislative issues, and the concerns related to the quality of care and patient safety, have kept TP from broader adoption. COVID19 pandemic seems to be a turning point for TP as well as for the eMH in general. The use of TP has exploded as many regulatory barriers to its use have been temporarily lowered during the COVID-19 pandemic. What has to be done to sustain this momentum?Objectives-outline temporary changes in TP regulations made due to COVID19;-discuss which of these should be maintained, modified, or reversed;-suggest additional initiatives needed to facilitate patient and professional use of digital technology.MethodsExamination of the use of digital technology in the light of regulatory, legislative, and other changes and initiatives made due to COVID 19.ResultsAmong several policy changes, the most important is e.g. removal of the “originating site” rule so professionals can be paid for a remote appointment wherever the patient is, including in the patient’s home. Further, professionals were allowed to serve patients through everyday communication technologies such as FaceTime, WhatsApp, Viber, or Skype, all compromising patient/data safety.ConclusionsEPA is perfectly positioned to be the frontrunner for the required initiatives i.e. mandatory lectures related to eMH at medical educational institutions, launching of TP-competency training of mental health professionals, regulatory and statutory changes e.g. unified licensure regulations, etc that are crucial for modernizing mental health care delivery and preparation for future unprecedented events.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Mucic, D.",European Psychiatry,681,1

Methods: Following approval by our hospital audit committee, details of all patients who received GA for CS were extracted from our IT system for 3 x 6-month rotation periods in 2009, 2019 and 2020. A retrospective chart review was carried out and each trainee present at the GA CS was recorded. Results: In the three 6-month rotations, a total of 41 trainees were assessed. [Formula presented] Discussion: Despite a 50% increase in the number of trainees in our department since 2009, we have seen no difference in the mean number of GA CS that each trainee is exposed to. This can partially be accounted for by the significant increase in the number of CS performed (P&lt;0.0001) while there was no significant difference in the proportion of GA CS (P = 0.782). There was one trainee in 2020 who did not meet the minimum standard. Interestingly, there was an increase in the number of GA CS during the period covering the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We were concerned that trainees during this period may not have received adequate exposure to GA CS as some maternity units in the UK showed a significant decrease in their rates of GA CS during this time.3 These numbers require ongoing review to ensure that trainees meet minimum volumes of practice during their obstetric anaesthesia rotation.","Haugh, C.; Kelly, D.; O039,; Gorman, L.; ffrench-O039,; Carroll, R.; Smith, S.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,681,16

Since student age is a period of active formation of the inner need of a person to correlate his own aspirations with the interests of society, it is sensitive for the assimilation of social experience, socially significant activities, and the formation of an active creative personality. Higher education in the context of COVID-19 faces an important task - to ensure the education of ""vital and socially competent person who can make independent choices and make responsible decisions in various life situations"" the formation of their own motives and interests. It is important how much the student as a subject of socialization, independent in the information space, what is the level of his social competence, how quickly he chooses the field of activity in which he can achieve high professionalism. The article deals with the problem of socialization of student youth in modern conditions of a higher educational institution, associated with the processes of development and education of the individual.

Physical activity is however a critical measure in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating, disease driven by small vessel vascular remodeling, leading to right heart failure. Exercise capacity relates to clinical outcomes and exercise training improves key indicators of cardiopulmonary function. Here, we describe the temporal effects of UK government restriction measures on daily activity, heart rate and quality-of-life (QoL) in patients with PAH. Methods From November 2019 to March 2020 patients were enrolled into the arrhythmia sub-study of The UK National Cohort Study of Idiopathic and Heritable PAH (REC:13/EE/ 0203) and implanted with insertable cardiac monitors. Daily heart rate, heart rate variability and activity were transmitted remotely. Standard questionnaires were administered remotely to assess QoL (EmPHasis-10), anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). Results Median age of the 26 patients implanted with insertable cardiac monitors was 49 years, 23(88%) were female and 5(19%) had heritable PAH with mutations in BMPR2. At enrolment 10(38.5%) patients were low risk (&lt;5% 1-year mortality), 10(38.5%) were intermediate risk (5-10%) and 6 (23%) were high risk (&gt;10%). The mean duration from insertion to census date was 21.1weeks±5.7. No complications were reported. Completeness of remote monitoring data was 100%. Following lockdown, mean activity was reduced (3.16vrs 2.68hours, -0.48 hours, 95%CI -0.27-0.69, 16%, p&lt;0.0001). During the period April 14th to 23rd QoL was reduced (26(18-38)vrs 32 (17-47), p&lt;0.01) and anxiety (1(0- 9)vrs 10 (5-18), p&lt;0.001) and depression scores increased (3 (1-16)vrs 11 (3-17), p&lt;0.001) compared to pre-lockdown levels. The observed increase in depression scores persisted to the census date (3(1-16)vrs 11(8-17), p&lt;0.01). No change in day or night heart rate, or heart rate variability, was observed and no patients developed COVID-19. Conclusion In this cohort of patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH, UK protective health measures were effective in preventing COVID-19 in patients thought to be vulnerable. However, these protective measures resulted in reduced daily activity and QoL and were associated increased anxiety and depression indicators. Patients may decondition through periods of reduced activity. This may have implications for riskassessment and endpoint adjudication in clinical studies, both of which use measures of exercise capacity.","Middleton, J.; Zafar, H.; Reddy, A.; Martin, C.; Thompson, R.; Swift, A.; Toshner, M.; Kiely, D.

Earlier demand and access barriers have seemingly been addressed with more free and accessible vaccines now available for a wide variety of ages. While rates of COVID-19 have decreased overall, some geographic areas continue to experience rapid outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between vaccination uptake and weekly COVID-19 cases throughout locations in the state of Missouri. Methods Among all Missouri counties and two cities (n=117), weekly COVID-19 incidence and cumulative proportion of residents fully vaccinated were abstracted from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services during a 25-week period from January 4 to Jun 26, 2021. Additional ecological variables known to be associated with COVID-19 incidence and prevalence were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and integrated into data: total population, proportion of nonwhite residents, annual median household income, proportion of residents working in public facing occupations. Descriptive and inferential statistics were completed which included the calculation of both linear and nonlinear models using repeated measure data to determine the quantitative association between vaccination uptake and reported COVID-19 cases in the presence of location characteristics. Results Throughout the 25 weeks of observations, the average weekly number of COVID-19 cases reported was 66.1 (SD=260.8) while the average cumulative proportion vaccinated individuals at the end of the 25 weeks was 25.8% (SD=6.8%) among study locations. While graphing seemed to suggest a more nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 incidence and proportion vaccinated, comparison of crude linear and nonlinear models pointed to the relationship likely being linear during study period. The final adjusted linear model exhibited a significant relationship between COVID-19 cases and proportion vaccinated, specifically every percent increase in population vaccinated resulted in 3 less weekly COVID-19 cases being reported ({beta} -3.74, p<0.001. Additionally, when controlling for other factors, the adjusted model revealed locations with higher proportions of nonwhite residents were likely to experience less weekly COVID-19 cases ({beta} -1.48, p=0.037). Discussion Overall, this study determined that increasing the proportion of residents vaccinated decreases COIVD-19 cases by a substantial amount over time. These findings provide insights into possible messaging strategies that can be leveraged to develop more effective implementation and uptake. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists and vaccination numbers begin to plateau, diverse communication strategies become a critical necessity to reach a wider population.","Shacham, E.; Scroggins, S.; Garza, A.",,681,1

New Teaching and Learning (T&L) online norms have been executed except for specific academic programs and subjects only since 18 March 2020 when the Movement Control Order (MCO) was administered and continued to this day. To guarantee students' continuity of education without online T&L dropout, online face-to-face (Synchronous) or not face-to-face (Asynchronous) is now become the primary approach and method platform with many virtual education applications. Therefore, this research examined students' readiness to follow online teaching and learning and analysed the impact of online T&L on the national education agenda. This study involved 133 students of Diploma in Fisheries, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, for the first semester of 2020-21. Data were obtained through a questionnaire using Google Form and presented to students by sharing links to their WhatsApp group in the final week of study. The questionnaire was adapted from several instruments related to various aspects of online T&L during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcomes revealed that most students were among Gen-Z with digital literacy background. Thus, it was assisting them having a high level of readiness to face online T&L. In terms of the availability of device infrastructure, internet access, e-Learning, and computers, most (80%) have mastered it. Only (20%) have low proficiency due to limited experience using computers and gadgets due to family constraints and their literacy levels. The research conclusion recommends a consecutive enhancement in curriculum structure flexibility, delivery, evaluation;internet accessibility and digital gap, and self-motivation of students entering the era of the self-regulated learner.

Although how carbon emission will change the world after the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, it is urgent to learn from the past and avert or slow down the potential rebound effect. Therefore, this study aims to identify key drivers of carbon intensity changes of 55 sectors, applying the decomposition techniques and the world input-output data. Our results demonstrate that global carbon intensity fluctuates drastically when shocked by the global financial crisis, presenting an inversed-V shape for the period 2008-2011. Industrial carbon emission and gross output vary among different industries, the growth rate of industrial carbon intensity varies from -55.55% to 23.77%. The energy intensity effect and economic structure effect have opposite impacts on carbon intensity decrease, accelerating and hindering the decreasing carbon intensity, respectively. However, the energy mix effect has a minor impact on carbon intensity decrease. The industrial carbon intensity decomposition results show the impact of technological and structural factors are significantly different among industries. Moreover, the impact of energy intensity is slightly stronger than the energy mix. More measures targeting avoiding the rebound in carbon intensity should be developed.

Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based cationic pathogen-like particles (PLPs) loaded with TLR agonists mimic biophysical properties of microbes and hence, simulate pathogen-pattern recognition receptor interactions to safely and effectively stimulate innate immune responses. We generated micro particle PLPs loaded with TLR4 (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, GLA) or TLR9 (CpG) agonists, and formulated them with and without a mucosal delivery enhancing carbomer-based nanoemulsion adjuvant (ADJ). These adjuvants delivered intranasally to mice elicited high numbers of influenza nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD8+/ CD4+ effector and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) in lungs and airways. PLPs delivering TLR4 versus TLR9 agonists drove phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of effector and memory T cells. While PLPs loaded with CpG or GLA provided immunity, combining the adjuvanticity of PLP-GLA and ADJ synergistically enhanced the development of airway and lung TRMs and protective immunity to pathogenic influenza A virus. Further, balanced CD8 (Tc1/Tc17) and CD4 (Th1/Th17) recall responses were linked to effective influenza virus control in the lungs. These studies provide mechanistic insights into vaccine-induced T cell immunity in the respiratory tract and pave the way for the development of a universal influenza vaccine.","Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Toy, Randall; Lee, Woojong; Pradhan, Pallab; Vogel, Gabriela; Marinaik, Chandranaik; Larsen, Autumn; Kawaoka, Yoshihoro; Roy, Krishnendu; Suresh, M",bioRxiv,681,1

This article uses anonymous mobile phone data to study the impact of the Spanish lockdown on the daily dynamics of the Madrid metropolitan area (Spain). The analysis has been carried out for a reference week prior to the lockdown and during several weeks of the lockdown in which different restrictions were in place. During these weeks, population distribution is compared during the day and at night and presence profiles are obtained throughout the day for each type of land use. In addition, a spatial multiple regression analysis is carried out to determine the impact of the different land uses on the local population. The results in the reference week, pre-COVID-19, show how the population in activity areas increases in each time slot on a specific day and how in residential areas it decreases. However, during the lockdown, activity areas cease to attract population during the day and the residential areas therefore no longer show a decrease. Only basic essential commercial activities, or others that require the presence of workers (industrial or logistics) maintain some activity during lockdown.","Romanillos, Gustavo García-Palomares Juan Carlos Moya-Gomez Borja Gutiérrez Javier Torres Javier López Mario Cantú-Ros Oliva G.; Herranz, Ricardo",Applied Geography,681,16

However, biological datasets frequently involve multiple classes related by a hierarchy, and each class can contain multiple labels, which cannot be predicted by the commonly used decision tree algorithm as classes used to define one higher hierarchical level would not appear again in the lower one. In this paper, a novel sequential decision tree (SDT) algorithm for hierarchical multi-label classification is proposed, and the SDT application to COVID-19 is examined. Comparing to the existing algorithms, SDT has good interpretability to be used on the population-demographic-COVID-19 (PDC) dataset. The goal of research is to compute the similarity of countries under the influence of COVID-19 using PDC as an input dataset. The hypothesis is made that the most similar countries predicted from the PDC dataset, which is defined by the DT leaves branched from the same end node, also have similar COVID-19 evolutions.

As the role of γδ T cells in early, active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is well documented, we focused on elucidating the γδ T cell response in persistent or controlled Mtb infection. Systems analysis of circulating γδ T cells from a South African adolescent cohort identified a distinct population of CD8+ γδ T cells that expanded in this state. These cells had features indicative of persistent antigenic exposure but were robust cytolytic effectors and cytokine/chemokine producers. While these γδ T cells displayed an attenuated response to TCR-mediated stimulation, they expressed Natural Killer (NK) cell receptors and had robust CD16 (FcγRIIIA)-mediated cytotoxic response, suggesting alternative ways for γδ T cells to control this stage of the infection. Despite this NK- like functionality, the CD8+ γδ T cells consisted of highly expanded clones, which utilized TCRs with different Vγ/δ pairs. Theses TCRs could respond to an Mtb-lysate, but not to phosphoantigens, which are components of Mtb-lysate that activate γδ T cells in acute Mtb infection, indicating that the CD8+ γδ T cells were induced in a stage-specific, antigen-driven manner. Indeed, trajectory analysis showed that these γδ T cells arose from naive cells that had traversed distinct differentiation paths in this infection stage. Importantly, increased levels of CD8+ γδ T cells were also found in other chronic inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, suggesting that persistent antigenic exposure may lead to similar γδ T cell responses.","Chowdhury, Roshni Roy; Valainis, John R.; Kask, Oliver; Ohanyan, Mane; Sun, Meng; Huang, Huang; Dubey, Megha; von Boehmer, Lotta; Sola, Elsa; Huang, Xianxi; Nguyen, Patricia K.; Scriba, Thomas J.; Davis, Mark M.; Bendall, Sean C.; Chien, Yueh-hsiu",bioRxiv,681,1

As we move into the era of vaccines, the detection of neutralising antibody will become increasingly important. Many serological tests have been developed under emergency use authorization, but their reliability remains unclear. MethodsWe evaluated the performance of six commercially-available Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), including a surrogate virus neutralization test, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), total or neutralising antibodies and a subset of results were compared to microneutralisation. ResultsFor sera collected > 14 days post-symptom onset the Wantai total Ab performed best with highest sensitivity 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) followed by 93.1% for Euroimmun NCP-IgG,93.1% for GenScript Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test, 90.3% for Euroimmun S1-IgG, 88.9% for Euroimmun S1-IgA and 83.3% for Wantai IgM. Specificity for the best performing assay was 99.5% and for the lowest 97.1%. ConclusionWantai ELISA, detecting total immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, had the best performance. Antibody target, timing and longevity of the immune response, and the objectives of testing should be considered in test choice. ELISAs should be used within a confirmatory testing algorithm to ensure reliable results. ELISAs provide high quality results, with flexibility for test numbers without the need for manufacturer specific analyzers.","Nicholson, Suellen R; Karapanagiotidis, Theo; Khvorov, Arseniy; Douros, Celia; Mordant, Francesca; Bond, Katherine; Williamson, Deborah A; Purcell, Damian Francis John; Lewin, Sharon; Sullivan, Sheena; Subbarao, Kanta; Catton, Mike",,681,16

As conferences of any type aim at networking and knowledge exchange, cancellation or postponement of such events harm a collaboration among possible conference participants. An online format of conferences is not a new sensation but due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions this becomes an emerging trend and must-have element in academia. Thus, in this paper best practices and success factors on online conferences development will be considered, based on which an agile framework of conference transformation will be proposed. The framework was further tested on two conferences organized by a German Higher Education Institution and a Chapter of the IEEE Society, and validated through surveys. Currently this framework is continuously used by the authors. Based on a positive feedback from last conferences, the framework could be further adopted by conference organisers, who may lack experience and resources in online events organisation. © 2021 IEEE.","Mikhridinova, N.; Badasian, A.; Aldaghamin, A.; Wolff, C.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Information Systems and Technologies, SIST 2021",681,17

In this study, we systemically evaluated the analgesic efficacy of intraperitoneal and incisional ropivacaine injected at the end of the LC. A total of 160 patients, scheduled for elective LC, were allocated into four groups. Group Sham received intraperitoneal and incisional normal saline (NS). Group IC received incisional ropivacaine and intraperitoneal NS. Group IP received incisional NS and intraperitoneal ropivacaine. Group ICP received intraperitoneal and incisional ropivacaine. At the end of the surgery, ropivacaine was injected into the surgical bed through the right subcostal port and infiltrated at the four ports. Dynamic pain by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and cumulative morphine consumption at 2 h, 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively, as well as incidence of side-effects over 48 h after LC was recorded. Compared with those in group Sham, the time of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, dynamic VAS score (VAS-D) 2 h and 6 h postoperatively, cumulative morphine consumption 6 h and 24 h postoperatively, and incidence of nausea and vomiting 48 h after LC in group IC and ICP were less (P<0.05). Furthermore, intraperitoneal and incisional ropivacaine exerts more powerful analgesic effect than single usage with intraperitoneal or incisional ropivacaine (P<0.05). No patients exhibited signs of local anesthetic toxicity. In conclusion, intraperitoneal and incisional ropivacaine might facilitate PACU transfer and effectively and safely reduce pain intensity after LC.","Liu, Dan-Shu; Guan, Feng; Wang, Bin; Zhang, Tian",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,681,9

Since then, the country has witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients confirmed with the disease. As of April 27th 2021, a total of 164,756 confirmed COVID-19 cases were notified making it the fifth-highest number of cases in the African region. This study aims to determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in Nigeria, identify clusters and determine factors associated with COVID-19. METHODS The study used secondary data of COVID-19 cases notified in each of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory between 27th February and 9th June, 2020. The Global and Local Moran'sItest were used to identify significant spatial clusters. The negative binomial regression model was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 and p d"" 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS The Local Moran I identified Lagos State as the significant cluster for COVID-19 in Nigeria at p<0.05. Higher GDP per capita and lower literacy rates were significantly associated with COVID-19 cases reported by the states while population density, BCG coverage and average temperature were not significantly associated. CONCLUSION The study identified Lagos State as the hotspot for the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The states with lower literacy rate and higher GDP per capita reported a higher number of COVID-19 cases. Proactive measures are needed to control of the infection in Lagos state while improving the literacy about the disease transmission and control measures.","Daniel, O J; Adejumo, O A",West African journal of medicine,681,16

We have found that the entire 3' UTR of MHV could be replaced by the 3' UTR of bovine coronavirus (BCV), which diverges overall by 31% in nucleotide sequence. This exchange between two viruses that are separated by a species barrier was carried out by targeted RNA recombination. Our results define regions of the two 3' UTRs that are functionally equivalent despite having substantial sequence substitutions, deletions, or insertions with respect to each other. More significantly, our attempts to generate an unallowed substitution of a particular portion of the BCV 3' UTR for the corresponding region of the MHV 3' UTR led to the discovery of a bulged stem-loop RNA secondary structure, adjacent to the stop codon of the nucleocapsid gene, that is essential for MHV viral RNA replication.","Hsue, B; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,681,16

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), the only common cause of sore throat warranting antibiotics, is cultured in 5% to 17% of adults with sore throat. The frequency of antibiotic use for pharyngitis has greatly exceeded the prevalence of GABHS, but less is known about specific classes of antibiotics used. Only penicillin and erythromycin are recommended as first-line antibiotics against GABHS. OBJECTIVES To measure trends in antibiotic use for adults with sore throat and to determine predictors of antibiotic use and nonrecommended antibiotic use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS Retrospective analysis of 2244 visits to primary care physicians in office-based practices in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1989-1999, by adults with a chief complaint of sore throat. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Treatment with antibiotics and treatment with nonrecommended antibiotics, extrapolated to US annual national rates. RESULTS There were an estimated 6.7 million annual visits in the United States by adults with sore throat between 1989 and 1999. Antibiotics were used in 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70%-76%) of visits. Patients treated with antibiotics were given nonrecommended antibiotics in 68% (95% CI, 64%-72%) of visits. From 1989 to 1999, there was a significant decrease in use of penicillin and erythromycin and an increase in use of nonrecommended antibiotics, especially extended-spectrum macrolides and extended-spectrum fluoroquinolones (P<.001 for all trends). In multivariable modeling, increasing patient age (odds ratio [OR], 0.86 per decade; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94) and general practice specialty (OR, 1.54 compared with family practice specialty; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14) were independent predictors of antibiotic use. Among patients receiving antibiotics, nonrecommended antibiotic use became more frequent over time (OR, 1.17 per year; 95% CI, 1.11-1.24). CONCLUSIONS More than half of adults are treated with antibiotics for sore throat by community primary care physicians. Use of nonrecommended, more expensive, broader-spectrum antibiotics is frequent.","Linder, J A; Stafford, R S",JAMA,681,1

Use of this testing, however, is currently limited in clinical neurologic practice by the lack of a framework for appropriate use and payer coverage. RECENT FINDINGS CES can be cost-effective due to its high diagnostic yield in comparison to other genetic tests in current use and should be utilized as a routine diagnostic test in patients with heterogeneous neurologic phenotypes facing a broad genetic differential diagnosis. CES can eliminate the need for escalating sequences of conventional neurodiagnostic tests. SUMMARY This review discusses the role of clinical exome sequencing in neurologic disease, including its benefits to patients, limitations, appropriate use, and billing.

Retrospective review identified complex hernia patients who underwent open AWR with mesh from November 2012 through April 2016. Multivariate analysis examined postoperative outcomes between groups. Quality of life was assessed using the Carolinas Comfort Scale. Seventy-five patients (18 FG vs 57 TS) with mean age (54.3 vs 53.9 years, P = 0.914), body mass index (35.8 vs 34.7 kg/m2, P = 0.623) and American Society of Anesthesiologist score (2.6 vs 2.5, P = 0.617) were reviewed. No differences in wound (P = 0.072) and nonwound (P = 0.639) related complications were noted between groups.

By plaque purification in tissue culture, we isolated two populations of particles, one carrying the long poly(C) tract and the other carrying only the short homopolymer. The fingerprints of both viruses were indistinguishable from each other and from that of the virus present in the original sample, suggesting that the main difference between the two types of particles is limited to the poly(C) tracts of their genomic RNAs, to the flanking sequences of the poly(C) tract, or to both. In addition, some biological properties of these viruses are reported, such as stability upon serial passages in different cell lines, plaque size, and pathogenicity for cattle. The results indicate that the size of the poly(C) tract is not directly related to the virulence of these viruses. However, the size of the homopolymer could play a role in determining their efficiency of replication, and it appears that the particles with the short poly(C) tract might have some replicative advantage over those carrying the long one.","Costa Giomi, M P; Bergmann, I E; Scodeller, E A; Augé de Mello, P; Gomez, I; La Torre, J L",Journal of virology,681,1

These cells usually have abnormalities from the original tumor itself, but may also develop abnormalities due to genetic manipulation, or genetic and epigenetic changes during long-term passages. Primary cultures may maintain lineage functions as the original tissue types, yet they have a very limited life span or population doubling time because of the nature of cellular senescence. Primary cultures usually have very low yields, and the high variability from any original tissue specimens, largely limiting their applications in research. Animal models are often used for studies of virus infections, disease modeling, development of antiviral drugs, and vaccines. Human viruses often need a series of passages in vivo to adapt to the host environment because of variable receptors on the cell surface and may have intracellular restrictions from the cell types or host species. Here, we describe a long-term cell culture system, conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs), and its applications in modeling human viral diseases and drug discovery. Using feeder layer coculture in presence of Y-27632 (conditional reprogramming, CR), CRCs can be obtained and rapidly propagated from surgical specimens, core or needle biopsies, and other minimally invasive or noninvasive specimens, for example, nasal cavity brushing. CRCs preserve their lineage functions and provide biologically relevant and physiological conditions, which are suitable for studies of viral entry and replication, innate immune responses of host cells, and discovery of antiviral drugs.

This study aimed to offer benchmark data on the incidence of VTE and to examine the difference in D-dimer levels among anticoagulated COVID-19 patients with and without VTE incident. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed from inception to May 2020 was performed for original studies that reported the frequency of VTE and death among COVID-19 patients who received thromboprophylaxis on hospitalization. The endpoints included VTE (a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)), PE, DVT, and mortality. Results: A total of 11 cohort studies were included. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 23.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 16.2% to 33.7%; I2= 93%) developed VTE despite anticoagulation. PE and DVT were detected in 11.6% (95% CI, 7.5% to 17.5%; I2= 92%) and 11.9% (95% CI, 6.3% to 21.3%; I2= 93%) of patients, respectively. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a higher risk for VTE (30.4% )95% CI, 19.6% to 43.9%)) than those in the ward (13.0% (95% CI, 5.9% to 26.3%)). The mortality was estimated at 21.3% (95% CI, 17.0% to 26.4%; I2= 53%). COVID-19 patients who developed VTE had higher D-dimer levels than those who did not develop VTE (mean difference, 2.05 µg/mL; 95% CI, 0.30 to 3.80 µg/mL; P = 0.02). Conclusions: The heightened and heterogeneous risk of VTE in COVID-19 despite prophylactic anticoagulation calls into research on the pathogenesis of thromboembolic complications and strategy of thromboprophylaxis and risk stratification. Prominent elevation of D-dimer may be associated with VTE development and can be used to identify high-risk subsets.","Chi, Gerald; Lee, Jane J.; Jamil, Adeel; Gunnam, Vamsikrishna; Najafi, Homa; Montazerin, Sahar Memar; Shojaei, Fahimehalsadat; Marszalek, Jolanta",J.

The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 h of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1% were men, 37.9% were obese, and 34.5% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of 5 days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV. Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation. Lymphocyte improvement was a predictor of good response.","Valenzuela, Omar; Ibáñez, Sebastián; Poli, M Cecilia; Roessler, Patricia; Aylwin, Mabel; Roizen, Gigia; Iruretagoyena, Mirentxu; Agar, Vivianne; Donoso, Javiera; Fierro, Margarita; Montes, José",Front Med (Lausanne),681,16

Clinical visits have only been facilitated for emergency purposes. Fewer patients have been admitted to the hospital for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) and a profound decrease in heart failure services has been reported. A similar reduction in the patient presentation is seen for ischemic heart disease, decompensated heart failure, and endocarditis. Cardiovascular services, including catheterization, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), cardiac investigations such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), exercise tolerance test (ETT), dobutamine stress test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) have been reported to have declined and performed on a priority basis. The long-term implications of this decline have been discussed with major concerns of severe cardiac complications and vulnerabilities in cardiac patients. The pandemic has also had psychological impacts on patients causing them to avoid seeking medical help. This review discusses the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of various cardiology services and aims to provide strategies to restore cardiovascular services including structural changes in the hospital to make up for the reduced staff personnel, the use of personal protective equipment in healthcare workers, and provides alternatives for high-risk cardiac imaging, cardiac interventions, and procedures. Implementation of the triage system, risk assessment scores, and telemedicine services in patients and their adaptation to the cardiovascular department have been discussed.","Yasmin, Farah; Shujauddin, Syed Muhammad; Naeem, Aisha; Jabeen, Adina; Shah, Syed Muhammad Ismail; Ochani, Rohan Kumar; Mohiuddin, Osama; Khan, Anosh Aslam; Jalees, Sumeen; Razzack, Aminah Abdul; Salman, Shiza; Khan, Shuja Abdul Karim; Mustafa, Ahmad; Lak, Hassan Mehmood",Rev Cardiovasc Med,681,32

Therefore, alternative testing technologies must be considered and implemented on a large scale to continue prevention efforts. This review seeks to describe the benefits of utilizing at-home HIV testing technologies, traditionally deemed an alternative form of testing. Recent Findings: Utilizing at-home testing technology during the COVID-19 pandemic overcomes novel and previously identified barriers to HIV testing. Summary: Ensuring access to HIV testing is imperative to long-term prevention goals. With the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative in the USA targeting achievement by 2030, obstacles to HIV testing must be addressed to ensure its success. Implementing alternative testing technology more broadly allows for continued prevention efforts for HIV in light of COVID era restrictions.","Warmbrunn, Isabella; Green-Jones, Monique; Outlaw, Angulique Y",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,681,16

The objective of this research was to investigate whether konjac glucomannan (KGM) could improve the quality of BWNs and further establish the shelf-life prediction model. RESULTS: The moisture distribution, recrystallization and thermal properties of BWNs during refrigerated or ambient temperature storage were determined. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that KGM addition induced left-shifts of T21 and T22 values, indicating that KGM limited the mobility of bound and immobile water among noodle matrices. X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that KGM did not change the crystal patterns of BWNs but could inhibit the starch recrystallization after refrigerated storage. The Tp and &#916;H values of retrograded samples notably (p<0.05) decreased with the increase of KGM addition, suggesting the hinderance of starch retrogradation behavior by KGM. The shelf life of BWNs was predicted by accelerated storage test combined with Arrhenius Equation. Present data displayed that the predicted shelf life of vacuum-packed and sterilized BWNs with 10 gâKg-1 KGM at 25°C was 733 days, 2.4 folds of the control group. CONCLUSION: The BWNs with KGM addition could inhibit starch retrogradation and improve the storage stability, consequently promoting the noodle quality. This article is protected by copyright.

We demonstrate the application of one such simple automated machine learning algorithm to a dataset obtained about COVID-19 spread in South Korea to better understand the disease dynamics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 20th January 2020 (when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in South Korea) to 4th March 2020 was accessed from Korea's centre for disease control (KCDC). A future time-series of specified length (taken as 7 days in our study) starting from 5th March 2020 to 11th March 2020 was generated and fed to the model to generate predictions with upper and lower trend bounds of 95% confidence intervals. The model was assessed for its ability to reliably forecast using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the metric. RESULTS: As on 4th March 2020, 145,541 patients were tested for COVID-19 (in 45 days) in South Korea of which 5166 patients tested positive. The predicted values approximated well with the actual numbers. The difference between predicted and observed values ranged from 4.08% to 12.77% . On average, our predictions differed from actual values by 7.42% (MAPE) over the same period. CONCLUSION: Open source and automated machine learning tools like Prophet can be applied and are effective in the context of COVID-19 for forecasting spread in naïve communities. It may help countries to efficiently allocate healthcare resources to contain this pandemic.","Asfahan, Shahir; Gopalakrishnan, Maya; Dutt, Naveen; Niwas, Ram; Chawla, Gopal; Agarwal, Mehul; Garg, Mahendera Kumar",Adv Respir Med,681,16

The in vitro antitumor assay revealed that among the 4-aryl-substituted 1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-ones (B series), most possessed moderate to strong activities, with compound B7c that bears a 2-naphthyl substituent being the most potent one (IC50 0.16-0.40 µM) against a panel of human cancer cell lines. In contrast, none of the 3-(arylmethylene)-substituted 1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-ones (L series) showed significant activities in the assay. Further studies indicated that B7c inhibited tubulin polymerization, disrupted in vitro vascularization, blocked cell cycle progression at G2/M phase, induced cell apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species level in a dose-dependent way. Compound B7c also inhibited significantly tumor growth in a xenograft mice model with no obvious drop in the mice body weights. Collectively, these results suggested that B7c and its analogues should merit further investigation as new promising antitumor agents.","Liang, Yuru; Zhang, Mao; Zhou, Pengfei; Liu, Mingming; Li, Jianqi; Wang, Yang",Bioorg Chem,681,2

The aim of study was to investigate the clinical features of pediatric inpatients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to seek for studies providing details on pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection which were published from 1st January to 21st April 2020. Studies with more than five pediatric inpatients were included in our meta-analysis.This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020183550). As the results shown, fever (46%) and cough (42%) were the main clinical characters of pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the other clinical characters, such as diarrhea, vomiting, nasal congestion, and fatigue account for 10% in pediatric inpatients. The proportion of asymptomatic cases was 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.59) and severe cases was 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01-0.06).

However, most methods for estimating the basic reproductive number (R0) and time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) assume that the fraction of cases detected and reported is constant through time. We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of coronavirus disease and testing practices from different states in the United States from March 4 to August 30, 2020. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of coronavirus disease.","Pitzer, Virginia E; Chitwood, Melanie; Havumaki, Joshua; Menzies, Nicolas A; Perniciaro, Stephanie; Warren, Joshua L; Weinberger, Daniel M; Cohen, Ted",Am. j. epidemiol,681,20

A full-fledged solution that can help the government and people retain their normal lifestyle and improve the economy is crucial. By bringing into the picture a unique incentive-based approach, the strain of government and the people can be greatly reduced. By providing incentives for actions such as voluntary testing, isolation, etc., the government can better plan strategies for fighting the situation while people in need can benefit from the incentive offered. This idea of combining strength to battle against the virus can bring out newer possibilities that can give an upper hand in this war. As the unpredictable future develops, sharing and maintaining COVID related data of every user could be the needed trigger to kick start the economy and blockchain paves the way for this solution with decentralization and immutability of data.","Manoj, MK; Srivastava, Gautam; Somayaji, Siva Rama Krishnan; Gadekallu, Thippa Reddy; Maddikunta, Praveen Kumar Reddy; Bhattacharya, Sweta",,681,32

It is not known whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of death than residents without COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher mortality rate in NH residents, considering frailty status assessed with the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). METHODS: In this retrospective study, made in 31 NHs in Venice, Italy, the presence of COVID-19 was ascertained with a nasopharyngeal swab. Frailty was evaluated using the MPI, modified according to the tools commonly used in our NHs. A Cox's regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using COVID-19 as exposure and mortality as outcome and stratified by MPI tertiles. Similar analyses were run using MPI tertiles as exposure. RESULTS: Overall, 3946 NH residents (median age = 87 years, females: 73.9%) were eligible, with 1136 COVID-19 + . During a median follow-up of 275 days, higher values of MPI, indicating frailer people, were associated with an increased risk of mortality. The incidence of mortality in COVID-19 + was more than doubled than COVID-19- either in MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3 groups. The presence of COVID-19 increased the risk of death (HR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59-2.15), also in the propensity score model using MPI as confounder (HR = 2.48; 95% CI 2.10-2.93). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of NH residents, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality than those not affected by COVID-19 also considering the different grades of frailty.","Veronese, Nicola; Koyanagi, Ai; Stangherlin, Vanni; Mantoan, Paola; Chiavalin, Marco; Tudor, Florina; Pozzobon, Gianfranco; Tessarin, Michele; Pilotto, Alberto",Aging Clin Exp Res,681,16

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were left intact (sham) or ovariectomized (OVX) and implanted with pumps delivering vehicle or E2 (0.5 mg/kg/day). Two weeks following surgery, the rats were exposed to room air (RA) or CIH for 7 days (10% O2, 10 cycles/hour, 8 hours/day). Lung samples were used to measure the activities of pro- (NADPH and xanthine oxidases) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) enzymes, and concentrations of advanced oxidation of protein products (AOPP). We determined gene expression with an RNA microarray and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. In rats exposed to RA, OVX and E2 supplementation increased pro- and antioxidant activities and AOPP concentration. In rats exposed to CIH, AOPP pro- and antoxidant enzymes activities increased in sham, did not changed in OVX-Veh rats, and were reduced in OVX-E2 rats. In rats exposed to RA, genes involved in extracellular matrix were up-regulated by OVX and down-regulated by E2, while E2 up-regulated genes involved in cell mobility/adherence and leukocytes migration. OVX downregulated expression of roughly 200 olfactory receptor genes without effect of E2. CIH altered gene expression in sham and OVX-E2, but not in OVX-Veh rats. Enrichment analysis confirmed the antioxidant effects of E2 under CIH. There are important interactions between ovarian hormones and CIH that can be relevant to better understand the consequences of sleep apnea (i.e. CIH) on the occurrence of lung pathologies in women.","Ribon-Demars, Alexandra; Jochmans-Lemoine, Alexandra; Ganouna-Cohen, Gauthier; Boreau, Anaëlle; Marcouiller, François; Bairam, Aida; Pialoux, Vincent; Joseph, Vincent",Free radic. biol. med,681,32

The importance of in silico studies in repurposing drug research is gradually increasing during the COVID-19 process. The present study found that especially ribavirin triphosphate and galidesivir triphosphate active metabolites had a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase than ATP by molecular docking. With the Molecular Dynamics simulation, we have observed that these compounds increase the complex's stability and validate the molecular docking results. We also explained that the interaction of RNA polymerase inhibitors with Mg++, which is in the structure of NSP12, is essential and necessary to interact with the RNA strand.

Guidelines for tracheotomy in this cohort of patients are therefore required with assessed outcomes of tracheotomies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy. Inclusion criteria were the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients between March 11 and December 31, 2020. Exclusion criteria were lack of consent, extubation prior to the performance of a tracheotomy, death prior to the performance of the tracheotomy, and COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy who tested negative twice after medical treatment. The primary predictor variable was the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients and the primary outcome variable was the time to cessation of mechanical ventilation with the institution of supplemental oxygen via trach mask. RESULTS: Seventeen tracheotomies were performed between 4-25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯17 days). Seven patients died between 4 and 16 days (meanâ¯=â¯8.7 days) following tracheotomy and 10 living patients realized cessation of mechanical ventilation from 4 hours to 61 days following tracheotomy (meanâ¯=â¯19.3 days). These patients underwent tracheotomy between 4 and 22 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯14 days). The 7 patients who died following tracheotomy underwent the procedure between 7 and 25 days following intubation (meanâ¯=â¯18.2 days). Seven patients underwent tracheotomy on or after 20 days of intubation and 3 survived (43%). Ten patients underwent tracheotomy before 20 days of intubation and 7 patients survived (70%). Significant differences between the mortality groups were detected for age (Pâ¯=â¯.006), and for P/F ratio at time of consult (Pâ¯=â¯.047) and the time of tracheotomy (Pâ¯=â¯.03). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheotomies are safely performed in COVID-19 patients with a standardized protocol. The timing of tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients is based on ventilator parameters, P/F ratio, patient prognosis, patient advanced directives, and family wishes.","Carlson, Eric R; Heidel, R Eric; Houston, Kyle; Vahdani, Soheil; Winstead, Michael",J. oral maxillofac. surg,681,26

This hybridization aims to identify a limited and stable set of discriminative genes without sacrificing classification accuracy, whereas most current methods have encountered challenges in extracting disease-related information from a vast amount of redundant genes. The proposed approach first applies the minimum redundancy maximum relevancy (MRMR) filter method to reduce the dimensionality of feature space and then utilizes the suggested hybrid DBH algorithm to determine a smaller set of significant genes. The proposed approach was evaluated on eight benchmark gene expression datasets, and then, was compared against the latest state-of-art techniques to demonstrate algorithm efficiency. The comparative study shows that the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement as compared with existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes. Moreover, the performance of the suggested method was examined on real RNA-Seq coronavirus-related gene expression data of asthmatic patients for selecting the most significant genes in order to improve the discriminative accuracy of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2, as a coronavirus receptor, is a biomarker that helps to classify infected patients from uninfected in order to identify subgroups at risk for COVID-19. The result denotes that the suggested MRMR-DBH approach represents a very promising framework for finding a new combination of most discriminative genes with high classification accuracy.","Pashaei, Elnaz; Pashaei, Elham",Anal Biochem,681,25

Like many other countries, Iran is struggling with the current situation. In this article, we aim to share our perspectives on confronting obstacles mentioned above using appropriate hospital protocols during the COVID-19 crisis. We investigated and compared the number of referred patients to the emergency room, elective, and emergent orthopedic operations in our hospital, along with a number of residents and faculty participants in the morning reports and virtual classes before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 in our hospital. The number of referred patients to the emergency room was significantly reduced; the number of orthopedic operations was also decreased to almost zero in March 2020. Meanwhile, we managed to dismiss our residents and reduce the number of in-hospital morning reports and conferences. Instead, we designed virtual classes, and the number of participants in our virtual classes grew to almost two-third of the whole participant. We also managed to fortify our virtual office system to reduce the number of in-hospital visits. Since our hospital had become a leading center for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and the number of referred trauma patients, elective, and trauma operations, along with educational activities, was reduced. There was also a significant concern about the management of elective, trauma, and post-operative patients in this era. Orthopedic faculty members needed to react to the current situation cautiously.

Twenty-one participants completed a pre-questionnaire distributed prior to telehealth service delivery, and 23 providers completed a post-questionnaire approximately three weeks later. Results indicate the majority of behavioral health providers had no experience providing telehealth services prior to COVID-19. The majority of participating behavioral health providers utilized telehealth to provide pediatric patient care within the first month of access to telehealth. Participants' confidence in their ability to provide telehealth services significantly increased within the first month of implementation, regardless of previous training in telehealth. This study identified differences between anticipated and actual barriers to treatment, with technological issues identified as the largest actual barrier to service delivery. Participants indicated a preference for in-person service delivery, which they reported allows for better rapport-building, behavioral observations, reduced technological barriers, and fewer distractions. However, most participants reported they intend to continue utilizing telehealth for certain types of behavioral health services (e.g., diagnostic interviews and outpatient therapy) after the pandemic has subsided.","Frye, William S; Gardner, Lauren; Campbell, Jonathan M; Katzenstein, Jennifer M",J Child Health Care,681,1

METHODS: Using data through December 1, 2020, we estimated time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using EpiEstim package in R, and calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) across the 3 provinces. RESULTS: In Ontario, 76% (92 745/121 745) of cases were in Toronto, Peel, York, Ottawa, and Durham; in Alberta, 82% (49 878/61 169) in Calgary and Edmonton; in British Columbia, 90% (31 142/34 699) in Fraser and Vancouver Coastal. Across 3 provinces, Rt dropped to &#8804; 1 after April. In Ontario, Rt would remain < 1 in April if congregate-setting-associated cases were excluded. Over summer, Rt maintained < 1 in Ontario, ~1 in British Columbia, and ~1 in Alberta, except early July when Rt was > 1. In all 3 provinces, Rt was > 1, reflecting surges in case count from September through November. Compared with British Columbia (684.2 cases per 100 000), Alberta (IRR = 2.0; 1399.3 cases per 100 000) and Ontario (IRR = 1.2; 835.8 cases per 100 000) had a higher cumulative case count per 100 000 population.

As such, there is an increased interest in leveraging eHealth innovations developed and tested in one country or jurisdiction and using these innovations in local settings. However, limited knowledge exists on the processes needed to appropriately adapt digital health innovations to optimize their transferability across geographical, cultural, and contextual settings. OBJECTIVE: We report on the results of an adaptation study of Horyzons, a digital health innovation originally developed and tested in Australia. Horyzons is designed to prevent relapses and support recovery in young people receiving services for first-episode psychosis (FEP). The aim of this study is to assess the initial acceptability of Horyzons and adapt it in preparation for pilot testing in Canada. METHODS: This research took place in 2 specialized early intervention clinics for FEP, located in 1 urban and 1 urban-rural setting, in 2 Canadian provinces. A total of 26 participants were recruited: 15 clinicians (age range 26-56 years) and 11 patients (age range 19-37 years). Following the digital health adaptation framework developed by our team, we used a mixed methods approach, combining descriptive quantitative and qualitative methods across 3 stages of data collection (focus groups, interviews, and consultations), analysis, and adaptations. RESULTS: Overall, patients and clinicians appreciated the strengths-based approach and social media features of Horyzons. However, participants expressed concerns related to implementation, especially in relation to capacity (eg, site moderation, crisis management, internet speed in rural locations). They also provided suggestions for adapting content and features, for example, in relation to community resources, volume of text, universal accessibility (eg, for individuals with limitations in vision), and optimization of platform accessibility through mobile devices. Additional aspects of the innovation were flagged for adaptation during the final stages of preparing it for live implementation. These included terms of use, time zone configuration to reflect local time and date, safety and moderation protocols, the need help now feature, and the list of trigger words to flag posts indicative of potential risk. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health guidelines for social distancing, there is an increasing interest and need to leverage the internet and mobile technologies for delivering youth mental health services. As countries look to one another for guidance on how to navigate changing social dynamics, knowledge on how to utilize and adapt existing innovations across contexts is now more important than ever. Using a systematic approach, this study illustrates the methods, processes, results, and lessons learned on adapting a digital health innovation to enhance its local acceptability.

Early cholecystectomy has many reported advantages. Operation-related morbidity and mortality have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, our aim is to present our general clinical approach to patients who were diagnosed with AC during the pandemic and our percutaneous cholecystostomy experience during this period. METHODS: This study included 72 patients who were presented to our hospital's emergency room between March 11 and May 31, 2020, with AC. Patients were divided into three groups based on their treatment: outpatients (Group 1), inpatients (Group 2) and patients undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy (Group 3). These three groups were compared by their demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: There were 36 (50%) patients in Group 1, 25 (34.7%) patients in Group 2, and 11 (15.3%) patients in Group 3. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar. The CRP and WBC levels of the patients in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to the other groups. Moreover, the wall of the gallbladder was thicker and the size of the gallbladder was larger in Group 3. Patients had percutaneous cholecystostomy at the median of 3.5 days and the length of hospital stay was longer compared to Group 2 (3.9 days versus 9.2 days, p=0.00). The rate of re-hospitalization after discharge was similar in Group 2 and Group 3, but none of the patients in Group 1 required hospitalization. None of 72 patients developed an emergency condition requiring surgery, and there was no death. CONCLUSION: Although many publications emphasize that laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can be performed with low morbidity at the first admission in acute cholecystitis, it is a clinical condition that can be delayed in the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar emergencies. Thus, percutaneous cholecystostomy should be effectively employed, and its indications should be extended if necessary (e.g., younger patients, patients with lower CCI or ASA). This approach may enable us to protect both patients and healthcare professionals that perform the operation from the risk of COVID-19.","Çiyiltepe, Hüseyin; Yildirim, Gülsah; Fersahoglu, Mehmet Mahir; Aydin, M Timuçin; Özcabi, Yetkin; Bulut, Nuriye Esen; Tasdelen, Iksan; Fersahoglu, Ayse Tuba; Yananli, Zühal Demirhan; Aydin, Ibrahim; Agca, Birol; Karakas, Hakki Muammer; Akyüz, Umit; Memisoglu, Kemal",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,681,33

Back in the 1970s, Jane Jacobs theorized urban vitality and found that there are four conditions required for the promotion of life in cities: diversity of land use, small block sizes, the mix of economic activities, and concentration of people. To build proxies for those four conditions and ultimately test Jane Jacobs's theory at scale, researchers have had to collect both private and public data from a variety of sources, and that took decades. Here we propose the use of one single source of data, which happens to be publicly available: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In particular, since the first two conditions (diversity of land use and small block sizes) are visible to the naked eye from satellite imagery, we tested whether we could automatically extract them with a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework and whether, in the end, the extracted features could predict vitality. In six Italian cities for which we had call data records, we found that our framework is able to explain on average 55% of the variance in urban vitality extracted from those records.","vS'cepanovi'c, Sanja; Joglekar, Sagar; Law, Stephen; Quercia, Daniele",,681,1

However, few EDs have adequate time and personnel resources to deliver recommended evidence-based assessment and interventions. To raise the clinical standard of care for patients who are suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services in the ED, we developed Jaspr Health, a tablet-based app for direct use by such patients, which enables the delivery of 4 evidence-based practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Jaspr Health among suicidal adults in EDs. METHODS: Patients who were acutely suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services participated in an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial while in the ED. Participants were randomly assigned to Jaspr Health (n=14) or care as usual (control; n=17) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, and a 2-hour posttest using self-report measures and a semistructured interview were conducted. RESULTS: Conditions differed significantly at baseline with regard to age but not other demographic variables or baseline measures. On average, participants had been in the ED for 17 hours before enrolling in the study. Over their lifetime, 84% (26/31) of the sample had made a suicide attempt (mean 3.4, SD 6.4) and 61% (19/31) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, with an average rate of 8.8 times in the past 3 months. All established feasibility and acceptability criteria were met: no adverse events occurred, participants' app use was high, Jaspr Health app user satisfaction ratings were high, and all participants using Jaspr Health recommended its use for other suicidal ED patients. Comparisons between study conditions provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the app: participants using Jaspr Health reported a statistically significant increase in receiving 4 evidence-based suicide prevention interventions and overall satisfaction ratings with their ED experience. In addition, significant decreases in distress and agitation, along with significant increases in learning to cope more effectively with current and future suicidal thoughts, were observed among participants using Jaspr Health compared with those receiving care as usual. CONCLUSIONS: Even with limited statistical power, the results showed that Jaspr Health is feasible, acceptable, and clinically effective for use by ED patients who are acutely suicidal and seeking ED-based psychiatric crisis services.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This clinical retrospective study included 103 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. All patient data were obtained from the patient files and anesthesia follow-up forms. Demographic datas, intraoperative fluids, blood products requirement and blood gas parameters were recorded. RESULTS: A total 15 of 103 patients data were lack, the remaining 88 patients were evaluated. Combination of crystalloid and colloid was used for intravenous fluid management. About 11% of patients required transfusion during surgery. The mean pH and pO2 values of the patients were observed to decrease whereas pCO2 and lactate values increased. DISCUSSION: Radical Prostatectomy can be performed either using open technique as a traditional approach or laparoscopic or robot-assisted technique as a minimally invasive approach. Today, minimally invasive approaches have replaced traditional open prostatectomy. Anaesthesia management of these minimally invasive techniques is very different and challenging from open technique in many aspects. CONCLUSION: Although minimally invasive techniques have good surgical outcomes such as less blood loss, smaller surgical incision, and shorter hospitalization, these techniques bring new problems that anesthesiologists have to deal with. Increased RARP operations has led to the anesthesiologists more likely to encounter perioperative problems.

In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.","Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",,681,16

We have also shown that the inelastic neutron spectrum of YCrO3 mimics the magnon spectrum from a G-type antiferromagnetic system, which is consistent with previously reported magnetic structure in the compound. The ab-initio lattice dynamics calculations in both the compounds exhibit anisotropic thermal expansion behaviour in the orthorhombic structure and predict negative thermal expansion along the crystallographic a-axis at low temperatures.

While the overwhelming focus has been on blockade of these inhibitory pathways to augment immunity, agonistic triggering via these receptors offers the promise of dampening pathogenic inflammatory responses. V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) has emerged as an immunoregulatory receptor with constitutive expression on both the T cell and myeloid compartments, and whose agonistic targeting has proven a unique avenue relative to other checkpoint pathways to suppress pathologies mediated by the innate arm of the immune system. VISTA agonistic targeting profoundly changes the phenotype of human monocytes towards an anti-inflammatory cell state, as highlighted by striking suppression of the canonical markers CD14 and FcÎ³r3a (CD16), and the almost complete suppression of both the interferon I (IFN-I) and antigen presentation pathways. The insights from these very recent studies highlight the impact of VISTA agonistic targeting of myeloid cells, and its potential therapeutic implications in the settings of hyperinflammatory responses such as cytokine storms, driven by dysregulated immune responses to viral infections (with a focus on COVID-19) and autoimmune diseases.

The patient had undergone liver transplantation 3 years prior to his referral due to primary sclerosing cholangitis in association with ulcerative colitis and was using immunosuppressive medications. The patient referred to a local physician with mild symptoms of fatigue, cough, myalgia, dizziness, and nausea/vomiting with a fear of contracting the disease. Except for a CRP of 32 his other blood tests were normal. After 3 days of hospital admission the patient was discharged with a good condition. His brother had developed fever, chills, headache, mild dyspnea and an objective loss of sense of smell and taste and was sent home and advised to self-quarantine. Both patients had CT scans in favor of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our patient who had liver transplantation and COVID-19 did not present more severe symptoms compared to his counterpart without liver transplantation and did not need to be hospitalized or be given antiviral drugs for COVID-19.","Nikoupour, Hamed; Arasteh, Peyman; Gholami, Siavash; Nikeghbalian, Saman",BMC Surg,681,5

Fatal CRS occurrences have also plagued the development of highly promising cancer therapies based on T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. CRS is intimately linked with dysregulated and excessive cytokine release, including IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, IL 1, IL-6, and IL-10, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response leading to multiple organ failure.

Blood cytokine levels and gene expression analysis from lung, liver, and spleen demonstrated a hierarchy of inflammatory cytokine production and infiltrating immune cells with differentiating organ-dependent kinetics. IL-2, IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 up-regulation preceded clinical signs of CRS. The co-treatment of mice with a neutralizing anti-cytokine antibody cocktail transiently improved early clinical and laboratory features of CRS.

Therefore, the study aim was to explore the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness among the outpatient population and healthcare workers in Taiwan during the worldwide pandemic period without community outbreaks. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs; n = 500; mean age = 32.96 years) of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) and outpatients (n = 238; mean age = 34.43 years) arriving at NCKUH. We used an online survey conducted between September 24 and 21 November 2020, for healthcare workers, and between 27 October and 31 December 2020, for the outpatient sample. Information regarding willingness to receive vaccination, willingness to rapid test, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors was collected in both samples; information regarding willingness to care for patients was collected in healthcare workers. Willingness to receive vaccination was the main variable in the present study; willingness to rapid test, willingness to care for patients, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors were the secondary variables in the study. The factors associated with vaccination willingness were identified through logistic regression analysis. The participants' willingness to receive vaccination was low for both healthcare workers (23.4%) and the outpatient sample (30.7%). Similarly, their willingness to take rapid tests was low (23.6% for healthcare workers and 28.6% for outpatient sample). Risk perception (crude odds ratio (COR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03, 1.63), willingness to take rapid test (COR = 9.24; 95% CI = 5.76, 14.83), and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.52, 3.56) were significant factors explaining the healthcare workers' willingness to receive vaccination.

Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among HCWs and outpatients is low due to the relatively safe status of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan.

This major human health emergency has been caused by a betacoronavirus, as have others in the past. In this chapter, we outline the taxonomy of betacoronaviruses and their properties, both genetic and biological. We discuss their recombinational and mutational histories separately to show that the sequence of the RaTG13 bat virus isolate is the closest currently known full-length genetic homolog of that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the RaTG13 bat virus and SARS-CoV-2 have probably diverged over 20 years. We discuss the ecology of their pangolin and bat hosts and conclude that, like other recent viral pandemics, the underlying cause of the SARS-CoV-2 emergence is probably the relentless growth of the world's human population and the overexploitation and disturbance of the environment.","Rodríguez-Román, Eduardo; Gibbs, Adrian J",Adv Exp Med Biol,681,16

This has motivated numerous studies on automating fake news detection. Most studies explore supervised training models with different modalities (e.g., text, images, and propagation networks) of news records to identify fake news. However, the performance of such techniques generally drops if news records are coming from different domains (e.g., politics, entertainment), especially for domains that are unseen or rarely-seen during training. As motivation, we empirically show that news records from different domains have significantly different word usage and propagation patterns. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of unlabelled news records, it is challenging to select news records for manual labelling so that the domain-coverage of the labelled dataset is maximized. Hence, this work: (1) proposes a novel framework that jointly preserves domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge in news records to detect fake news from different domains; and (2) introduces an unsupervised technique to select a set of unlabelled informative news records for manual labelling, which can be ultimately used to train a fake news detection model that performs well for many domains while minimizing the labelling cost. Our experiments show that the integration of the proposed fake news model and the selective annotation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for cross-domain news datasets, while yielding notable improvements for rarely-appearing domains in news datasets.","Silva, Amila; Luo, Ling; Karunasekera, Shanika; Leckie, Christopher",,681,16

Treatment in this subpopulation is complex due to the potential hepatotoxicity of some of the medicinal products used. Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future.

However, disease prevalence in IBD patients is presently unknown. In this prospective observational study we aimed at determining SARS-CoV2 infection prevalence in IBD patients treated with biological therapy. METHODS: 354 sera from IBD patients under biological therapy recruited from three different locations in Italy and Germany were evaluated for antibody presence by RBD ELISA. Control groups were i) age-matched healthy subjects tested in the same time period in Milan, Italy; ii) healthy subjects collected in the pre-COVID era; iii) IBD patients under biological therapy collected in the pre-COVID era. RESULTS: 8 out of 354 patients tested positive for the anti-RBD-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody (prevalence 2.3%). IgG positive patients' percentage recruited from Milan was significantly higher than those recruited from other locations (prevalence 5.4% vs. 0.4% p < 0.005). IgG positive patients reported a significantly higher incidence of fever, anosmia and ageusia, and were more likely to have entered in close contact with COVID-19 positive subjects before the study enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 in IBD patients treated with biological therapy reflects values measured in the local general population. Specific symptoms and contact history with SARS-CoV2-infected individuals strongly increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV2 seropositivity.","Berte039,; Roberto,; Mazza, Stefano; Stefanucci, Marta Rachele; Noviello, Daniele; Costa, Stefania; Ciafardini, Clorinda; Mileti, Erika; Mapelli, Marina; Pasqualato, Sebastiano; Pinto, Sergio; Favale, Agnese; Vecchi, Maurizio; Neurath, Markus F; Atreya, Raja; Fantini, Massimo Claudio; Facciotti, Federica; Caprioli, Flavio",J. crohns. colitis,681,20

Lockdown measures, shown to be effective in reducing the number of new cases, may not have been effective in the same way for all, failing to protect the most vulnerable populations. This survey aims to assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020, during COVID-19 lockdown. Ten thousand one hundred one participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19. The main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3 days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: In all, 1304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies. The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8 to 4.3%, P = 0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9% before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P = 0.03). This differential effect of lockdown remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The odds of being infected during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by 57% among working class individuals (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.00-2.48). The same was true for those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections, calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions. Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.","Bajos, Nathalie; Jusot, Florence; Pailhé, Ariane; Spire, Alexis; Martin, Claude; Meyer, Laurence; Lydié, Nathalie; Franck, Jeanna-Eve; Zins, Marie; Carrat, Fabrice",BMC Public Health,681,1

Nepal has been severely affected by it, with an increasing number of confirmed cases and casualties in recent days, even after 8 months of the first case detected in China. As of 26 November 2020, there were over 227,600 confirmed cases of COVID in Nepal with 209,435 recovered cases and 1,412 deaths. This study aimed to compile public data available from the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), Government of Nepal (GoN) and analyse the data of 104 deceased COVID-19 patients using IBM SPSS (Version 25.0). Additionally, this study also aimed to provide critical insights on response of the GoN to COVID-19 and way forward to confront unprecedented pandemic. Figures and maps were created using the Origin Lab (Version 2018) and QGIS (Version 3.10.8). Most of the reported cases were from Bagmati Province, the location of Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu. Among deceased cases, >69% of the patients were male and patients &#8805;54 years accounted for 67.9% (n = 923). Preliminary findings showed respiratory illness, diabetes, and chronic kidney diseases were the most common comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19 deaths in Nepal. Despite some efforts in the 8 months since the first case was detected, the government's response so far has been insufficient. Since the government eased the lockdown in July 2020, Nepal is facing a flood of COVID-19 cases. If no aggressive actions are taken, the epidemic is likely to result in significant morbidity and mortality in Nepal. The best way to curb the effect of the ongoing pandemic in a resource-limited country like Nepal is to increase testing, tracing, and isolation capacity, and to set up quality quarantine centers throughout the nation. A comprehensive health literacy campaign, quality care of older adults and those with comorbidity will also result in the effective management of the ongoing pandemic.","Rayamajhee, Binod; Pokhrel, Anil; Syangtan, Gopiram; Khadka, Saroj; Lama, Bhupendra; Rawal, Lal Bahadur; Mehata, Suresh; Mishra, Shyam Kumar; Pokhrel, Roshan; Yadav, Uday Narayan",Front Public Health,681,16

The FDA Emergency Use Authorization restricts use of CCP to high-titer units only. The purpose of this study was to determine if donor ABO blood group was associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, and subsequent qualification as high-titer CCP. METHODS: All CCP donations collected from April 21, 2020 to September 1, 2020 were included. The Abbott ARCHITECT semi-quantitative chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to assess IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. Units with a S/C value &#8805;4.5 were considered high titer. RESULTS: A total of 232 CCP donations were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the distribution of sex, age, and interval from symptom resolution to donation by ABO blood group. The mean SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody S/C value was significantly lower in blood group O donations (3.6), compared to blood group A (5.0) donations (p < .001). There was no difference in antibody response between the other blood group pairings. Blood group O donations resulted in a lower percentage of high-titer units (35%), compared to blood group A (60%), B (58%), and AB (65%) donations. CONCLUSION: Blood group O donations were found to have significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid antibodies compared to blood group A donations and were less likely to produce CCP units that qualified as high titer. These findings may aid donor recruitment to promote availability of high-titer CCP to meet patient needs.","Hayes, Chelsea; Rubenstein, Wesley; Gibb, David; Klapper, Ellen; Tanaka, Julie; Pepkowitz, Samuel",Transfusion,681,1

RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury-related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation-related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (P < .01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID-19.

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 worldwide, highlights the critical need for developing rapid and accurate diagnostic testing methods for emerging human coronavirus (CoV) infections. Testing is crucial to track the spread of disease during a pandemic, and to swiftly permit public health interventions including isolation, quarantine, and appropriate clinical management of afflicted individuals. The key components of viral diagnostic tests are (1) collection of the appropriate sample (blood, nasal swab, and throat swab), (2) availability of the genetic and proteomic sequences of the novel virus for analysis, and (3) rapid and accurate laboratory testing methods. The current gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viral nucleic acids. Other relevant laboratory methods include enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for viral antibody and antigen detection, and serum viral neutralization (SVN) assays for antibody neutralization determination. The challenges faced in developing a diagnostic test for a novel pathogen are the ability to measure low viral loads for early detection, to provide low or no cross-reactivity with other viral strains and to deliver results rapidly. Several point-of-care molecular devices are currently being integrated for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

To stay in touch with our cohort and to ensure continued data collection under different stages of quarantine, the ISMMS ADRC redeployed their work force to continue their observational study via telehealth assessment. On the basis of this experience and that of other centers, NACC was able to create a data collection process to accommodate remote assessment in mid-August.

This cross-sectional study examined the primary and secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income and minority groups in New York State using the social determinants of health framework. New Yorkers were recruited to complete a web-based survey through Qualtrics. The survey took place in May and June 2020 and asked respondents about COVID-19 health impacts, risk factors, and concerns. Chi-square analysis examined the health effects experienced by race and ethnicity, and significant results were analyzed in a series of logistic regression models. Results showed disparities in the primary and secondary impacts of COVID-19. The majority of differences were reported between Hispanic and white respondents. The largest differences, in terms of magnitude, were reported between other or multiracial respondents and white respondents. Given the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on minority populations, improved policies and programs to address impacts on lower-paying essential jobs and service positions could reduce exposure risks and improve safety for minority populations. Future research can identify the long-term health consequences of the pandemic on the social determinants of health among populations most at risk.","Clay, Lauren A; Rogus, Stephanie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),681,16

While digital trace data collected by private and public parties hold a huge potential for social-scientific discovery, their most useful parts have been unattainable for academic researchers due to privacy concerns and prohibitive API access. However, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants all citizens the right to an electronic copy of their personal data. All major data controllers, such as social media platforms, banks, online shops, loyalty card systems and public transportation cards comply with this right by providing their clients with a `Data Download Package' (DDP). Previously, a conceptual workflow was introduced allowing citizens to donate their data to scientific- researchers. In this workflow, citizens' DDPs are processed locally on their machines before they are asked to provide informed consent to share a subset of the processed data with the researchers. In this paper, we present the newly developed software PORT that implements the local processing part of this workflow, protecting privacy by shielding sensitive data from any contact with outside observers -- including the researchers themselves.

The impact of neutralising antibody waning rate at the individual patient level on the longevity of immunity remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the peak levels and dynamics of neutralising antibody waning and IgG avidity maturation over time, and correlate this with clinical parameters, cytokines, and T-cell responses. Methods: We did a longitudinal study of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 up to day 180 post-symptom onset by monitoring changes in neutralising antibody levels using a previously validated surrogate virus neutralisation test. Changes in antibody avidities and other immune markers at different convalescent stages were determined and correlated with clinical features. Using a machine learning algorithm, temporal change in neutralising antibody levels was classified into five groups and used to predict the longevity of neutralising antibody-mediated immunity. Findings: We approached 517 patients for participation in the study, of whom 288 consented for outpatient follow-up and collection of serial blood samples. 164 patients were followed up and had adequate blood samples collected for analysis, with a total of 546 serum samples collected, including 128 blood samples taken up to 180 days post-symptom onset. We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30% inhibition level (19 [12%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (52 [29%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades. Interpretation: Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level. Our findings emphasise the importance of public health and social measures in the ongoing pandemic outbreak response, and might have implications for longevity of immunity after vaccination.

The ways behavioral health specialists can capitalize on their competence in the leadership, prevention, education, service, research, and advocacy domains within each behavioral health pandemic response phase are articulated. Behavioral health expertise can help ensure a more comprehensive, effective pandemic response that facilitates the flattening of the curve of disease spread, along with the corresponding emotional distress curve. A case illustration, the Caring Communities (CC) initiative, is offered as an exemplar of action steps in the leadership, prevention, education, service, research, and advocacy domains that behavioral health professionals can take within each of the behavioral health pandemic response phases. Key CC action steps include providing support groups, offering virtual wellness breaks, participating in educational outreach, creating and disseminating wellness guides, launching and leading a virtual behavioral health clinic for health care staff, participating in behavioral health research and program evaluation, and engaging in advocacy initiatives aimed at improving behavioral health care and addressing and reducing health disparities.

In SARS-CoV infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, whereas they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19-like disease in macaques and provides a new model to test preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Rockx, Barry; Kuiken, Thijs; Herfst, Sander; Bestebroer, Theo; Lamers, Mart M; Oude Munnink, Bas B; de Meulder, Dennis; van Amerongen, Geert; van den Brand, Judith; Okba, Nisreen M A; Schipper, Debby; van Run, Peter; Leijten, Lonneke; Sikkema, Reina; Verschoor, Ernst; Verstrepen, Babs; Bogers, Willy; Langermans, Jan; Drosten, Christian; Fentener van Vlissingen, Martje; Fouchier, Ron; de Swart, Rik; Koopmans, Marion; Haagmans, Bart L",Science,681,24

It is known that stress, caused by many factors and life events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can negatively impact the health of mothers and offspring. It is the first time social media, such as Twitter, are available and commonly used during a global pandemic; this allows access to a rich set of data. The objective of this study was to characterize the content of an international sample of tweets related to pregnancy and mental health during the first wave of COVID-19, from March to June 2020. Tweets were collected using GetOldTweets3. Sentiment analysis was performed using the VADER sentiment analysis tool, and a thematic analysis was performed. In total, 192 tweets were analyzed: 51 were from individuals, 37 from companies, 56 from non-profit organizations, and 48 from health professionals/researchers. Findings showed discrepancies between individual and non-individual tweets. Women expressed anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleeping problems, and distress related to isolation. Alarmingly, there was a discrepancy between distress expressed by women with isolation and sleep difficulties compared to support offered by non-individuals. Concrete efforts should be made to acknowledge these issues on Twitter while maintaining the current support offered.","Talbot, Joey; Charron, Valérie; Konkle, Anne Tm",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),681,16

We validated a rapidly applicable, low-cost decontamination protocol in compliance with regulatory standards to enable the safe reuse of N95 respirators. METHODS: We inoculated 4 common models of N95 respirators with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluated viral inactivation after disinfection for 60 minutes at 70°C and 0% relative humidity. Similarly, we evaluated thermal disinfection at 0% to 70% relative humidity for masks inoculated with Escherichia coli. We assessed masks subjected to multiple cycles of thermal disinfection for structural integrity using scanning electron microscopy and for protective functions using standards of the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance and respirator fit. RESULTS: A single heat treatment rendered SARS-CoV-2 undetectable in all mask samples. Compared with untreated inoculated control masks, E. coli cultures at 24 hours were virtually undetectable from masks treated at 70°C and 50% relative humidity (optical density at 600 nm wavelength, 0.02 ± 0.02 v. 2.77 ± 0.09, p < 0.001), but contamination persisted for masks treated at lower relative humidity. After 10 disinfection cycles, masks maintained fibre diameters similar to untreated masks and continued to meet standards for fit, filtration efficiency and breathing resistance. INTERPRETATION: Thermal disinfection successfully decontaminated N95 respirators without impairing structural integrity or function. This process could be used in hospitals and long-term care facilities with commonly available equipment to mitigate the depletion of N95 masks.","Daeschler, Simeon C; Manson, Niclas; Joachim, Kariym; Chin, Alex W H; Chan, Katelyn; Chen, Paul Z; Tajdaran, Kiana; Mirmoeini, Kaveh; Zhang, Jennifer J; Maynes, Jason T; Zhang, Libo; Science, Michelle; Darbandi, Ali; Stephens, Derek; Gu, Frank; Poon, Leo L M; Borschel, Gregory H",CMAJ,681,24

This paper reviews the origin and development of masks and expounds the internal structure and protective mechanism of masks. Masks are an important line of defense against respiratory infections and can reduce the risk of novel coronavirus infection. Masks can not only prevent the patient from spraying droplets, reduce the amount and speed of droplets, but also block the virus containing droplets nucleus, preventing the wearer from inhaling. There are many types of face masks on the market, and different types of face masks have different application ranges. Different types of face masks follow different standards. The author investigated the application scope and relevant standards of masks in various countries, sorted out the classification, standards and evaluation indicators, etc., in order to provide help for medical personnel and the public. Through analysis, the new surgical mask with high antibacterial, high viral resistance and comfortable wearing is an important development direction in the future.","Wang, H. T.; Pan, X.

We recently reported increased service use in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (19 March to 15 April 2020), and a small increase in anxiety symptoms. This follow-up paper examines trends in service use and symptoms, over 12 weeks from 19 March to 10 June 2020. Methods: Demographics, symptoms, and psychosocial stressors were compared for participants starting an online assessment over four time-periods: A baseline ""Comparison period"" prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1 to 28 September 2019), ""Weeks 1 - 4"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (19 March - 15 April 2020), ""Weeks 5 - 8"" (16 April - 13 May 2020) and ""Weeks 9 - 12"" (14 May - 10 June). Responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 and strategies used by participants to improve their mental wellbeing are also reported. Results: A total of 5,455 people started a mental health assessment with MindSpot from 19 March to 10 June 2020. The number of assessments per week rose steadily from 303 in week 1 to a peak of 578 in week 5. Symptoms of anxiety were highest in Weeks 1 - 4, declining steadily over subsequent weeks. Psychological distress and depression, as measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9 respectively, remained stable. Concern about COVID-19 was highest in the first week then steadily declined during the following weeks. The proportions of participants reporting changes to routine were consistent across the 12 weeks, and most participants reported adopting helpful strategies to improve their mental wellbeing. Conclusions: We observed an initial increase in service use, which reduced over the 12 weeks. The initial rise in anxiety symptoms returned to baseline. Reported concern about the effect of COVID-19 declined steadily over 12 weeks. Symptoms of psychological distress and depression measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9, and the proportion reporting suicidal thoughts and plans did not change, and to date we have not identified indications of a mental health crisis. However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the economy and large sections of society are yet to be fully realised, indicating the importance of ongoing monitoring and reporting of trends as indicators of the mental health of the nation.","Staples, Lauren; Nielssen, Olav; Kayrouz, Rony; Cross, Shane; Karin, Eyal; Ryan, Katie; Dear, Blake; Titov, Nickolai",Internet Interv,681,16

Unfortunately, it coincided with the major shrimp farming season in India which contributes 60% of the national annual shrimp production hence the impact was substantial. An on-line survey was carried out among the stakeholders of the shrimp farming sector to evaluate the prospective impact of COVID-19 related lockdown across the shrimp supply chain. The study estimated an economic loss of 1.50 billion USD to the shrimp aquaculture sector during the current year. It is expected that shrimp production and its export performance may be declining by 40% in the current season. The Garret ranking and Rank Based Quotient analyses projected severe constraints in shrimp seed production and supply, disruptions in the supply chain, logistics, farming, processing, marketing and loss of employment and income for the workers due to the pandemic. To mitigate the impact, the Government of India declared fisheries and aquaculture as an essential activity, facilitated the movement of inputs and services. Further, a major Fisheries Development Scheme(PMMSY) with a financial outlay of 267 million USD has been announced to usher in a blue revolution by strengthening the value chain, doubling the fisher/farmer income, employment generation, economic and social security for fishers/fish farmers adhering to the sustainability principles.

However, Africa, which represents 17 % of the world's population, is estimated to have only 5 % of global cases (source: WHO on 2020/08/04). In this work, the authors try to identify and understand the reasons for these epidemiological data. METHOD: Some follow-up indicators have been carried out, mainly through WHO reports. These data were compared with the literature and the field expertise of the association ""Biologie sans frontières"" in Africa. RESULTS: The following points mark the particularity of COVID-19 in Africa: (1) insufficient diagnostic capacity (linked to gross national product), (2) a younger population limiting the population at risk and the number of deaths, (3) a favourable climate (hot and humid) which is decreasing viral transmission, (4) some socio-cultural factors that can reduce cases reporting. CONCLUSION: Today, this health crisis is omnipresent while the number of deaths remains limited in Africa. Simultaneously, actions concerning African public health priorities (malaria, diarrhoea, AIDS ) are interrupted or slowed down.","Hardy, É J L; Flori, P",Ann. pharm. fr,681,33

This paper describes the incidence and factors associated with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study of public data analysing geopolitical and immigration activities that occurred between 02 April and 08 September 2020. The Chi-square test of independence was used to tabulate sex and age-related fatality ratios among deaths due to COVID-19-related complications. RESULTS: The drivers for COVID-19 spread were mass gatherings secondary to the country's political landscape and repatriation of citizens from high-risk areas coupled with minimum use of public health interventions. The prevalence was higher in people aged 50-59 years, males and in urban areas. Men had an increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths (Case Fatality Ratio: 1.58 (95% CI 1.11-2.22) compared with women. Furthermore, men and women aged &#8805;40 years were 16.1 times and 7.1 times more likely to die of COVID-related complications, respectively. Men aged &#8805;40 years had a 62% increased risk of deaths compared with women of the same age group. CONCLUSION: Mass political gatherings and cross-border immigration from high-risk areas were drivers for infection. Males, older age and urban residence were associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of COVID-19 there is a need to regulate mass gatherings and repatriation of citizens, and strengthen the use of preventive health interventions. Men, the older age groups and urban areas should be prioritised for COVID-19 prevention strategies.","Nyasulu, Juliet Charity Yauka; Munthali, Richard Junganiko; Nyondo-Mipando, Alinane Linda; Pandya, Himani; Nyirenda, Laywell; Nyasulu, Peter Suwirakwenda; Manda, Samuel",Int J Infect Dis,681,1

Compared with the situation where only local movement or individual-based linkage exists, the coexistence of them leads to a wider spread of infectious disease. The roles of narrowing segregated spatial domain and reducing mobility in epidemic control are checked, these two measures are found to be conducive to curbing the spread of infectious disease. Considering heterogeneous time scales between local movement and global interaction, a log-log relation between the change in the number of infected individuals and the timescale $\tau$ is found. A theoretical analysis indicates that the evolutionary dynamics in the present model is related to the encounter probability and the encounter time.

Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.","Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha; de Soysa, Indra",Scand J Public Health,681,1

Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. METHODS: Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. RESULTS: We found that the freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18 ~ 25 °C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37 °C and 56 °C, respectively. CONCLUSION: The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories.","Xu, Jiasu; Wang, Jin; Zhong, Zecheng; Su, Xiaosong; Yang, Kunyu; Chen, Zhongfu; Zhang, Dongxu; Li, Tingdong; Wang, Yingbin; Zhang, Shiyin; Ge, Shengxiang; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao",Clin Biochem,681,3

A subset was compared to immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) and micro-neutralisation. Sensitivity and specificity of the Roche (n = 1033), Abbott (n = 806), Diasorin (n = 1034) and Euroimmun (n = 175) were 93.7 %/99.5 %, 90.2 %/99.4 %, 88.6 %/98.6 % and 91.3 %/98.8 %, respectively. ROC analysis with specificity held at 99 % increased the sensitivity for the Roche and Abbott assays from 93.7% to 98.7% (cut-off 0.21) and 90.2 % to 94.0 % (cut-off 0.91), respectively. Overall seropositivity of samples increased from a maximum of 23 % for samples 0-7 days-post-onset of symptoms (dpos), to 61 % from samples 8-14dpos and 93 % from those >14dpos.

Literature is beginning to suggest that these behaviours may be conducted automatically, although the instigation (deciding to do) and execution ('doing') of these behaviours has never been examined separately. The objective of this study was to test a theoretically informed supposition that oral hygiene behaviours in adults are automatic behaviours. METHODS: One hundred and fifty participants attending three types of dental providers covering emergency and routine dental services, completed a questionnaire. The self-reported behavioural automaticity index scale (SRBAI) was used to measure behavioural automaticity. RESULTS: Morning toothbrushing SRBAI scores were higher than evening scores (Z=-3.315, p = 0.001). Automaticity scores for instigating both toothbrushing and interdental cleaning were also higher compared to execution (toothbrushing: Z=-2.601, p = 0.009 and interdental cleaning: Z=-2.256. p = 0.024). Toothbrushing automaticity scores were associated with age, gender and self-efficacy, whereas interdental cleaning automaticity scores were associated with intention. Individuals in lower socio-economic status (SES) occupations had significantly higher automaticity scores for interdental cleaning compared to those with higher SES roles. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of people undertake toothbrushing and interdental cleaning automatically, especially in relation to embarking on these behaviours. This is most pronounced in morning toothbrushing.","Raison, M H; Corcoran, R; Burnside, G; Harris, R V",J Dent,681,24

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. RESULTS: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","Altmann, Samuel; Milsom, Luke; Zillessen, Hannah; Blasone, Raffaele; Gerdon, Frederic; Bach, Ruben; Kreuter, Frauke; Nosenzo, Daniele; Toussaert, Séverine; Abeler, Johannes",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,681,16

Although extremely useful in many tasks, most models have performed poorly in forecasting the pandemic peaks. We investigate this common pitfall by forecasting four countries' pandemic peak: Austria, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. Far from the peaks, our models can forecast the pandemic dynamics 20 days ahead. Nevertheless, when calibrating our models close to the day of the pandemic peak, all forecasts fail. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis revealed the main obstacle: the misestimation of the transmission rate. Inverse uncertainty quantification has shown that significant changes in transmission rate commonly precede a peak. These changes are a key factor in forecasting the pandemic peak. Long forecasts of the pandemic peak are therefore undermined by the lack of models that can forecast changes in the transmission rate, i.e., how a particular society behaves, changes of mitigation policies, or how society chooses to respond to them. In addition, our studies revealed that even short forecasts of the pandemic peak are challenging. Backward projections have shown us that the correct estimation of any temporal change in the transmission rate is only possible many days ahead. Our results suggest that the distance between a change in the transmission rate and its correct identification in the curve of active infected cases can be as long as 15 days. This is intrinsic to the phenomenon and how it affects epidemic data: a new case is usually only reported after an incubation period followed by a delay associated with the test. In summary, our results suggest the phenomenon itself challenges the task of forecasting the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when only epidemic data is available. Nevertheless, we show that exciting results can be obtained when using the same models to project different scenarios of reduced transmission rates. Therefore, our results highlight that mathematical modeling can help control COVID-19 pandemic by backward projections that characterize the phenomena' essential features and forward projections when different scenarios and strategies can be tested and used for decision-making.","Reis, Ruy Freitas; Oliveira, Rafael Sachetto; Quintela, Bárbara de Melo; Campos, Joventino de Oliveira; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; Dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber",Front Public Health,681,16

While the implementation of these new curricula has been described, an understanding of the impact on student learning outcomes is lacking. In 2020, the authors followed Kern's 6-step approach to curricular development to create and evaluate a novel COVID-19 curriculum for medical students at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and evaluate its learning outcomes. The primary goal of the curriculum was to provide third- and fourth-year medical students an opportunity for workplace learning in the absence of clinical clerkships, specifically for students to develop clerkship-level milestones in the competency domains of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and systems-based practice. The curriculum was designed to match students with faculty-mentored projects occurring primarily in virtual formats. A total of 126 students enrolled in the curriculum and completed a survey about their learning outcomes (100% response rate). Of 35 possible clerkship-level milestones, there were 12 milestones for which over half of students reported development, in competency domains including practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills. Thematic analysis of students' qualitative survey responses demonstrated 2 central motivations for participating in the curriculum: identity as physicians-in-training, and patient engagement. Six central learning areas were developed during the curriculum: interprofessional teamwork, community resources, technology in medicine, skill-building, quality improvement, and specialty-specific learning. This analysis demonstrates that students can develop competencies and achieve rich workplace learning through project-based experiential learning, even in virtual clinical workplaces. Furthermore, knowledge of community resources, technology in medicine, and quality improvement were developed through the curriculum more readily than in traditional clerkships, and could be considered as integral learning objectives in future curricular design.","Castro, Maria R H; Calthorpe, Lucia M; Fogh, Shannon E; McAllister, Sophie; Johnson, Christopher L; Isaacs, Eric D; Ishizaki, Allison; Kozas, Anna; Lo, Daphne; Rennke, Stephanie; Davis, John; Chang, Anna",Acad. med,681,16

Most regimens utilize rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which may affect the clinical course of novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. Here we describe the first case of mild COVID-19 during ongoing oncological treatment without significant deterioration after rituximab administration. CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female with an enlargement of her right palatine tonsil was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma following tonsillectomy and started immunochemotherapy according to the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone regimen. At home before the fourth cycle, she developed nonspecific symptoms (excessive fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea), misdiagnosed as adverse effects of chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, performed shortly before rituximab administration, revealed previously nonexistent pulmonary changes, potentially of infectious etiology. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab (with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) performed the following day. Despite rituximab infusion, the patient remained oligosymptomatic and was discharged home for self-isolation. Having reached a negative SARS-CoV-2 status before the subsequently scheduled regimen, the patient successfully received six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and obtained complete remission by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. CONCLUSION Our case shows that rituximab-based immunotherapy due to follicular lymphoma may have no evident negative effect on the COVID-19 clinical course. ©The Author(s) 2021.

The aim of this review is to show the possible associations between COVID-19 and heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). RECENT FINDINGS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of HFpEF is high, ranging from 4 to 16%, probably due to the shared cardio-metabolic risk profile. Indeed, comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease - known predictors of a severe course of COVID-19 - are major causes of HFpEF, too. COVID-19 may represent a precipitating factor leading to acute decompensation of HF in patients with known HFpEF and in those with subclinical diastolic dysfunction, which becomes overt. COVID-19 may also directly or indirectly affect the heart. In otherwise healthy patients, echocardiographic studies showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients present diastolic (rather than systolic) impairment, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. Such abnormalities are observed both in the acute or subacute phase of COVID-19. Cardiac magnetic resonance reveals myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in up to the 78% of patients in the chronic phase of the disease. These findings suggest that COVID-19 might be a novel independent risk factor for the development of HFpEF, through the activation of a systemic pro-inflammatory state. Follow-up studies are urgently needed to better understand long-term sequelae of COVID-19 inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","Zaccone, Gregorio; Tomasoni, Daniela; Italia, Leonardo; Lombardi, Carlo Mario; Metra, Marco",Curr Heart Fail Rep,681,1

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

Objective: To evaluate early surgical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in different subspecialties. Design, Setting, and Participants: This matched cohort study conducted in the general, vascular and thoracic surgery, orthopedic, and neurosurgery units of Spedali Civili Hospital (Brescia, Italy) included patients who underwent surgical treatment from February 23 to April 1, 2020, and had positive test results for COVID-19 either before or within 1 week after surgery. Gynecological and minor surgical procedures were excluded. Patients with COVID-19 were matched with patients without COVID-19 with a 1:2 ratio for sex, age group, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and comorbidities recorded in the surgical risk calculator of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients older than 65 years were also matched for the Clinical Frailty Scale score. Exposures: Patients with positive results for COVID-19 and undergoing surgery vs matched surgical patients without infection. Screening for COVID-19 was performed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in nasopharyngeal swabs, chest radiography, and/or computed tomography. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positivity of at least 1 of these investigations. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was early surgical mortality and complications in patients with COVID-19; secondary end points were the modeling of complications to determine the importance of COVID-19 compared with other surgical risk factors. Results: Of 41 patients (of 333 who underwent operation during the same period) who underwent mainly urgent surgery, 33 (80.5%) had positive results for COVID-19 preoperatively and 8 (19.5%) had positive results within 5 days from surgery. Of the 123 patients of the combined cohorts (78 women [63.4%]; mean [SD] age, 76.6 [14.4] years), 30-day mortality was significantly higher for those with COVID-19 compared with control patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 9.5; 95% CI, 1.77-96.53). Complications were also significantly higher (OR, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.81-16.07); pulmonary complications were the most common (OR, 35.62; 95% CI, 9.34-205.55), but thrombotic complications were also significantly associated with COVID-19 (OR, 13.2; 95% CI, 1.48-&#8734;). Different models (cumulative link model and classification tree) identified COVID-19 as the main variable associated with complications. Conclusions and Relevance: In this matched cohort study, surgical mortality and complications were higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19. These data suggest that, whenever possible, surgery should be postponed in patients with COVID-19.","Doglietto, Francesco; Vezzoli, Marika; Gheza, Federico; Lussardi, Gian Luca; Domenicucci, Marco; Vecchiarelli, Luca; Zanin, Luca; Saraceno, Giorgio; Signorini, Liana; Panciani, Pier Paolo; Castelli, Francesco; Maroldi, Roberto; Rasulo, Francesco Antonio; Benvenuti, Mauro Roberto; Portolani, Nazario; Bonardelli, Stefano; Milano, Giuseppe; Casiraghi, Alessandro; Calza, Stefano; Fontanella, Marco Maria",JAMA surg.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between September 2012 and January 2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders. RESULTS: Of 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-&#945;2a, rIFN-&#945;2b, or rIFN-ß1a; none received rIFN-ß1b). RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .73-1.44]; P = .87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .30-1.44]; P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-&#945;2a, rIFN-&#945;2b, or rIFN-ß1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Shalhoub, Sarah; Mandourah, Yasser; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Al-Omari, Awad; Al Qasim, Eman; Jose, Jesna; Alraddadi, Basem; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Sindi, Anees A; Mady, Ahmed; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Maghrabi, Khalid; Ragab, Ahmed; Al Mekhlafi, Ghaleb A; Balkhy, Hanan H; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Kharaba, Ayman; Gramish, Jawaher A; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Merson, Laura; Hayden, Frederick G; Fowler, Robert",Clin Infect Dis,681,33

We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 69 793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until 8 April 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users, and 1577 patients were nonusers. In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (Pâ <â .001). However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; Pâ =â .60). No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.

The objective of this review was to discuss topical preparations that could be utilized preoperatively to help to decrease viral load and potentially reduce the risks of viral transmission. METHODS: A PubMed/MEDLINE database review of articles was performed querying topical preparations with virucidal activity against coronaviruses. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solutions ranging from 0.23% to 7% have been found to demonstrate highly effective virucidal activity against a broad range of viruses including several coronaviruses responsible for recent epidemics including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: While specific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 is lacking, PVP-I-based preparations have been successfully demonstrated to reduce viral loads of coronaviruses. They are relatively safe to use in the upper airway and may reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization during upper airway mucosal surgery.","Parhar, Harman S; Tasche, Kendall; Brody, Robert M; Weinstein, Gregory S; O039,; Malley, Bert W; Shanti, Rabie M; Newman, Jason G",Head Neck,681,1

To schematize the current SARS-CoV-2 migration scenario between and within the three countries chosen, using the multitype bearth-death model implemented in BEAST2. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rate of evolution of 2.11 × 10-3 per sites per year (95% highest posterior density: 1.56 × 10-3 to 3.89 × 10-3 ), and a geographic origin in Shanghai, where time until the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) emerged, according to the analysis of the molecular clock, around 13 November 2019. While for Italy and Spain, there are two tMRCA for each country, which agree with the assumption of several introductions for these countries. That explains also this very short period of subepidermal circulation before the recent events. A total of 8 (median) migration events occurred during this short period, the largest proportion of which (6 events [75%]) occurred from Shanghai (China) to Spain and from Italy to Spain. Such events are marked by speeds of migration that are comparatively lower as compared with that from Shanghai to Italy. Shanghai's R0 and Italy's are closer to each other, though Spain's is slightly higher. All these results allow us to conclude the need for an automatic system of mixed, molecular and classical epidemiological surveillance, which could play a role in this global surveillance of public health and decision-making.","Nabil, Benazi; Sabrina, Bounab; Abdelhakim, Bounab",J Med Virol,681,16

380149,380149,380149,Machine Learning Algorithms for Forecasting COVID 19 Confirmed Cases in America,13.9108715,1.4765929,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand had almost depleted its critical care resources, particularly intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. This prompted the necessity to develop a national guideline for resource allocation. This paper describes the development process of a national guideline for critical resource allocation in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The guideline development process consisted of three steps: (1) rapid review of existing rationing guidelines and literature; (2) interviews of Thai clinicians experienced in caring for COVID-19 cases; and (3) multi-stakeholder consultations. At steps 1 and 2, data was synthesized and categorized using a thematic and content analysis approach, and this guided the formulation of the draft guideline. Within step 3, the draft Thai critical care allocation guideline was debated and finalized before entering the policy-decision stage. RESULTS: Three-order prioritization criteria consisting of (1) clinical prognosis using four tools (Charlson Comorbidity Index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, frailty assessment and cognitive impairment assessment), (2) number of life-years saved and (3) social usefulness were proposed by the research team based on literature reviews and interviews. At consultations, stakeholders rejected using life-years as a criterion due to potential age and gender discrimination, as well as social utility due to a concern it would foster public distrust, as this judgement can be arbitrary. It was agreed that the attending physician is required to be the decision-maker in the Thai medico-legal context, while a patient review committee would play an advisory role. Allocation decisions are to be documented for transparency, and no appealing mechanism is to be applied. This guideline will be triggered only when demand exceeds supply after the utmost efforts to mobilize surge capacity. Once implemented, it is applicable to all patients, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, requiring critical care resources prior to ICU admission and during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The guideline development process for the allocation of critical care resources in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand was informed by scientific evidence, medico-legal context, existing norms and societal values to reduce risk of public distrust given the sensitive nature of the issue and ethical dilemmas of the guiding principle, though it was conducted at record speed. Our lessons can provide an insight for the development of similar prioritization guidelines, especially in other low- and middle-income countries.","Marshall, Aniqa Islam; Archer, Rachel; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan; Sirison, Kanchanok; Chotchoungchatchai, Somtanuek; Sriakkpokin, Pisit; Srisookwatana, Orapan; Teerawattananon, Yot; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",Health Res Policy Syst,681,5

This qualitative study focuses on women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. METHOD: A purposive sample of fifteen women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV participated in the study. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews that were subjected to qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: One theme was identified, stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength, and three categories are as follows: managing a restricted everyday life as an expert of their illness, being afraid of contracting infections leading to suffocation and suffering and importance of continuous help and support from significant others and digital media. Breathlessness restricted women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living with a body they have to wait for. Managing everyday life was adapted to their limited abilities and energy. This required detailed planning, good knowledge of their breathing and body. Women were afraid of contracting life-threatening infections that caused suffering, especially COVID-19. The fear leads to isolation and digital media was described as an important means of communication. Significant others gave support and help that was practical and emotional. Women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced lack of continuous help and support from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength required women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV to conduct detailed planning to manage everyday life. Being afraid of contracting infections and the consequences of suffocation had increased since the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, which led to self-isolation and an inactive everyday life.

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,681,30

Our study is to determine the impact of mental and psychological symptoms among population in quarantine for 2 weeks during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A case-controlled study design have conducted at department of psychiatry of Shenzhen Longgang Center for Chronic Disease Control in Shenzhen, China mainland from 7th April to 15th June 2020.1674 participants (aged 18 to 65 years) in quarantine for 2 weeks and 1743 age-sex matched controls living in Shenzhen were recruited between 7th April 2020 and 15th June 2020. The assessment of depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms were determined by self-reported questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1674 participants in quarantine for 2 weeks and 1743 age-sex matched controls (32.6 ± 9.3 years vs. 32.7 ± 10.7 years, 49.8% vs. 47.8% females) were recruited. Population in quarantine had higher score on PHQ-9 (6.1 ± 5.5 vs. 3.0 ± 3.7, p < 0.001), GAD-7 (4.2 ± 4.7 vs. 1.9 ± 3.7, p < 0·001), and ISI (5.5 ± 5.8 vs. 3.1 ± 5.0%, p < 0.001) compared to general population. Population in quarantine showed significantly higher risks of depression (OR: 4.55, 95% CI: 3.82-5.41), anxiety (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.43-3.51), and insomnia (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 2.02-2.89), when compared to the general population. Younger, more education, non-married and lower household income showed higher risks of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Population in quarantine had a higher level of depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms than controls. Specifically, they were at a higher risk prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, especially the severity of depression, when compared to controls. Younger, more education, non-married, and lower income population in quarantine were at higher risks of mental health problems. Mental health professionals should pay attention to the mental and psychological symptoms for population in quarantine.","Wang, Chengmin; Song, Weidong; Hu, Xiaohui; Yan, Shaoguang; Zhang, Xing; Wang, Xunqiang; Chen, Wenli",BMC Psychiatry,681,7

Yet, with the current scientific consensus being in overwhelming agreement over the safety and efficacy of vaccines, many scientists lose their grasp on the fears, concerns, and arguments that the opposition may hold. This paper discusses and evaluates vaccine-hesitant individuals on a socioeconomic, historical, and philosophical landscape. It also provides an analysis of common argumentative patterns and the psychological impact that these arguments may have on undecided individuals. The discussion also explores why anti-vaccine sentiments are on the rise, and how members of the scientific and medical community require a more structured approach to communicating key arguments. This is particularly important if vaccination rates and herd immunity are to be sustained. No longer is it sufficient to win arguments based on a factual and scientific basis, but rather scientists and medical practitioners have to focus on conveying confidence and reassurance on both an informative and emotional level to those with doubts and fears.","Stolle, Lucas B; Nalamasu, Rohit; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Varrassi, Giustino; Magnusson, Peter; LeQuang, JoAnn; Breve, Frank",Adv Ther,681,4

Yet little attention has been paid to measurement validity and demographic bias, due in part to the lack of documentation about which users are represented as well as the challenge of obtaining ground truth data on unique visits and demographics. We illustrate how linking large-scale administrative data can enable auditing mobility data for bias in the absence of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show that linking voter roll data---containing individual-level voter turnout for specific voting locations along with race and age---can facilitate the construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. These tests illuminate a sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older and non-white voters are less likely to be captured by mobility data. We show that allocating public health resources based on such mobility data could disproportionately harm high-risk elderly and minority groups.","Coston, Amanda; Guha, Neel; Ouyang, Derek; Lu, Lisa; Chouldechova, Alexandra; Ho, Daniel E.",,681,20

Viral clearance is the most important laboratory test for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To better understand which underlying diseases that are risk factors for delaying the viral clearance, we retrospectively analyzed 161 COVID-19 clinical cases in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 13, 2020. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records were collected. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore the association between delayed viral clearance and other factors by using logistic regression. Survival analyses by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling were employed to identify factors negatively influencing the viral clearance negatively. We found that hypertension and intravenous immunoglobulin adversely affected the time of viral RNA shedding. Hypertension was the most important risk factor to delay the SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance, however, the use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors(ACEI)/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers(ARB) did not shorten the time for virus clearance in these hypertensive patients' virus clearance. We conclude that patients having hypertension and intravenous immunoglobulin may delay the viral clearance in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Xiaoping; Hu Mt, Wenjia; Yang, Miao; Ling, Jiaxin; Zhang, Yongxi; Deng, Liping; Li, Jinlin; Lundkvist, Åke; Lindahl, Johanna F; Xiong, Yong",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),681,6

The corollary of the content alignment within and between news sources experienced by readers (i.e., all news transformed into Corona-news), was that the novelty of news content went down as media focused monotonically on the pandemic event. This all-important Covid-19 news theme turned out to be quite persistent as the pandemic continued, resulting in the, from a news media's perspective, paradoxical situation where the same news was repeated over and over. This information phenomenon, where novelty decreases and persistence increases, has previously been used to track change in news media, but in this study we specifically test the claim that new information decoupling behavior of media can be used to reliably detect change in news media content originating in a negative event, using a Bayesian approach to change point detection.","Nielbo, Kristoffer L.; Haestrup, Frida; Enevoldsen, Kenneth C.; Vahlstrup, Peter B.; Baglini, Rebekah B.; Roepstorff, Andreas",,681,1

METHODS: Patients presenting to a Dutch teaching hospital were eligible between 17 March and 10 April 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The performances of six different LFAs were evaluated in plasma samples obtained on corresponding respiratory sample dates of NATs testing. Subsequently, the best performing LFA was evaluated in 228 patients and in 50 sera of a historical patient control group. RESULTS: In the pilot analysis, sensitivity characteristics of LFA were heterogeneous, ranging from 2/20 (10%; 95% CI 0%-23%) to 11/20 (55%; 95% CI 33%-77%). In the total cohort, Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test LFA had a sensitivity of 43/99 (43%; 95% CI 34%-53%) and specificity of 126/129 (98%; 95% CI 95%-100%). Sensitivity increased to 31/52 (60%; 95% CI 46%-73%) in patients with at least 7 days of symptoms, and to 21/33 (64%; 95% CI 47%-80%) in patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) &#8805;100 mg/L.

CONCLUSIONS: There is large variability in diagnostic test performance between rapid LFAs, but overall limited sensitivity and high specificity in acutely admitted patients. Sensitivity improved in patients with longer existing symptoms or high CRP.

As knowledge about COVID-19 rapidly evolves, global implementation of containment and mitigation measures has varied greatly, with impacts to mental wellness. Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health needs of health care workers and other workers may help mitigate mental health impacts and secure sustained delivery of health care and other essential goods and services. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in health care workers and other workers seeking support through Text4Hope, an evidence-based SMS text messaging service supporting the mental health of residents of Alberta, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey gathered demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, education, relationship, housing and employment status, employment type, and isolation status) and clinical characteristics using validated tools (self-reported stress, anxiety, depression, and contamination/hand hygiene obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were used to compare the clinical characteristics of health care workers and other workers. Post hoc analysis was conducted on variables with >3 response categories using adjusted residuals. Logistic regression determined associations between worker type and likelihood of self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder, while controlling for other variables. RESULTS: Overall, 8267 surveys were submitted by 44,992 Text4Hope subscribers (19.39%). Of these, 5990 respondents were employed (72.5%), 958 (11.6%) were unemployed, 454 (5.5%) were students, 559 (6.8%) were retired, 234 (2.8%) selected ""other,"" and 72 (0.9%) did not indicate their employment status. Most employed survey respondents were female (n=4621, 86.2%). In the general sample, the 6-week prevalence rates for moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 85.6%, 47.0%, and 44.0%, respectively. Self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression were all statistically significantly higher in other workers than in health care workers (P<.001). Other workers reported higher obsessive-compulsive symptoms (worry about contamination and compulsive handwashing behavior) after the onset of the pandemic (P<.001), while health care worker symptoms were statistically significantly higher before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<.001). This finding should be interpreted with caution, as it is unclear the extent to which the adaptive behavior of health care workers or the other workers might be misclassified by validated tools during a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing symptoms of prevalent stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior in health care workers and other workers may enhance our understanding of COVID-19 mental health needs. Research is needed to understand more fully the relationship between worker type, outbreak phase, and mental health changes over time, as well as the utility of validated tools in health care workers and other workers during pandemics. Our findings underscore the importance of anticipating and mitigating the mental health effects of pandemics using integrated implementation strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the ease of safely and rapidly assessing mental health needs using an SMS text messaging platform during a pandemic.

RESULTS: About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19. The psychological impact of stressful events was related to worrying about their physical health, having close COVID-19 infected acquaintances and family relationship issues. Therefore, the psychological supprot for medical staff fighting in the COVID-19 pandemic may be needed.","Dong, Zai-Quan; Ma, Jing; Hao, Yan-Ni; Shen, Xiao-Ling; Liu, Fang; Gao, Yuan; Zhang, Lan",Eur Psychiatry,681,1

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital. RESULTS: All 13 children had the disease onset due to family aggregation. Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting. As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type. The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children. All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6. The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result. Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children. All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis. Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.","Tan, Xin; Huang, Juan; Zhao, Fen; Zhou, Yan; Li, Jie-Qiong; Wang, Xiang-Yun",Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,681,16

An extensive analysis of human miRNA binding sites on the viral genome led to the identification of miR-1207-5p as potential regulator of the viral Spike protein. It is known that exogenous RNA can compete for miRNA targets of endogenous mRNAs leading to their overexpression. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus can act as an exogenous competing RNA, facilitating the over-expression of its endogenous targets. Transcriptomic analysis of human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells confirmed that the CSF1 gene, a known target of miR-1207-5p, is over-expressed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. CSF1 enhances macrophage recruitment and activation and its overexpression may contribute to the acute inflammatory response observed in severe COVID-19. In summary, our results indicate that dysregulation of miR-1207-5p-target genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to uncontrolled inflammation in most severe COVID-19 cases.","Bertolazzi, Giorgio; Cipollina, Chiara; Benos, Panayiotis V; Tumminello, Michele; Coronnello, Claudia",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,681,21

DESIGN & SETTINGS: The category, period, and regions selected in the Google Trends were ""health,"" ""15 January-15 May 2020,"" in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Italy, and France, respectively. The most commonly searched herbs, foods and supplements (n = 32) during the pandemic were determined from a pool of keywords (n = 1286) based on the terms' relative search volumes (RSVs) within the last five years. Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate associations between coronavirus-related parameters with each keyword's RSV for each country. Selected keywords (n = 25) were analyzed using the gtrendsR package in the R programming language; the ggplot2 package was used to visualize the data, the Prophet package was used to estimate the time series, and the dplyr package was used to create the data frame. RESULTS: Significantly strong positive correlations were identified between daily RSVs of the terms ""black seed,"" ""vitamin C,"" ""zinc,"" and ""quercetin,"" and search queries for ""coronavirus"" and ""COVID-19"" in the USA (Spearman's correlation coefficient > 0.8, p < 0.05), and between the RSVs of the terms ""vitamin C"" and ""zinc,"" and daily search queries for ""coronavirus"" and/or ""COVID-19"" in the UK (Spearman's correlation coefficient > 0.8, p < 0.05).

To address this, we developed an in vitro infection model for two human coronaviruses; alphacoronavirus 229E-CoV (229E) and betacoronavirus OC43-CoV (OC43) in differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs). Primary BECs from healthy subjects were grown at air-liquid interface (ALI) and infected with 229E or OC43, and replication kinetics and time-course expression of innate immune mediators were assessed. OC43 and 229E-CoVs replicated in differentiated pBECs but displayed distinct replication kinetics: 229E replicated rapidly with viral load peaking at 24 h postinfection, while OC43 replication was slower peaking at 96 h after infection. This was associated with diverse antiviral response profiles defined by increased expression of type I/III interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by 229E compared with no innate immune activation with OC43 infection. Understanding the host-virus interaction for previously established coronaviruses will give insight into pathogenic mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory disease and other future coronaviruses that may arise from zoonotic sources.","Loo, Su-Ling; Wark, Peter A B; Esneau, Camille; Nichol, Kristy S; Hsu, Alan C-Y; Bartlett, Nathan W",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,681,24

The significant value of community pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. OBJECTIVE: The assessment of community pharmacies preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview survey of 1018 community pharmacies working in four regions of Egypt (South, East, Centre, and North). Data collection was conducted from 8-19 April 2020. RESULTS: Availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medication was better than alcohol (70% conc.). Home delivery services were available in 49.1% of pharmacies. Infection control measures covering interactions between staff were in place in up to 99.5% of pharmacies. Conversely, there was less frequent availability of contactless payment (29.1%), hand sanitizers (62.1%) or masks (86.5%) for customer use, or a separate area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (64%). Verbal customer education (90.4%) was used preferably to written (81.3%). Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%-99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P < 0.001; pandemic training p < 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Government and policymakers strive to mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication. More attention should be given to infection control measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are fit and able to provide continuity in their important role. Educating customers using regularly-updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy. Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures. By avoiding under-reporting or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national spread of infection.","Bahlol, Mohamed; Dewey, Rebecca Susan",Res. soc. adm. pharm,681,19

and brings great pressure to medical systems The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and fatigue, which may lead to a fatal complication: acute respiratory distress syndrome The main challenge in inhibiting the spread of this disease is the lack of efficient detection methods Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for confirming COVID-19, it takes 4-6 h to obtain the results, and the false-negative rate of RT-PCR detection is as high as 17%-25 5% Therefore, multiple RT-PCR detections at intervals of several days must be performed to confirm the diagnostic result In addition, RT-PCR reagents are lacking in many severe epidemic areas By contrast, X-ray and CT(computed tomography) examination equipment have been widely popularized in hospitals In clinical practice, by combining clinical symptoms and travel history, CT is an efficient and safe method to diagnose COVID-19 Compared with CT, X-ray examination has faster scanning speed and lower radiation amount Moreover, X-ray and CT images are important tools for doctors to track and observe the condition and evaluate the efficacy In summary, medical imaging plays a vital role in limiting the spread of viruses and treating COVID-19 During the outbreak of the epidemic, medical imaging-based AI-assisted diagnostic technology has become a popular research direction Computer-aided diagnostic technology improves the sensitivity and specificity of doctors' diagnosis and is accurate and efficient, which helps rapid diagnosis of a large number of suspicious cases For example, the out preformed AI-assisted diagnosis system can achieve an accuracy rate comparable to that of radiologists, and it take less than 1 second to perform a diagnosis The system has been used in 16 hospitals, with more than 1 300 diagnoses performed daily This article reviews the latest research works on AI-assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 and analyzes and summarizes them on the basis of four aspects: data preparation, image segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis First, this article organizes some public data sets to support the AI-assisted diagnostic technology of COVID-19 and provides several solutions to insufficient datasets, such as the human-in-the-loop strategy, which improves the efficiency of data set production Using transfer learning, weakly supervised or unsupervised learning can reduce model's dependence on the COVID-19 dataset Second, the semantic segmentation network is also an indispensable part of the intelligent diagnosis of COVID-19 Segmenting the lung region from the original image is a key pre-processing step, which can reduce the calculation amount of subsequent algorithms The lesion area helps the doctor to track the condition of the disease, and the infection rate can be calculated according to the size of the infected area U-Net, U-Net++, and attention U-Net are suitable for the segmentation of medical images because of the small number of parameters, which is not easy to overfit Furthermore, training the semantic segmentation network with the idea of the generative adversarial network (GAN) can improve the Dice coefficient Third, this article introduces the AI diagnostic system from two aspects of CT images and X-rays Comparing different diagnostic schemes, the method of diagnosis based on the segmentation images is better than that based on the original images Among the classification networks, ResNet and VGG19(visual geometry group 19-layer net) perform better Methods such as GAN, location attention mechanisms, transfer learning, and combining 2D and 3D features can be used to improve accuracy In addition, clinical information (travel and contact history, white blood cell count, fever, cough, sputum, patient age, and patient gender) c n be used as a basis for diagnosis For example, algorithm D_FF_Conic uses clinical information as a diagnostic basis and has reached an accuracy rate of 90% Clinicians will consider medical imaging and clinical information in the process of diagnosis, but the current AI diagnostic system cannot integrate multiple types of data for diagnosis Although some algorithms can fuse the diagnostic results of medical images with the diagnostic results of clinical information, the simple fine-tuned algorithm haven't learned the deep internal connection between different types of data Fourth, AI technology can also predict high-risk patients on the basis of infection rates and clinical information Some research predicted the survival rate of COVID-19 patients on the basis of age, syndrome, and infection rate Such algorithms can help doctors find and treat high-risk patients early, thereby reducing mortality, which is of great significance This article shows the latest progress of COVID-19's medical imaging-based AI diagnosis Although some AI-assisted diagnostic systems have been deployed in hospitals to play a practical role, these algorithms still have some problems, such as insufficient training data, a single diagnostic basis, and the ability to distinguish between non-COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19 © 2020, Editorial and

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter study involving 13 intensive cardiac care units, to evaluate consecutive STEMI patients admitted throughout an 8-week period during the Covid-19 outbreak. These patients were compared with consecutive STEMI patients admitted during the corresponding period in 2018 who had been prospectively documented in the Israeli bi-annual National Acute Coronary Syndrome Survey. The primary end-point was defined as a composite of malignant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and/or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included individual components of primary outcome, cardiogenic shock, mechanical complications, electrical complications, re-infarction, stroke, and pericarditis. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 1466 consecutive acute MI patients, of whom 774 (53%) were hospitalized during the Covid-19 outbreak. Overall, 841 patients were diagnosed with STEMI: 424 (50.4%) during the Covid-19 era and 417 (49.6%) during the parallel period in 2018. Although STEMI patients admitted during the Covid-19 period had fewer co-morbidities, they presented with a higher Killip class (p value = .03). The median time from symptom onset to reperfusion was extended from 180 minutes (IQR 122-292) in 2018 to 290 minutes (IQR 161-1080, p < .001) in 2020. Hospitalization during the Covid-19 era was independently associated with an increased risk of the combined endpoint in the multivariable regression model (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.68, p value = .04). Furthermore, the rate of mechanical complications was four times higher during the Covid-19 era (95% CI 1.42-14.8, p-value = .02). However, in-hospital mortality remained unchanged (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.81-3.78, p-value = .16). CONCLUSIONS: STEMI patients admitted during the first wave of Covid-19 outbreak, experienced longer total ischemic time, which was translated into a more severe disease status upon hospital admission, and a higher rate of in-hospital adverse events, compared with parallel period.","Fardman, Alexander; Zahger, Doron; Orvin, Katia; Oren, Daniel; Kofman, Natalia; Mohsen, Jameel; Tsafrir, Or; Asher, Elad; Rubinshtein, Ronen; Jamal, Jafari; Efraim, Roi; Halabi, Majdi; Shacham, Yacov; Fortis, Lior Henri; Cohen, Tal; Klempfner, Robert; Segev, Amit; Beigel, Roy; Matetzky, Shlomi",PLoS One,681,33

Coagulopathy is reflective of more severe disease and anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalized patients. However, the prevalence of thrombosis on the intensive care unit (ICU) remains unclear, including whether this is sufficiently addressed by conventional anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We aimed to identify the rate of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19, to inform recommendations for diagnosis and management. A systematic review was conducted to assess the incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients with COVID-19. Observational studies and registries reporting thrombotic complications in ICU-treated patients were included. Information extracted included patient demographics, use of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation, method of identifying thrombotic complications, and reported patient outcomes. In 28 studies including 2928 patients, thrombotic complications occurred in 34% of ICU-managed patients, with deep venous thrombosis reported in 16.1% and pulmonary embolism in 12.6% of patients, despite anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, and were associated with high mortality. Studies adopting systematic screening for venous thrombosis with Duplex ultrasound reported a significantly higher incidence of venous thrombosis compared to those relying on clinical suspicion (56.3% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). Despite thromboprophylaxis, there is a very high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 on the ICU. Systematic screening identifies many thrombotic complications that would be missed by relying on clinical suspicion and should be employed, with consideration given to increased dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, whilst awaiting results of prospective trials of anticoagulation in this cohort.","Jenner, William J; Kanji, Rahim; Mirsadraee, Saeed; Gue, Ying X; Price, Susanna; Prasad, Sanjay; Gorog, Diana A",J Thromb Thrombolysis,681,25

Smaller hospitals may have limited supply of blood, and air medical systems may not carry blood. The primary outcome is to quantify the number of patients meeting established physiologic criteria for blood product administration and to identify which patients receive and which ones do not receive it due to lack of availability locally. METHODS: Electronic patient care records were used to identify a retrospective cohort of patients undergoing emergent air medical transport in Ontario, Canada, who are likely to require blood. Presenting problems for blood product administration were identified. Physiologic data were extracted with criteria for transfusion used to identify patients where blood product administration is indicated. RESULTS: There were 11,520 emergent patient transports during the study period, with 842 (7.3%) where blood product administration was considered. Of these, 290 met established physiologic criteria for blood products, with 167 receiving blood, of which 57 received it at a hospital with a limited supply. The mean number of units administered per patient was 3.5. The remaining 123 patients meeting criteria did not receive product because none was unavailable. CONCLUSION: Indications for blood product administration are present in 2.5% of patients undergoing time-sensitive air medical transport. Air medical services can enhance access to potentially lifesaving therapy in patients with hemorrhagic shock by carrying blood products, as blood may be unavailable or in limited supply locally in the majority of patients where it is indicated.","MacDonald, Russell D; Ramjaun, Aliya",CJEM,681,16

We report the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, KCONVAC, in healthy adults. METHODS: Phase 1 and phase 2 randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials of KCONVAC were conducted in healthy Chinese adults aged 18 to 59 years. The participants in the phase 1 trial were randomized to receive two doses, one each on Days 0 and 14, of either KCONVAC (5 or 10 µg/dose) or placebo. The participants in the phase 2 trial were randomized to receive either KCONVAC (at 5 or 10 µg/dose) or placebo on Days 0 and 14 (0/14 regimen) or Days 0 and 28 (0/28 regimen). In the phase 1 trial, the primary safety endpoint was the proportion of participants experiencing adverse reactions/events within 28 days following the administration of each dose. In the phase 2 trial, the primary immunogenicity endpoints were neutralization antibody seroconversion and titer and anti-receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G seroconversion at 28 days after the second dose. RESULTS: In the phase 1 trial, 60 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of 5-µg vaccine (nâ=â24), 10-µg vaccine (nâ=â24), or placebo (nâ=â12). In the phase 2 trial, 500 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of 5-µg vaccine (nâ=â100 for 0/14 or 0/28 regimens), 10-µg vaccine (nâ=â100 for each regimen), or placebo (nâ=â50 for each regimen). In the phase 1 trial, 13 (54%), 11 (46%), and seven (7/12) participants reported at least one adverse event (AE) after receiving 5-, 10-µg vaccine, or placebo, respectively. In the phase 2 trial, 16 (16%), 19 (19%), and nine (18%) 0/14-regimen participants reported at least one AE after receiving 5-, 10-µg vaccine, or placebo, respectively. Similar AE incidences were observed in the three 0/28-regimen treatment groups. No AEs with an intensity of grade 3+ were reported, expect for one vaccine-unrelated serious AE (foot fracture) reported in the phase 1 trial. KCONVAC induced significant antibody responses; 0/28 regimen showed a higher immune responses than that did 0/14 regimen after receiving two vaccine doses. CONCLUSIONS: Both doses of KCONVAC are well tolerated and able to induce robust immune responses in healthy adults. These results support testing 5-µg vaccine in the 0/28 regimen in an upcoming phase 3 efficacy trial.

The use of immunosuppressive agents, such as high dose corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors (e.g., Tocilizumab) has been suggested to contrast the hyperinflammatory process involved in the pathogenesis of the severe disease, with conflicting evidence. Among the drawbacks of immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of reactivation of latent infections, including parasitic infestations, is to be considered. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 59-year-old Italian patient treated with high dose intravenous dexamethasone and two intravenous doses of Tocilizumab for interstitial bilateral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed itching, abdominal pain, and an increased eosinophil count. Stool examination confirmed the presence of S. stercoralis larvae. The patient was treated with a 4-day course of Ivermectin with full recovery. DISCUSSION: We report the first case of S. stercoralis infection following an 11-day treatment with high-dose steroids and Tocilizumab for severe COVID-19.

METHODS: We compared all visits to the OER to Meir Medical Center in Israel, from March 15th to April 15th, 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic and government mandated quarantine, to the same period in 2019. Factors analyzed were patient demographics, chief complaints, referral patterns, exam findings, treatments given, hospitalizations and surgical interventions. RESULTS: We included in this study 1311 visits of 1158 patients, 477 during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and 834 during the same period in 2019. The demographic distribution (age, gender, and ethnicity) was similar between the two periods. LogMAR visual acuity at presentation was worse during the Covid-19 pandemic (0.42 ± 0.6 and 0.34 ± 0.5 in 2020 and 2019 respectively; p = 0.025) and the number of emergent surgeries was higher (3.7% in 2020 vs 1.8% in 2019, p = 0.026). In 2019 there was a higher likelihood of involvement of both segments of the eye (4.82% versus 1.2%, p < 0.01) and more diagnoses were given to each patient (1 ± 0.5 versus 0.93 ± 0.35, p = 0.001; During the Covid - 19 pandemic medications (both topical and systemic) were prescribed more often (1.22 ± 0.95 in 2020 and 0.84 ± 0.67 in 2019, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: OER visits were less frequent during the Covid - 19 pandemic as compared to 2019, though the demographics of the patients remained unchanged. Visits during the pandemic tended to be for more severe ocular conditions, with worse visual acuity at presentation and required more medical and surgical treatment which imply higher necessity of ocular evaluation.

In total we report more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs produced from the Ad2 transcriptome whereof more than 850 are novel mRNAs. A surprising finding was that more than 50% of all E1A transcripts extended upstream of the previously defined transcriptional start site. The novel start sites mapped close to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) and within the E1A enhancer region. We speculate that novel promoters or enhancer driven transcription, so-called eRNA transcription, is responsible for producing these novel mRNAs. Their existence was verified by a peptide in the Ad2 proteome that was unique for the E1A ITR mRNA. Although we show a high complexity of alternative splicing from most early and late regions, the E3 region was by far the most complex when expressed at late times of infection. More than 400 alternatively spliced mRNAs were observed in this region alone. These mRNAs included extended L4 mRNAs containing E3 and L5 sequences and readthrough mRNAs combining E3 and L5 sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the virus has a remarkable capacity to produce novel exon combinations, which will offer the virus an evolutionary advantage to change the gene expression repertoire and protein production in an evolving environment.IMPORTANCE Work in the adenovirus system led to the groundbreaking discovery of RNA splicing and alternative RNA splicing in 1977. These mechanisms are essential in mammalian evolution by increasing the coding capacity of a genome. Here, we have used a long-read sequencing technology to characterize the complexity of human adenovirus pre-mRNA splicing in detail. It is mindboggling that the viral genome, which only houses around 36,000 bp, not being much larger than a single cellular gene, generates more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs. Recently, adenoviruses have been used as the backbone in several promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Further improvement of adenovirus-based vaccines demands that the virus can be tamed into an innocent carrier of foreign genes. This requires a full understanding of the components that govern adenovirus replication and gene expression.","Westergren Jakobsson, Amanda; Segerman, Bo; Wallerman, Ola; Lind, Sara Bergström; Zhao, Hongxing; Rubin, Carl-Johan; Pettersson, Ulf; Akusjärvi, Göran",J. virol,681,1

The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in elasticity of the cornea, sclera, and limbus when subjected to different intraocular pressures (IOP) using wave-based optical coherence elastography (OCE). Special attention was given to the elasticity changes of the limbal region with respect to the elasticity variations in the neighboring corneal and scleral regions. Methods: Continuous harmonic elastic waves (800 Hz) were mechanically induced in the sclera near the corneo-sclera limbus of in situ porcine eye-globes (n = 8). Wave propagation was imaged using a phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography system (PhS-OCT). The eyes were subjected to five different IOP-levels (10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 mm Hg), and spatially distributed propagation velocities were calculated along corneal, limbal, and scleral regions. Finite element analysis (FEA) of the same regions under the same excitation conditions were conducted for further validation of results. Results: FEA demonstrated that the stiffness of the heterogeneous cornea-limbus-sclera transition can be characterized by phase velocity measurements of the elastic waves produced at 800 Hz in the anterior eye. Experimental results revealed that the wave speed in the limbus (cL = 6.5 m/s) is between the cornea (cc = 2.9 m/s) and sclera (cs = 10.0 m/s) at a physiological IOP level (15 mm Hg) and rapidly increases as the IOP level is increased, even surpassing the wave speed in the sclera. Finally, the change in elastic wave speed in the limbus (&#916;cLâ¼18.5 m/s) was greater than in the cornea (&#916;cc â¼12.6 m/s) and sclera (&#916;csâ¼8.1 m/s) for the same change in IOP. Conclusions: We demonstrated that wave-based OCE can be utilized to assess limbus biomechanical properties. Moreover, experimental evidence showed that the corneo-scleral limbus is highly nonlinear compared to the cornea and sclera when the eye-globe is deformed by an increase of IOP. This may suggest that the limbus has enough structural flexibility to stabilize anterior eye shape during IOP changes.","Zvietcovich, Fernando; Nair, Achuth; Singh, Manmohan; Aglyamov, Salavat R; Twa, Michael D; Larin, Kirill V",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,681,10

The aims were to identify potential ""druggable"" binding pockets in the protein and, if located, to virtual screen pharmaceutical agents currently in use for predicted affinity to these pockets which might be useful to restrict, reduce, or inhibit the infectivity of the virion. RESULTS: Our analyses of this structure have revealed a key potentially druggable pocket where it might be viable to bind pharmaceutical agents to inhibit its ability to infect human cells. This pocket is found at the inter-chain interface that exists between two domains prior to the virion binding to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. One of these domains is the highly mobile receptor binding domain, which must move into position to interact with ACE2, which is an essential feature for viral entry to the host cell. Virtual screening with a library of purchasable drug molecules has identified pharmaceuticals currently in use as prescription and over the counter medications that, in silico, readily bind into this pocket. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights possible drugs already in use as pharmaceuticals that may act as agents to interfere with the movements of the domains within this protein essential for the infectivity processes and hence might slow, or even halt, the infection of host cells by this new coronavirus.

This interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of AI for the automation of work, which has been described as Intelligent Automation (IA). A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers. The article also discusses the implications of this debate for information management research and practice.","Coombs, Crispin",Int J Inf Manage,681,1

The continuous use of METH eventually leads to drug addiction and causes serious health complications, including attention deficit, memory loss and cognitive decline. These neurological complications are strongly associated with METH-induced neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, which leads to neuronal cell death. The current review investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying METH-mediated neuronal damages. Our analysis demonstrates that the process of neuronal impairment by METH is closely related to oxidative stress, transcription factor activation, DNA damage, excitatory toxicity and various apoptosis pathways. Thus, we reach the conclusion here that METH-induced neuronal damages are attributed to the neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effect of the drug. This review provides an insight into the mechanisms of METH addiction and contributes to the discovery of therapeutic targets on neurological impairment by METH abuse.","Kim, Buyun; Yun, Jangmi; Park, Byoungduck",,681,1

An outbreak of COVID-19 has led to more than one million confirmed cases as of April 3rd, 2020. Understanding the early spread dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe COVID-19 spread with four datasets from within and outside of Wuhan, China; it is estimated how spread in Wuhan varied between January and February 2020. It is used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human spread to occur in locations outside Wuhan if disease holders were introduced. It is combined SEIR framework model with data on cases of COVID-19 in China and International cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how spread had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, it is calculated the probability that freshly introduced cases might produce outbreaks in other regions. Also, it is calculated approximately the median day by day basic reproduction number in Wuhan, refused from 2·45 (95% CI: 1·16-4·87) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23rd, 2020, to 1.05 (0·42-2·40) one week after. Based on our estimates of, presumptuous SARS approximating disparity, it is computed that in locations with a similar spread potential to Wuhan in near the beginning of January, some time ago there are at least four independently set up cases, there is a more than fifty percent chance the infection will found within those inhabitants. COVID-19 spreading probably refused in Wuhan during delayed January 2020, corresponding with the prologue of voyage control channels. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar spread potential to Wuhan, before these organize measures, it is likely many chains of spread will fail to create initially but might lead to innovative outbreaks ultimately.","Veera Krishna, M",,681,13

ACE2 causes vasodilatation. ACE2 works in balance with ACE1. The vaso-status maintains blood-pressure/vascular-health which is demolished in Covid-19 manifesting aldosterone/salt-deregulations/inflammations/endothelial-dysfunctions/hyper-hypo- tension, sepsis/hypovolemic-shock and vessel-thrombosis/coagulations. Here, nigellidine, an indazole-alkaloid was analyzed by molecular-docking for binding to different Angiotensin-binding-proteins (enzymes, ACE1(6en5)/ACE2(4aph)/receptors, AT1(6os1)/AT2(5xjm)) and COVID-19 spike-glycoprotein(6vsb). Nigellidine strongly binds to the spike-protein at the hinge-region/active-site-opening which may hamper proper-binding of nCoV2-ACE2 surface. Nigellidine effectively binds in the Angiotensin- II binding-site/entry-pocket (-7.54 kcal/mol, -211.76, Atomic-Contact-Energy; ACE-value) of ACE2 (Ki 8.68 and 8.3 µmol) in comparison to known-binder EGCG (-4.53) and Theaflavin-di-gallate (-2.85). Nigellidine showed strong-binding (Ki, 50.93 µmol/binding-energy -5.48 kcal/mol) to mono/multi-meric ACE1. Moreover, it binds Angiotensin-receptors, AT1/AT2 (Ki, 42.79/14.22 µmol, binding-energy, -5.96/-6.61 kcal/mol) at active-sites, respectively. This article reports the novel binding of nigellidine and subsequent blockage of angiotensin-binding proteins. The ACEs-blocking could restore Angiotensin-level, restrict vaso-turbulence in Covid patients and receptor-blocking might stop inflammatory/vascular impairment. Nigellidine may slowdown the vaso-fluctuations due to Angiotensin-deregulations in Covid patients. Angiotensin II-ACE2 binding (ACE-value -294.81) is more favorable than nigellidine-ACE2. Conversely, nigellidine-ACE1 binding-energy/Ki is lower than nigellidine-ACE2 values indicating a balanced-state between constriction-dilatation. Moreover, nigellidine binds to the viral-spike, closer-proximity to its ACE2 binding-domain. Taken together, Covid patients/elderly-patients, comorbid-patients (with hypertensive/diabetic/cardiac/renal-impairment, counting >80% of non-survivors) could be greatly benefited.","Maiti, Smarajit; Banerjee, Amrita; Kanwar, Mehak",Vascul Pharmacol,681,16

Regulators, blood centres and hospitals worldwide worked quickly to get CCP to the bedside. Although response was admirable, several areas have been identified to help improve future pandemic management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, multinational subgroup from the ISBT Working Group on COVID-19 was tasked with drafting a manuscript that describes the lessons learned pertaining to procurement and administration of CCP, derived from a comprehensive questionnaire within the subgroup. RESULTS: While each country's responses and preparedness for the pandemic varied, there were shared challenges, spanning supply chain disruptions, staffing, impact of social distancing on the collection of regular blood and CCP products, and the availability of screening and confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing for donors and patients. The lack of a general framework to organize data gathering across clinical trials and the desire to provide a potentially life-saving therapeutic through compassionate use hampered the collection of much-needed safety and outcome data worldwide. Communication across all stakeholders was identified as being central to reducing confusion. CONCLUSION: The need for flexibility and adaptability remains paramount when dealing with a pandemic.

This study evaluated a multidisciplinary approach of supporting PCPs in their management of this psychosocially complex patient population, to inform subsequent strategies clinics can use to support PCPs. METHODS: Four years ago, at our academic community health safety-net system, we created a multidisciplinary consultation service to support PCPs in caring for complex patients with pain and addiction. We collected and thematically analyzed 66 referral questions to understand PCPs' initially expressed needs, interviewed 14 referring PCPs to understand their actual needs that became apparent during the consultation, and identified discrepancies between these sets of needs. RESULTS: Many of the PCPs' expressed needs aligned with their actual needs, including needing expertise in the areas of addiction, safe prescribing of opioids, nonopioid treatment options, and communication strategies for difficult conversations, a comprehensive review of the case, and a biopsychosocial approach to management. But several PCP needs emerged after the initial consultation that they did not initially anticipate, including confirming their medical decision-making process, emotional validation, feeling more control, having an outside entity take the burden off the PCP for management decisions, boundary setting, and reframing the visit to focus on the patient's function, values, and goals. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary consultation service can act as a mechanism to meet the needs of PCPs caring for psychosocially complex patients with pain and addiction, including unanticipated needs.

The median incubation period and intergenerational interval were 9 and 6 days, respectively. The secondary attack rate was 7.1% in the index cases, 5.0% in the first generation, 1.0% in the second generation, and 4.7% overall. Severe cases were seen more in the index (13, 65%) and first generation (7, 35%) ones, who had a significantly higher viral load than the mild and moderate ones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increase of transmission generation, secondary infection rate and severity decreased. Severe patients had a higher virus load. Patients in the incubation period and asymptomatic carriers were potential infection sources who might play an important role in transmission.","Wu, Jiabing; Chen, Xiuzhi; Gong, Lei; Huo, Shaohu; Gao, Xuehuan; Nie, Shuang; Chen, Fang; Hou, Sai; Song, Dandan; Ma, Wanwan; Jiang, Xuqin; Liu, Zhirong",Int. j. infect. dis,681,29

With effective treatment options available, education and testing strategies are essential in preventing transmission. Text messaging is an effective tool for health promotion and can be used to target higher risk populations. This study reports on the design, delivery and testing of a mobile text messaging SMS intervention for HIV prevention and awareness, aimed at adults in the construction industry and delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Participants were recruited at Test@Work workplace health promotion events (21 sites, n = 464 employees), including health checks with HIV testing. Message development was based on a participatory design and included a focus group (n = 9) and message fidelity testing (n = 291) with assessment of intervention uptake, reach, acceptability, and engagement. Barriers to HIV testing were identified and mapped to the COM-B behavioural model. 23 one-way push SMS messages (19 included short web links) were generated and fidelity tested, then sent via automated SMS to two employee cohorts over a 10-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Engagement metrics measured were: opt-outs, SMS delivered/read, number of clicks per web link, four two-way pull messages exploring repeat HIV testing, learning new information, perceived usefulness and behaviour change. Results: 291 people participated (68.3% of eligible attendees). A total of 7726 messages were sent between March and June 2020, with 91.6% successfully delivered (100% read). 12.4% of participants opted out over 10 weeks. Of delivered messages, links were clicked an average of 14.4% times, max 24.1% for HIV related links. The number of clicks on web links declined over time (r = -6.24, p = 0.01). Response rate for two-way pull messages was 13.7% of participants. Since the workplace HIV test offer at recruitment, 21.6% reported having taken a further HIV test. Qualitative replies indicated behavioural influence of messaging on exercise, lifestyle behaviours and intention to HIV test. Conclusions: SMS messaging for HIV prevention and awareness is acceptable to adults in the construction industry, has high uptake, low attrition and good engagement with message content, when delivered during a global pandemic. Data collection methods may need refinement for audience, and effect of COVID-19 on results is yet to be understood.","Middleton, Matthew; Somerset, Sarah; Evans, Catrin; Blake, Holly",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),681,16

We address the general public comprising people interested in medicine without specific medical background knowledge. We derived a general template for the narrative medical visualization of diseases. Applying this template to three diseases selected to span bone, vascular, and organ systems, we discuss how narrative techniques can support visual communication and facilitate understanding of medical data. Other scientists can adapt our proposed template to inform an audience on other diseases. With our work, we show the potential of narrative medical visualization and conclude with a comprehensive research agenda.","Meuschke, Monique; Garrison, Laura; Smit, Noeska; Bruckner, Stefan; Lawonn, Kai; Preim, Bernhard",,681,16

The value of rRT-PCR testing for identifying SARS-CoV-2 nursing homes (NH) residents is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (i) atypical symptoms may predict rRT-PCR results and (ii) rRT-PCR results may predict immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in NH residents. DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING: eight NHs with at least ten rRT-PCR-positive residents. SUBJECTS: 456 residents. METHODS: Typical and atypical symptoms recorded in residents' files during the 14 days before and after rRT-PCR testing were analyzed. Residents underwent blood testing for IgG-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 6 to 8 weeks after testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses compared symptoms and immunization rates in rRT-PCR-positive and negative residents. RESULTS: 161 residents had a positive rRT-PCR (35.3%), 17.4% of whom were asymptomatic before testing. Temperature > 37.8°C, oxygen saturation < 90%, unexplained anorexia, behavioural change, exhaustion, malaise, and falls before testing were independent predictors of a further positive rRT-PCR. Among the rRT-PCR-positive residents, 95.2% developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vs 7.6% in the rRT-PCR-negative residents. Among the residents with a negative rRT-PCR, those who developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies more often had typical or atypical symptoms (p = 0.02 and < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study supports a strategy based on (i) testing residents with typical or unexplained atypical symptoms for an early identification of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases, (ii) rT-PCR testing for identifying COVID-19 residents, (iii) repeated wide-facility testing (including asymptomatic cases) as soon as a resident is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and (iv) implementing SARS-CoV-2 infection control measures in rRT-PCR-negative residents when they have unexplained typical or atypical symptoms.","Blain, Hubert; Gamon, Lucie; Tuaillon, Edouard; Pisoni, Amandine; Giacosa, Nadia; Albrand, Mylène; Miot, Stéphanie; Rolland, Yves; Picot, Marie-Christine; Bousquet, Jean",Age ageing,681,20

Herein, we have studied whether the net growth and survival of the leukemic cell lines Jurkat, U937 and HL-60 are affected by external addition of five proteins acting as natural cysteine protease inhibitors. None of the cystatins examined (A, C, D and E/M) or chagasin showed consistent effects on Fas-induced apoptosis when evaluated at 1 µM. In contrast, when the intrinsic apoptosis pathway was activated by hydrogen peroxide, addition of cystatin D augmented caspase-3-like activity within all three cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of U937 cells also showed increased numbers of annexin V positive cells when hydrogen peroxide was used to initiate apoptosis and cells were cultured in the presence of cystatin D or C. Moreover, stimulation of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic U937 cells with either cystatin C or D resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of the number of cells. Cell viability was also decreased when U937 cells were cultured in the presence of cystatin C or D (1-9 µM) only, demonstrating that these cystatins can reduce cell proliferation by themselves in addition to enhancing apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. These effects on U937 cells were paralleled by internalization of cystatins C and D, indicating these effects are caused by down-regulation of intracellular proteolysis. External addition of cystatins C and D to HL-60 and Jurkat cells demonstrated similar degrees of cystatin D uptake and decreased viability as for U937 cells, indicating that these effects are general for leukemic cells.","Hunaiti, Samar; Wallin, Hanna; Eriksson, Mia; Järås, Marcus; Abrahamson, Magnus",,681,29

In particular, antiviral drugs that are currently available to treat infection in the respiratory tract have been experienced, but there is a need for new antiviral drugs that are targeted and inhibit coronavirus. The antiviral properties of organic compounds found in nature, especially coumarins, are known and widely studied. Coumarins, which are also metabolites in many medicinal drugs, should be investigated as inhibitors against coronavirus due to their pharmacophore properties (low toxicity and high pharmacokinetic properties). The easy addition of substituents to the chemical structures of coumarins makes these structures unique for the drug design. This study focuses on factors that increase the molecular binding and antiviral properties of coumarins. Molecular docking studies have been carried out to five different proteins (Spike S1-subunit, NSP5, NSP12, NSP15, and NSP16) of the SARS-CoV-2 and two proteins (ACE2 and VKORC1) of human. The best binding scores for 17 coumarins were determined for NSP12 (NonStructural Protein-12).

Our aim was to analyse the impact of work environment factors on short-term and long-term SA based on musculoskeletal and psychiatric diagnoses among healthcare workers. METHODS: The study sample consisted of healthcare workers (n=12 452) drawn from representative samples of workers aged 16 to 64, who participated in the Swedish Work Environment Surveys (SWES) between 1993 and 2013. The outcomes were either short-term (&#8804;28 days) or long-term (>104 days) SA between 1994 and 2016. HRs and 95% CIs were calculated for the impact of physical and psychosocial working conditions on risk of subsequent short-term or long-term SA for 3 years after participation in SWES. RESULTS: Heavy physical work and strenuous work postures showed elevated HRs for short-term and long-term SA compared with those without these work exposures. Similarly, high job demands and low job control each increased the risk for both short-term and long-term SA compared with employees with low job demands and high job control. Low job support increased the risk for short-term SA compared with those with high job support. Working conditions were strongly related to short-term SA due to musculoskeletal diagnoses but not to short-term SA due to psychiatric diagnoses. None of the work characteristics, except strenuous postures, elevated the risk for long-term SA due to psychiatric diagnosis compared with employees without these characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Ergonomic improvements and stress reduction among healthcare workers are likely to reduce the prevalence of SA foremost due to musculoskeletal diagnoses.","Leineweber, Constanze; Marklund, Staffan; Gustafsson, Klas; Helgesson, Magnus",Occup. environ. med,681,26

However, in some regions, ideal vaccination coverage in dogs is not obtained due to low participation in the MDVC. Travel distance to the vaccination sites has been identified as an important barrier to participation. We aim to increase MDVC participation by optimally placing fixed point vaccination locations to minimize walking distance to the nearest vaccination location. We quantified participation probability based on walking distance to the nearest vaccination point using a Poisson regression model. The regression was fit with survey data collected from 2016-2019. We then used a computational recursive interchange technique to solve the facility location problem to find a set of optimal placements of fixed point vaccination locations. Finally, we compared predicted participation of optimally placed vaccination sites to historical participation data from surveys collected from 2016-2019. We identified the p-median algorithm to solve the facility location problem as ideal for fixed point vaccination placement. We found a predicted increase in MDVC participation if vaccination locations are placed optimally. We also found a more even vaccination coverage with optimized vaccination sites; however, the workload in some optimized locations increased significantly. We developed a data-driven computational algorithm to combat an ongoing rabies epidemic by optimally using limited resources to maximize vaccination coverage. The main positive effects we expect if this algorithm is to be implemented would be increased overall vaccination coverage and increased spatial evenness of coverage. A potential negative effect could be the presence of long waiting lines as participation increases.","Castillo-Neyra, Ricardo; Bhattacharya, Bhaswar; Saxena, Aris; Raynor, Brinkley; Diaz, Elvis; Condori, Gian Franco; Rieders, Maria; Levy, Michael Z.",,681,23

These strategies, however, carry a significant risk for mental health, which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality and is currently not included in modeling the impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure, applied to Switzerland as an example. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status, and social isolation, as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. RESULTS: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average of 9.79 YLL. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences and attitudes of elementary school students and their parents (two generations from the same family) toward online learning in China during the pandemic. METHODS: A 16-item questionnaire was distributed at the 10-day and 40-day marks after the start of the first online course to 867 parent-child pairs and 141 parent-child pairs, respectively. The questionnaire was comprised of questions pertaining to course and homework completeness, effectiveness, reliability, and abundance as well as the students' enthusiasm for taking part in online classes and their satisfaction with the courses. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 90.7% (786/867) of students exhibited high or moderate enthusiasm for participating in online classes. However, most students performed poorly in online learning classes and after-school homework. With regard to satisfaction, parents' and students' average scores were 7.35 and 7.25, respectively (10-point scoring system). During the second stage of this study, parents' positive evaluations for online learning declined, including those for the effectiveness and reliability of the courses. Furthermore, the proportion of students who completed the courses and homework on time decreased; this difference proved statistically significant (P=.047). The parents' and students' overall satisfaction with online learning also declined during the second stage (parents: 7.21; students: 7.23); however, the difference in overall satisfaction between the two stages was not statistically significant (parents: P=.53; students: P=.60). Several of the parents (315/867, 36.2%) indicated that assisting with and supervising the students' online learning resulted in increased stress. Further, 36% of parents expressed dissatisfaction with or provided suggestions for online learning; most parents and students hoped to return to face-to-face classes (parents: 823/867, 94.9%; students: 811/867, 93.5%). Finally, our results presented the following six main issues that parents were the most concerned about: (1) disappointment regarding timely interaction in courses; (2) apprehensiveness about students' understanding of the course; (3) the increased burden of annoying adult responsibilities; (4) concern about children's eyesight; (5) the idea that teachers' explanations were not detailed enough; and (6) concerns about the decline of students' interest in and attention toward online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Online learning can prevent the spread of infectious diseases while still allowing elementary school students to attain knowledge. However, in our study, children's completion of the courses and homework were not satisfactory. Furthermore, their parents often experienced stress and had many concerns and complaints. Measures such as increasing the interactivity of the courses and prohibiting teachers from assigning tasks to parents could improve the effectiveness of these courses and the mental health of parents and students.","Cui, Shu; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Shijiang; Zhang, Xingong; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Ling; Yuan, Qiuyu; Huang, Cui; Cheng, Fangshuo; Zhang, Kai; Zhou, Xiaoqin",J Med Internet Res,681,24

The use of educational technology (EdTech) offers an alternative to in-person learning and reinforces social distancing, but there is limited evidence on whether and how EdTech affects academic outcomes. Recently, we conducted two large-scale randomized experiments, involving ~10,000 primary school students in China and Russia, to evaluate the effectiveness of EdTech as a substitute for traditional schooling. In China, we examined whether EdTech improves academic outcomes relative to paper-and-pencil workbook exercises of identical content. We found that EdTech was a perfect substitute for traditional learning. In Russia, we further explored how much EdTech can substitute for traditional learning. We found that EdTech substitutes only to a limited extent. The findings from these large-scale trials indicate that we need to be careful about using EdTech as a full-scale substitute for the traditional instruction received by schoolchildren.","Fairlie, Robert; Loyalka, Prashant",NPJ Sci Learn,681,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiological imaging findings of 45 pediatric patients aged between 52 days and 16 years, who were diagnosed with MIS-C according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, were evaluated. All the patients underwent chest X-ray and echocardiography. The findings obtained from 25 abdominal radiographs, 24 abdominal US, 7 abdominal CT, 16 thorax CT, 21 cranial MRI and one spinal MRI, MR cholangiography (MRCP) and cardiac MRI examinations were categorized and evaluated according to the affected systems. RESULTS: While the most common findings in chest X-ray were perihilar opacity and peribronchial thickening, pleural effusion was the most finding in thorax CT. Echocardiography findings of myocarditis were observed in 31% of the cases. The most common findings in abdominal radiological evaluation were hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, edema in the gallbladder wall and periportal area, mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, thickening of the intestinal walls, and free fluid. Reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) was the most common neurological finding. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like lesions, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalomyelitis, and radiological findings consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome were found in one case each. CONCLUSION: Radiological findings seen in MIS-C in pediatric cases are correlated with the affected system. According to the system involved, there is no specific finding for this disease. Radiological findings are not the primary diagnostic tool but can assist in the evaluation of the affected systems and to guide treatment.","Palabiyik, Figen; Akcay, Nihal; Sevketoglu, Esra; Hatipoglu, Nevin; Sari, Emine Ergul; Inci, Ercan",Acad. radiol,681,16

Patients of higher age and with preexisting chronic health conditions are at an increased risk of fatal disease outcome. However, detailed information on causes of death and the contribution of pre-existing health conditions to death yet is missing, which can be reliably established by autopsy only. We performed full body autopsies on 26 patients that had died after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 at the Charité University Hospital Berlin, Germany, or at associated teaching hospitals. We systematically evaluated causes of death and pre-existing health conditions. Additionally, clinical records and death certificates were evaluated. We report findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.","Elezkurtaj, Sefer; Greuel, Selina; Ihlow, Jana; Michaelis, Edward Georg; Bischoff, Philip; Kunze, Catarina Alisa; Sinn, Bruno Valentin; Gerhold, Manuela; Hauptmann, Kathrin; Ingold-Heppner, Barbara; Miller, Florian; Herbst, Hermann; Corman, Victor Max; Martin, Hubert; Radbruch, Helena; Heppner, Frank L; Horst, David",Sci Rep,681,16

Eighteen months (2020 January 1-2021 June 30) COVID-19 publication data of 46 Sub-Saharan African countries was collected from Scopus for analysis. Country of affiliation of the authors and funding agencies data was analyzed to understand country contributions, collaboration pattern and funding sources. USA (23.08%) and the UK (19.63%), the top two external contributors, collaborated with Sub-Saharan African countries about three times more than other countries. Collaborative papers between Sub-Saharan African countries - without contributions from outside the region-made up less than five percent of the sample, whereas over 50% of the papers were written in collaboration with researchers from outside the region. Organizations that are in USA and the UK funded 45% of all the COVID-19 research from Sub-Saharan Africa. 53.44% of all the funding from Sub-Saharan African countries came from South African organizations. This study provides evidence that pan-African COVID-19 research collaboration is low, perhaps due to poor funding and lack of institutional support within Sub-Saharan Africa. This mirrors the collaborative features of science in Sub-Saharan Africa before the COVID-19 pandemic. The high volume of international collaboration during the pandemic is a good development. There is also a strong need to forge more robust pan-African research collaboration networks, through funding from Africas national and regional government organizations, with the specific objective of meeting local COVID-19 and other healthcare needs.","Asubiaro, Toluwase Victor; Shaik, Hafsah",,681,23

This impact may be more pronounced in the context of humanitarian crises, such as the one currently unfolding in Yemen. In line with Pillar 9 of the WHO's COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, this paper reports on the nutrition program adaptations in Yemen to maintain the delivery of essential nutrition services to under-five children. The process of adaptation focused on the services provided within the nutrition surveillance system (NSS), therapeutic feeding centers (TFC), and isolation units (IU). It was conducted in five steps: (1) situation analysis;(2) development of guidance documents;(3) consultation process;(4) capacity-building programs;and (5) incorporation of programmatic adaptation within nutrition services. As of September 2020, NSS, TFC, and IUs services have shifted their standard operating procedures in line with the context-specific adaptations.

DESIGN: quantitative survey of aggregated data for each Region and overall for Italy relating to screening tests carried out in the period January-May 2020 compared to those of the same period of 2019; estimate of diagnostic delays starting from the calculation of the average detection rate of the last 3 years available (specific by Region). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Italian mass screening programmes. Data on the tests carried out in the target population of the breast (women 50-69 years old), cervix (women 25-64 years old), and colorectal (women and men 50-69 years old) cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the cumulative delay (in absolute numbers and as a percentage) in the period January-May 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, by Region; the difference of screening tests (in absolute number and in percentage) performed in May 2020 compared to May 2019; the estimate of the fewer lesions diagnosed in 2020 compared with 2019 with relative 95% confidence intervals (95%CI); the 'standard months' of delay (proportion of fewer tests carried out from January to May 2020 for the corresponding number of months). RESULTS: 20 Regions out of 21 participated. In the period January-May 2020, the fewer screening tests performed in comparison with the same period of 2019 were: 472,389 (equal to 53.8%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for mammography screening; 585,287 (equal to 54.9%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for colorectal screening; 371,273 (equal to 55.3%) with an average delay of 2.8 standard months for cervical screening. The estimated number of undiagnosed lesions is 2,201 (95%CI 2,173-2,220) breast cancers; 645 (95%CI 632-661) colorectal carcinomas; 3,890 (95%CI 3,855-3,924) advanced colorectal adenomas and 1,497 (95%CI 1,413-1,586) CIN2 or more serious lesions. CONCLUSIONS: mass screenings need to be restarted as quickly as possible. In order to make up for the delay that is accumulating, it is necessary to provide for wider delivery times, greater resources, and new organizational approaches. It will also be essential to develop communication strategies suitable for promoting participation during this emergency.","Mantellini, Paola; Battisti, Francesca; Armaroli, Paola; Giubilato, Pamela; Ventura, Leonardo; Zorzi, Manuel; Battagello, Jessica; Sassoli de Bianchi, Priscilla; Senore, Carlo; Zappa, Marco",Epidemiol Prev,681,1

While considerable information regarding COVID-19 is being published every day, it is challenging to filter out the most relevant or appropriate information for our individual practice. The Spine Society of Singapore convened via a teleconference on April 24, 2020 to collaborate on a national level and share collective wisdom in order to tackle the ongoing crisis. In the teleconference, 13 spine surgeons from across various hospitals in Singapore constituted the panel of experts. The following topics were discussed: repurposing of surgeons, continuity of spine services, introduction of telemedicine, triaging of spinal surgeries, preoperative testing, new challenges in performing spine surgery, and preparing for the post-pandemic era. While some issues required only the sharing of best practices, the Delphi panel method was adopted to form a consensus on others. Existing spine specific triage guidelines were debated and a locally accepted set of guidelines was established. Although preoperative testing is currently not performed routinely, the panel voted in favor of its implementation because they concluded that it is vital to protect themselves, their colleagues, and their patients. Solutions to operating room specific concerns were also discussed. This article reflects the opinions and insights shared during this meeting and reviews the evidence relevant to the issues that were raised. The rapid consensus reached during the teleconference has enabled us to be concerted, and thus stronger, in our national efforts to provide the best standard of care via our spine services in these challenging times. We believe that this article will provide some guidance for addressing COVID-19 in spine surgery and encourage other national/regional societies to conduct similar discussions that would help their navigation of this pandemic.","Tan, Kimberly-Anne; Thadani, Vishaal Nanik; Chan, Daniel; Oh, Jacob Yoong-Leong; Liu, Gabriel Ka-Po",,681,22

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is imaging evidence of olfactory apparatus pathology in patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study compared the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract signal intensity on thin-section T2WI and postcontrast 3D T2 FLAIR images in patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms, and age-matched controls imaged for olfactory dysfunction. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in normalized olfactory bulb T2 FLAIR signal intensity between the patients with COVID-19 and the controls with anosmia (P = .003). Four of 12 patients with COVID-19 demonstrated intraneural T2 signal hyperintensity on postcontrast 3D T2 FLAIR compared with none of the 12 patients among the controls with anosmia (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory bulb 3D T2 FLAIR signal intensity was greater in the patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms compared with an age-matched control group with olfactory dysfunction, and this was qualitatively apparent in 4 of 12 patients with COVID-19. Analysis of these preliminary finding suggests that olfactory apparatus vulnerability to COVID-19 might be supported on conventional neuroimaging and may serve as a noninvasive biomarker of infection.","Strauss, S B; Lantos, J E; Heier, L A; Shatzkes, D R; Phillips, C D",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,681,24

TropNO2VCDs from OMI and TROPOMI reveal sharp reductions of 33%-72% during 2020 LNY holiday season and the co-occurring outbreak of COVID-19 relative to the climatological mean of 2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, and 22%-67% reduction relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season. These reductions of TropNO2VCD occur majorly over highly polluted metropolitan areas with condensed industrial and transportation emission sources. COVID-19 control measures including lockdowns and shelter-in-place regulations are the primary reason for these tropospheric NO2 reductions over most areas of East China in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season, as COVID-19 control measures may explain ~87%-90% of tropospheric NO2 reduction in Wuhan as well as ~62%-89% in Beijing, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Sichuan Basin areas. The clean air regulation of China also contributes significantly to reductions of tropospheric NO2 simultaneously and is the primary factor in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) area, by explaining ~56%-63% of the tropospheric NO2 reduction there.","Huang, Guanyu; Sun, Kang",Sci Total Environ,681,1

Given the critical contribution of such activities in achieving health system quality goals, we undertook to address the question: What is known about work that has been done on patient engagement activities during the pandemic? OBJECTIVE: To examine peer-reviewed and grey literature to identify the range of patient engagement activities, broadly defined (inclusive of engagement to support clinical care to partnerships in decision-making), occurring within health systems internationally during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as key barriers and facilitators for sustaining patient engagement activities during the pandemic. METHODS: The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase and LitCOVID; a search for grey literature focused on the websites of professional organizations. Articles were required to be specific to COVID-19, describe patient engagement activities, involve a healthcare organization and be published from March 2020 to September 2020. Data were extracted and managed using Microsoft Excel. A content analysis of findings was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included. Few examples of more genuine partnership with patients were identified (such as co-design and organizational level decision making); most activities related to clinical level interactions (e.g. virtual consultations, remote appointments, family visits using technology and community outreach). Technology was leveraged in almost all reported studies to interact or connect with patients and families. Five main descriptive categories were identified: (1) Engagement through Virtual Care; (2) Engagement through Other Technology; (3) Engagement for Service Improvements/ Recommendations; (4) Factors Impacting Patient Engagement; and (5) Lessons Learned though Patient Engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of how healthcare systems and organizations stayed connected to patients and families during the pandemic was identified; the majority of activities involved direct care consultations via technology. Since this review was conducted over the first six months of the pandemic, more work is needed to unpack the spectrum of patient engagement activities, including how they may evolve over time and to explore the barriers and facilitators for sustaining activities during major disruptions like pandemics.","Cadel, Lauren; Marcinow, Michelle; Sandercock, Jane; Dowedoff, Penny; Guilcher, Sara J.

We sought to characterize patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) identified after admission for COVID-19. METHODS: All adult patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) from March 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020 and undergoing lower extremity venous duplex for DVT evaluation were included. Patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 were divided into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative groups based on in-hospital test results. Patients without clinical suspicion for COVID-19 were not tested. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify potential risk factors for DVT in patients with COVID-19. Demographic, radiographic and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,404 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. Of the 135 SARS-CoV-2 patients who underwent duplex scanning, there were 18 (13.3%) noted to have DVT compared to 72 of the 711 patients (10.1%) who were either SARS-CoV-2 negative or untested. The odds ratio for DVT in COVID-19 was 1.35 (95% CI 0.78 – 2.34, p=0.289). Baseline characteristics for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT were overall similar. COVID-19 patients with DVT had an elevated median first D-dimer (18.88 mcg/mL [IQR 7.79, 20.00] versus 2.55 mcg/mL [IQR 1.45, 6.28], p=0.002, reference range <0.5 mcg/mL), average in-hospital D-dimer (median 11.93 mcg/mL [IQR 8.25, 16.97] versus 3.54 mcg/mL [IQR 2.05, 8.53] , p<0.001) and median fibrinogen level (501.0 (IQR 440.0, 629.0) versus 654.5 (IQR 535.8, 780.0), p= 0.002, reference range 187-502 mg/dL). There was a trend to significance for COVID-19 patients with DVT compared to without DVT in median D-dimer levels at the time of the duplex (13.61 mcg/mL [IQR 4.04, 19.97] versus 3.58 mcg/mL [IQR 2.51, 9.62], p=0.055) and median ferritin levels (1,679.0 ng/mL [IQR 1,168.0, 2,577.0] versus 1,103.0 ng/mL [IQR 703.5, 2,076.5], p=0.055, reference 25-270 ng/mL). Twelve of the 18 patients with COVID who developed DVT did so despite chemical thromboprophylaxis, and two developed DVT in spite of therapeutic anticoagulation CONCLUSIONS: We found only a modestly increased risk of DVT in patients with COVID-19, likely underestimated due to limitations in duplex testing early in the epidemic. Elevated D-dimer and a less elevated fibrinogen are associated with DVT in patients with COVID-19 who appear to form thrombus despite conventional chemical thromboprophylaxis. Additionally, an increasing D-dimer over time may be a reflection of the development of DVT in patients with COVID-19.","Koleilat, Issam; Galen, Benjamin; Choinski, Krystina; Hatch, Ayesha Nzeribe; Jones, Davis Brent; Billett, Henny; Indes, Jeff; Lipsitz, Evan",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,681,4

We describe the application of the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework, developed by the Centers for Disease Control Prevention and used in public health program implementation, to scale up an evidence-based family caregiver training intervention in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. METHODS: From 2018 to 2020, clinicians at eight VA medical centers received REP-guided implementation including facilitation, technical assistance, and implementation tools to deliver the training program. The project team used the REP framework to develop activities across four distinct phases – (1) pre-conditions, (2) pre-implementation, (3) implementation, and (4) maintenance and evolution – and systematically tracked implementation facilitators, barriers, and adaptations. RESULTS: Within the REP framework, results describe how each medical center adapted implementation approaches to fit local needs. We highlight examples of how sites balanced adaptations and intervention fidelity. CONCLUSIONS: The REP framework shows promise for national expansion of the caregiver training intervention, including to non-VA systems of care, because it allows sites to adapt while maintaining intervention fidelity.

At the same time, those firms are increasingly intervening on the population level in ways that have implications for social and political life. This creates the potential for power relations of domination, and demands that we decide what constitutes the legitimacy to act on the public. Business ethics and private law are not designed to answer these questions, which are primarily political. If people have lost the right to disengage with commercial technologies, we may need to hold the companies that offer them to the same standards to which we hold the public sector. This paper first defines the problem and demonstrates that it is significant and widespread, and then argues for the development of an overarching normative framework for what constitutes non-domination with regard to digital technologies. Such a framework must involve a nuanced idea of political power and accountability that can respond not only to the legality of corporate behaviour, but to its legitimacy.","Taylor, Linnet",Philos Technol,681,24

The present study was conducted to gain a preliminary understanding of the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically for dreamers, i.e., undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as minors. A population of about 150 dreamers currently enrolled at a public university in Delaware were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey contained questions about demographics, mental health, academics, immigration, COVID-19 infection, and unemployment, in addition to mental health screens for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10). In total, 109 dreamers completed the survey. We observed remarkably high clinical levels of anxiety and depression: 47% of the dreamers met the clinical cutoff for anxiety, 63% met the cutoff for depression, and 67% (2 in 3) met the cutoff for anxiety and/or depression. Rates of anxiety and depression in our sample were significantly higher than those recently reported for college students overall, suggesting that dreamers may be experiencing a more severe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that pandemic-induced concerns about finances, COVID-19 infection, immigration, and unemployment (among other factors) were associated with greater anxiety, stress, and depression among the dreamers in our sample. The present findings are consistent with recent predictions by social scientists that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a disproportionately negative impact on the mental health of undocumented immigrants.","Goodman, J.; Wang, S.

Virus‐derived nucleic acids are sensed by the retinoic acid‐inducible gene I (RIG‐I)‐like receptor (RLR) family and the toll‐like receptor (TLR) family as well as the DNA sensor cyclic GMP‐AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). These receptors activate IRF3/7 and NF‐κB signaling pathways to induce the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines firing antiviral responses within the cell. However, to achieve a favorable outcome for the host, a balanced production of IFNs and activation of antiviral responses is required. Post‐translational modifications (PTMs), such as the covalent linkage of functional groups to amino acid chains, are crucial for this immune homeostasis in antiviral responses. Canonical PTMs including phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been extensively studied and other PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, ADP‐ribosylation and glutamylation are being increasingly implicated in antiviral innate immunity. Here we summarize our recent understanding of the most important PTMs regulating the antiviral innate immune response, and their role in virus‐related immune pathogenesis.","Zhou, Yilong; He, Chenxi; Wang, Lin; Ge, Baoxue",Eur J Immunol,681,29
