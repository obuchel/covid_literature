In this study, O2-type Li0.78[Li0.24Mn0.76]O2 nanowires were synthesized by a solvothermal reaction to produce P2-type Na5/6[Li1/4Mn3/4]O2 nanowires, which were then subjected to molten salt Li-ion exchange. The resulting nanowires have diameters less than 20 nm and lengths of several micrometers. The full-Mn-based nanowires cathode material delivers a reversible capacity of 275 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 200 mAh g-1 at a high current rate of 15 C with a capacity retention of more than 80% and the voltage decay was dramatically suppressed after 100 cycles. This excellent performance is ascribed to the highly stable oxygen redox reaction and lack of layered-to-spinel phase transition in the O2-type structure during cycling.","Shang, Huaifang; Zuo, Yuxuan; Shen, Feiran; Song, Jin; Ning, Fanghua; Zhang, Kun; He, Lunhua; Xia, Dingguo",Nano letters,879,23

Now, with advancements in genome sequencing, assembly and annotation, non-model organisms may be studied with the same advanced bioanalytical toolkit as model organisms. Proteomics is one such technique, which classically relies on predicted protein sequences to catalog and measure complex proteomes across tissues and biofluids. Applying proteomics to non-model organisms can advance and accelerate biomimicry studies, biomedical advancements, veterinary medicine, agricultural research, behavioral ecology, and food safety. In this post-model organism era we can study almost any species, meaning that many non-model organisms are in fact important emerging model organisms. Herein we focus specifically on eukaryotic organisms and discuss steps to generating sequence databases, analyzing proteomic data with or without a database, interpreting results, and future research opportunities. Proteomics is more accessible than ever before, and will continue to rapidly advance in the coming years, enabling critical research and discoveries in non-model organisms that were hitherto impossible.","Heck, Michelle; Neely, Benjamin A",Journal of proteome research,879,16

Most series of RARC used an open approach to urinary diversion. Even though robot-assisted intracorporeal urinary diversion (RICUD) is the natural extension of RARC, few centers have reported their experiences with RICUD in general, and in particular, of robot-assisted intracorporeal ileal conduits (RICIC). OBJECTIVE To report our experience with RICIC using the Marionette technique. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The first 100 consecutive patients who underwent RARC and RICIC, and had ≥ 3 mo of postoperative follow-up were included in this study. Patients were divided into four groups of 25 patients each to study the evolution of our surgical technique. INTERVENTION RICIC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Intraoperative, pathologic, and 90-d postoperative outcomes for the four groups and the overall cohort were compared using the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables). Continuous variables were reported as median (range) and categorical variables were specified as frequency (percentage). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Overall operative and specific diversion times were 352 and 123 min, respectively. Estimated blood loss was 300 ml, lymph node yield was 24, and positive surgical margin rate was 4%. Length of hospital stay increased from 7 d for group 1 to 9 d for group 4. The overall 90-d complication rate was 81%; 19% of complications were high grade. Infections were the most common complications, representing 31% of all complications. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences except in diversion time, intraoperative transfusions, and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS RICIC diversion is safe, feasible, and reproducible. Larger series with longer follow-up are needed to validate the procedure and define its place in the minimally invasive urologic armamentarium. Quality of life studies need to be conducted to compare benefits of intracorporeal urinary diversion.","Azzouni, Faris S; Din, Rakeeba; Rehman, Shabnam; Khan, Aabroo; Shi, Yi; Stegemann, Andrew; Sharif, Mohammad; Wilding, Gregory E; Guru, Khurshid A",European urology,879,22

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at three districts (Quetta, Zhob and Killa Abdullah) of Balochistan, Pakistan. All childhood TB patients enrolled for treatment at Bolan Medical Complex Hospital (BMCH) Quetta and District Headquarter Hospitals of Zhob and Killa Abdullah from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 were included in the study and followed until their treatment outcomes were reported. Data were collected through a purpose developed standardized data collection form and analyzed by using SPSS 20. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Out of 5152 TB patients enrolled at the study sites, 2184 (42.4%) were children. Among them, 1941 childhood TB patients had complete medical record were included in the study. Majority of the study participants were <5 years old (66.6%) and had pulmonary TB (PTB; 65%). A total of 45 (2.3%) patients were cured, 1680 (86.6%) completed treatment, 195 (10%) lost to follow-up, 15 (0.8%) died, 5 (0.3%) failed treatment and 1 (0.1%) was not evaluated for outcomes. In multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, treatment at BMCH Quetta (OR = 25.671, p-value < 0.001), rural residence (OR = 3.126, p-value < 0.001) and extra-PTB (OR = 1.619, p-value = 0.004) emerged as risk factors for unsuccessful outcomes. CONCLUSION The study sites collectively reached the World Health Organization's target of treatment success (>85%). Lost to follow-up was the major reason for unsuccessful outcomes. Special attention to patients with identified risk factors for unsuccessful outcomes may improve outcomes further.","Abdullah, Abid; Ahmad, Nafees; Atif, Muhammad; Khan, Shereen; Wahid, Abdul; Ahmad, Izaz; Khan, Asad",Journal of tropical pediatrics,879,29

We found that repetitive optogenetic activation of neuronal populations in the mouse cortex caused enhancement of optogenetically evoked firing of local coactivated neurons as well as distant cortical neurons in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. This global enhancement of evoked responses required coactivation of a sufficiently large population of neurons either within one cortical area or distributed in several areas. Enhancement of neuronal firing was saturable after repeated episodes of coactivation, diminished by inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, and accompanied by elevated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, all consistent with activity-induced synaptic potentiation. Chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal activity of the thalamus decreased the enhancement effect, suggesting thalamic involvement. Thus, correlated excitation of large neuronal populations leads to global enhancement of neuronal excitability.","Zhang, Deng; Yan, Xingjian; She, Liang; Wen, Yunqing; Poo, Mu-Ming",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,879,29

Gingivitis does not cause pain; however, if left untreated, it can worsen, leading to bad breath, bleeding gums, and even tooth loss, as the problem spreads to the underlying structures anchoring the teeth in the jaws. The asymptomatic nature of gingivitis leads people to postpone dental appointments until clinical signs are obvious or pain is evident. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated social distancing, which has caused many people to postpone dental visits and neglect gingival health. iGAM is a dental mobile health (mHealth) app that remotely monitors gum health, and an observational study demonstrated the ability of iGAM to reduce gingivitis. We found that a weekly dental selfie using the iGAM app reduced the signs of gingivitis and promoted oral health in a home-based setting. OBJECTIVE The aim of this mixed methods study is to assess perceptions, attitudes, willingness to pay, and willingness to use an mHealth app. METHODS The first qualitative phase of the study included eight semistructured interviews, and the second quantitative phase included data collected from responses to 121 questionnaires. RESULTS There was a consensus among all interviewees that apps dealing with health-related issues (mHealth apps) can improve health. Three themes emerged from the interviews: the iGAM app is capable of improving health, the lack of use of medical apps, and a contradiction between the objective state of health and the self-definition of being healthy. Participants were grouped according to how they responded to the question about whether they believed that mHealth apps could improve their health. Participants who believed that mHealth apps can enhance health (mean 1.96, SD 1.01) had a higher willingness to pay for the service (depending on price) than those who did not believe in app efficacy (mean 1.31, SD 0.87; t119=-2417; P=.02). A significant positive correlation was found between the amount a participant was willing to pay and the benefits offered by the app (rs=0.185; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS Potential mHealth users will be willing to pay for app use depending on their perception of the app's ability to help them personally, provided they define themselves as currently unhealthy.","Tobias, Guy; Sgan-Cohen, Harold; Spanier, Assaf B; Mann, Jonathan",JMIR formative research,879,24

However, there is limited knowledge concerning small-bowel lesions. We evaluated the clinical state of patients with SSc according to the capsule endoscopy (CE) findings. Sixty-five consecutive patients with SSc (61 females; mean age, 64.3 years) underwent CE at Hiroshima University Hospital between April 2012 and December 2019. SSc was subclassified into diffuse and limited cutaneous SSc. Among the 65 patients, 55 (51 females; mean age, 64.5 years; diffuse cutaneous SSc, 27 patients) were evaluated for the presence of fibrosis in the gastrointestinal tract by biopsy. Small-bowel lesions were detected in 27 (42%) patients with SSc. Type 1b angioectasia (Yano-Yamamoto classification) was more frequent in limited cutaneous SSc patients (p = 0.0071). The average capsule transit time of the esophagus was significantly longer in diffuse cutaneous SSc patients (p = 0.0418). There were more cases of Type 1a angioectasia in SSc patients without fibrosis. The average capsule transit time of the esophagus was significantly longer in SSc patients with fibrosis. Thus, this study revealed that the frequency of small-bowel angioectasia and gastrointestinal motility in patients with SSc differed depending on SSc subclassification and the presence of fibrosis.","Iio, Sumio; Oka, Shiro; Tanaka, Shinji; Sumioka, Akihiko; Tsuboi, Akiyoshi; Nojima, Takaki; Hirata, Shintaro; Matsuo, Yoshimi; Sugiyama, Eiji; Hide, Michihiro; Arihiro, Koji; Chayama, Kazuaki",Scientific reports,879,16

METHODS We used 3 types of hemodialysis catheters: polyurethane, silicone, and carbothane catheters. Catheter segments were incubated in vitro for various time intervals of up to 2 weeks either in a novel catheter lock solution (novel CLS), which consisted of N-acetylcysteine, tigecycline, and heparin, or in heparin alone (as a control). At the time of testing, each segment was rinsed and cut longitudinally into 2 sections. All catheter sections were scanned using an optical dissecting microscope to check for surface abnormalities and to measure wall thickness. We also carried out tensile strength testing of another set of catheters using a universal testing machine. Tested parameters included stress at yield, strain at yield, stress at break, strain at break, modulus of elasticity, and force at break. RESULTS The surfaces of catheters in both groups appeared similar by microscopy. The mean thickness of the catheter wall was not significantly different for the catheters exposed to the novel CLS and the catheters exposed to heparin (P > .05). Results for most of the tensile strength parameters tested were similar in the 2 groups of catheters at the end of 2 weeks of incubation. In particular, the force-at-break value of all tested catheters remained much greater than that recommended by industry standards. CONCLUSIONS The use of the novel catheter lock solution did not impair the mechanical integrity or increase the propensity for fracture of hemodialysis catheters.","Aslam, Saima; Darouiche, Rabih O",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,879,19

PAstV, which was recently identified as an important pathogen of diarrhea in piglets, is widely distributed in China. However, few studies have investigated the coinfection and genetic characterization of PAstV in diarrheic piglets in China. In this study, 89 PAstV-positive samples were identified in 543 diarrhea samples in China from 2015 to 2018, of which 75.28% (67/89) were coinfected with three to five different porcine pathogens, while none were positive for PAstV only. Among the 543 diarrhea samples, statistical analysis showed that PAstV-induced diarrhea was potentially associated with coinfection of PEV (p < 0.01) and GARV (p < 0.01). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 27 identified PAstV strains belong to three different genotypes and that PAstV-2 (81.48%, 22/27) was predominant in diarrheic piglets in China, followed by PAstV-4 (11.11%, 3/27) and PAasV-5 (7.41%, 2/27). Sequence analysis revealed that the 27 RdRp genes identified in this study had nucleotide homologies of 53.8-99.5%. In addition, the RdRp gene of PAstV-4 strain JL/MHK/2018/0115 harbored a unique insert of three nucleotides (GAA) as compared with other known PAstV-4 strains. Furthermore, the genotypes of PAstV varied among different geographical locations, although PAstV-2 was the most widely distributed in China. These data demonstrate that PAstV coinfection with other porcine pathogens was common and there was genetic diversity of PAstV in diarrheic piglets in China.","Su, Mingjun; Qi, Shanshan; Yang, Dan; Guo, Donghua; Yin, Baishuang; Sun, Dongbo",Frontiers in veterinary science,879,17

Almost all children estimated to have died from TB were never diagnosed or offered TB treatment. Improved access to TB preventive treatment (TPT) requires major upscaling of household contact investigation with allocation of adequate resources. Symptom-based screening is often discouraged in adults for fear of generating drug resistance, if TB cases are missed. However, the situation in vulnerable young children is different, as they present minimal risk of drug resistance generation. Further, the perceived need for additional diagnostic evaluation presents a major barrier to TPT access and underlies general reluctance to consider pragmatic decentralised models of care. Widespread roll-out of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra® represents an opportunity for improved case detection in young children, but attaining full impact will require the use of non-sputum specimens. The new Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM® urine assay demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy in HIV-positive and malnourished children, but further validation is required.

POEM is usually performed under general anesthesia in an endoscopy suite or operating theatre. The current study was conducted with the aim to analyse anesthetic management of patients with AC who underwent POEM at our institution. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the data of patients with AC who underwent POEM at our institution from January 2013 to September 2016. All cases were performed in an endoscopy suite under supervision of an anesthesia management team. Pre-procedure endoscopic evacuation of esophagogastric contents was done in all cases. Management strategies used for gas-related adverse events and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Four hundred and eighty patients (median age 40 years, range 4-77 years) underwent POEM during the study period. The sub-types of AC were type I (163), type II (297), and type III (20). POEM was successfully completed in 97.5% patients. Gas-related events were noted in 30.6% cases including-capno-thorax in 1%, capno-peritoneum in 12.3%, retroperitoneal air in 16.5%, capno-mediastinum in 0.2%, and capno-pericardium in 0.4% patients.

However, it is unclear if these changes are reversible. Methods: We prospectively assessed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and 18F-FDG PET scans in 8 COVID-19 patients at the subacute (as no longer infectious) and chronic stages (approximately six months after symptom onset). The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related covariance pattern was analyzed at both stages to examine the time course of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment. For further validation, we also conducted a conventional group analysis. Results: Follow-up 18F-FDG PET revealed a significant reduction of initial frontoparietal and, to a lesser extent, temporal glucose hypometabolism that was accompanied by a significant improvement in cognition. The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related pattern was significantly lower at follow-up and correlated inversely with MoCA performance. However, both 18F-FDG PET and cognitive assessment suggest a residual impairment. Conclusions: Although a significant recovery of regional neuronal function and cognition can be clearly stated, residuals are still measurable in some patients six months after the manifestation of COVID-19.

Some of these players were training with senior teams and three additional infected players were detected in two senior teams. In total, 49 infections were detected in five ice hockey teams, and six teams were in quarantine for two weeks. CONCLUSION An asymptomatic player can potentially endanger the whole season of a team and put opponents in danger as well. We report massive team-to-team transmission of COVID-19 in the U-20 Finnish National Hockey League. In order to prevent spread of COVID-19 in amateur-level team sports, suitable protocols should be established and adopted into daily use.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Uimonen, Mikko M; Ponkilainen, Ville T",Infectious diseases,879,20

Fortunately, many tasks of systematic reviews have the potential to be automated or may be assisted by automation. Recent advances in natural language processing, text mining and machine learning have produced new algorithms that can accurately mimic human endeavour in systematic review activity, faster and more cheaply. Automation tools need to be able to work together, to exchange data and results. Therefore, we initiated the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR), to successfully put all the parts of automation of systematic review production together. The first meeting was held in Vienna in October 2015. We established a set of principles to enable tools to be developed and integrated into toolkits.This paper sets out the principles devised at that meeting, which cover the need for improvement in efficiency of SR tasks, automation across the spectrum of SR tasks, continuous improvement, adherence to high quality standards, flexibility of use and combining components, the need for a collaboration and varied skills, the desire for open source, shared code and evaluation, and a requirement for replicability through rigorous and open evaluation.Automation has a great potential to improve the speed of systematic reviews. Considerable work is already being done on many of the steps involved in a review. The 'Vienna Principles' set out in this paper aim to guide a more coordinated effort which will allow the integration of work by separate teams and build on the experience, code and evaluations done by the many teams working across the globe.","Beller, Elaine; Clark, Justin; Tsafnat, Guy; Adams, Clive; Diehl, Heinz; Lund, Hans; Ouzzani, Mourad; Thayer, Kristina; Thomas, James; Turner, Tari; Xia, Jun; Robinson, Karen; Glasziou, Paul",Systematic reviews,879,23

OBJECTIVE To review the diagnosis and management of achalasia, with a focus on phenotypic classification pertinent to therapeutic outcomes. EVIDENCE REVIEW Literature review and MEDLINE search of articles from January 2004 to February 2015. A total of 93 articles were included in the final literature review addressing facets of achalasia epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Nine randomized controlled trials focusing on endoscopic or surgical therapy for achalasia were included (734 total patients). FINDINGS A diagnosis of achalasia should be considered when patients present with dysphagia, chest pain, and refractory reflux symptoms after an endoscopy does not reveal a mechanical obstruction or an inflammatory cause of esophageal symptoms. Manometry should be performed if achalasia is suspected. Randomized controlled trials support treatments focused on disrupting the lower esophageal sphincter with pneumatic dilation (70%-90% effective) or laparoscopic myotomy (88%-95% effective). Patients with achalasia have a variable prognosis after endoscopic or surgical myotomy based on subtypes, with type II (absent peristalsis with abnormal pan-esophageal high-pressure patterns) having a very favorable outcome (96%) and type I (absent peristalsis without abnormal pressure) having an intermediate prognosis (81%) that is inversely associated with the degree of esophageal dilatation. In contrast, type III (absent peristalsis with distal esophageal spastic contractions) is a spastic variant with less favorable outcomes (66%) after treatment of the lower esophageal sphincter. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Achalasia should be considered when dysphagia is present and not explained by an obstruction or inflammatory process. Responses to treatment vary based on which achalasia subtype is present.","Pandolfino, John E; Gawron, Andrew J",JAMA,879,20

From its initial emergence to the present, COVID-19 has posed fundamental challenges to people living with Parkinson's, forcing them to balance the need and desire to stay active and socially connected with the requirement to adhere to strict shelter-at-home orders. As cities and towns worldwide began shutting down in early 2020, people living with Parkinson's found themselves unable to access live dance activities that had provided consistent, reliable physical support; joyful cognitive stimulation; emotional connection; and social engagement. Government sanctioned closures and stay-at-home orders increased the potential for apathy, isolation, anxiety, and stress-factors that are already heightened in people with Parkinson's. COVID-19 also exacerbated disparities based on race, language, socioeconomic background, and age, inequities already present in the Parkinson's community and in Parkinson's-focused dance programming. In this article, the authors provide a description and analysis of ways one dance for Parkinson's program addressed multiples challenges through three key initiatives: online group classes in English and Spanish, telephone-based resources for people without internet access, and robust online training opportunities for teaching artists. The authors outline ways in which the pandemic has increased the inclusive nature of dance for Parkinson's programming and suggest that changes implemented during the pandemic will permanently alter program delivery for the better when it is safe to restore group classes in community settings.","Kelly, Maria Portman; Leventhal, David",Health promotion practice,879,1

Methods Babies who were hospitalized before the date first coronavirus case was detected in our country were included as control group (CG). The study group was divided into two groups; study group 1 (SG1): the mothers whose babies were hospitalized in the period when mother were asked not to bring breast milk to NICU, study group 2 (SG2): the mothers whose babies were hospitalized after the date we started to use the informed consent form for feeding options. The breast milk delivery rates to NICU during hospitalization and EB rates between discharge and 30th day of life were compared between groups. Results Among 154 mother-baby dyads (CG, n=50; SG1, n=46; SG2, n=58), the percentage of breast milk delivery to NICU was 100%, 79% for CG, SG2, respectively (p<0.001). The EB rate between discharge and 30th day of life did not change between groups (CG:90%, SG1:89%, SG2:75.9; p=0.075). Conclusions If the mothers are informed about the importance of breast milk, the EB rates are not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in short term, even if the mothers are obligatorily separated from their babies. The breast milk intake rate of the babies was lowest while our NICU protocol was uncertain, and after we prepared a protocol this rate increased.","Gunes, Asli Okbay; Dincer, Emre; Karadag, Nilgun; Topcuoglu, Sevilay; Karatekin, Guner",Journal of perinatal medicine,879,30

Because Betacoronavirus PLPs have been well characterized, it was sought to determine how PLP2 from the alphacoronavirus PEDV differentiates itself from its related counterparts. PEDV PLP2 was first biochemically characterized, and a 3.1 Å resolution crystal structure of PEDV PLP2 bound to Ub was then solved, providing insight into how Alphacoronavirus PLPs bind to their preferred substrate, Ub.

AIM We aimed to evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture in migraine prophylaxis and calculated the required information size (RIS) to determine whether further clinical studies are required. METHODS We searched Cochrane library, EMBASE and PubMed from inception to April 23th, 2020. Randomized trials that compared acupuncture with conventional drug therapy or sham acupuncture were included. The primary outcome was migraine episodes. Secondary outcomes were responder rate and adverse event. RESULTS Twenty studies (n = 3380) met the inclusion criteria. When it comes to migraine episodes, Acupuncture was superior over sham acupuncture [SMD = - 0.29, 95% CI (- 0.47 to - 0.11), P = 0.002] after treatment, while the difference between acupuncture and prophylactic drugs was not significant [SMD = - 0.21, 95% CI (- 0.42 to 0.00), P = 0.06].Both TSA graphs indicated that more RCTs are needed. As for responder rate, the results after treatment showed that acupuncture was statistically significantly better than sham acupuncture [RR 1.30, 95% CI (1.09-1.55), P = 0.003] as well as conventional drugs [RR 1.24, 95% CI (1.04-1.48), P = 0.01]. Both of their cumulative Z-curves intersected with the trial sequential monitoring boundaries favoring acupuncture. Compared to prophylactic medication, acupuncture can cause less adverse events [RR 0.34, 95% CI (0.14-0.81), P = 0.01]. CONCLUSION Acupuncture can reduce migraine episodes compared to sham one and can be an alternative and safe prophylactic treatment for conventional drugs therapy, but it should be further verified through more RCTs. Available studies suggested acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture and conventional drugs in terms of responder rate as verified by TSA.","Fan, Shi-Qi; Jin, Song; Tang, Tai-Chun; Chen, Min; Zheng, Hui",Journal of neurology,879,16

The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard. METHODS: In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. RESULTS: A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery.

However, the Commission has not adequately considered the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation. In this viewpoint, we assess how the Commission has considered health co-benefits in the key response domains. Extrapolating UK evidence to the New Zealand context suggests climate change mitigation strategies that reduce air pollution, transition the population towards plant-based diets and increase physical activity via active transport could prevent thousands of deaths per year in coming decades. Substantial health co-benefits would also arise from improved housing, cleaner water, noise reductions, afforestation and more compact cities. The Commission's draft report only briefly mentions many of these health co-benefits, and some are completely absent. We recommend the Commission's final report: (i) use health co-benefits as an explicit frame; (ii) ensure the government's Treaty of Waitangi obligations are met in all the domains covered to maximise benefits for Māori health and wellbeing; (iii) build on the successful COVID-19 response that demonstrated rapid, science-informed and vigorous government action can address major global health threats; (iv) include both public health expertise and Māori health expertise among its commissioners; (v) explain how health co-benefits are likely to generate major cost-savings to the health system.","Chambers, Tim; Hales, Simon; Shaw, Caroline; Baker, Michael; Ball, Jude; Cleghorn, Christine; Wilson, Nick",The New Zealand medical journal,879,6

It is the largest hospital in Israel and was the first to face coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients in the country at the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. OBJECTIVES To describe our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on our triage method in the emergency department (ED). Our goal was to keep the main hospitalization buildings clean of infection by separating COVID-19 positive patients from COVID-19 negative patients. METHODS We divided our ED into two separate sections: a regular non-COVID-19 ED and an advanced biological ED. We created clear protocols of triage for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the data of patients admitted to our ED during the month of March and analyzed the results of our triage method in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients. RESULTS During the month of March 2020, 7957 patients were referred to our ED. Among them 2004 were referred to the biological ED and 5953 were referred to the regular ED. Of the 2004 patients referred to the biological ED, 1641 (81.8%) were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction of whom 143 (8.7%) were positive. Only two COVID-19 positive patients unintentionally entered the main clean hospital, making our triage almost full proof.

All of these peptides were able to stimulate the proliferation of NP-specific T-cell lines or freshly isolated lymph node cells from mice immunized with recombinant NP. Immunization of mice with synthetic peptides containing appropriate Th epitopes elicited strong cellular immunity in vivo, as evidenced by delayed-type hypersensitivity. Priming with the helper peptides (e.g., NP111 and NP351) significantly accelerated the immune response induced by recombinant NP, as determined by the production of NP-specific antibodies. When fused with a conserved neutralizing epitope (SP1143-1157) from the spike protein of SARS-CoV, NP111 and NP351 assisted in the production of high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo. These data provide useful insights regarding immunity against SARS-CoV and have the potential to help guide the design of peptide-based vaccines.","Zhao, Jincun; Huang, Qianrong; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Yan; Lv, Ping; Gao, Xiao-Ming",Journal of virology,879,12

DESIGN Prospective, descriptive study. METHOD The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections. We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms. The number of co-infections is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th. RESULTS The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered. The average age was 71 years and 41% was female. The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine. Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%). In 54% of the COVID-19 patients at the ED, the temperature was ≥ 38,0°C, CRP ≥ 50 in 51%, leucocytosis in 12% and elevated LD in 61%. Of 31 patients 24 (77%) had an absolute lymphopenia.

Demyelination has been shown to result from immunopathological responses mediated by CD4+, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted T cells. As little or no class II is expressed in the normal mouse CNS, the ability of astrocytes to express these proteins and present antigen to T cells from TMEV-infected mice was investigated here. It is shown that astrocytes are capable of presenting TMEV to virus-specific T cells in vitro, and that this ability is dependent on prior induction of MHC class II by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment. Unlike other viruses such as murine hepatitis virus-JHM (a coronavirus) and measles, TMEV is not capable of inducing class II on astrocytes directly. There is a correlation between the ease of class II induction on astrocytes from different mouse strains by IFN-gamma and mouse strain susceptibility to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. These results suggest that following viral infection and initial T-cell infiltration into the CNS, class II induction on astrocytes is a key step allowing local antigen presentation and amplification of immunopathological responses within the CNS and hence the development of demyelinating disease.","Borrow, P; Nash, A A",Immunology,879,11

The infection surveillance and control resources and activities in Canadian acute care hospitals had not been assessed in 20 years. METHODS In 2000, surveys were mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian hospitals with more than 80 acute care beds. The survey was modeled after the US Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control instrument, with new items dealing with resistant pathogens and computerization. Surveillance and control indices were calculated. RESULTS One hundred seventy-two of 238 (72.3%) hospitals responded. In 42.1% of hospitals, there was fewer than 1 infection control practitioner per 250 beds. Just 60% of infection control programs had physicians or doctoral professionals with infection control training who provided services. The median surveillance index was 65.6/100, and the median control index was 60.5/100. Surgical site infection rates were reported to individual surgeons in only 36.8% of hospitals. CONCLUSIONS There were deficits in the identified components of effective infection control programs. Greater investment in resources is needed to meet recommended standards and thereby reduce morbidity, mortality, and expense associated with nosocomial infections and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.","Zoutman, Dick E; Ford, B Douglas; Bryce, Elizabeth; Gourdeau, Marie; Hébert, Ginette; Henderson, Elizabeth; Paton, Shirley",American journal of infection control,879,8

METHODS A community based sample of 222 subjects was examined. Psychiatric diagnoses were formulated using the International Composite Diagnostic Interview Simplified (CIDIS), according to DSM-IV criteria. All subjects underwent a complete thyroid evaluation including physical examination, thyroid echography and measure of serum free T4 (FT4), free T3 (FT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (anti-TPO). RESULTS 16.6% of the overall sample had an anti-TPO value above the normal cut-off. Subjects with at least one diagnosis of anxiety disorders (OR = 4.2, C.L. 95% 1.9-38.8) or mood disorders (OR = 2.9, Cl 95% 1.4-6.6, P < 0.011) were positive for serum anti-TPO more frequently than subjects without mood or anxiety disorders. A statistically significant association with anti-TPO+ was found in Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (OR = 4.0, CL 95% 1.1-15.5), in Major Depressive Episode (OR = 2.7, CL 95% 1.1-6.7) and Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (OR = 4.4, S CL 95% 1-19.3). CONCLUSIONS The study seems to suggest that individuals in the community with thyroid autoimmunity may be at high risk for mood and anxiety disorders. The psychiatric disorders and the autoimmune reaction seem to be rooted in a same (and not easy correctable) aberrancy in the immuno-endocrine system. Should our results be confirmed, the findings may be of great interest for future preventive and case finding projects.","Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Loviselli, Andrea; Hardoy, Maria Carolina; Massa, Sergio; Cadeddu, Mariangela; Sardu, Claudia; Carpiniello, Bernardo; Dell'Osso, Liliana; Mariotti, Stefano",BMC psychiatry,879,32

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of lidocaine alone and lidocaine with steroids in managing spinal pain to assess superiority or equivalency. STUDY DESIGN A systematic review of RCTs assessing the effectiveness of lidocaine alone compared with addition of steroids to lidocaine in managing spinal pain secondary to multiple causes (disc herniation, radiculitis, discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post-surgery syndrome). METHODS This systematic review was performed utilizing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) for literature search, Cochrane review criteria, and Interventional Pain Management Techniques-Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB) to assess the methodologic quality assessment and qualitative analysis utilizing best evidence synthesis principles, and quantitative analysis utilizing conventional and single-arm meta-analysis. PubMed, Cochrane Library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and prior systematic reviews and reference lists were utilized in the literature search from 1966 through December 2019. The evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis on a scale of 1 to 5. OUTCOME MEASURES A hard endpoint for the primary outcome was defined as the proportion of patients with 50% pain relief and improvement in function. Secondary outcome measures, or soft endpoints, were pain relief and/or improvement in function. Effectiveness was determined as short-term if it was less than 6 months. Improvement that lasted longer than 6 months, was defined as long-term. RESULTS Based on search criteria, 15 manuscripts were identified and considered for inclusion for qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis with conventional meta-analysis, and single-arm meta-analysis. The results showed Level II, moderate evidence, for short-term and long-term improvement in pain and function with the application of epidural injections with local anesthetic with or without steroid in managing spinal pain of multiple origins. LIMITATIONS Despite 15 RCTs, evidence may still be considered as less than optimal and further studies are recommended. CONCLUSION Overall, the present meta-analysis shows moderate (Level II) evidence for epidural injections with lidocaine with or without steroids in managing spinal pain secondary to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain, and post-surgery syndrome based on relevant, high-quality RCTs. Results were similar for lidocaine, with or without steroids.","Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Urits, Ivan; Orhurhu, Vwaire; Vangala, Brahma Prasad; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Sanapati, Mahendra R; Shah, Shalini; Soin, Amol; Mahajan, Amit; Atluri, Sairam; Kaye, Alan D; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain physician,879,30

Despite the abundance of new studies, privacy laws prevent their dissemination for medical investigations: through clinical de-identification, the Protected Health Information (PHI) contained therein can be anonymized so that medical records can be shared and published. The automation of clinical de-identification through deep learning techniques has proven to be less effective for languages other than English due to the scarcity of data sets. Hence a new Italian de-identification data set has been created from the COVID-19 clinical records made available by the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM). Therefore, two multi-lingual deep learning systems have been developed for this low-resource language scenario: the objective is to investigate their ability to transfer knowledge between different languages while maintaining the necessary features to correctly perform the Named Entity Recognition task for de-identification. The systems were trained using four different strategies, using both the English Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) 2014 and the new Italian SIRM COVID-19 data sets, then evaluated on the latter. These approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning to de-identify medical records written in a low resource language such as Italian, using one with high resources such as English.","Catelli, Rosario; Gargiulo, Francesco; Casola, Valentina; De Pietro, Giuseppe; Fujita, Hamido; Esposito, Massimo",Appl Soft Comput,879,16

The Italian Society of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) identified the need of practice recommendations on logistic issues, treatment delivery and healthcare personnel's protection in a time of limited resources. A panel of 15 national experts on HNCs completed a modified Delphi process. A five-point Likert scale was used; the chosen cut-offs for strong agreement and agreement were 75% and 66%, respectively. Items were organized into two sections: (1) general recommendations (10 items) and (2) special recommendations (45 items), detailing a set of procedures to be applied to all specific phases of the Radiation Oncology workflow. The distribution of facilities across the country was as follows: 47% Northern, 33% Central and 20% Southern regions. There was agreement or strong agreement across the majority (93%) of proposed items including treatment strategies, use of personal protection devices, set-up modifications and follow-up re-scheduling.

The virus and associated social restriction measures have been linked to an increase in mental health conditions. A considerable body of evidence shows that spending time in and engaging with nature can improve human health and wellbeing. Our study explores nature's role in supporting health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created web-based questionnaires with validated health instruments and conducted spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS). We collected data (n = 1184) on people's patterns of nature exposure, associated health and wellbeing responses, and potential socioecological drivers such as relative deprivation, access to greenspaces, and land-cover greenness. The majority of responses came from England, UK (n = 993). We applied a range of statistical analyses including bootstrap-resampled correlations and binomial regression models, adjusting for several potential confounding factors. We found that respondents significantly changed their patterns of visiting nature as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People spent more time in nature and visited nature more often during the pandemic. People generally visited nature for a health and wellbeing benefit and felt that nature helped them cope during the pandemic. Greater land-cover greenness within a 250 m radius around a respondent's postcode was important in predicting higher levels of mental wellbeing. There were significantly more food-growing allotments within 100 and 250 m around respondents with high mental wellbeing scores. The need for a mutually-advantageous relationship between humans and the wider biotic community has never been more important. We must conserve, restore and design nature-centric environments to maintain resilient societies and promote planetary health.","Robinson, Jake M; Brindley, Paul; Cameron, Ross; MacCarthy, Danielle; Jorgensen, Anna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),879,24

Since effective and specific vaccine is not available to combat the deadly COVID-19, the objective of our study was to design a multi-epitope vaccine using immunoinformatics approach with translational implications. Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is stable, conserved and highly immunogenic along with being less prone to mutations during infection, which makes it a suitable candidate for designing vaccine. In our study, B- and T-cells epitopes were identified from N protein and screened based on crucial parameters to design the multi-epitope vaccine construct. Additionally, human beta-defensin-2 was incorporated into the vaccine construct as an adjuvant along with suitable linkers followed by its further evaluation based on crucial parameters including allergenicity, antigenicity, stability etc. Combined major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II) binding epitopes presented broader population coverage of the vaccine throughout the world. The three-dimensional structure of vaccine candidate implied strong interaction with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) using molecular docking. The vaccine-TLR3 complex was observed to be highly stable during simulation and electrostatic free energy was foremost contributor for stabilization of the structure. Subsequently, in silico cloning of vaccine candidate was carried out to generate the construct into pET-28a(+) expression vector succeeded by its virtual confirmation. Altogether, our results advocate that the designed vaccine candidate could be an effective and promising weapon to fight with COVID-19 infection worldwide.","Kumar, Janish; Qureshi, Rahila; Sagurthi, Someswar R; Qureshi, Insaf Ahmed",Int J Pept Res Ther,879,11

Mask fit-testing of respiratory protective equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers from aerosolized particles. AIM: To analyse the outcome of mask fit-testing across National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Using the Freedom of Information Act, 137 NHS hospitals were approached on May 26th, 2020 by an independent researcher to provide data on the outcome of fit-testing at each site. FINDINGS: Ninety-six hospitals responded to the request between May 26th, 2020 to October 29th, 2020. There was a total of 86 mask types used across 56 hospitals, 13 of which were used in at least 10% of these hospitals; the most frequently used was the FFP3M1863, used by 92.86% of hospitals. Overall fit-testing pass rates were provided by 32 hospitals with mean pass rate of 80.74%. The most successful masks, in terms of fit-test failure rates, were the Alpha Solway 3030V and the Alpha Solway S-3V (both reporting mean fit-test failures of 2%). Male- and female-specific pass and failure rates were provided by seven hospitals. Across the seven hospitals, 20.1% of men tested failed the fit-test for all masks used, whereas 19.9% of women tested failed the fit-test for all masks used. Failure rates were significantly higher in staff from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds 644/2507 (25.69%) across four hospitals. CONCLUSION: Twenty percent of healthcare workers tested during the first response to the pandemic failed fit-testing for masks. A small sample revealed that this was most prominent in staff from BAME backgrounds.","Green, S; Gani, A; Bailey, M; Brown, O; Hing, C B",J. hosp. infect,879,6
