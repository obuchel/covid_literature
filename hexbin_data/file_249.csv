941,"Examining the knowledge, attitudes and practices of domestic and international university students towards seasonal and pandemic influenza",2012-04-26,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the availability of the specific pandemic vaccine, strategies to mitigate the impact of the disease typically involved antiviral treatment and “non-pharmaceutical” community interventions. However, compliance with these strategies is linked to risk perceptions, perceived severity and perceived effectiveness of the strategies. In 2010, we undertook a study to examine the knowledge, attitudes, risk perceptions, practices and barriers towards influenza and infection control strategies amongst domestic and international university students. METHODS: A study using qualitative methods that incorporated 20 semi-structured interviews was undertaken with domestic and international undergraduate and postgraduate university students based at one university in Sydney, Australia. Participants were invited to discuss their perceptions of influenza (seasonal vs. pandemic) in terms of perceived severity and impact, and attitudes towards infection control measures including hand-washing and the use of social distancing, isolation or cough etiquette. RESULTS: While participants were generally knowledgeable about influenza transmission, they were unable to accurately define what ‘pandemic influenza’ meant. While avian flu or SARS were mistaken as examples of past pandemics, almost all participants were able to associate the recent “swine flu” situation as an example of a pandemic event. Not surprisingly, it was uncommon for participants to identify university students as being at risk of catching pandemic influenza. Amongst those interviewed, it was felt that ‘students’ were capable of fighting off any illness. The participant’s nominated hand washing as the most feasible and acceptable compared with social distancing and mask use. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high levels of interaction that occurs in a university setting, it is really important that students are informed about disease transmission and about risk of infection. It may be necessary to emphasize that pandemic influenza could pose a real threat to them, that it is important to protect oneself from infection and that infection control measures can be effective.","Seale, Holly; Mak, Jackie PI; Razee, Husna; MacIntyre, C Raina",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447694/,249
2926,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Zika: Paper- and Internet-Based Survey in Zhejiang, China",2017-10-30,"BACKGROUND: As public access to the Internet increases, many health workers prefer to carry out health education online, reducing the use of traditional community-based health education methods. Since March 2016, four Zika cases have been confirmed in Zhejiang, China. Rapid assessment of people’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding Zika is crucial to its prevention and control. Web-based surveys to assess public KAP may be a growing trend; however, we had little experience with this method. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore KAP regarding Zika in residents of Zhejiang using both traditional paper- and innovative Internet-based investigations. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A paper-based version of the survey was used in a cross-sectional community study following multistage cluster random sampling, and an Internet-based survey was promoted through a local health education site. Data were interpreted via univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 447 community residents participated in the paper-based survey, with a response rate of 89.4% (447/500), and 621 eligible Internet users participated in the Internet-based survey, with a response rate of 36.92% (621/1682). Age, education level, and occupation differed significantly between participants in the paper- and Internet-based surveys. Participants completing the Internet-based survey were much younger (χ(2)(2)=144.7, P<.001) and had a higher level of education (χ(2)(2)=423.5, P<.001) than those completing the paper-based survey. Among participants completing the paper-based survey, there were more farmers, housewives, and unemployed people (χ(2)(3)=413.7, P<.001). Overall, 83.52% of participants (892/1068) knew the transmission route for Zika, 76.12% (813/1068) knew that pregnant women were at high risk of severe complications, 66.39% (709/1068) knew that contracting Zika during pregnancy could lead to newborn babies with microcephaly, and 98.88% (1056/1068) knew places where mosquitos could usually be found. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, participants completing the Internet-based survey were more likely to know the transmission route of Zika (odds ratio [OR]=5.0, 95% CI 3.0-8.0), the association between pregnant women with Zika and newborn babies with microcephaly (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.0), and that pregnant women were at high risk for Zika (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.5-8.4) than those completing the paper-based survey. They were less likely to worry about contracting Zika (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9) and more likely to actively seek information about Zika than participants completing the paper-based survey (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.0-5.6). CONCLUSIONS: Participants completing the Internet-based survey had a higher level of basic knowledge and more positive attitudes and behaviors than participants completing the paper-based survey. In addition to providing Web-based health information, the government should ensure sufficient access to health information for the elderly and less educated people in the community to improve health equity.","Huang, Yu; Xu, Shuiyang; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Yushui; Liu, He; Yao, Dingming; Xu, Yue; Lv, Qiaohong; Hao, Gang; Xu, Yan; Wu, Qingqing",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5684512/,249
7440,Infectious diseases pharmacy residency programs,2007-11-11,"Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) plays a pivotal role in the biology of mammals, including its association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I gene products. The latter molecules have been shown to affect reproduction in both mice and humans, although the exact mechanism is still unknown. Here we report the results of a longitudinal study of the reproductive performance of a genetically modified B2m deficient mouse strain with low MHC Class I expression. Our data show that this mouse strain has an impaired reproductive performance. However, the mice superovulate well and show a normal estrous cycle. Breeding studies from crosses between the transgenic mice and the wild-type parental strain show that B2m deficient mice have a significantly lower frequency of mating than the control B2m(+/+) mice. In addition, the litter size and weaning success of B2m deficient mice were lower than the control. Perinatal lethality of the B2m deficient offspring was also inflicted by cannibalism of the young pups by the B2m deficient female. The impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) can be reversed by reintroducing the B2m gene in F1 heterozygous B2m(+/−) animals; thus the presence of B2M confers a normal breeding pattern. The acquisition of an impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) as a result of the knockout of B2m directly implicates B2M in the reproductive cycle of mice and raises the possibility of an effect of B2M on the reproduction of other mammals.","Cooper, Joanne C.; Dealtry, Gillian B.; Ahmed, Mohamed Abdelrahman; Arck, Petra C.; Klapp, Burghard F.; Blois, Sandra M.; Fernández, Nelson",Biol Reprod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110103/,249
11110,Burnout and Leadership Style in Behavioral Health Care: a Literature Review,2020-03-18,"PURPOSE: To analyse the preference of end of life care place in paediatric oncology patients, and to understand the end of life care needs and regrets among the care givers. METHOD: This was an observational qualitative study. Parents of in-curable paediatric malignancy patients who died during the years 2016–2018 were interviewed using a pre-formed open-ended questionnaire. Fears during the last phase of child’s life, most disturbing symptoms, choice of end of life care plan, regret of care givers and reasons for such choices were noted and analysed. RESULT: Twenty six families were interviewed. A median of 3 months of discordance was noted between declaration of in-curability and acceptance of the same by the family. During terminal months, pain (84.62%) was described as the most bothersome symptom followed by respiratory distress (73.08%). Eighteen families (69%) opted for home-based terminal care, 8 (31%) for hospital-based terminal care. Regret of choice was noted in 62.5% families of the hospital-based care group (separation from home environment being the main reason) and 38.89% of the home-based care group (lack of access to health care personnel and pain medication being the main reasons). CONCLUSION: Home-based care is the preferred option for end of life care by the care givers. Lack of community-based terminal care support system and availability of analgesics are the main areas to work on in India.","Das, Kunal; Khanna, Tanvi; Arora, Anshika; Agrawal, Nitika",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223103/,249

Here, we show that the conventional detailed balance condition is a special case of a more general relation that works when the diffusion occurs in the presence of a distributed sink that eventually traps the particle. We use this relation to study the lifetime distribution of particles that start and are trapped at specified initial and final points. It turns out that when the sink strength at the initial point is nonzero, the initial and final points are interchangeable, i.e., the distribution is independent of which of the two points is initial and which is final. In other words, this conditional trapping time distribution possesses forward–backward symmetry.","Berezhkovskii, Alexander M.; Makarov, Dmitrii E.",J Chem Phys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7307648/,249
15925,How pharmacists can help heal democracy in America,2021-01-07,"Rabies is caused by infection of rabies virus (RABV) and remains a serious threat to the global public health. Except for the requirement for cold chain and high cost of human rabies immune globulin, no small molecule drugs are currently available for clinical treatment of rabies. So, it is of great importance to identify novel compounds that can effectively inhibit RABV infection. Artesunate (ART) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA), two derivatives of artemisinin, are widely used for treatment of malaria in adults and children, showing high safety. In this study, we found that both ART and DHA were able to inhibit RABV replication in host cells at a low concentration (0.1 μmol/L). The antiviral effects of ART and DHA were independent of viral strains and cell lines. Pre-treatment with ART or DHA for 2 h in vitro did not affect the viral replication in host cells, implying that ART and DHA neither reduced the viability of RABV directly nor inhibited the binding and entrance of the virus to host cells. Further studies revealed that ART and DHA inhibited RABV genomic RNA synthesis and viral gene transcription. Treatment with ART or DHA (5 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection improved, to some extent, the survival rate of RABV-challenged mice. Combination treatment with derivatives of artemisinin and mannitol significantly improved the survival rate of RABV-challenged mice. The results suggest that ART and DHA have a great potential to be explored as new anti-rabies agents for treatment of rabies.","Luo, Jun; Zhang, Yue; Wang, Yang; Liu, Qing; Li, Jiesen; He, Hongling; Luo, Yongwen; Huang, Shile; Guo, Xiaofeng",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7930525/,249
16596,The ParentingWell Learning Collaborative Feasibility Study: Training Adult Mental Health Service Practitioners in a Family-Focused Practice Approach,2021-04-04,"Is it true that parents always prioritize educational effectiveness when selecting childcare services? The current study identified the potential requirements of dual-income parents toward social robots’ diverse childcare functions (e.g., socialization, education, entertainment, and consultation). The results revealed that parental attitudes toward robots were made more positive by all the childcare functions of robots except for their educational features. Furthermore, parents’ expectations of childcare functions varied based on their parenting characteristics. Spectral clustering analysis identified distinctive parenting styles (e.g., family-oriented, work-oriented, noninterventional, and dominant), and multigroup structural equation modeling suggested that the impact of robots’ socialization function was significant in all parent groups, while other childcare functions exerted limited influence according to specific parenting styles. In addition, children’s characteristics were found to alter parents’ preferences for each childcare function. These results offer practical implications for the early adoption of childcare robots through predetermining parents’ acceptability based on their specific parenting characteristics.","Lee, Jieon; Lee, Daeho; Lee, Jae-gil",Int J Soc Robot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020072/,249
17213,A day of relief and hope,2021-03-19,"Rapid-response vaccine production platform technologies, including RNA vaccines, are being developed to combat viral epidemics and pandemics. A key enabler of rapid response is having quality-oriented disease-agnostic manufacturing protocols ready ahead of outbreaks. We are the first to apply the Quality by Design (QbD) framework to enhance rapid-response RNA vaccine manufacturing against known and future viral pathogens. This QbD framework aims to support the development and consistent production of safe and efficacious RNA vaccines, integrating a novel qualitative methodology and a quantitative bioprocess model. The qualitative methodology identifies and assesses the direction, magnitude and shape of the impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on critical quality attributes (CQAs). The mechanistic bioprocess model quantifies and maps the effect of four CPPs on the CQA of effective yield of RNA drug substance. Consequently, the first design space of an RNA vaccine synthesis bioreactor is obtained. The cost-yield optimization together with the probabilistic design space contribute towards automation of rapid-response, high-quality RNA vaccine production.","van de Berg, Damien; Kis, Zoltán; Behmer, Carl Fredrik; Samnuan, Karnyart; Blakney, Anna K.; Kontoravdi, Cleo; Shattock, Robin; Shah, Nilay",NPJ Vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8085199/,249

The vast majority of HPV infections clear in less than 3 years, but the underlying mechanisms, especially the involvement of the immune response, are still poorly known. Building on earlier work stressing the importance of randomness in the type of cell divisions in the clearance of HPV infection, we develop a stochastic mathematical model of HPV dynamics that combines the previous aspect with an explicit description of the intracellular level. We show that the random partitioning of virus episomes upon stem cell division and the occurrence of symmetric divisions dramatically affect viral persistence. These results call for more detailed within-host studies to better understand the relative importance of stochasticity and immunity in HPV infection clearance.","Beneteau, Thomas; Selinger, Christian; Sofonea, Mircea T.; Alizon, Samuel",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448377/,249
22608,"2(nd) World Congress on Women’s Mental Health March 17–20, 2004, Washington, DC",2005,"The study was carried out in Sindh province of Pakistan to investigate productive and reproductive performance of ten local goat breeds. The ten goat breeds included in the study were Kamori, Tapri, Bugi-Turi, Pateri, Kachan, Jattan, Lohri, Chappar, Barri, and Thari. The data were collected using a detailed survey on various productive (birth weight, weaning weight, weaning age, average daily gain, milk yield and lactation length) and reproductive (age at first heat, age at first kidding, kidding interval, service period, number of services per conception and twinning percentage) traits of goats. Up sixteen local farmers of each breed were visited by the investigators and information was recorded/collected on prescribed performas. The highest birth weight was observed in Pateri goat (2.90 ± 0.11kg). In case of weaning weight maximum was observed in Kachan (16.0 ± 0.50kg) and lowest in Thari (11.19 ± 0.40 kg). Moreover weaning age was lowest in Thari (3.0 ± 0.11months) and highest was in Bugi-Turi (8.0 ± 0.14months). The highest milk yield was observed in Tapri and Kamori (~ 3.50 kg) followed by Pateri (~2.90 kg), Bugi Tori, Kacchan, Jattan (~ 2.00 kg) and Lohri, Chapper, Barri and Theri (~1 kg). As far as reproductive traits are concerned; age at first heat was lowest in Pateri (around 7 months) while all other breeds ranged from 11 to 15 months). The maximum twining percentage at first kidding was observed in Chappar (25%). Jattan had lowest kidding interval (5.0 ± 0.16 months). On the basis of overall average pre-weaning growth rate of kids, Tapri and Thari appear to have higher growth potential followed by Kamori and Kachhan. It could be concluded that Tapri, Thari and Kamori may be utilized for meat production under existing circumstances in the order of priority. Similarly, Tapri, Kamori and Pateri may be better utilized as dairy goats as well.

41028,Parental concerns and uptake of childhood vaccines in rural Tanzania – a mixed methods study,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: CpG methylation of tumor suppressor genes occurs in the early stage of carcinogenesis. Detecting risk factors for aberrant CpG methylation is clinically important for predicting cancer development. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3a is considered to play critical roles in the DNA methylation process during pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the association between DNMT3A polymorphisms (rs6733868 and rs13428812) and CpG methylation status in non-cancerous gastric mucosa. METHODS: We determined the DNMT3A genotype and CpG methylation status of 4 genes (p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), DAPK, and CDH1) in 510 subjects without gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection status was determined by the rapid urease test, urea breath test, speculum examination, or serum antibody test. We determined the DNMT3A genotype using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). CpG methylation status was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). When the methylated band was stronger than 10 ng/μL according to the DNA marker, we judged CpG island hypermethylation (CIHM) to be present. Associations between genotypes and susceptibilities were assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies of both polymorphisms (rs6733868 and rs13428812) were lower in the CpG methylated groups of each of the 4 genes (p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), DAPK, and CDH1). Using a dominant genetic model, rs6733868 was significantly associated with the hypermethylation of each gene, whereas rs13428812 was associated with the methylation of 3 genes (all except p14(ARF)). When low-CIHM was defined as 1 or 2 CpG islands methylated and high-CIHM was defined as 3 or more CpG islands methylated, carrying the minor allele of rs6733868 was associated with both decreased low- and high-CIHM, and that of rs13428812 also was associated with a decrease. Comparing low-CIHM with high-CIHM, carrying the minor alleles of rs6733868 or rs13428812 was related to decreased susceptibility to high-CIHM. In HP-infected subjects, carrying the minor alleles of rs6733868 or rs13428812 had a significantly greater association with decreased susceptibility to high-CIHM. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that polymorphisms of DNMT3A are associated with the accumulation of gene methylation in gastric mucosa. Carrying the minor alleles of rs6733868 or rs13428812 inhibits aberrant gene methylations, which are typically enhanced by HP infection.","Takano, Hikaru; Shibata, Tomoyuki; Nakamura, Masakatsu; Sakurai, Naoko; Hayashi, Tasuku; Ota, Masafumi; Nomura-Horita, Tomoe; Hayashi, Ranji; Shimasaki, Takeo; Otsuka, Toshimi; Tahara, Tomomitsu; Arisawa, Tomiyasu",BMC Med Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7562764/,249

The knowledge about these different phases allows the improvement of investment decisions by the private sector or by the government, in a context of challenges and opportunities. The main objective of this study was to verify in which phase the Island of Sal and Cape Verde were at an individual and competitive level during the period 2010–2018, considering the Tourism Development Index (TDI). To calculate the TDI, destinations with the same ‘sun and beach’ market were chosen, such as the Dominican Republic, Morocco, Tunisia and the Canary Islands, because they compete for the same European market and their geographical proximity to this market; data from government and non-government sources were used. It was concluded that the Island of Sal is in the Development phase, the same phase as that of Cape Verde. As for competitiveness, they are in the exploration and stagnation phase, both needing to increase the TDI to 48% and 43%, respectively to reach the involvement phase. For the calculation of the TDI, data from Cape Verde can be used to analyse the Sal Island index and vice versa.

In other conditions, interventions in which diet and physical activity are combined seem to be more effective than separate interventions. Therefore, we assessed the effect of a combined lifestyle intervention on the impact of disease on daily life, clinical disease activity, fatigue and quality of life in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A single arm intervention study was performed in IBD patients in remission or with mildly active disease. Participants received personal advice to improve their diet and level of physical activity by a dietician and a physiotherapist in one face-to-face and one telephone consult. These advices were supported by guidelines based on the Dutch dietary and physical activity guidelines, a recipe app and a booklet with physical activity exercises. IBD disability index (IBD-DI) to assess impact of disease on daily life, clinical disease activity questionnaires (P-HBI or P-SCCAI), IBD fatigue (IBD-F) patient self-assessment scale and IBD quality of life questionnaire (IBDQ) were completed. The Eetscore Food Frequency Questionnaire (Eetscore FFQ) and Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH) were used to assess diet and physical activity. Changes from baseline to 5 weeks after start were investigated by paired samples t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. RESULTS: We included 29 participants. At time of this preliminary analysis, 25 participants completed baseline and 5-week assessments (11 males, 11 CD, median age 36 years [IQR 29–53], median BMI 25 kg/m(2) [IQR 24–28]). After 5 weeks, diet quality had significantly improved (p<0.001), but level of physical activity had not (p=0.509). Impact of disease on daily life (IBD-DI) decreased with 2.5 points (95%CI -5.5-0.4; p=0.09). Disease activity did not change significantly. There was a significant decrease in fatigue (median IBD-F 20 [IQR 8–29] to 15 [IQR 3–24; p=0.03]) and a significant increase in quality of life (median IBDQ 194 [IQR 179–206] to 196 [IQR 186–209; p=0.03]). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that a combined lifestyle intervention is effective to reduce fatigue and to increase quality of life in patients with IBD, at least in the short term. Impact of disease on daily life and clinical disease activity did not improve significantly. Participants reported their level of physical activity to be restricted due to COVID-19 measures, which could explain the lack of effect on this outcome.

This study (NCT01883115) aimed to assess safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. METHODS Patients with inguinal/femoral hernias from February 2013 to February 2014 undergoing SILTEP herniorraphy with telescopic dissection were compared with patients who had previously undergone SILTEP herniorraphy with balloon dissection. Costs of different ports/trocars were analysed. RESULTS There were 102 patients in telescopic compared to 51 in balloon dissection group; these had no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists and pre-op visual analogue scores. Telescopic vs. balloon showed: post-operative pain-day one 2.5 vs. 2.5; p = 0.90, day seven 0 vs. 0; p = 0.02 (0 vs. 1; p < 0.01 for bilateral hernias); operation times-unilateral 48.0 vs. 48.0 min; p = 0.88 and bilateral 70.0 vs. 65.0 min; p = 0.66, length of hospital stay 1.0 vs. 1.0 day, analgesic intake (dextropropoxyphene) 6.0 vs. 6.0 tablets; p = 0.95, return to work/normal physical activities 7.0 vs. 7.0 days; p = 0.46 and cosmetic scar scores 24.0 vs. 24.0, respectively. There was no conversion to open surgery/need for additional ports in either group. Median scar length for telescopic group was 13.0 mm. Costs of disposable ports/trocars for telescopic and balloon groups were US$480 and $720, respectively. There were no morbidities/recurrences with follow-up of 2-36 months.

The 3-field lymph node dissection is the standard procedure in Japan for surgically curable esophageal cancer in the middle or upper thoracic esophagus. Minimally invasive esophagectomy is being increasingly performed in many countries, and several studies report its feasibility and curability; further, the magnifying effect of the thoracoscope is another distinct advantage. However, few studies have reported that minimally invasive esophagectomy is more beneficial than open esophagectomy. A recent meta-analysis revealed that minimally invasive esophagectomy reduces blood loss, respiratory complications, the total morbidity rate, and hospitalization duration. A randomized study reported that the pulmonary infection rate, pain score, intraoperative blood loss, hospitalization duration, and postoperative 6-week quality of life were significantly better with the minimally invasive procedure than with other procedures.

As of 10th April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95,000 deaths. Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy. The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article. Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals. Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging. Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.

According to WHO recommendations, it may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients. In most CRSwNP cases, the inflammatory changes affecting the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes are type-2 (T2) inflammation endotypes. METHODS The current knowledge on COVID-19 and on treatment options for CRS was analyzed by a literature search in Medline, Pubmed, international guidelines, the Cochrane Library and the Internet. RESULTS Based on international literature, on current recommendations by WHO and other international organizations as well as on previous experience, a panel of experts from EAACI and ARIA provided recommendations for the treatment of CRS during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Intranasal corticosteroids remain the standard treatment for CRS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surgical treatments should be reduced to a minimum and surgery preserved for patients with local complications and for those with no other treatment options. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Treatment with biologics can be continued with careful monitoring in non-infected patients and should be temporarily interrupted during the course of the COVID-19 infection.","Klimek, L; Jutel, M; Bousquet, J; Agache, I; Akdis, C; Hox, V; Gevaert, P; Tomazic, P V; Rondon, C; Cingi, C; Toppila-Salmi, S; Karavelia, A; Bozkurt, B; Förster-Ruhrmann, U; Becker, S; Chaker, A M; Wollenberg, B; Mösges, R; Huppertz, T; Hagemann, J; Bachert, C; Fokkens, W",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33075144/,249

Because of its dynamic, real-time, non-invasive, repeatable and other advantages, critical ultrasonography can be widely used in the diagnosis, assessment and guidance of treatment for severe patients. Based on the recommendations of critical care experts from all over the country who fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, this article summarizes the guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 based on critical ultrasonography, hoping to provide help for the treatment of severe patients. The recommendations mainly cover the following aspects: (1) lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 is mainly manifested by thickened and irregular pleural lines, different types of B-lines, shred signs, and other consolidation like dynamic air bronchogram; (2) Echocardiography may show right heart dysfunction, diffuse cardiac function enhancement, stress cardiomyopathy, diffuse cardiac depression and other multiple abnormalities; (3) Critical ultrasonography helps with initiating early treatment in the suspect patient, screening confirmed patients after intensive care unit admission, early assessment of sudden critical events, rapid grading assessment and treatment based on it; (4) Critical ultrasonography helps to quickly screen for the etiology of respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19, make oxygen therapeutic strategy, guide the implementation of lung protective ventilation, graded management and precise off-ventilator; (5) Critical ultrasonography is helpful for assessing the circulatory status of patients with COVID-19, finding chronic cardiopulmonary diseases and guiding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation management; (6) Critical ultrasonography Contributes to the management of organs besides based on cardiopulmonary oxygen transport; (7) Critical ultrasonography can help to improve the success of operation; (8) Critical ultrasonography can help to improve the safety and quality of nursing; (9) When performing critical ultrasonography for patients with COVID-19, it needs to implement three-level protection standard, pay attention to disinfect the machine and strictly obey the rules from nosocomial infection.

In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response is the first line of defense, triggering multiple signaling pathways to produce interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and initiating the adaptive immune response against the virus. Unsurprisingly, the virus has developed strategies to evade detection, which can result in delayed, excessive activation of the innate immune system. The response elicited by the host depends on multiple factors, including health status, age, and sex. An overactive innate immune response can lead to a cytokine storm, inflammation, and vascular disruption, leading to the vast array of symptoms exhibited by COVID-19 patients. What is known about the expression and epigenetic regulation of the ACE2 gene and the various players in the host response are explored in this review.","Beacon, Tasnim H; Su, Ruey-Chyi; Lakowski, Ted M; Delcuve, Geneviève P; Davie, James R",IUBMB life,https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936531/,249

The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of palatal groove in preterm infants and to evaluate whether this condition affects oral feeding ability. METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study among very low-birthweight infants born at Takatsuki General Hospital, Osaka, between March and October in 2010. The shape of the hard palate was classified into three types: normal, narrow high-arched palate, and palatal groove. RESULTS Among the 37 enrolled infants, 14 (38%) had palatal groove. In particular, among the 29 infants with birthweight <1000 g, palatal groove was observed in 48% of these patients, and only 10% were normal. Infants with palatal groove were ventilated for considerably more days with oral endotracheal tube than those without palate groove, even after adjustment for gestational age, birthweight, and duration of oral duodenal tube placement (OR, 1.11). Establishment of oral feeding and disappearance of choking on milk were considerably delayed in infants with palatal groove. Transient oral feeding difficulty requiring thickened-feed intervention was observed only in infants with palatal groove; on multi-regression analysis this difficulty seemed to be induced by the palatal groove. CONCLUSIONS Palatal groove formation induced by oral endotracheal intubation occurs with a high frequency in preterm infants, and this is likely to affect oral feeding ability.","Enomoto, Masahiro; Sezaki, Hiromi; Muranishi, Rie; Sato, Yumi; Kikuchi, Shin; Katayama, Yoshinori; Takei, Atsuko; Ikegami, Hitoshi; Sakuma, Mio; Minami, Hirotaka",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.13113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501257/,249

Neurorehabilitation has been progressively relying on computer-assisted programs and, more recently, on virtual reality (VR). Current reviews explore VR-based neurorehabilitation for assessing and treating the most common neurological pathologies. However, none of them explored specifically the impact of VR on multiple cognitive domains. AREAS COVERED The present work is a review of six years of literature (2015-2020) on VR in neurorehabilitation with the purpose of analysing its effects on memory, attention, executive functions, language and visuospatial ability. EXPERT OPINION Our review suggests that VR-based neurorehabilitation showed encouraging results for executive functions and visuospatial abilities particularly for both acute and neurodegenerative conditions. Conversely, memory and attention outcomes are conflicting, and language did not show significant improvements following VR-based rehabilitation. Within five years, it is plausible that VR-based intervention would be provided in standalone and mobile-based platforms that won't need a PC to work, with reduced latency and improved user interaction.","Riva, Giuseppe; Mancuso, Valentina; Cavedoni, Silvia; Stramba-Badiale, Chiara",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2020.1825939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962433/,249

Composite razor-thin skin grafting over acellular dermal matrix scaffold has been used successfully in repairing burns of the trunk and limbs, but its use in covering deep facial burns has rarely been reported. In this study, the authors investigated the clinical outcomes of early escharectomy and concurrent composite razor-thin skin autografting and acellular dermal matrix scaffold for treating deep facial burns. METHODS Patients with deep facial burns (n = 16) involving 8 to 30 percent of the total body surface area received early escharectomy by postburn day 3 and concurrent, one-stage, large, razor-thin skin autografting on top of human acellular dermal matrix scaffold. Wound dressings were changed on postoperative days 7, 9, and 12 to examine the survival of skin autografts. Patients were followed up for 12 months to evaluate their facial profiles. RESULTS The take rate of composite skin autografts was 97.3 percent at postoperative day 12. At the follow-up visit, the skin autografts appeared normal in color, with soft texture and good elasticity. The skin junctures showed little scarring. The patients exhibited a chubby facial appearance and abundant expression, except for one patient with microstomia and two patients with ectropion who required further plastic surgical interventions. CONCLUSION Early escharectomy and concurrent composite razor-thin skin autografting on top of acellular dermal matrix scaffold constitute an effective and favorable option for covering deep facial burns, especially for patients with limited donor sites.","Tang, Bing; Zhu, Bin; Liang, Yue-Ying; Bi, Liang-Kuan; Chen, Bin; Hu, Zhi-Cheng; Zhang, Kai; Zhu, Jia-Yuan",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e31820a63e8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21460662/,249

Obesity causes dysregulation throughout the immune system, affecting the balance and levels of cytokines, adipokines, and innate and adaptive immune cells. The present review focuses on the impact of obesity on immune function in children: altering the baseline activation state of immune cells and affecting the ability of the host to combat pathogens and malignancy and respond appropriately to vaccination. RECENT FINDINGS Obesity causes dysregulation of the immune system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of adipose tissue and resident immune cells is quantifying the impact of obesity on the frequency of immune cell subsets and their states. The system-wide alterations in immune function in obesity are most evident upon perturbation, including the response to infection (e.g. increased risk of severe COVID-19 in the ongoing pandemic), vaccination, and malignancy. However, mechanistic research in pediatric obesity is limited and this impacts our ability to care for these children. SUMMARY We must better understand baseline and perturbed immune health in obese children to determine how to account for altered frequency and function of humoral and cellular immune components in acute infection, during vaccine design and when considering therapeutic options for this complex, medically vulnerable group.","Fang, Xingyuan; Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Henrickson, Sarah E",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33105275/,249

However, very little is known about the pathogenesis of SIV or simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in cynomolgus macaques from different Asian countries. In the present study, we analysed the infectivity and pathogenicity of CCR5-tropic SIVmac and those of dual-tropic SHIV89.6P inoculated into cynomolgus macaques in Indonesian, Malaysian or Philippine origin. The plasma viral loads in macaques infected with either SIVmac239 or SHIV89.6P were maintained at high levels. CD4+ T cell levels in macaques infected with SIVmac239 gradually decreased. All of the macaques infected with SHIV89.6P showed greatly reduced CD4+ T-cell numbers within 6 weeks of infection. Eight of the 11 macaques infected with SIVmac239 were killed due to AIDS symptoms after 2-4.5 years, while four of the five macaques infected with SHIV89.6P were killed due to AIDS symptoms after 1-3.5 years. We also analysed cynomolgus macaques infected intrarectally with repeated low, medium or high doses of SIVmac239, SIVmac251 or SHIV89.6P. Infection was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR at more than 5000, 300 and 500 TCID50 for SIVmac239, SIVmac251 and SHIV89.6P, respectively. The present study indicates that cynomolgus macaques of Asian origin are highly susceptible to SIVmac and SHIV infection by both intravenous and mucosal routes. These models will be useful for studies on virus pathogenesis, vaccination and therapeutics against human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS.","Okamura, Tomotaka; Tsujimura, Yusuke; Soma, Shogo; Takahashi, Ichiro; Matsuo, Kazuhiro; Yasutomi, Yasuhiro",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902330/,249

New digital approaches are required for remote scientific exchange. OBJECTIVE This study aims to analyze the options of using an augmented reality device for remote supervision of exercise science examinations. METHODS A mobile ultrasound examination of the diameter and intima-media thickness of the femoral and carotid arteries was remotely supervised using a head-mounted augmented reality device. All participants were provided with a link to a YouTube video of the technique in advance. In part 1, 8 international experts from the fields of engineering and sports science were remotely connected to the study setting. Internet connection speed was noted, and a structured interview was conducted. In part 2, 2 remote supervisors evaluated 8 physicians performing an examination on a healthy human subject. The results were recorded, and an evaluation was conducted using a 25-item questionnaire. RESULTS In part 1, the remote experts were connected over a mean distance of 1587 km to the examination site. Overall transmission quality was good (mean upload speed: 28.7 Mbps, mean download speed: 97.3 Mbps, mean ping: 21.6 milliseconds). In the interview, participants indicated that the main potential benefits would be to the fields of education, movement analysis, and supervision. Challenges regarding internet connection stability and previous training with the devices used were reported. In part 2, physicians' examinations showed good interrater correlation (interclass correlation coefficient: 0.84). Participants valued the experienced setting as highly positive.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of frailty and associated risk of adverse outcomes depending on whether sensory difficulties participated in the definition of frailty. DESIGN Prospective cohort study - GAZEL cohort. SETTING France. PARTICIPANTS The 13,128 subjects who completed a questionnaire in 2012. MEASUREMENTS According to the Strawbridge questionnaire, subjects were considered frail if they reported difficulties in two domains or more among physical, nutritive, cognitive and sensory domains. The risk of adverse health outcomes was assessed by using logistic regression models (hospitalisations, onset of difficulty in performing movements of everyday life) and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models (mortality). RESULTS Mean age was 66.8 +/- 3.4 years and 73.8% were males. The prevalence of frailty varied from 4.4 to 14.2% depending on whether the sensory domain was excluded or included. During follow-up, 182 deaths (1.4%), 479 hospitalisations (3.6%) and 703 cases of new disability (8.0%) were observed. Both definitions of frailty predicted the onset of difficulties to perform everyday movements, with 2 to 3-fold increase in the risk. The inclusion of the sensory domain in the definition made frailty predictive of hospitalisations (Odds Ratio 1.31 [1.01-1.70]) but the association with mortality was only observed when sensory difficulties were ignored (Hazard Ratio 2.28 [1.32-3.92]). CONCLUSION The inclusion of a sensory domain into a frailty screening instrument has a major impact in terms of prevalence and modifies the risk profile associated with frailty. In order to develop the use of frailty screening instruments in clinical practice, further researches will need to carefully evaluate the impact on risk prediction of the different domains involved.","Linard, M; Herr, M; Aegerter, P; Czernichow, S; Goldberg, M; Zins, M; Ankri, J","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-015-0651-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27499304/,249

Its health system attracts little attention, with analyses tending to underplay the differences between the four countries of the UK. This paper helps redress this via a case study of Welsh mental health policy, services and nursing practice. Distinctively, successive devolved governments in Wales have emphasised public planning and provision. Wales also has primary legislation addressing sustainability and future generations, safe nurse staffing and rights of access to mental health services. However, in a context in which gaps always exist between national policy, local services and face-to-face care, evidence points to the existence of tension between Welsh policy aspirations and realities. Mental health nurses in Wales have produced a framework for action, which describes practice exemplars and looks forward to a secure future for the profession. With policy, however enlightened, lacking the singular potency to bring about intended change, nurses as the largest of the professional groups involved in mental health care have opportunities to make a difference in Wales through leadership, influence and collective action.","Hannigan, Ben","Health economics, policy, and law",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133120000456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455606/,249

We tracked changes in partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), oxygen saturation, pulse rate and respiratory rate over 72-minutes of mask-use. All subjects were monitored every 15 minutes, the first 30 minutes while not wearing a mask, and the next 30 minutes while wearing a mask. Children then performed a 12-minute walking test. RESULTS Children did not experience a statistically significant change in oxygen saturation or pulse rate during the study. There was a significant increase in respiratory rate and PETCO2 in those children wearing a mask without an exhalation valve, whereas this was only seen in those children wearing a mask with an exhalation valve after the walking test. CONCLUSION The use of an N95 mask could potentially cause breathing difficulties in children if the mask does not have an exhalation valve, particularly during a physical activity. We believe that it may be more appropriate for children to use a surgical mask.","Lubrano, Riccardo; Bloise, Silvia; Marcellino, Alessia; Ciolli, Claudia Proietti; Testa, Alessia; De Luca, Enrica; Dilillo, Anna; Mallardo, Saverio; Isoldi, Sara; Martucci, Vanessa; Sanseviero, MariaTeresa; Del Giudice, Emanuela; Malvaso, Concetta; Iacovelli, Claudio; Leone, Rita; Iorfida, Donatella; Ventriglia, Flavia",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.05.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043996/,249
120209,Addressing and Eliminating Health Disparities.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Postoperative throat complications after intubation are undesirable but frequent outcomes. A randomized, double-blinded study was performed to determine whether thermal softening of endotracheal tubes reduced throat complications after intubation. METHODS Patients (n= 196) undergoing nasal surgery were randomly allocated into the control group and thermal softening groups. Sore throat and hoarseness were evaluated 1 hour and 24 hours after extubation. The severity of sore throat was evaluated using the numeric rating scale. The primary outcome was the incidence of sore throat 1 hour after extubation and sore throat was defined as a painful or scratchy feeling in the throat. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of hoarseness 1 hour after extubation, the incidence of sore throat and hoarseness 24 hours after extubation, severity of sore throat, and vocal cord injuries. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat 1 hour after extubation was lower in the thermal softening group than in the control group (35.1% vs. 52.7%, P = 0.02). Moreover, thermal softening decreased the mean numeric rating scale score for sore throat in the thermal softening group by 10% an hour after extubation (thermal softening group, 1.29 (95% CI ,0.88-1.70) vs. control group, 2.33 (95% CI ,1.77-2.89); P < 0.01). At 24 hours after extubation, the incidence of sore throat (38.3% vs. 40.7%, P = 0.77) and hoarseness (34.0% vs. 35.2%, 0.95 (0.52-1.74), P = 0.74) were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Intubation using endotracheal tubes with thermal softening significantly decreased the incidence of sore throat 1 hour after extubation when compared with endotracheal tubes without thermal softening.","Yu, Je Hyuk; Paik, Hye-Sun; Ryu, Ho Geol; Lee, Hannah",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926423/,249
121058,The need for a systematic approach to disaster psychosocial response: a suggested competency framework.,2014,"BACKGROUND Nasopharyngoscopy is a common method to evaluate velopharyngeal closure in patients with cleft palate. However, insertion of a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope causes discomfort in patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the reliability of short-time exposure images obtained using 320-row area detector computed tomography (320-ADCT) as a novel evaluation method for the assessment of velopharyngeal function. METHODS We evaluated five healthy adult volunteers and five postoperative adult patients with cleft palate. During a 3.3-s imaging exposure, the participants were asked to perform two tasks: nasal inspiration and subsequent oral expiration through a catheter into a water-filled cup. The movement of the velopharyngeal structures was recorded during each examination, and the presence of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and velopharyngeal closure (VPC) patterns were estimated. If VPI was detected, the cross-sectional area was also calculated. Cohen's kappa and weighted kappa coefficients were used to evaluate the concordance of nasopharyngoscopy and 320-ADCT evaluation. RESULTS Speech pathology evaluation did not reveal hypernasality in any study participant. Micro-VPI was detected by nasopharyngoscopy in one healthy volunteer and two patients. 320-ADCT detected micro-VPI in two more patients. The cross-sectional area of the VPI in these subjects ranged from 2.53 to 16.28 mm2. Nasopharyngoscopy and 320-ADCT were concordant in detecting VPI in eight participants (κ = 0.6) and in assessing VPC patterns in nine (κ = 0.82). Moreover, images obtained using 320-ADCT allowed for reduced dead angle and, thus, easy detection of micro-VPI and Passavant's ridges. CONCLUSION Although the radiation exposure cannot be ignored, our novel evaluation method using 320-ADCT enables more detailed evaluation of VPC than nasopharyngoscopy. Future studies should investigate the relationship between 320-ADCT findings and speech pathology evaluations.","Kobayashi, Yoshikazu; Kanamori, Daisuke; Fujii, Naoko; Kataoka, Yumi; Hirai, Emiko; Yoshioka, Satoshi; Satoh, Koji; Toyama, Hiroshi; Naito, Kensei; Matsuo, Koichiro",BMC medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-019-0350-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286915/,249

We studied serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) or ovarian endometriomas (OE), but no other forms of associated endometriosis disease type. We carried out a case-control study including 19 patients with OE alone (OE group), 14 patients with DIE alone (DIE group) and 24 healthy patients without endometriosis (C group). Serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in the three groups of patients. Serum levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in the OE group. A high positive correlation was found between serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the OE group but not in the DIE and C groups. Serum IL-8 alone achieved the highest predictive value of the presence of OE (adjusted OR: 1.44; sensitivity: 78.2%; specificity: 76.2%). The combination of IL-6 and IL-8 levels did not significantly improve the discrimination between subjects with OE and those with DIE over that of IL-8. OE but not DIE are associated with increased serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8, and thus these may become useful tools for discriminating OE alone from DIE.","Carmona, Francisco; Chapron, Charles; Martínez-Zamora, María-Ángeles; Santulli, Pietro; Rabanal, Aintzane; Martínez-Florensa, Mario; Lozano, Francisco; Balasch, Juan",Journal of reproductive immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2012.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22819248/,249

Exosomes are subsets with lengths between 30 and 100 nanometers, and they can be secreted by different cells. Exosomes are containing different types of miRNAs, mRNAs, and different proteins. The role of immune system modulation of exosomes of mesenchymal stem cells has been studied and confirmed in more than one study. Exosome miRNAs detect and reduce cytokines that cause cytokine storms such as IL-7, IL-2, IL-6, etc. These miRNAs include miR-21, miR-24, miR-124, miR-145, etc. The risks associated with treatment with exosomes from different cells are relatively small compared to other treatments because transplanted cells do not stimulate the host immune system and also has reduced infection transmission. Due to the ineffectiveness of existing drugs in reducing inflammation and preventing cytokine storms, the use of immune-boosting systems may be suggested as another way to control cytokine storm.","Kheirkhah, Amir Hossein; Shahcheraghi, Seyed Hossein; Lotfi, Malihe; Lotfi, Marzieh; Raeisi, Sanaz; Mirani, Zulfiqar",Protein and peptide letters,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929866528666210222150347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618635/,249

The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate a method based on microscopic Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR) mappings to monitor the degradation of such polymers on tissue explant sections, after implantation. This technique provided information on their location and on both their composition and crystallinity, which is directly linked to their state of degradation induced predominantly by chain scissions. An in vitro study was first performed on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) meshes to validate the procedure and the assumption that changes observed on FTIR spectra are indeed a consequence of degradation. Then, mappings of in vivo degraded PLLA meshes were realized to follow up their degradation and to better visualize their degradation mechanisms. This work further warrants its translation to medical implants made of copolymers of lactic acid and to other polyesters.","Leroy, Adrien; Ribeiro, Sofia; Grossiord, Carole; Alves, Antoine; Vestberg, Robert H; Salles, Vincent; Brunon, Céline; Gritsch, Kerstin; Grosgogeat, Brigitte; Bayon, Yves",Journal of materials science.

128820,Could routine pregnancy self-testing facilitate earlier recognition of unintended pregnancy? A feasibility study among South African women.,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND Communication between clinicians, patients, and families is a core component of medical care that requires deliberate practice and feedback to improve. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden transformation in communication practices because of new physical distancing requirements, necessitating physicians to communicate bad news via telephone and video-mediated communication (VMC). This study investigated students' experience with a simulation-based communications training for having difficult conversations using VMC. METHODS Thirty-eight fourth-year medical students preparing for their surgical residency participated in a simulated scenario where students discussed a new COVID-19 diagnosis with a standardised family member (SFM) of a sick patient via VMC. Learners were introduced to an established communications model (SPIKES) by an educational video. After the simulation, SFM and course facilitators guided a debrief and provided feedback. Learners completed surveys evaluating reactions to the training, preparedness to deliver bad news, and attitudes about telehealth. RESULTS Twenty-three students completed evaluation surveys (response rate=61%). Few students had prior formal training (17%) or experience communicating bad news using telehealth (13%). Most respondents rated the session beneficial (96%) and felt they could express empathy using the VMC format (83%). However, only 57% felt ready to deliver bad news independently after the training and 52% reported it was more difficult to communicate without physical presence. Comments highlighted the need for additional practice. CONCLUSION This pilot study demonstrated the value and feasibility of teaching medical students to break bad news using VMC as well as demonstrating the need for additional training.","Rivet, Emily Burke; Cholyway, Renee; Edwards, Cherie; Wishnoff, Matthew; Raza, Omar; Haynes, Susan; Feldman, Moshe",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101333/,249

The plasma pools were made up from donations collected in several different Italian regions from May 2017 to October 2020, i.e. in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS All plasma pools were initially tested for the qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test kit. Plasma pools positive for these antibodies were further tested using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S test kit for the quantitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain. All plasma pools showing reactivity to these antibodies were tested undiluted for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 transcription-mediated amplification assay. Intravenous immunoglobulins were tested using both test kits to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS All plasma pools made up from donations collected in the pre-pandemic period were negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. Of the plasma pools made up from donations collected from December 2018 to March 2020, only 1 pool out of 68 (1.4%), that was made up from donations from the Lombardy region, was reactive for these antibodies. Interestingly, 105 out of 174 (60.3%) of the plasma pools made up from donations collected from November 2018 to October 2020 showed the presence of these antibodies. All plasma pools positive for these antibodies were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and were confirmed positive. DISCUSSION None of these plasma pools tested were reactive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the case of intravenous immunoglobulins, 20 out of 25 (80%) batches showed the presence of both anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, reflecting the concentration in the plasma pools used for their production.","Pisani, Giulio; Cristiano, Karen; Simeoni, Matteo; Martina, Antonio; Pati, Ilaria; Carocci, Alberto; Gaggioli, Andrea; Marino, Francesco; Adriani, Daniela; Pupella, Simonetta; Candura, Fabio; De Angelis, Vincenzo",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2021.0055-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059195/,249

Within a short span, COVID-19 was declared a global public health emergency affecting 214 countries with 5,939,234 confirmed cases and 3,67,255 deaths as of 30 May, 2020. With limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment or vaccine is available till date. AREAS COVERED We performed a review of literature on PubMed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness including trials of preventive and therapeutic measures. This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present pandemic. EXPERT OPINION The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, healthcare professionals and scientists around the world under tremendous pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction and aggressive steps such as 'lockdown'. Clinical trials at different phases are ongoing across different countries to expedite development of effective drugs and vaccine to overcome the pandemic.","Hussain, Arafat; Yadav, Suniti; Hadda, Vijay; Suri, Tejas M; Tiwari, Pawan; Mittal, Saurabh; Madan, Karan; Mohan, Anant",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1782198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32529866/,249

The pandemic is both highly threatening and poorly understood, typical of deeply distressing conditions. Stress associated with uncertain recommendations from authorities, fear of illness and contagion for oneself and one's loved ones, extended periods of isolation, moral conflicts, financial instability, perception of discrimination and/or stigma, and ongoing loss and grief imperil mental health and resilience among the general population and high-risk groups. Health care workers (HCWs) face additional challenges that increase their vulnerability to distress and burnout. Bolstering resilience among HCWs can allow them to continue working with the intensity and focus their jobs require, which in turn supports the overall functioning of the health care system. Given their training in understanding wellness, distress, and psychotherapeutic treatment, mental health clinicians are well positioned to respond to this need. By studying the lessons from past and present experiences with public health emergencies and by incorporating principles from psychotherapeutic literature and training, clinicians can help facilitate an informed and effective response. The goal of this article is to discuss the development of a resilience coaching model that is rooted in principles from psychotherapeutic literature and practice to support psychological well-being among hospital-based HCWs. This model, developed to support the authors' health care colleagues working in a Toronto hospital, is generalizable, can be adapted for use by any mental health clinician, and makes explicit how previous training in psychotherapy may be applied to coaching and supporting frontline HCWs.","Rosen, Benjamin; Preisman, Mary; Hunter, Jonathan; Maunder, Robert",American journal of psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.20200020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985915/,249

OBJECTIVE to describe the weight status of schoolchildren aged 6 to 9 years in Spain in 2019, and their associated factors. METHODS ALADINO is a cross-sectional study in schoolchildren aged 6 to 9 years, representative of the Spanish population, and aligned with the Child Obesity Surveillance Initative of the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Participants' weight, height, and abdominal circumference were measured, defining weight status according to different standards (WHO, IOTF, and Orbegozo). A questionnaire on lifestyle and socio-demographic characteristics was administered to parents. RESULTS a total of 16,665 schoolchildren from 276 schools were measured. Excess weight was observed in 40.6 %: 23.3 % overweight and 17.3 % obesity, with obesity being more prevalent in boys and overweight in girls, both increasing with age. The prevalence of abdominal obesity was 22.6 %. Excess weight decreased by 3.9 percentage points since 2011, mainly due to overweight in boys. Obesity remained stable. Excess weight was more prevalent in schoolchildren with less healthy eating and physical activity habits, and in families with a lower socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS the prevalence of excess weight is high, although it has declined since 2011 and remains stable since 2015 among schoolchildren aged 6-9 years in Spain, this reduction being mainly due to a decrease in overweight in children. It is necessary to continue promoting healthy habits from the earliest stages of life, thus reducing health inequalities.","García Solano, Marta; Gutiérrez González, Enrique; López Sobaler, Ana M; Ruiz Álvarez, Miguel; Bermejo López, Laura M; Aparicio Vizuete, Aránzazu; García López, María Araceli; Yusta Boyo, María José; Robledo de Dios, Teresa; Villar Villalba, Carmen; Dal Re Saavedra, María Ángeles",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.03618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34304573/,249

This review will summarize the current state of the art in the field highlighting its clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS The genetics of PCD have exploded over the past few years as knowledge acquired from model systems has permitted the identification of genes that are key components of the ciliary apparatus and its function. In addition, clinical criteria and diagnostic tools have emerged that permit more clear identification of affected individuals. SUMMARY The rate of progress in the field continues to accelerate through international collaborative efforts and standardization of methods. Although the genetics behind PCD are complex, given the large number of genes associated with disease, as well as the large number of possible mutations even at the individual gene level, this knowledge is rapidly translating in improved diagnostics and hopefully in the near future in the identification of potential therapeutics.","Milla, Carlos E",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27070443/,249

Previous studies indicated that specific Abs to SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) waned over time in recovered SARS patients. It is critical to find out whether a potential anamnestic response, as seen with other viral infections, exists to protect a person from reinfection in case of another SARS outbreak. Recovered SARS patients were followed up to 6 y to estimate the longevity of specific Ab. The specific memory B cell and T cell responses to SARS-CoV Ags were measured by means of ELISPOT assay. Factors in relation to humoral and cellular immunity were investigated. Six years postinfection, specific IgG Ab to SARS-CoV became undetectable in 21 of the 23 former patients. No SARS-CoV Ag-specific memory B cell response was detected in either 23 former SARS patients or 22 close contacts of SARS patients. Memory T cell responses to a pool of SARS-CoV S peptides were identified in 14 of 23 (60.9%) recovered SARS patients, whereas there was no such specific response in either close contacts or healthy controls. Patients with more severe clinical manifestations seemed to present a higher level of Ag-specific memory T cell response. SARS-specific IgG Ab may eventually vanish and peripheral memory B cell responses are undetectable in recovered SARS patients.

148854,Everyday Dangers - The Impact Infectious Disease has on the Health of Paramedics: A Scoping Review.,2017,"Purpose: Speech-language pathologists' (SLPs) role in tracheostomy management is well described internationally. Surveys from Australia and the United Kingdom show high clinical consistency in SLP tracheostomy management, and that practice follows guidelines, research evidence and protocols. Swedish SLPs work with tracheostomised patients, however, the content and extent of this practice, and how it compares to international research is unknown. This study reports how SLPs in Sweden work with tracheostomised patients, investigating (a) the differences and similarities in SLPs tracheostomy management and (b) the facilitators and barriers to tracheostomy management, as reported by SLPs. Methods: A study-specific, online questionnaire was completed by 28 SLPs who had managed tracheostomised patients during the previous year. This study was conducted in 2018, pre Covid-19 pandemic. The answers were analysed for exploratory descriptive comparison of data. Content analyses were made on answers from open-ended questions. Results: Swedish SLPs manage tracheostomised patients, both for dysphagia and communication. During this study, the use of protocols and guidelines were limited and SLPs were often not part of a tracheostomy team. Speech-language pathologists reported that the biggest challenges in tracheostomy management were in (a) collaboration with other professionals, (b) unclear roles and (c) self-perceived inexperience. Improved collaboration with other professionals and clearer roles was suggested to facilitate team tracheostomy management. Conclusions: This study provides insight into SLP tracheostomy management in Sweden, previously uncharted. Results suggest improved collaboration, further education and clinical training as beneficial for a clearer and more involved SLP role in tracheostomy management.","Wiberg, Sara; Whitling, Susanna; Bergström, Liza","Logopedics, phoniatrics, vocology",https://doi.org/10.1080/14015439.2020.1847320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356717/,249

In order to do this, we felt it necessary to summarize the knowledge acquired previously, since the since the disease was first identified in the 1930s. Infectious bronchitis virus is a significant pathogen in the domestic chicken, affecting the respiratory and renal systems as well as the female reproductive tract. The virus exists in the form of many, ever changing, serotypic or genotypic variants, some of which have global distribution whilst others are found only in more local areas. This review mentions the major discoveries concerning both the virus itself and the types of disease it causes and considers recent changes in its pathogenesis. It also discusses the impact of developments in the field of molecular biology and highlights possible areas for future work.","Cook, Jane K A; Jackwood, M; Jones, R C",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2012.680432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22702451/,249

Here we reveal, that both EPO and EPOR are expressed in the developing rat somatosensory cortex during radial migration and laminar positioning of granular and supragranular neurons. Experimental deregulation of EPO signaling using genetic approaches results in aberrant migration as well as permanent neuronal misplacement leading to abnormal network activity and protracted sensory behavioral deficits. We identify ERK as the downstream effector of the EPO signaling pathway for neuronal migration. These findings reveal a critical role for endogenous EPO signaling in neuronal migration and offer important insights for understanding how temporary deregulation of EPO could results in migration defects leading to abnormal behavior in the adult.","Constanthin, Paul E; Contestabile, Alessandro; Petrenko, Volodymyr; Quairiaux, Charles; Salmon, Patrick; Hüppi, Petra S; Kiss, Jozsef Z",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.190249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764029/,249

Design/methodology/approach Using monthly panel data from Airbnb listings in 22 cities worldwide, the authors run a differences-in-differences analysis comparing the period of February-October 2020 to the previous year. Findings Besides a decline in accommodation supply, the pandemic made prices and demand fall in all cities significantly, after controlling for room characteristics, host traits, booking policies and individual fixed effects. There is also evidence of an alteration of the influence on prices of certain variables such as superhost and instant booking. Research limitations/implications The main limitations are related to the reference spatial and temporal environment. Besides, the samples are limited to listings that stayed before and after the pandemic;therefore, it is possible that the real effect on review growth and/or prices is actually more negative. Practical implications The analysis performed shows a scenario that represents an opportunity for public managers to test more imaginative regulations that overcome the limitations of those implemented so far. Likewise, hosts who aspire to make their accommodations profitable must adapt to the conditions imposed by the economic environment of the cities in which they operate.

Here we show that the nanoscale assemblies of phosphopeptides, as a dynamic continuum, cluster ALP to enable caveolae mediated endocytosis (CME) and eventual endosomal escape. Specifically, fluorescent phosphopeptides, as substrates of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), undergo enzyme catalyzed self-assembly to form nanofibers. As shown by live cell imaging, the nanoparticles of phosphopeptides, being incubated with HEK293 cells overexpressing red fluorescent protein-tagged TNAP (TNAP-RFP), cluster TNAP-RFP in lipid rafts to enable CME, further dephosphorylation of the phosphopeptides form the peptide nanofibers for endosomal escape inside cells. Inhibiting TNAP, cleaving the membrane anchored TNAP, or disrupting lipid rafts abolishes the endocytosis. Moreover, decreasing the formation of peptide nanofibers prevents the endosomal escape. As the first study establishing a dynamic continuum of supramolecular assemblies for cellular uptake, this work not only illustrates an effective design for enzyme responsive supramolecular therapeutics, but also provides mechanism insights for understanding the dynamics of cellular uptakes of proteins or exogenous peptide aggregates at nanoscale.","He, Hongjian; Guo, Jiaqi; Xu, Jiashu; Wang, Jiaqing; Liu, Shuang; Xu, Bing",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.435896,249

Although general health checks are often expected and advocated by patients, clinicians, payers, and health systems, others question their value. The current evidence was updated and recommendations provided for conducting general health checks in adults. ObservationsRandomized trials and observational studies with control groups from prior systematic reviews and an updated literature review through December 2020 were included. Out of 19 included randomized trials (906 to 59,616 participants; follow-up, 1 to 30 years), 5 evaluated a single general health check and 7 evaluated annual health checks. All of 12 included observational studies (240 to 471,415 participants; follow-up, cross-sectional to 5 years) evaluated a single general health check. General health checks were generally not associated with decreased mortality, cardiovascular events, or cardiovascular disease incidence. For example, in the South-East London Screening Study (n=7,229), adults age 40 to 64 who were invited to two health checks over two years experienced no 8-year mortality benefit (6% overall). However, general health checks were associated with increased detection of chronic diseases, such as depression and hypertension; moderate improvements in controlling risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol; increased clinical preventive service uptake, such as colorectal and cervical cancer screening; and improvements in patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and self-rated health. General health checks were sometimes associated with modest improvements in health behaviors such as physical activity and diet. For example, in the OXCHECK trial (n=4121), fewer intervention participants exercised less than once per month (68% versus 71%). Potential adverse effects in individual studies included an increased risk of stroke and increased mortality attributed to increased completion of advanced directives. Conclusions and RelevanceGeneral health checks were not associated with reduced mortality or cardiovascular events, but were associated with increased chronic disease recognition and treatment; risk factor control, preventive service uptake, and patient-reported outcomes. Primary care teams may reasonably offer general health checks, especially for groups at high risk of overdue preventive services, uncontrolled risk factors, low self-rated health, or poor connection to primary care.","Liss, D.

181321,Wearable and Continuous Prediction of Passage of Time Perception for Monitoring Mental Health,2021-05-03,"Background: Anticipating an initial shortage of vaccines for COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States developed priority vaccine allocations for specific demographic groups in the population. This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested). Methods: We developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infec- tious virus strains). Under this model, the CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies). Results: The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation. Interpretation: The developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies. Funding: The authors received no funding for this work.","Islam, M. R.; Oraby, T.; McCombs, A.; Chowdhury, M. M.; Al-Mamun, M.; Tyshenko, M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care centre in North India between 2 March-4 April 2020 was performed. The clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, treatment and outcome data of patients were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 75 patients were treated and 56 (74.66%) were men. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranged from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Fever (85.36%) was the most common symptom followed by cough (56.09%) and dyspnoea (19.51%). Findings from hemogram analysis showed that 32%, 21.33% and 18.67% of patients had lymphopaenia, eosinopenia and thrombocytopaenia, respectively. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrin degradation product and interleukin-6 were significantly elevated (P <0.05) in patients who required oxygen therapy than those who did not require it, suggesting the potential role such markers could play in predicting prognosis in patients. Mean hospital stay was 9.2 days and 72 (96%) patients made a complete recovery, but 3 (4%) patients demised after progressing to ARDS. CONCLUSION The clinical and epidemiological spectrum of COVID-19 has jeopardised the health system in India. Without a proven therapy to combat this pandemic and with no sight of vaccines in the near future, a preventive strategy should be adopted to contain the spread of this infectious disease.","Sharma, Shrikant; Keswani, Prakash; Bhargava, Abhishek; Sharma, Ramji; Shekhawat, Ajeet; Bhandari, Sudhir","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000107/,249

197537,Public hospital preparations for SARS outbreak: experience of Alexandra Hospital.,2005,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Chemokines are important inflammatory mediators, and regulate disease due to viral infection. This article will discuss scientific papers published primarily since June 2002 that have introduced new concepts in how chemokines regulate the inflammatory response to specific viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Acute respiratory viruses commonly induce inflammatory chemokines such as CCL3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) and CCL5 (RANTES), which can amplify inflammatory responses leading to immunopathology. Where single agent therapy fails, combination antiviral and anti-CCL3 treatment is synergistic and able to prevent mortality in mice infected with the highly lethal pneumonia virus of mice. Human herpesvirus-6 also induces production of CCL3 and CCL5, which are able to block HIV-1 replication in coinfected human lymphoid tissue. On this basis, Margolis has proposed a new and general approach to the treatment and prevention of infection by viral pathogens. SUMMARY Inflammatory chemokines play both beneficial and harmful roles in infectious diseases caused by viruses. Blocking them or using them as immunomodulators, depending on the virus, may be rational approaches to treatment or prevention of disease. With regard to blockade, combination antiviral/antichemokine therapy is a new strategy worth considering as a general therapeutic approach to viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). With regard to immunomodulation, use of weak or attenuated viruses to skew the local cytokine network to a configuration able to inhibit a pathogen is a new and interesting concept, but is fraught with important safety issues. Identifying master chemokines to target or exploit in human viral infection is a major opportunity and challenge for clinical immunologists.","Glass, William G; Rosenberg, Helene F; Murphy, Philip M",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14612671/,249
201361,Implementation of Telemedicine in a Tertiary Hospital-Based Ambulatory Practice in Detroit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging human infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV is a major virion structural protein. It plays an important role in the interaction with receptors and neutralizing antibodies. In this study, the S1 domain of the spike protein and three truncated fragments were expressed by fusion with GST in a pGEX-6p-1 vector. Western blot results demonstrated that the 510-672 fragment of the S1 domain is a linear epitope dominant region. To map the antigenic epitope of this linear epitope dominant region, a set of 16 partially overlapping fragments spanning the fragment were fused with GST and expressed. Four antigenic epitopes S1C3 (539-559), S1C4 (548-567), S1C7/8 (583-606), and S1C10/11 (607-630) were identified. Immunization of mice with each of the four antigenic epitope-fused proteins revealed that all four proteins could elicit spike protein specific antisera. All of them were able to bind to the surface domain of the whole spike protein expressed by recombinant baculovirus in insect cells. Identification of antigenic epitopes of the spike protein of SARS-CoV may provide the basis for the development of immunity-based prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic clinical techniques for the severe acute respiratory syndrome.","Hua, Rong-Hong; Wang, Yun-Feng; Bu, Zhi-Gao; Zhou, Yan-Jun; Ge, Jin-Ying; Wang, Xi-Jun; Tong, Guang-Zhi",DNA and cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16101348/,249
201362,Implementation of Telemedicine in a Tertiary Hospital-Based Ambulatory Practice in Detroit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study,2021,"Previous studies have shown that human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a potent elicitor of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Induction of the interferon pathway does not require replication-competent virus, and envelope glycoprotein B (gB) from CMV is a viral structural component that can directly induce transcription of ISGs. Here we extend these earlier findings by defining the consequences of inducing the interferon pathway. We found that cells respond to CMV or soluble gB by establishing a functional antiviral state within cell types critical in CMV biology, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We have also discovered new insights into the mechanism by which the pathway is initiated. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a key transcriptional regulator of cellular interferon responses, is activated by CMV virions and soluble gB. Thus, IRF3 becomes activated via ""outside-in"" signal transduction events. This is a novel mechanism of activation of this key transcription factor by viruses. In comparison to soluble gB (gB(1-750)), which comprises the entire ectodomain of gB, a truncation mutant encompassing only the amino-terminal region of gB (gB(1-460)) was markedly less effective at inducing antiviral responses. This indicates that the region of gB from residues 461 to 750 is important for initiation of the antiviral response. In addition, CMV and gB establish an antiviral state in alpha/beta interferon null cells, illustrating that primary induction of ISGs by CMV and gB is sufficient to establish the antiviral response and that interferon secretion is not necessary for the antiviral effect. Taken together, our findings reveal that CMV initiates a coordinated antiviral response through contact between gB and an as-yet-unidentified cell surface receptor(s).","Boehme, Karl W; Singh, Jasbir; Perry, Stuart T; Compton, Teresa",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14722275/,249

It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.","Zuo, Ming-Zhang; Huang, Yu-Guang; Ma, Wu-Hua; Xue, Zhang-Gang; Zhang, Jia-Qiang; Gong, Ya-Hong; Che, Lu",Chin. med. sci. j,,249

DESIGN: We utilised a qualitative interpretative approach to explore education leaders' experiences of leading during the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: Nineteen leaders with significant strategic responsibility for nurse education in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom were identified via purposive sampling and agreed to participate. Interviews were held between May and July 2020. RESULTS: Four overarching themes arose from the analysis: (1) Crisis driven adaptability & flexibility; (2) Responsive, complex and changing communication; (3) Making decisions for student and staff safety; (4) Looking to the future; stronger partnerships. CONCLUSION: Internationally, while nursing education leaders faced different problems, they shared a common goal amidst the crisis to remain student-centred. They demonstrated they were able to face major challenges, respond to large scale logistical problems and make decisions under significant and ongoing pressure. IMPACT: In responding to the pandemic, nurse leaders shared knowledge and offered mutual support. This bodes well for future collaboration. The move to online learning accelerated an existing trend and it seems likely that this will continue. Given the pressures they experienced over an extended period, the sector may wish to consider how it prepares and supports existing and future leaders.","Ion, Robin; Craswell, Alison; Hughes, Lynda; Johnston, Amy; Kilbride, Lynn; Hubbard-Murdoch, Natasha; Massey, Debra",J. adv. nurs,,249

226397,Institutional Distrust among African Americans and Building Trustworthiness in the COVID-19 Response: Implications for Ethical Public Health Practice,2021,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in solid organ transplanted patients. We here report a series of heart transplanted patients with COVID-19 from two centers of Italy. METHODS: All heart transplanted patients of Transplant Centers of Bergamo and Torino with a microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Data collection included clinical presentation, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment and outcome. Follow-up was performed by visit or phone. RESULTS: From February to March 2020 twenty-six heart transplanted patients (age 62±12 years; 77% males; time from transplant 10±10 years; 69% with comorbidities) had a microbiologically confirmed COVID-19. The most frequent symptom was fever, followed by cough. Seventeen patients had a pneumonia, 8 of them severe pneumonia. Seven patients died (27%) and 17 (65%) were hospitalized. Discontinuation of immunosuppression was associated with death (71 vs 21%, p=0.02). Conversely, all patients receiving steroids survived (p<0.001). Patients who received heart transplantation during COVID-19 outbreak survived and no acute graft rejection occurred. Patients who died were older than survivors, had a longer time from transplant and a worse clinical presentation at diagnosis. The current regimen enabled the prolonged survival and function of orthotopic cardiac xenografts in altogether 6 of 8 baboons, of which 4 were now added. These results exceed the threshold set by the Advisory Board of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a significant impact on long term heart transplanted patients. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a limited influence on more recent transplants. Our experience may suggest that heart transplantation programs can be maintained even during the pandemic phase if specific and tailored paths to prevent and to limit virus transmission are provided.","Iacovoni, Attilio; Boffini, Massimo; Pidello, Stefano; Simonato, Erika; Barbero, Cristina; Sebastiani, Roberta; Vittori, Claudia; Fontana, Alessandra; Terzi, Amedeo; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Rinaldi, Mauro",J Heart Lung Transplant,,249
231351,Improving the mental health of abandoned children: Experiences from a global online intervention,2020,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Information regarding co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with vector-borne diseases (malaria and dengue) is crucial especially for the countries wherein malaria and dengue are endemic. The objective was to study the prevalence, demographic, clinical presentations among HCWs with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to compare the viral clearance in HCWs with COVID-19 and co-infection of malaria and dengue. This retrospective study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), Mumbai, India April 6th-October 31st 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was confirmed by reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction. Out of 491 HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2, analysis of viral clearance was carried out in 467 HCWs over seven month periods, The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was 13% (491 out of 3711). Out of the HCWs with COVID-19, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among security guards (25%) with 1% mortality. The co-infection of malaria or dengue was reported in 31 HCWs (6.3%). The mean duration of virus clearance was longer (12 days) in symptomatic HCWs as compared to asymptomatic (8 days, p < .005). The recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was faster (mean 8 days) with co-infection of malaria than without malaria (p < .005). We recommend universal testing of HCWs, to optimize staffing levels during the current pandemic as HCWs are the most precious resource.

At the same time, the pandemic has created challenges for data collection, one of which is interviewer training in the context of social distancing. In sub-Saharan Africa, in-person interviewer training and face-to-face data collection remain the norm, requiring researchers to think creatively about transitioning to remote settings to allow for safer data collection that respects government guidelines. Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA, formerly PMA2020) has collected both cross-sectional and longitudinal data on key reproductive health measures in Africa and Asia since 2013. Relying on partnerships with in-country research institutes and cadres of female interviewers recruited from sampled communities, the project was well-positioned to transition to collecting data on COVID-19 from the onset of the pandemic. This article presents PMA's development of a remote training system for COVID-19 surveys in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, including challenges faced and lessons learned. We demonstrate that remote interviewer training can be a viable approach when data are critically needed and in-person learning is not possible. We also argue against systematic replacement of in-person trainings with remote learning, instead recommending consideration of local context and a project's individual circumstances when contemplating a transition to remote interviewer training.","Turke, Shani; Nehrling, Sarah; Adebayo, Samuel Olanipekun; Akilimali, Pierre; Idiodi, Ivan; Mwangi, Anthony; Larson, Elizabeth; Moreau, Caroline; Anglewicz, Philip",Glob Health Sci Pract,,249
238525,Assessment of gender differences in letters of recommendation for pharmacy residency applicants,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has plunged the world into both social and economic disarray, with vaccines still emerging and a continued paucity of personal protective equipment; the pandemic has also highlighted the potential for rapid emergence of aggressive respiratory pathogens and the need for preparedness. Avian immunoglobulins (IgY) have been previously shown in animal models to protect against new infection and mitigate established infection when applied intranasally. We carried out a proof-of-concept study to address the feasibility of using such antibodies as mucosally-applied prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Hens were immunized with recombinant S1 spike glycoprotein of the virus, and the resulting IgY was evaluated for binding specificity, inhibition of glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein (the requisite binding site for the virus), and inhibition of viral replication in Vero cell culture. RESULTS: Titers of anti-S1 glycoprotein IgY were evident in yolks at 14 days post-immunization, peaking at 21 days, and at peak concentrations of 16.8 mg/ml. IgY showed strong and significant inhibition of S1/ACE2 binding interactions, and significantly inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. Four weeks' collection from eggs of two hens produced a total of 1.55 grams of IgY. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study we showed that avian immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against a key virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully inhibited the critical initial adhesion of viral spike glycoproteins to human ACE2 protein receptors and inhibited viral replication in vitro, in a short period using only two laying hens. We conclude that production of large amounts of IgY inhibiting viral binding and replication of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible, and that incorporation of this or similar material into an intranasal spray and/or other mucosal protecting products may be effective at reducing infection and spread of COVID-19.","Artman, Chad; Brumfield, Kyle D; Khanna, Sahil; Goepp, Julius",PLoS One,,249

We introduce a U.S. School Closure and Distance Learning Database that tracks in-person visits across more than 100,000 schools throughout 2020. The database, which we make publicly accessible and update monthly, describes year-over-year change in in-person visits to each school throughout 2020 to estimate whether the school is engaged in distance learning. Our findings reveal that school closures from September to December 2020 were more common in schools with lower third-grade math scores and higher shares of students from racial/ethnic minorities, who experience homelessness, have limited English proficiency and are eligible for free/reduced-price school lunches. The findings portend rising inequalities in learning outcomes.","Parolin, Zachary; Lee, Emma K",Nat Hum Behav,,249

They have now started relaxing some of those restrictions. To avoid overwhelming health systems, predictions for the number of new COVID-19 cases need to be considered when choosing a school reopening strategy. Using computer simulation, we analyze different strategies to reopen schools in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, including the official reopening plan. Our results indicate that reopening schools with all students at once has a big impact on the number of new COVID-19 cases, which could cause a collapse of the health system. On the other hand, a controlled school reopening avoids the collapse of the health system, with a maximum ICU occupancy between 48.8% and 97.8%, depending on how people attending school follow sanitary measures. Postponing the schools' return date for after a vaccine becomes available can save up to 37,753 lives just in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area.","Cruz, Eduardo H.

In the field of neurology, telemedicine has been used in emergency settings for acute stroke management between spoke and hub hospital networks, where good outcomes have been achieved. However, data on the use of telemedicine in non-stroke acute neurological conditions accessing the emergency department (ED) are currently missing. METHODS AND ANALYSES: This is an interventional, open-label trial on the use of teleconsultation in the ED for neurological diseases other than stroke. The study aims to develop a remote consultancy system (TeleNeurological Evaluation and Support, TeleNS) for patients with acute neurological symptoms referred to hospital facilities without a 24-hour availability of a neurologist consultant (spoke hospitals). The study population will include 100 ED patients referred to two spoke hospitals in 6 months, who will be asked to perform teleconsultation instead of inperson visits. As a control group, retrospectively available data from patients admitted to the ED of spoke hospitals during the same time period over the last 2 years will be evaluated. The primary objective is to assess whether a TeleNS for the ED guarantees a faster but qualitatively non-inferior diagnostic/therapeutic work-up if compared with inperson examination, assuring the availability of all the necessary examinations and treatments with consistent time-saving. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was designed following the national guidelines on clinical investigation on telemedicine provided by the Italian Ministry of Health and according to the Standard Protocol Items for Randomized Trials statement guidelines. This research protocol was approved by Comitato Etico Area Vasta Emilia Nord in September 2020 (number/identification: 942/2020/DISP/AOUMO SIRER ID 805) and was written without patient involvement.

However, data on the use of telemedicine in non-stroke acute neurological conditions accessing the emergency department (ED) are currently missing. METHODS AND ANALYSES: This is an interventional, open-label trial on the use of teleconsultation in the ED for neurological diseases other than stroke. The study aims to develop a remote consultancy system (TeleNeurological Evaluation and Support, TeleNS) for patients with acute neurological symptoms referred to hospital facilities without a 24-hour availability of a neurologist consultant (spoke hospitals). The study population will include 100 ED patients referred to two spoke hospitals in 6 months, who will be asked to perform teleconsultation instead of inperson visits. As a control group, retrospectively available data from patients admitted to the ED of spoke hospitals during the same time period over the last 2 years will be evaluated. The primary objective is to assess whether a TeleNS for the ED guarantees a faster but qualitatively non-inferior diagnostic/therapeutic work-up if compared with inperson examination, assuring the availability of all the necessary examinations and treatments with consistent time-saving. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was designed following the national guidelines on clinical investigation on telemedicine provided by the Italian Ministry of Health and according to the Standard Protocol Items for Randomized Trials statement guidelines. This research protocol was approved by Comitato Etico Area Vasta Emilia Nord in September 2020 (number/identification: 942/2020/DISP/AOUMO SIRER ID 805) and was written without patient involvement. Patients' associations will be involved in the dissemination of study design and results. The results of the study will be presented during scientific symposia or published in scientific journals.

The efficient clinical resource planning and efficient treatment require identification of risk groups and specific clinical features of the patients. In this study we develop analyze mortality for COVID19 patients in Russia. We identify comorbidities and risk factors for different groups of patients including cardiovascular diseases and therapy. In the study we used a Russian national COVID registry, that provides sophisticated information about all the COVID-19 patients in Russia. To analyze Features importance for the mortality we have calculated Shapley values for the ""mortality"" class and ANN hidden layer coefficients for patient lifetime. We calculated the distribution of days spent in hospital before death to show how many days a patient occupies a bed depending on the age and the severity of the disease to allow optimal resource planning and enable age-based risk assessment. Predictors of the days spent in hospital were calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient. Decisions trees were developed to classify the patients into the groups and reveal the lethality factors.","Metsker, Oleg; Kopanitsa, Georgy; Yakovlev, Alexey; Veronika, Karlina; Zvartau, Nadezhda",Stud Health Technol Inform,,249
243890,Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong,2021,"COVID-19 has disproportionately affected persons who identify as non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (1). The Blackfeet Tribal Reservation, the northern Montana home of the sovereign Blackfeet Nation, with an estimated population of 10,629 (2), detected the first COVID-19 case in the community on June 16, 2020. Following CDC guidance,* and with free testing widely available, the Indian Health Service and Blackfeet Tribal Health Department began investigating all confirmed cases and their contacts on June 25. The relationship between three community mitigation resolutions passed and enforced by the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council and changes in the daily COVID-19 incidence and in the distributions of new cases was assessed. After the September 28 issuance of a strictly enforced stay-at-home order and adoption of a mask use resolution, COVID-19 incidence in the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation decreased by a factor of 33 from its peak of 6.40 cases per 1,000 residents per day on October 5 to 0.19 on November 7. Other mitigation measures the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation used included closing the east gate of Glacier National Park for the summer tourism season, instituting remote learning for public school students throughout the fall semester, and providing a Thanksgiving meal to every household to reduce trips to grocery stores. CDC has recommended use of routine public health interventions for infectious diseases, including case investigation with prompt isolation, contact tracing, and immediate quarantine after exposure to prevent and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (3). Stay-at-home orders, physical distancing, and mask wearing indoors, outdoors when physical distancing is not possible, or when in close contact with infected or exposed persons are also recommended as nonpharmaceutical community mitigation measures (3,4). Implementation and strict enforcement of stay-at-home orders and a mask use mandate likely helped reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the Blackfeet Tribal Reservation.","Pratt, Caroline Q; Chard, Anna N; LaPine, Rosaula; Galbreath, K Webb; Crawford, Cinnamon; Plant, Albert; Stiffarm, Garland; Rhodes, Neil Sun; Hannon, Lorissa; Dinh, Thu-Ha",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,249

247550,The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic's impact on mental health,2020,"We report a multicentric retrospective case series of patients with COVID-19 who developed acute kidney injury and/or proteinuria and underwent a kidney biopsy in the Paris and its metropolitan area. Forty-seven patients (80.9% men) with COVID-19 who underwent a kidney biopsy between March 08 and May 19, 2020 were included. Median age was 63 years IQR [52-69]. Comorbidities included hypertension (66.0%), diabetes mellitus (27.7%), obesity (27.7%), history of chronic kidney (25.5%), cardiac (38.6%) and respiratory (27.3%) diseases. Initial symptoms were fever (85.1%), cough (63.8%), shortness of breath (55.3%), and diarrhea (23.4%). Almost all patients developed acute kidney injury (97.9%) and 63.8% required renal replacement therapy. Kidney biopsy showed two main histopathological patterns, including acute tubular injury in 20 (42.6%) patients, and glomerular injury consisting of collapsing glomerulopathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 17 (36.2%) patients. Two (4.3%) patients had acute vascular nephropathy, while eight (17%) had alternative diagnosis most likely unrelated to COVID-19. Acute tubular injury occurred almost invariably in the setting of severe forms of COVID-19, whereas patients with glomerular injury had various profiles of COVID-19 severity and collapsing glomerulopathy was only observed in patients harboring a combination of APOL1 risk variants. At last follow-up, 16 of the 30 patients who initially required dialysis were still on dialysis, and 9 died. The present study describes the spectrum of kidney lesions in patients with COVID-19. While acute tubular injury is correlated with COVID-19 severity, the pattern of glomerular injury is intimately associated with the expression of APOL1 risk variants.","Ferlicot, Sophie; Jamme, Matthieu; Gaillard, François; Oniszczuk, Julie; Couturier, Aymeric; May, Olivia; Grünenwald, Anne; Sannier, Aurélie; Moktefi, Anissa; Le Monnier, Ophélie; Petit-Hoang, Camille; Maroun, Nadine; Brodin-Sartorius, Albane; Michon, Arthur; Dobosziewicz, Hélène; Andreelli, Fabrizio; Guillet, Matthieu; Izzedine, Hassane; Richard, Christian; Dekeyser, Manon; Arrestier, Romain; Sthelé, Thomas; Lefèvre, Edouard; Mathian, Alexis; Legendre, Christophe; Mussini, Charlotte; Verpont, Marie-Christine; Pallet, Nicolas; Amoura, Zahir; Essig, Marie; Snanoudj, Renaud; Brocheriou-Spelle, Isabelle; François, Hélène; Belenfant, Xavier; Geri, Guillaume; Daugas, Eric; Audard, Vincent; Buob, David; Massy, Ziad A; Zaidan, Mohamad",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,249

Therefore, the business continuity management (BCM) has become an essential technical solution for enterprise emergency response. Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 has spread worldwide at an alarming rate causing many threats to sustainable development of the business sector. The decline in consumer demand has hugely impacted service industries, such as wholesale and retail sales, tourism. Enterprise production and operations have faced severe challenges. In this study, we develop a risk factor analysis of BCM under the presence of COVID-19 in China. Based on a statistical survey of 940 enterprises in Hangzhou City, China, this study employs ordinal logistic regression to explore the hindering effect of risk factors introduced by the epidemic on business performance. Then, the interpretive structure model (ISM) is applied to analyze the hierarchical structure of the factors under examination. The key factors influencing the enterprise production and operation during COVID-19 outbreak significantly differ across the sub-sectors of the service industry. Therefore, this paper assesses the resilience of the productive technologies and business models of different industries amid the pandemic. This paper proposes epidemic prevention and control strategy focusing on investment and government regulation to ensure sustainable business development.","Chen, Ji Huang Jiayan Su Weihua Štreimikienė Dalia Baležentis Tomas",Technology in Society,,249

METHODS: From March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective analysis of consecutive hospitalized adult patients receiving TCZ to treat severe COVID-19 was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,092 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period. Of them, 186 (17%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8%) in combination with CS. Of the total 186 patients, 155 (83.3 %) patients were receiving noninvasive ventilation when TCZ was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use was 12 (±4.3) and 4.3 days (±3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79%) survived and 39 (21%) died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR = 1.09, p < 0.001), chronic heart failure (HR = 4.4, p = 0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR = 4.69, p = 0.004). The use of CS, in combination with TCZ, was identified as a protective factor against mortality (HR = 0.26, p < 0.001) in such severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ. No serious superinfections were observed after a 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe COVID-19 receiving TCZ due to systemic host-immune inflammatory response syndrome, the use of CS in addition to TCZ therapy, showed a beneficial effect in preventing in-hospital mortality.","Rubio-Rivas, Manuel; Ronda, Mar; Padulles, Ariadna; Mitjavila, Francesca; Riera-Mestre, Antoni; García-Forero, Carlos; Iriarte, Adriana; Mora, Jose M; Padulles, Nuria; Gonzalez, Monica; Solanich, Xavier; Gasa, Merce; Suarez-Cuartin, Guillermo; Sabater, Joan; Perez-Fernandez, Xose L; Santacana, Eugenia; Leiva, Elisabet; Ariza-Sole, Albert; Dallaglio, Paolo D; Quero, Maria; Soriano, Antonio; Pasqualetto, Alberto; Koo, Maylin; Esteve, Virginia; Antoli, Arnau; Moreno-Gonzalez, Rafael; Yun, Sergi; Cerda, Pau; Llaberia, Mariona; Formiga, Francesc; Fanlo, Marta; Montero, Abelardo; Chivite, David; Capdevila, Olga; Bolao, Ferran; Pinto, Xavier; Llop, Josep; Sabate, Antoni; Guardiola, Jordi; Cruzado, Josep M; Comin-Colet, Josep; Santos, Salud; Jodar, Ramon; Corbella, Xavier",Int J Infect Dis,,249
262913,Effect of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal services - Authors' reply,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by heterogeneity in susceptibility to the disease and severity of illness. Understanding inter-individual variation has important implications for not only allocation of resources but also targeting patients for escalation of care, inclusion in clinical trials, and individualized medical therapy including vaccination. In addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, underlying genetic variation, and differential immune response that contribute to variability in disease manifestation. These differences may have implications for precision medicine. Specific examples include the observation that androgens regulate the expression of the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 which facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral entry into the cell; therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is being explored as a treatment option in males infected with COVID-19. An immunophenotyping study of COVID-19 patients has shown that a subset develop T cytopenia which has prompted a clinical trial that is testing the efficacy of interleukin-7 in these patients. Predicting which COVID-19 patients will develop progressive disease that will require hospitalization has important implications for clinical trials that target outpatients. Enrollment of patients at low risk for progression of disease and hospitalization would likely not result in such therapy demonstrating efficacy. There are efforts to use artificial intelligence to integrate digital data from smartwatch applications or digital monitoring systems and biological data to enable identification of the high risk COVID-19 patient. The ultimate goal of precision medicine using such modern technology is to recognize individual differences to improve health for all.","Pereira, Naveen L; Ahmad, Ferhaan; Byku, Mirnela; Cummins, Nathan W; Morris, Alanna A; Owens, Anjali; Tuteja, Sony; Cresci, Sharon",Mayo Clin Proc,,249
264763,Digital or Digitally Delivered Responses to Domestic and Intimate Partner Violence During COVID-19,2020,"The speed by which the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world caught some national and local governments unprepared. Healthcare systems found themselves struggling to increase capacity and procure key supplies, such as personal protective equipment. Protective face shields became essential for healthcare professionals. However, most hospitals and healthcare facilities did not have them in adequate quantities. The urgency of producing and delivering face shields increased as the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly multiplied. This was the situation that we encountered in the city and province of Burgos (Spain). Since there was no time to wait for a large manufacturer to produce face shields, private citizens and small companies volunteered to make them using technologies such as 3D printers. Nonprofits, citizens, and governments agencies volunteered to deliver materials to the face shield makers and to pick up and deliver the face shields to health centers and other locations where they were needed. This resulted in a vehicle routing problem with some special characteristics that made it different from models used for commercial purposes. We describe the development of a heuristic to find feasible and efficient routes for this problem. We highlight the advantages of using heuristics in an emergency context like the one triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the heuristic approach allowed us to design, implement, test, and delivery a routing system in less than 1 week from the time that the local government contacted us with what they described as a logistics nightmare.","Pacheco, Joaquín; Laguna, Manuel",J Heuristics,,249

By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalisations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that the effect of school closure is visible as a reduction in the growth rate approximately 9 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. A large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible in countries such as Denmark or Norway, where community transmission is generally low. However, school reopening can contribute to significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy and a solid infrastructure to quickly identify and isolate new infections.","Stage, Helena B.; Shingleton, Joseph; Ghosh, Sanmitra; Scarabel, Francesca; Pellis, Lorenzo; Finnie, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14158v1.pdf,249

The safety of PVP-I topically applied to the nasal and oral cavity is addressed by a literature review. The specific efficacy of PVP-I against coronaviruses and its potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is discussed. METHODS: A review was performed utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Databases. All citations in protocols for nasal and oral PVP-I use regarding COVID-19 were independently reviewed. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine has been safely administered for up to 5 months in the nasal cavity and 6 months in the oral cavity. Concentrations less than 2.5% in vitro do not reduce ciliary beat frequency or cause pathological changes in ciliated nasal epithelium, upper respiratory, or mucosal cells. Adverse events with oral use have not been reported in conscious adults or children. Allergy and contact sensitivity is rare. Chronic mucosal use up to 5% has not been shown to result in clinical thyroid disease. PVP-I is rapidly virucidal and inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CONCLUSIONS: Povidone-iodine can safely be used in the nose at concentrations up to 1.25% and in the mouth at concentrations up to 2.5% for up to 5 months. Povidone-iodine rapidly inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, when applied for as little as 15 seconds. There is optimism that PVP-I can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, but in vitro efficacy has not yet been demonstrated.","Frank, Samantha; Capriotti, Joseph; Brown, Seth M; Tessema, Belachew",Ear Nose Throat J,,249

272550,CBT-Vaccination: A Public Health Approach to Support the Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney; however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients hospitalized between March 13th and May 19th, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI. This data may inform future studies to discover the mechanistic basis of COVID-19 associated AKI.","Paranjpe, Ishan; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Johnson, Kipp W; Jaladanki, Suraj K; Zhao, Shan; De Freitas, Jessica K; Pujdas, Elisabet; Chaudhry, Fayzan; Bottinger, Erwin P; Levin, Matthew A; Fayad, Zahi A; Charney, Alexander W; Houldsworth, Jane; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Nadkarni, Girish N",PLoS One,,249

Thus, as of March 16 of 2021, vaccination programs in 18 countries had been suspended until further examination, including Sweden, Germany and France. This disorder presents as extensive thrombosis in atypical sites, primarily in the cerebral venous, alongside thrombocytopenia and the production of autoantibody against platelet-factor 4 (PF4). PF4 autoantibody has the ability to binds the human FcRÎ³IIA receptor of platelets and contribute to their aggregation. This rare adverse effect extremely resembles the clinical presentation of the classical immune-mediated HIT disorder, which occurs following exposure to heparin. Surprisingly, none of these patients had been pre-exposed to heparin before disease onset, leading to the hypothesis that a viral antigen from the vaccine had triggered the response. Importantly, COVID-19 had been associated with numerous autoimmune manifestations, including the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, new onset of autoimmune diseases and disorders. As the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination leads to the synthesis of specific SARS-CoV-2-proteins, they may trigger a production of PF4 autoantibody though molecular mimicry phenomena, while vaccination compounds lead to a rigorous bystander activation of immune cells. If existing, removing such homological sequences from the vaccine may eliminate this phenomenon. In contrast, it needs to be emphasized that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized controlled trials, which included 23,848 participants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa.","Dotan, Arad; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",J Autoimmun,,249
277326,Mental health plan for workers of the London Nightingale Hospital: following the evidence to support staff,2020,"Liver injury has been described with COVID-19, and early reports suggested 2%-11% of patients had chronic liver disease (CLD). In this multicentre retrospective study, we evaluated hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and the impact of CLD on relevant clinical outcomes. Of 363 patients included, 19% had CLD, including 15.2% with NAFLD. Patients with CLD had longer length of stay. After controlling for age, gender, obesity, cardiac diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes and pulmonary disorders, CLD and NAFLD were independently associated with ICU admission ([aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.03-3.04] and [aOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.27-4.17]) and mechanical ventilation ([aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.20-3.60] and [aOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.18-3.91]). Presence of cirrhosis was an independent predictor of mortality (aOR 12.5, 95% CI 2.16-72.5). Overall, nearly one-fifth of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had CLD, which was associated with more critical illness. Future studies are needed to identify interventions to improve clinical outcomes.","Hashemi, Nikroo; Viveiros, Kathleen; Redd, Walker D; Zhou, Joyce C; McCarty, Thomas R; Bazarbashi, Ahmad N; Hathorn, Kelly E; Wong, Danny; Njie, Cheikh; Shen, Lin; Chan, Walter W",Liver Int,,249

Many United States nursing homes have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet little has been described regarding the typical disease course in this population. The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID-19. SETTING AND METHODS: This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID-19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28th - June 17th 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31st , 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over three weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID-19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID-19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post-disease. Future studies should combine data from nursing home residents across the country to identify the risk factors for disease trajectories identified in this case series.","Carnahan, Jennifer L; Lieb, Kristi M; Albert, Lauren; Wagle, Kamal; Kaehr, Ellen; Unroe, Kathleen T",J. am. geriatr. soc,,249
288969,Maintaining trauma center operational readiness during a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health concern. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for disease control. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification assay similar to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the former being a simple, low cost, and rapid method. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the RT-LAMP assay with RT-PCR using the Loopamp&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and fifty-one nasopharyngeal swab and 88 sputum samples obtained from individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: RT-LAMP had high specificity (98.5 % (95 % CI: 96.9-100 %)), sensitivity (87.0 % (95 % CI: 82.8-91.3 %)), positive predictive value (97.9 % (95 % CI: 96.1-99.7 %)), negative predictive value (90.2 % (95 % CI: 86.4-94.0 %)), and concordance rate (93.3 % (95 % CI: 90.1-96.5 %)). Nasopharyngeal and sputum samples positive in RT-LAMP contained as few as 10.2 and 23.4 copies per 10 µL, respectively. RT-LAMP showed similar performance to RT-PCR for samples with cycle threshold value below 36. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that RT-LAMP is a highly reliable and at least equivalent to RT-PCR in utility, and potentially applicable in settings that are more diverse as a point-of-care tool.","Kitajima, Heita; Tamura, Yoshitaka; Yoshida, Hiroko; Kinoshita, Hitomi; Katsuta, Hiroki; Matsui, Chika; Matsushita, Akane; Arai, Tsuyoshi; Hashimoto, Shoji; Iuchi, Atsuhiko; Hirashima, Tomonori; Morishita, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Hiroto; Tanaka, Toshio; Nagai, Takayuki",J Clin Virol,,249

COVID-19 pandemic has claimed about one million deaths in less than a year. However, it is unclear whether exposure to acute and chronic air pollution influences the COVID-19 epidemiologic curve. METHODS: We searched for relevant studies listed in six electronic databases between December 2019 and September 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits. Studies presented as original articles, studies that assessed risk, incidence, prevalence, or lethality of COVID-19 in relation with exposure to either short-term or long-term exposure to ambient air pollution were included. All patients regardless of age, sex and location diagnosed as having COVID-19 of any severity were taken into consideration. We synthesised results using harvest plots based on effect direction. RESULTS: Included studies were cross-sectional (n = 10), retrospective cohorts (n = 9), ecological (n = 6 of which two were time-series) and hypothesis (n = 1). Of these studies, 52 and 48% assessed the effect of short-term and long-term pollutant exposure, respectively and one evaluated both. Pollutants mostly studied were PM2.5 (64%), NO2 (50%), PM10 (43%) and O3 (29%) for acute effects and PM2.5 (85%), NO2 (39%) and O3 (23%) then PM10 (15%) for chronic effects. Most assessed COVID-19 outcomes were incidence and mortality rate. Acutely, pollutants independently associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality were first PM2.5 then PM10, NO2 and O3 (only for incident cases). Chronically, similar relationships were found for PM2.5 and NO2. High overall risk of bias judgments (86 and 39% in short-term and long-term exposure studies, respectively) was predominantly due to a failure to adjust aggregated data for important confounders, and to a lesser extent because of a lack of comparative analysis. CONCLUSION: The body of evidence indicates that both acute and chronic exposure to air pollution can affect COVID-19 epidemiology. The evidence is unclear for acute exposure due to a higher level of bias in existing studies as compared to moderate evidence with chronic exposure. Public health interventions that help minimize anthropogenic pollutant source and socio-economic injustice/disparities may reduce the planetary threat posed by both COVID-19 and air pollution pandemics.","Katoto, Patrick D M C; Brand, Amanda S; Bakan, Buket; Obadia, Paul Musa; Kuhangana, Carsi; Kayembe-Kitenge, Tony; Kitenge, Joseph Pyana; Nkulu, Celestin Banza Lubaba; Vanoirbeek, Jeroen; Nawrot, Tim S; Hoet, Peter; Nemery, Benoit",Environ Health,,249

The purpose of this study was to determine whether HCQ administration is associated with improved mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected during the care process for COVID-19 positive patients discharged from facilities affiliated with a large healthcare system in the United States as of April 27, 2020. Patients were categorized by treatment with HCQ (in addition to standard supportive therapy) or receipt of supportive therapy with no HCQ. Patient outcomes were evaluated for in-hospital mortality. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were accounted for through a multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1669 patients were evaluated (no HCQ, n = 696; HCQ, n = 973). When adjusting for patient characteristics, receipt of AZM, and severity of disease at admission, there was no beneficial effect of receipt of HCQ on the risk of death. In this population, there was an 81% increase in the risk of mortality among patients who received HCQ at any time during their hospital stay versus no HCQ exposure (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.20-2.77, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, we found that there was no benefit of administration of HCQ on mortality in COVID-19 patients. These results support recent changes to clinical trials that discourage the use of HCQ in COVID-19 patients.","Sands, Kenneth; Wenzel, Richard; McLean, Laura; Korwek, Kimberly; Roach, Jonathon; Miller, Karla; Poland, Russell E; Burgess, L Hayley; Jackson, Edmund; Perlin, Jonathan B",Int J Infect Dis,,249

321101,FDA's commitment to transparency,2021,"The chest X-ray plays a key role in screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases including the COVID-19. More recently, many works construct deep neural networks (DNNs) for chest X-ray images to realize automated and efficient diagnosis of lung diseases. However, bias field caused by the improper medical image acquisition process widely exists in the chest X-ray images while the robustness of DNNs to the bias field is rarely explored, which definitely poses a threat to the X-ray-based automated diagnosis system. In this paper, we study this problem based on the recent adversarial attack and propose a brand new attack, i.e., the adversarial bias field attack where the bias field instead of the additive noise works as the adversarial perturbations for fooling the DNNs. This novel attack posts a key problem: how to locally tune the bias field to realize high attack success rate while maintaining its spatial smoothness to guarantee high realisticity. These two goals contradict each other and thus has made the attack significantly challenging. To overcome this challenge, we propose the adversarial-smooth bias field attack that can locally tune the bias field with joint smooth&adversarial constraints. As a result, the adversarial X-ray images can not only fool the DNNs effectively but also retain very high level of realisticity. We validate our method on real chest X-ray datasets with powerful DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, DenseNet121, and MobileNet, and show different properties to the state-of-the-art attacks in both image realisticity and attack transferability. Our method reveals the potential threat to the DNN-based X-ray automated diagnosis and can definitely benefit the development of bias-field-robust automated diagnosis system.","Tian, Binyu; Guo, Qing; Juefei-Xu, Felix; Chan, Wen Le; Cheng, Yupeng; Li, Xiaohong; Xie, Xiaofei; Qin, Shengchao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09247v2.pdf,249

323144,Justice for George Floyd and a reckoning for global mental health,2020,"Background: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) has been proposed to guide the allocation of resources in acute care during the pandemic, but the association between frailty and COVID-19 prognosis is still unclear. We investigated the effect of frailty on mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Cohort study comprising 1,830 patients aged ≥ 50 years with COVID-19 admitted to a large academic medical center in Brazil. We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1-9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1-3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7-9). We also assessed the Frailty Index (0-1;frail &gt; 0.25), a well-validated frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time-to-death within 30 and 100 days of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity- measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Results: Patients had a median age of 66 years (range = 50-100 years), 58% were male, and 27% were frail according to the CFS. Compared with fit to managing well patients, those with greater CFS scores presented a higher risk of mortality (Table 1). The CFS also predicted different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and SOFA scores and worked as an effect modifier on the association between acute morbidity and 100-day mortality (P-value for interaction = 0.01). Of note, the CFS achieved outstanding accuracy to identify frailty according to Frailty Index (area under the ROC curve = 0.94;95% CI = 0.93-0.95). Conclusions: Our results encourage the use of the CFS, alongside measures of acute morbidity, to guide clinicians in prognostication and resource allocation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Aliberti, M.; Avelino-Silva, T.

330453,Mental Health of Staff in a Key Frontline Hospital During COVID-19: A Single-Center Cross-Sectional China-Based Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused enormous stress among the public in China. Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to fight against COVID-19, including understanding of the public's emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., perceived severity, perceived controllability, and knowledge of COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. METHODS: Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17-90 years, Mage = 23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in a cross-sectional survey online. RESULTS: The results showed that the public's emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of structural equation model with latent variables revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables (i.e., negative emotion, positive emotion, sleep problems, aggression, substance use, mobile phone use, social participation, and precautionary behaviour). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the public's emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern. Practically, the findings facilitate the government and practitioners to design and deliver targeted intervention programs to the public.","Li, Jian-Bin; Yang, An; Dou, Kai; Wang, Lin-Xin; Zhang, Ming-Chen; Lin, Xiao-Qi",BMC Public Health,,249
330795,Impact of a clinical decision support tool targeting QT-prolonging medications,2020,"Purpose of Review: Acute respiratory infections of viral etiology (ARIVE) constitute one of the most frequent infectious processes among humans. They cause significant morbidity and mortality every year in all age groups and regions of the world. Their etiology is diverse, and seasonal viruses began their journey, at some point, with an episode of expansion before their annual circulation as seasonal agents. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for Latin America. Understanding dynamics is essential for decision making, to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. Recent Findings: Currently, governments in Latin America have taken measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 primarily based on World Health Organization recommendations. However, the potential impact of the virus in Latin America is still unknown. Given the urgency, governments need more accurate estimates of what could happen in Latin America in order to make informed decisions, At the September 20, 2020, cumulative cases 2295 of COVID-19 per 1 million population has been registered in Latin America and the Caribbean. Brazil, Peru, and Chile are the most countries affected by this pandemic, registering a total of cumulative cases per million inhabitants of 21,148, 22,941, and 23,262 respectively. Peru has shown the highest death numbers with 949 per million inhabitants. Summary: The Latin American health authorities should make the most beneficial decisions based in scientific facts for the health and life of citizens, both understood in the broadest and most inclusive sense.Once the epidemic is over, Latin America should begin a profound health reform, at a single and universal health system, integrated and coordinated, where the leading role of the Ministry of Health is resumed, to have a national network of modern, integrated, and excellent quality laboratories for the benefit of the entire society.","Callejas, Diana; Echevarría, José M; Carrero, Yenddy; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Moreira, Ruth",Curr Trop Med Rep,,249

We subsequently aimed to describe the main chest radiograph findings in another cohort, focusing on zonal predominance. The admission chest radiographs of 111 patients with CO-VID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care admission were reviewed by 2 thoracic radiologists and categorized according to the predominant pattern into either ground-glass opacities (GGOs), alveolar infiltrates and/or consolidation, or reticular and/or nodular infiltrates or an equal combination of both, and the extent of disease involvement of each of the zones using a modified Radiologic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score. Parenchymal changes were detected in all. In total, 106 radiographs showed GGOs, alveolar infiltrates, and/or consolidation, and 5 had a combination of reticular/nodular infiltrates as well as GGOs, alveolar infiltrates, and/or consolidation.

333428,A Public Health COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy to Maximize the Health Gains for Every Single Vaccine Dose,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is a pandemic with an estimated death rate between 1% and 5%; and an estimated R0between 2.2 and 6.7 according to various sources. As of March 28th, 2020, there were over 649,000 confirmed cases and 30,249 total deaths, globally. In the United States, there were over 115,500 cases and 1891 deaths and this number is likely to increase rapidly. It is critical to detect clusters of COVID-19 to better allocate resources and improve decision-making as the outbreaks continue to grow. Using daily case data at the county level provided by Johns Hopkins University, we conducted a prospective spatial-temporal analysis with SaTScan. We detect statistically significant space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. between January 22nd-March 9th, 2020, and January 22nd-March 27th, 2020. The space-time prospective scan statistic detected “active” and emerging clusters that are present at the end of our study periods – notably, 18 more clusters were detected when adding the updated case data. These timely results can inform public health officials and decision makers about where to improve the allocation of resources, testing sites; also, where to implement stricter quarantines and travel bans. As more data becomes available, the statistic can be rerun to support timely surveillance of COVID-19, demonstrated here.

Matériels et méthodes Étude observationnelle monocentrique portant sur l’ensemble des patients HDC à qui la vaccination contre la COVID-19 par le vaccin à ARNm BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech®) a été proposée. Deux injections ont été réalisées à 28j d’intervalle, dans le bras opposé à l’abord vasculaire. Les données cliniques ont été recueillies prospectivement. La recherche d’anticorps spécifiques (IgG et IgM anti-protéine Spike) a été réalisée par immunochromatographie (COVID-19 BSS, Biosynex®) sur des sérums collectés avant la première injection, puis avant la seconde et 1 mois après. Les résultats sont exprimés en médiane [IQR : 25–75] ou %. Résultats Entre le 15 janvier et le 21 mars 2021, la vaccination a été proposée aux 55 patients du centre et acceptée par 49 (89,1 %) patients, les 6 autres ayant refusé. Parmi les 49 patients vaccinés, l’âge médian est de 70 [63–82,5] ans, 17 (34,7 %) sont diabétiques, et 8 (16,3 %) ont une greffe d’organe solide. La durée médiane en dialyse à la vaccination est de 26,2 [17,8–49,9] mois ;les patients sont dialysés sur une membrane en polysulfone (PSF), sauf 4 (8,2 %) sur une membrane en polyméthylmétacrylate (PMMA). La séroprévalence en IgG à j0 est de 12,2 % (6/49 patients, dont 4 ayant un antécédent de COVID symptomatique de plus de 3 mois, avec PCR positive). Parmi les 43 patients séronégatifs à l’inclusion, 10 sont encore en cours de vaccination. Les 33 patients ayant complété le schéma vaccinal ont les résultats suivants, respectivement avant la seconde injection et 1 mois après : IgM, 9,1 % (3 patients) et 12,1 % (4 patients) ;IgG, 9,1 % (3 patients) et 87,9 % (29 patients). Tous les patients positifs en IgM le sont également en IgG (aucun n’a développé de signes cliniques évocateurs de COVID-19 dans le suivi).

347148,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Potential implications for weak health systems and conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa region,2020,"COVID-19-related restrictions may have a serious impact on patients with eating disorders. We conducted semistructured interviews with female adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) (n = 13, 13-18 years) currently receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment and their parents (n = 10). We asked for their experiences during COVID-19 confinement regarding everyday life, AN symptoms, and treatment. We used thematic analysis to interpret the data. The main themes identified from the patients' interviews involved restrictions of personal freedom (i.e., leading to tension between patients and family members, reduced motivation to work on recovery), interruption of the treatment routine (emerging risks through self-monitored weight, challenges/opportunities of teletherapy), changes in AN symptoms (more exposure to triggering situations), COVID-19-related fears, and compulsions but also potential opportunities (less stress, better family relationships). The parents discussed changes in daily routines as negative (challenges in maintaining day structures) and positive (more family time, ""slowing down""). They expressed reservations about reduced outpatient monitoring and increased teletherapy and discussed challenges in keeping contact with the child and clinicians during inpatient treatment. Moreover, the parents discussed deteriorations and improvements in the patients' psychopathology. Clinical implications from these in-depth insights include the importance of strengthening communication between changing staff cohorts, patients, and parents; motivational work; and joint weight monitoring with the therapist.","Zeiler, Michael; Wittek, Tanja; Kahlenberg, Leonie; Gröbner, Eva-Maria; Nitsch, Martina; Wagner, Gudrun; Truttmann, Stefanie; Krauss, Helene; Waldherr, Karin; Karwautz, Andreas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,249

The present study aimed to obtain further information regarding the effects of these toxins on neurodevelopment by investigating the responses of murine subventricular zone (SVZ) neural progenitors to STXs. An in vitro neonatal mouse SVZ explant model was exposed to different concentrations of toxic cyanobacterial extracts to evaluate the migration and differentiation of SVZ-derived progenitor cells. To test the ability of STX to cross the placental barrier, pregnant mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of STXs (7.5â¯µg/kg body weight) on gestational day fifteen. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect proliferating and differentiating progenitors, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). It was found that specific proliferation of OPCs was significantly increased, but there was no corresponding increase in the number of differentiated oligodendrocytes, which may indicate a negative effect on the maturation process of these cells. Additionally, the data showed that STXs crossed the placental barrier. Thus, STXs can be considered a potential risk to fetal neurodevelopment.","Lima-Filho, Cesar Macedo; Nogaroli, Luciana; Hedin-Pereira, Cecilia; Azevedo, Sandra M F O; Soares, Raquel M",Toxicon,,249

We aimed to explore the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine and related factors among pregnant women, a vulnerable population for vaccine-preventable diseases.Methods: A multi-center cross-sectional study among pregnant women was conducted in five provinces of mainland China from November 13 to 27, 2020. We collected sociodemographic characteristics, attitude, knowledge, and health beliefs on COVID-19 vaccination. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression analysis was used to assess the trends of vaccination acceptance. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to vaccination acceptance.Results: Among the 1392 pregnant women, the acceptance rate of a COVID-19 vaccine were 77.4% (95%CI 75.1-79.5%). In the multivariable regression model, the acceptance rate was associated with young age (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.20-2.93), western region (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.72-4.32), low level of education (aOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.13-5.51), late pregnancy (aOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03-2.16), high knowledge score on COVID-19 (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10), high level of perceived susceptibility (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.36-3.49), low level of perceived barriers (aOR = 4.76, 95% CI: 2.23-10.18), high level of perceived benefit (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.36-3.49), and high level of perceived cues to action (aOR = 15.70, 95% CI: 8.28-29.80).Conclusions: About one quarters of pregnant women have vaccine hesitancy.

Methods: We used a multimodal electrophysiological approach combined with neuropsychological investigations to study functional alteration of both the PNS and CNS in four patients with severe COVID-19. Results: We found electrophysiological evidence for affection of both the PNS and CNS, and particularly affection of brain stem function. Furthermore, our neuropsychological investigations provide evidence of marked impairment of cognition independent of delirium, and outlasting the duration of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: This case series provides first direct electrophysiological evidence for functional brain stem involvement in COVID-19 patients without evident morphological changes supporting the notion of the brain stem contributing to respiratory failure and thus promoting severe courses of the disease. Moreover, sustained neuropsychological sequelae in these patients may be of particular psychosocial and possibly also economic relevance for society.","Groiss, Stefan Jun; Balloff, Carolin; Elben, Saskia; Brandenburger, Timo; Müttel, Tomke; Kindgen-Milles, Detlef; Vollmer, Christian; Feldt, Torsten; Kunstein, Anselm; Ole Jensen, Björn-Erik; Hartung, Hans-Peter; Schnitzler, Alfons; Albrecht, Philipp",Front Neurol,,249
357426,"Masks, Politics, Culture and Health",2020,"Background: By the beginning of December 2020, some vaccines against COVID-19 already presented efficacy and security, which qualify them to be used in mass vaccination campaigns. Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became crucial to control the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28- Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021. To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each city.","Albani, Vinicius V.

360852,Contingency plan of the Clinical Management Unit for Psychiatry and Mental Health (CMUPMH) of the Infanta Cristina University Hospital (ICUH) for the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The various epidemiological indicators used to communicate the impact of COVID-19 have different strengths and limitations. METHODS: We conducted a selective literature review to identify the indicators used and to derive appropriate definitions. We calculated crude and age-adjusted indicators for selected countries. RESULTS: The proportion of deaths (case fatality proportion [CFP]; number of deaths/ total number of cases) is commonly used to estimate the severity of a disease. If the CFP is used for purposes of comparison, the existence of heterogeneity in the detection and registration of cases and deaths has to be taken into account. In the early phase of an epidemic, when case numbers rise rapidly, the CFP suffers from bias. For these reasons, variants have been proposed: the ""confirmed CFP"" (number of deaths/total number of confirmed cases), and the ""delay-adjusted CFP,"" which considers the delay between infection with the disease and death from the disease. The indicator mortality (number of deaths/total population) has at first sight the advantage of being based on a defined denominator, the total population. During the outbreak of a disease, however, the cumulative deaths rise while the total population remains stable. The phase of the epidemic therefore has to be considered when using this indicator. In this context, R0 and R(t) are important indicators. R0 estimates the maximum rate of spread of a disease in a population, while R(t) describes the dynamics of the epidemic at a given time. Age-adjusted analysis of the CFP shows that the differences between countries decrease but do not dis - appear completely. If the test strategies depend on age or symptom severity, however, the bias cannot be entirely eliminated. CONCLUSION: Various indicators of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic at population level are used in daily communication. Considering the relevance of the pandemic and the importance of relevant communications, however, the strengths and the limitations of each parameter must be considered carefully.","Gianicolo, Emilio; Riccetti, Nicola; Blettner, Maria; Karch, André",Dtsch Arztebl Int,,249

Liver enzymes derangement is seen in 15-55% of the patients. Advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, malignancy and, cardiovascular disease predispose them to severe disease and the need for hospitalization. Data on preexisting liver disease in patients with COVID -19 is limited and most studies had only 3-8% of these patients. Patients with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver (MAFLD) had shown 4-6 fold increase in severity of COVID-19 and its severity and mortality increased in patients with higher fibrosis score. Patients with chronic liver disease had shown that cirrhosis is an independent predictor of severity of COVID-19 with increased hospitalization and mortality. Increase in Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) score and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score increases the mortality in these patients. Few case reports had shown SARS-CoV-2 as an acute event in the decompensation of underlying chronic liver disease. Immunosuppression should be reduced prophylactically in patients with autoimmune liver disease and post-transplantation with no COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir is found to be safe in limited studies in a patient with cirrhosis and COVID-19. For hepatologist cirrhosis with COVID-19 is a pertinent issue as the present pandemic will have severe disease in patients with chronic liver disease leading to more hospitalisation and decompensation.","Praveen, Sharma; Ashish, Kumar; Anikhindi, ShriHari Anil; Naresh, Bansal; Vikas, Singla; Khare, Shivam; Anil, Arora",,,249

372903,A Guide to Chatbots for COVID-19 Screening at Pediatric Health Care Facilities,2020,"Conventional smoking is known to both increase susceptibility to infection and drive inflammation within the lungs. Recently, smokers have been found to be at higher risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). E-cigarette aerosol inhalation (vaping) has been associated with several inflammatory lung disorders, including the recent e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic, and recent studies have suggested that vaping alters host susceptibility to pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To assess the impact of vaping on lung inflammatory pathways, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, mice were exposed to e-cigarette aerosols for 60 min daily for 1-6 months and underwent gene expression analysis. Hierarchical clustering revealed extensive gene expression changes occurred in the lungs of both inbred C57BL/6 mice and outbred CD1 mice, with 2,933 gene expression changes in C57BL/6 mice, and 2,818 gene expression changes in CD1 mice (&gt;abs 1.25-fold change). Particularly, large reductions in IgA and CD4 were identified, indicating impairment of host responses to pathogens via reductions in immunoglobulins and CD4 T cells. CD177, facmr, tlr9, fcgr1, and ccr2 were also reduced, consistent with diminished host defenses via decreased neutrophils and/or monocytes in the lungs. Gene set enrichment (GSE) plots demonstrated upregulation of gene expression related to cell activation specifically in neutrophils. As neutrophils are a potential driver of acute lung injury in COVID-19, increased neutrophil activation in the lungs suggests that vapers are at higher risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19. The receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, ACE2, was found to have moderate upregulation in mice exposed to unflavored vape pens, and further upregulation (six-fold) with JUUL mint aerosol exposure. No changes were found in mice exposed to unflavored Mod device-generated aerosols. These findings suggest that specific vaping devices and components of e-liquids have an effect on ACE2 expression, thus potentially increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, exposure to e-cigarette aerosols both with and without nicotine led to alterations in eicosanoid lipid profiles within the BAL. These data demonstrate that chronic, daily inhalation of e-cigarette aerosols fundamentally alters the inflammatory and immune state of the lungs. Thus, e-cigarette vapers may be at higher risk of developing infections and inflammatory disorders of the lungs.","Masso-Silva, J.

DM is highly prevalent in the general population. Defining strategies to reduce the health care system burden and the late arrival of some patients thus seems crucial. The study aim was to compare phenotypic characteristics between in and outpatients with diabetes and infected by COVID-19, and to build an easy-to-use hospitalization prediction risk score. This was a retrospective observational study. Patients with DM and laboratory- or CT-confirmed COVID-19, who did (n = 185) and did not (n = 159) require hospitalization between 10 March and 10 April 2020, were compared. Data on diabetes duration, treatments, glycemic control, complications, anthropometrics and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were collected from medical records. Stepwise multivariate logistic regressions and ROC analyses were performed to build the DIAB score, a score using no more than five easy-to-collect clinical parameters predicting the risk of hospitalization. The DIAB score was then validated in two external cohorts (n = 132 and n = 2036).

Type 2 DM (T2D) was found in 94% of all patients, with 10 times more type 1 DM in the outpatient group (11.3 vs. 1.1%, p < 0.0001). A DIAB score > 27 points predicted hospitalization (sensitivity 77.7%, specificity 89.2%, AUC = 0.895), and death within 28 days. Its performance was validated in the two external cohorts.

Since these thrombotic complications are associated with in-hospital mortality, all current guidelines and consensus papers propose pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Several trials are ongoing to study the optimal intensity of anticoagulation for this purpose. As for the management of thrombotic complications, treatment regimens from non-COVID-19 guidelines can be adapted, with choice of anticoagulant drug class dependent on the situation. Parenteral anticoagulation is preferred for patients on ICUs or with impending clinical deterioration, while oral treatment can be started in stable patients. This review describes current knowledge on incidence and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated VTE and provides an overview of guideline recommendations on thromboprophylaxis and treatment of established VTE in COVID-19 patients.","Kaptein, F H J; Stals, M A M; Huisman, M V; Klok, F A",Postgrad Med,,249

OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the mortality risks associated with CVD and cardiac injury among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially in subgroups of populations in different countries. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using 9 databases from November 1, 2019 to November 9, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed for CVD and cardiac injury between non-survivors and survivors of COVID-19. RESULTS: Although the prevalence of CVD in different populations was different, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CVD were at a higher risk of fatal outcomes (OR = 2.72; 95% CI 2.35-3.16) than those without CVD. Separate meta-analyses of populations in four different countries also reached a similar conclusion that CVD was associated with an increase in mortality. Cardiac injury was common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with cardiac injury had a significantly higher mortality risk than those without cardiac injury (OR = 13.25; 95% CI: 8.56-20.52). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' CVD history and biomarkers of cardiac injury should be taken into consideration during the hospital stay and incorporated into the routine laboratory panel for COVID-19.","Long, Jiali; Luo, Yefei; Wei, Yuehong; Xie, Chaojun; Yuan, Jun",Am J Emerg Med,,249

The average diet in India is low in iron and mostly of vegetable origin. This can be improved by increasing awareness of foodstuffs that are rich in iron and ensuring their availability. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the quality of information available on iron-rich foods and to assess their production and consumption in India. Methods: This was a review of common textbooks for medical, nursing, and home science students; related policy and program documents; and government publications on production and consumption of various foodstuffs in India. Results: Details of specific foods that are rich in iron have not been provided. Instead, food groups such as pulses, cereals, nuts, and green leafy vegetables (GLVs) have been mentioned that are good sources of non-heme iron. This is in spite of the fact that all the foodstuffs in these groups are not uniformly iron rich. Among cereals and pulses, rice and red gram dal (arhar) are the most commonly produced and consumed, though they have the lowest iron content. Spinach and mustard leaves believed to be iron rich and commonly consumed are among those GLVs having lowest iron content. Conclusion: Details of 5-10 foodstuffs which have the highest iron content within each food group should be available in relevant books and documents meant for education, production, and consumption data.","Taneja, Davendra K; Rai, Sanjay K; Yadav, Kapil",Indian J Public Health,,249

Methods: Viral RNA was extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29 2019-nCoV genomes and 30 ß-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank. Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13 with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity (92.87%). The genome sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase. The 2019-nCoV genome sequencing method used in this paper provides an useful tool for monitoring variation of viral genes.","Yu, H; Wang, X C; Li, J; Qian, X; Yu, X F; Sun, Z; Chen, J F; Kao, Q J; Wang, H Q; Pan, J C",Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,249

397109,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: UK-Wide Observational Study,2021,"Events that occur during fetal and perinatal life can have consequences on the health and disease of the offspring. The pioneering work on the ""Fetal Programming Hypothesis"" focused on pregnant women exposed to a great famine that occurred in the Netherlands at the end of World War II. The intrauterine environment of the babies during that famine caused them to low birthweight and determined the appearance of cardiovascular diseases in themselves when they reached adulthood, a risk that was transmitted even to the following generation. In addition to the general stress that a pregnant woman may suffer as a result of the death of a family member, suffering a war or natural disaster such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is another specific type of stress that refers exclusively to the pregnancy process;this is the pregnancy specific-stress. Pregnancy-specific stress is capable of sensitively predicting negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. This type of stress refers to the specific stress of pregnant women related to medical problems, the health of the newborn, the changes that the pregnancy will produce in their social relationships, prematurity, physical changes of pregnancy and fear of labor and birth. The objective of this article was to offer an updated information on pregnancy-specific stress and its consequences for maternal and neonatal health. Thus, we also proposed to offer strategies that midwives and psychologists can use to reduce pregnancy-specific stress levels. In conclusion, midwives and psychologists can work together to reduce pregnancy-specific stress levels. Los eventos que ocurren durante la vida fetal y perinatal pueden tener consecuencias sobre la salud y la enfermedad del neonato y del adulto. Los trabajos pioneros sobre la “Hipótesis de la Programación Fetal“ se centraron en embarazadas expuestas a una gran hambruna que ocurrió en Holanda al final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. El ambiente intrauterino de los bebés durante esa hambruna condicionó que nacieran con un bajo peso y determinó la aparición de enfermedades cardiovasculares en ellos mismos al llegar a la edad adulta, riesgo que se trasmitió incluso a la siguiente generación. Además del estrés general que pueda sufrir una embarazada como consecuencia de la muerte de un familiar, sufrir una guerra o un desastre natural como la pandemia por el coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, existe otro tipo de estrés concreto y referido exclusivamente al proceso de embarazo: el estrés específico del embarazo. El estrés específico del embarazo es capaz de predecir de manera sensible resultados negativos maternos y neonatales. Este tipo de estrés se refiere al estrés concreto de las embarazadas en referencia a problemas médicos, la salud del recién nacido, los cambios que el embarazo va a producir en sus relaciones sociales, la posibilidad de un parto prematuro, los cambios físicos del embarazo y el miedo al parto y nacimiento. El objetivo de este artículo fue ofrecer información actualizada sobre el estrés específico del embarazo y sus consecuencias para la salud materna y neonatal. Así mismo, nos propusimos ofrecer estrategias que los profesionales sanitarios (incluidas las matronas) y los profesionales de la Psicología pudieran usar para reducir los niveles de estrés específico del embarazo. Como conclusión, afirmamos que las matronas y los profesionales de la Psicología pueden trabajar conjuntamente para reducir los niveles de estrés específico del embarazo.","Caparros-Gonzalez, R.

401237,A pharmacist-managed virtual consult service to improve tuberculosis screening,2021,"From SARS to H1N1, and most recently COVID-19, global disease outbreaks have defined the past several decades. For many, we are living in what can only be described as a pre-apocalyptic moment. Indeed, we are currently facing a global pandemic outbreak – a situation that had been previously described as imminent and perhaps even long overdue. Consequently, the publication of pandemic narratives has increased exponentially, which exposes a heightened social concern about the risk of viral outbreak. But instead of speaking to these growing anxieties and providing models to interpret our current position, a growing body of popular culture post-apocalyptic fiction remains deeply entrenched in a dangerous nostalgia that undermines the construction of hypothetical models that could appropriately respond to these threats. I argue that these texts can therefore be read as degenerate utopias, Louis Marin’s term for the false utopian myths that circulate within a society. A degenerate utopia is thus not really a utopia at all, but rather an ideology that elevates the past to a false state of perfection. My article examines the construction of degenerate utopian realities through collective memory in Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven and Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. © 2020, Intellect Ltd..

Therefore, this study was planned to investigate the antiviral role of the active constituents against spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its host ACE2 receptor. Structure-based drug design approach has been used to elucidate the antiviral activity of active constituents present in traditional medicinal plants from Ayurveda. Further, parameters like drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity were determined to ensure the safety and efficacy of active constituents. Gene network analysis was performed to investigate the pathways altered during COVID-19. The prediction of drug-target interactions was performed to discover novel targets for active constituents. The results suggested that amarogentin, eufoliatorin, &#945;-amyrin, caesalpinins, kutkin, ß-sitosterol, and belladonnine are the top-ranked molecules have the highest affinity towards both the spike glycoprotein and ACE2. Most active constituents have passed the criteria of drug-likeness and demonstrated good pharmacokinetic profile with minimum predicted toxicity level. Gene network analysis confirmed that G-protein coupled receptor, protein kinase B signaling, protein secretion, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, nuclear transport, apoptotic pathway, tumor necrosis factor, regulation of angiotensin level, positive regulation of ion transport, and membrane protein proteolysis were altered during COVID-19. The target prediction analysis revealed that most active constituents target the same pathways which are found to be altered during COVID-19. Collectively, our data encourages the use of active constituents as a potential therapy for COVID-19. However, further studies are ongoing to confirm its efficacy against disease.","Maurya, Vimal K; Kumar, Swatantra; Bhatt, Madan L B; Saxena, Shailendra K",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,249

METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed on the PubMed to identify eligible studies that summarized the liver injury and GIS in COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with 3024 patients were included. Up to 53% patients had liver dysfunctions and the degree of liver damage was associated the severity of the disease. The prevalence of diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain in patients with COVID-19 were 9.1%, 5.2% and 3.5%, respectively. No significant was found in the prevalence of diarrhoea (OR, 1.24; 95%CI, 0.90 to 1.72; I2=0%, P=0.19) and nausea/vomiting (OR, 1.24; 95%CI, 0.57 to 2.69; I2=61%, P=0.58) between severe and non-severe patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Tokyo, we continued providing head and neck cancer care, guided by our own uniform screening protocol. In this study, medical records of 208 patients with head and neck malignancy, who underwent surgical treatment at our hospital during the first and second wave of pandemic for each 2-month period (first wave: 30 March 2020-30 May 2020, second wave: 14 July 2020-14 September 2020) and the 2-month pre-pandemic period (30 October 2019-30 December 2020), were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 133 patients were admitted for surgical treatment and all, except six patients with emergency tracheostomy, were screened according to the protocol. As a result, all 127 patients received surgical treatment as planned, and all 1247 medical staff members involved in the surgeries were uninfected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. During the first wave of pandemic, 20% reduction of head and neck surgery was requited; however, restrictions of surgery were not necessary during the second wave. Surgical procedure, length of hospitalization, postoperative complications and number of medical staff were unchanged compared with pre-pandemic period.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Maryland statewide EMS electronic medical records and daily COVID-19 hospitalizations from March 13, 2020 through July 31, 2020. All unique EMS patients who were identified as COVID-19 PUIs during the study period were included. Descriptive analysis was performed. The Box-Jenkins approach was used to evaluate the relationship between EMS transports and daily new hospitalizations. Separate Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were constructed to transform the data into a series of independent, identically distributed random variables. Fit was measured using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Box-Ljung white noise test was utilized to ensure there was no autocorrelation in the residuals. Results: EMS units in Maryland identified a total of 26,855 COVID-19 PUIs during the 141-day study period. The median patient age was 62 years old, and 19,111 (71.3%) were 50 years and older. 6,886 (25.6%) patients had an abnormal initial pulse oximetry (<92%). A strong degree of correlation was observed between EMS PUI transports and new hospitalizations. The correlation was strongest and significant at a 9-day lag from time of EMS PUI transports to new COVID-19 hospitalizations, with a cross correlation coefficient of 0.26 (p < .01). Conclusions: A strong correlation between EMS PUIs and COVID-19 hospitalizations was noted in this state-wide analysis. These findings demonstrate the potential value of incorporating EMS clinical information into the development of a robust syndromic surveillance system for COVID-19. This correlation has important utility in the development of predictive tools and models that seek to provide indicators of an impending surge on the healthcare system at large.","Levy, Matthew J; Klein, Eili; Chizmar, Timothy P; Pinet Peralta, Luis M; Alemayehu, Teferra; Sidik, Mustafa M; Delbridge, Theodore R",Prehosp Emerg Care,,249
418267,Potentially preventable hospitalisations for physical health conditions in community mental health service users: a population-wide linkage study,2021,"To manage citizen evaluations of government performance, public officials use blame avoidance strategies when communicating performance information. We examine two prominent presentational strategies: scapegoating and spinning, while testing how public responses vary depending on whether they are ideologically aligned with the public official. We examine these relationships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Trump administration sought to shift blame by scapegoating outgroups (by using the term""Chinese virus""), and framing performance information on COVID-19 testing in positive terms. Using a novel pre-registered survey experiment that incorporates open and close-ended items, we offer three main findings. First, there is clear evidence of motivated reasoning: conservatives rate the performance of the Trump administration more positively and are more apt to blame prominent Democrats, Chinese residents and the Chinese Government. Second, performance information framing was found to impact blame attribution among conservatives, but only for open-ended responses. Third, while exposure to the term""Chinese virus""increased blame assigned to Chinese residents among all participants, conservatives exposed to the term appeared to blame President Trump more, suggesting repeated use of divisive blame shifting strategies may alienate even supporters.","Porumbescu, Gregory A.; Moynihan, Donald; Anastasopoulos, Jason; Olsen, Asmus Leth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03037v1.pdf,249

Does co-infection increase the risk of severe illness or amplify virus shedding? Actually, we do not yet know the answers to these questions;so, in this article, first, we attempt to define the similarities and differences between COV-Flu Then, we will have a brief discussion on how to manage patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of both diseases However, as COVID-19 has been recognized as a pandemic since December 2019, the management of this emerging disease is rapidly evolving as new information is collected from different parts of the world","Karimi, A.; Tabatabaei, S.

Although there is no current treatment for PASC, reports from patients that the vaccine itself improves, and in some reports, worsens, PASC symptoms may lead to a deeper understanding of the causes of PASC symptoms and viable treatments. As such, we are conducting a study that measures the changes in PASC symptoms after vaccination. We are collecting baseline self-report and biospecimens for immune assays and then are following up with participants to collect the same data at 2-weeks, 6-weeks, and 12-weeks post-vaccination (first dose). Immune assays using blood specimens will include B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid cell panels; evaluation of T-cell responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and antigen specific response; autoantibody screening (of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies that attack human proteins); and TCR sequencing and antigen mapping of CD8+ T-cells. Mucosal immunity will be measured using saliva specimens.

In the literature, the fusion of multi-source time-series has been achieved either by using ensemble learning models which ignore temporal patterns and correlation within features or by defining a fixed-size window to select specific parts of the data sets. On the other hand, many studies have shown major improvement to handle the irregularity of time-series, yet none of these studies has been applied to multi-source data. In this work, we design a novel architecture, PIETS, to model heterogeneous time-series. PIETS has the following characteristics: (1) irregularity encoders for multi-source samples that can leverage all available information and accelerate the convergence of the model; (2) parallelised neural networks to enable flexibility and avoid information overwhelming; and (3) attention mechanism that highlights different information and gives high importance to the most related data. Through extensive experiments on real-world data sets related to COVID-19, we show that the proposed architecture is able to effectively model heterogeneous temporal data and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in the prediction task.","Abushaqra, Futoon M.; Xue, Hao; Ren, Yongli; Salim, Flora D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00071v2.pdf,249

As a pilot study, the scope of the project covers only a few major justice problems related to the social determinants of health (standard housing, evictions and foreclosures, guardianships for the incapacitated, and victims of domestic violence) because they significantly impact health outcomes and there are data available. Based on our calculations, we estimate that the total number of attorney hours to address only these five legal issues is over 34 million per year. To put that in perspective, the American Bar Association estimated that in 2018, the year from which much of our data comes, the total number of practicing attorneys in the United States was 1,338,678 (Weiss). Thus, to provide the needed hours, every single practicing attorney in the United States would need to contribute about 26 hours a year. While many lawyers do in fact contribute pro bono hours, they address the full range of legal needs that go well beyond just the five we studied.","Mao, Yi; Beck, Stacey R.; Bartek, Benjamin; Cabrera, Beatriz; Calhoun, Rachell; Coe, David; Cronberg, Jakob; Nalluri, Suren; Thompson, Bradley Merrill",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08522v1.pdf,249

456669,Criticism of best practice statement related to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and serum potassium levels,2021,"This paper evaluates the aggregation behavior of a potential drug and gene delivery system that combines branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a positively-charged polyelectrolyte, and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), a recombinant polymer that exhibits lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The LCST behavior of ELP has been extensively studied, but there are no quantitative ways to control the size of aggregates formed after the phase transition. The aggregate size cannot be maintained when the temperature is lowered below the LCST, unless the system exhibits hysteresis and forms irreversible aggregates. This study shows that conjugation of ELP with PEI preserves the aggregation behavior that occurs above the LCST and achieves precise aggregate radii when the solution conditions of pH (3, 7, 10), polymer concentration (0.1, 0.15, 0.3 mg/mL), and salt concentration (none, 0.2, 1 M) are carefully controlled. K-means cluster analyses showed that salt concentration was the most critical factor controlling the hydrodynamic radius and LCST. Conjugating ELP to PEI allowed crosslinking the aggregates and achieved stable particles that maintained their size below LCST, even after removal of the harsh (high salt or pH) conditions used to create them. Taken together, the ability to control aggregate sizes and use of crosslinking to maintain stability holds excellent potential for use in biological delivery systems.","Cobb, Jared S; Engel, Alexandra; Seale, Maria A; Janorkar, Amol V",Sci Rep,,249

A relatively higher number of patients with influenza had a fever and respiratory symptoms than COVID-19 patients. In contrast, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in a higher number of COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients. A statistically significant increase in white cell counts is noted in COVID-19 but not in influenza patients (P < 0.05). There are no obvious variations in the mean period of duration of hospitalization between COVID-19 and influenza patients. However, the total intensive care unit length of stay was longer for influenza compared to COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of children infected with COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza were noted and reported in this study. There were no significant variations in the severity of the symptomatology and laboratory findings between the two groups of patients. Significant differences between these patients in some hospitalization factors and diagnosis upon admission also were not observed. However, more severe clinical manifestations and serious consequences were observed among pediatric patients hospitalized with influenza infections than among those with COVID-19.","Asseri, Ali Alsuheel; Shati, Ayed A; Al-Qahtani, Saleh M; Alzaydani, Ibrahim A; Al-Jarie, Ahmed A; Alaliani, Mohammed J; Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed",World j. pediatr,,249

METHODS: 60 children with cancer and their families participated in the study. The first and second assessments were carried out in April and September 2020, respectively. The pediatric quality of life inventory parent proxy-report was used to evaluate the QOL, and the Canadian occupational performance measurement was used to evaluate children's occupational performance and satisfaction. A qualitative interview was planned to determine the impact of the pandemic on children with cancer alongside their families and therefore determining the rehabilitation needs of the children. RESULTS: While there is no statistically significant change in the pain-related conditions of the children in the first six months of the pandemic (p > 0.05), procedural and treatment anxieties of the children increased during the treatment. Their QOL including cognitive state, perceived physical appearance and communication skills also showed a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05). Both the occupational performance and satisfaction scores decreased significantly, covering the pre-pandemic and pandemic era (p < 0.01). In the qualitative interview parents expressed their children's need for physical, psychological and social participation support. Also, they emphasized the need for time management. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the QOL and occupational performance level of children with cancer decreased significantly.

458194,COVID-19's lost generation of unvaccinated children - Authors' reply,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization formally announced the global COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020 due to widespread infections. In this study, COVID-19 cases in India were critically analyzed during the pre-lockdown (PLD), lockdown (LD), and unlock (UL) phases. METHOD: Analyses were conducted using geospatial technology at district, state, and country levels, and comparisons were also made with other countries throughout the world that had the highest infection rates. India had the third highest infection rate in the world after the USA and Brazil during UL2.0-UL3.0 phases, the second highest after the USA during UL4.0-UL5.0 phases, and the highest among South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries in PLD-UL5.0 period. RESULTS: The trend in the number of COVID-19 cases was associated with the population density where higher numbers tended to be record in the eastern, southern, and west-central parts of India. The death rate in India throughout the pandemic period under study was lower than the global average. Kerala reported the maximum number of infections during PLD whereas Maharashtra had the highest numbers during all LD and UL phases. Eighty percent of the cases in India were concentrated mainly in highly populous districts. CONCLUSION: The top 25 districts accounted for 70.99%, 69.38%, 54.87%, 44.23%, 40.48%, and 38.96% of the infections from the start of UL1.0 until the end of UL phases, respectively, and the top 26-50 districts accounted for 6.38%, 6.76%, 11.23%, 12.98%, 13.40%, and 13.61% of cases in these phase, thereby indicating that COVID-19 cases spread during the UL period. By October 31, 2020, Delhi had the highest number of infections, followed by Bengaluru Urban, Pune, Mumbai, Thane, and Chennai. No decline in the infection rate occurred, even in UL5.0, thereby indicating a highly alarming situation in India.","Gangwar, Hari Shankar; Ray, P K Champati",Int J Infect Dis,,249

459589,Opportunities for improving opioid disposal practices in the Veterans Health Administration,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate the efficacy (prognosis, coagulation/inflammation biomarkers) and safety (bleeding events) of different anticoagulation dosages in COVID-19 inpatients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: COVID-19 inpatients (Athens, Greece) were included. The ""Enhanced dose THRomboprophylaxis in Admissions (ETHRA)"" protocol was applied in certain Departments, suggesting the use of intermediate anticoagulation dosage. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation/venous thromboembolism/death. Inflammation/coagulation parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Among 127 admissions, 95 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one events (4 deaths, 17 intubations) were observed. Regression analysis demonstrated significant reduction of events with intermediate or therapeutic dosage [HR=0.16 (95%CI=0.05-0.52) p=0.002; HR=0.17 (0.04-0.71) p=0.015, respectively]. D-Dimer values were higher in those who met the composite endpoint. Intermediate dosage treatment was associated with decreased values of ferritin. Three patients (3%) had minor hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation treatment (particularly intermediate dosage) appears to have positive impact on COVID-19 inpatients' prognosis by inhibiting both coagulation and inflammatory cascades.","Poulakou, Garyphallia; Dimakakos, Evangelos; Kollias, Anastasios; Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Rapti, Vasiliki; Trontzas, Ioannis; Thanos, Charalampos; Abdelrasoul, Mahmoud; Vantana, Theodora; Leontis, Konstantinos; Kakalou, Eleni; Argyraki, Katerina; Baraboutis, Ioannis; Michelakis, Evangelos; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos; Dimakou, Katerina; Tsoukalas, Georgios; Rapti, Angeliki; Michelakis, Evangelos D; Syrigos, Konstantinos N",In Vivo,,249

The virus has killed nearly 50 000 people all over the world in only 3 months. These reforms bring major challenges to the public health and healthcare system. The pulmonary pathological features during the initial phase of COVID-19 are alveolar oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, gravitational consolidations and interstitial thickening. The ability of lung ultrasound (LUS) and its evolving applications in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia are widespread. This study aims to evaluate the surveillance value of LUS in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a systematic search and meta-analysis on the use of LUS to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 pneumonia. We will search Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar, China Biology Medicine disc and WHO Global Health Library for studies on diagnostic accuracy from December 2019 to April 2021. Data collection and screening will be individually accomplished by two reviewers. The assessment of risk of bias for each outcome will be conducted using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2) tool. Data will be synthesised and heterogeneity will be evaluated. Meta-analysis will be conducted when strong homogeneous data are accessible. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation(GRADE) will be used to assess quality of evidence.

471993,Coronavirus Challenges for Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing in 2021,2021,"Background: Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies has become an important tool, complementing nucleic acid tests (NATs) for diagnosis and for determining the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in population serosurveys. The magnitude and persistence of antibody responses are critical for assessing the duration of immunity. Methods: A SARS-CoV-2-specific immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was developed and prospectively evaluated by comparison to the reference standard of NAT on respiratory tract samples from individuals with suspected COVID-19. Neutralizing antibody responses were measured in a subset of samples using a standard microneutralization assay. Results: A total of 2753 individuals were eligible for the study (126 NAT-positive; prevalence, 4.6%). The median ""window period"" from illness onset to appearance of antibodies (range) was 10.2 (5.8-14.4) days. The sensitivity and specificity of either SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, or IgM when collected &#8805;14 days after symptom onset were 91.3% (95% CI, 84.9%-95.6%) and 98.9% (95% CI, 98.4%-99.3%), respectively. The negative predictive value was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.3%-99.8%). The positive predictive value of detecting any antibody class was 79.9% (95% CI, 73.3%-85.1%); this increased to 96.8% (95% CI, 90.7%-99.0%) for the combination of IgG and IgA. Conclusions: Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody by IFA is an accurate method to diagnose COVID-19. Serological testing should be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify additional cases where NAT was not performed and resolve cases where false-negative and false-positive NATs are suspected. The majority of individuals develop robust antibody responses following infection, but the duration of these responses and implications for immunity remain to be established.","Hueston, Linda; Kok, Jen; Guibone, Ayla; McDonald, Damien; Hone, George; Goodwin, James; Carter, Ian; Basile, Kerri; Sandaradura, Indy; Maddocks, Susan; Sintchenko, Vitali; Gilroy, Nicole; Chen, Sharon; Dwyer, Dominic E; O039,; Sullivan, Matthew V N",Open Forum Infect Dis,,249

Despite some advances in drug treatments of medical complications in the later stages of the disease, the pandemic's death toll is tragic, as no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is currently available. By using a systems approach, we identify the host-encoded pathway, which provides ribonucleotides to viral RNA synthesis, as a possible target. We show that methotrexate, an FDA-approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.","Caruso, Arnaldo; Caccuri, Francesca; Bugatti, Antonella; Zani, Alberto; Vanoni, Marco; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cazzaniga, Marina E; Perno, Carlo F; Messa, Cristina; Alberghina, Lilia",J Med Virol,,249

480759,2020 Report of the ASHP Treasurer,2020,"Background and objective: In the current pandemic scenario, data mining tools are fundamental to evaluate the measures adopted to contain the spread of COVID-19. In this study, unsupervised neural networks of the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) type were used to assess the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 in Brazil, according to the number of cases and deaths in regions, states, and cities. Materials and methods: The SOM applied in this context does not evaluate which measures applied have helped contain the spread of the disease, but these datasets represent the repercussions of the country's measures, which were implemented to contain the virus' spread. Results: This approach demonstrated that the spread of the disease in Brazil does not have a standard behavior, changing according to the region, state, or city. The analyses showed that cities and states in the north and northeast regions of the country were the most affected by the disease, with the highest number of cases and deaths registered per 100,000 inhabitants. Conclusions: The SOM clustering was able to spatially group cities, states, and regions according to their coronavirus cases, with similar behavior. Thus, it is possible to benefit from the use of similar strategies to deal with the virus' spread in these cities, states, and regions.","Galvan, Diego; Effting, Luciane; Cremasco, Hágata; Conte-Junior, Carlos Adam",Medicina (Kaunas),,249

Technology, and, in particular, the internet, has affected, for instance, the ways in which learners communicate with teachers, learn, and work. With the advent of the internet, teaching and learning is no longer confined to classrooms. However, the digital divide, exposed by the closing of schools because of Covid-19 has now become more apparent. We collected data from 48 teachers and 3 school principals through focus group discussions and in-depth face-to-face interviews, respectively. We conclude that the three schools whose principals we interviewed, suffer from the inadequacy of ICT that creates digital, information, and knowledge divides between schools of different quintiles. Furthermore, these schools cannot run online classes during school closures related to Covid-19.

495480,How has COVID-19 impacted on Learning Disability Nursing Services in Scotland?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation in intensive care for 48 h or longer is associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might be present at the time ventilatory support is instituted or develop afterwards, predominantly during the first 5 days. Survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ARDS are at risk of considerably impaired physical function that can persist for years. An early pathogenic mechanism of lung injury in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients is inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrin deposition, leading to thrombosis of the microvasculature and hyaline membrane formation in the air sacs. The main aim of this study was to determine if nebulised heparin, which targets fibrin deposition, would limit lung injury and thereby accelerate recovery of physical function in patients with or at risk of ARDS. METHODS: The Can Heparin Administration Reduce Lung Injury (CHARLI) study was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial across nine hospitals in Australia. Adult intensive care patients on invasive ventilation, with impaired oxygenation defined by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300, and with the expectation of invasive ventilation beyond the next calendar day were recruited. Key exclusion criteria were heparin allergy, pulmonary bleeding, and platelet count less than 50âXâ109/L. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, with stratification by site and using blocks of variable size and random seed, via a web-based system, to either unfractionated heparin sodium 25â000 IU in 5 mL or identical placebo (sodium chloride 0·9% 5 mL), administered using a vibrating mesh membrane nebuliser every 6 h to day 10 while invasively ventilated. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical Function Score (out of 100) of survivors at day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes, which are exploratory, included development of ARDS to day 5 among at-risk patients, deterioration of the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) to day 5, mortality at day 60, residence of survivors at day 60, and serious adverse events. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. There was no imputation of missing data. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, number ACTRN12612000418875 . FINDINGS: Between Sept 4, 2012, and Aug 23, 2018, 256 patients were randomised. Final follow-up was on Feb 25, 2019. We excluded three patients who revoked consent and one ineligible participant who received no intervention. Of 252 patients included in data analysis, the mean age was 58 years (SD 15), 157 (62%) were men, and 118 (47%) had ARDS. 128 (51%) patients were assigned to the heparin group and 124 (49%) to the placebo group, all of whom received their assigned intervention. Survivors in the heparin group (n=97) had similar SF-36 Physical Function Scores at day 60 compared to the placebo group (n=94; mean 53·6 [SD 31·6] vs 48·7 [35·7]; difference 4·9 [95% CI -4·8 to 14·5]; p=0·32). Compared with the placebo group, the heparin group had fewer cases of ARDS develop to day 5 among the at-risk patients (nine [15%] of 62 patients vs 21 [30%] of 71 patients; hazard ratio 0·46 [95% CI 0·22 to 0·98]; p=0·0431), less deterioration of the MLIS to day 5 (difference -0·14 [-0·26 to -0·02]; p=0·0215), similar day 60 mortality (23 [18%] of 127 patients vs 18 [15%] of 123 patients; odds ratio [OR] 1·29 [95% CI 0·66 to 2·53]; p=0·46), and more day 60 survivors at home (86 [87%] of 99 patients vs 73 [73%] of 100 patients; OR 2·45 [1·18 to 5·08]; p=0·0165). A similar number of serious adverse events occurred in each group (seven [5%] of 128 patients in the heparin group vs three [2%] of 124 patients in the placebo group; OR 2·33 [0·59 to 9·24]; p=0·23), which were a transient increase in airway pressure during nebulisation (n=3 in the heparin group), major non-pulmonary bleeding (n=2 in each group), haemoptysis (n=1 in the heparin group), tracheotomy site bleeding (n=1 in the heparin group), and hypoxaemia during nebulisation (n=1 in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: In patients with or at risk of ARDS, nebulised heparin did not improve self-reported performance of daily physical activities, but was well tolerated and exploratory outcomes suggest less progression of lung injury and earlier return home. Further research is justified to establish if nebulised heparin accelerates recovery in those who have or are at risk of ARDS.

I base my findings on the analysis of a questionnaire-based survey administered to a sample of students. My research aims at examining the efficiency of the implementation of digital instruction and the accompanying challenges at various levels of the education sphere. I was interested in students' Information and Communications Technology (ICT) preferences and usage habits and whether or not they possess vital digital competences in their own view. The digitally scheduled education programs introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could not fully reach a level required for effective learning according to research findings. The responses revealed that several schools did not implement uniform systems, the educational materials were not suitable for independent learning, the given materials did not have a modular structure, the respective texts did not reflect a system oriented perspective, and it was proven that neither students nor teachers possessed digital literacy skills considered to be currently vital. The most important result of this statistical analysis entails that those students were more successful in the digital home-based education, who spent more time with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) use, regularly played with or used experience-oriented software and relied on smart devices for most of their studies.","Orosz, B.",Acta Polytechnica Hungarica,,249

Materials and methods: Data have been retrospectively obtained from the time-related analysis of conversations via a WhatsApp messenger-based group chat between the medical directors belonging to the Italian College of Medical Oncology Directors. Overall number, intensity and time trend of conversations related to reactions during the 4 weeks of observation related to the crucial events which occurred between 24 February and 28 March, 2020 are included. A sentiment analysis of conversations was also carried out. Results: We report 956 conversations among 19 medical oncology units related to reactions to the crucial events, such as epidemic spread, Government ordinances and guidelines during the 4 weeks of observation. Data show significant awareness of problems linked to the COVID-19 spread among oncologists and rapid diffusion of countermeasures. Actions taken were correlated time wise to crucial events. A correlation between conversations and the volume of activity of oncology units was found. By analysing the sentiment analysis of raw data, positive emotions were reduced in percentage over the weeks. A significant increase in negative emotions was observed as the outbreak impacted on the healthcare system. Conclusion: In our experience, the WhatsApp instant-messaging system seems to be a useful tool to share news and reactions between medical oncologists to rapidly implement necessary health measures and answers to most cancer patients' needs and queries in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.","Blasi, Livio; Bordonaro, Roberto; Borsellino, Nicolò; Butera, Alfredo; Caruso, Michele; Cordio, Stefano; Liborio, Di Cristina; Ferraù, Francesco; Giuffrida, Dario; Parra, Hector Soto; Spada, Massimiliano; Tralongo, Paolo; Valenza, Roberto; Verderame, Francesco; Vitello, Stefano; Zerilli, Filippo; Piazza, Dario; Firenze, Alberto; Gebbia, Vittorio",ecancermedicalscience,,249

We aimed to describe the incidence rate of VTE on patients with non-hematological cancer who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 at our center. In this prospective study, non-hematological cancer patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at our institution from 1st March to 30th April 2020, were evaluated daily for VTE complications during their hospital stay, and after discharge until 30th June 2020. Furthermore, Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs was routinely performed in asymptomatic patients based on D-dimer levels and current active cancer therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the cumulative incidence of VTE. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of bleeding and mortality. A total of 58 hospitalized non-hematological cancer patients and confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Median follow-up since initial symptoms of COVID-19 was 91 days (IQR 19-104). Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in three (5%) patients. Symptomatic catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed in one patient. Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs was done in 11 asymptomatic patients, showing distal DVT in two of them (18%). The cumulative incidence of VTE on day 14 after admission was 10%, without new VTE events after hospital discharge and up to 90 days follow-up. No bleeding complication was observed. Seventeen patients (29%) died in the first 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Four patients died after discharge due to malignancy progression.

516739,Teaching A to Z for a new generation of pharmacy learners,2021,"PURPOSE: Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" in conjunction with ""otorhinolaryngological manifestation"", ""ENT"", and ""olfaction"". RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.","Krajewska, Joanna; Krajewski, Wojciech; Zub, Krzysztof; Zatonski, Tomasz",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,249

However, significant limitations affect current treatment options and clinical demand for soft tissue and cartilage regenerative therapies continues to rise. Improving the regeneration of soft tissues has therefore become a key area of focus within tissue engineering. As an emerging technology, 3D bioprinting can be used to build complex soft tissue constructs ""from the bottom up,"" by depositing cells, growth factors, extracellular matrices and other biomaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion. In this way, regeneration of cartilage, skin, vasculature, nerves, tendons and other bodily tissues can be performed in a patient specific manner.

589831,Practicing during a pandemic: The role of a new pharmacy practitioner,2020-08-06,"Male sex and older age have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. It was postulated that estrogens may play a role in reducing the severity of the disease and may therefore offer a treatment option for COVID-19 patients. However, more female cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded in Canada. To determine the potential role of estrogens, we analyzed COVID-19 data from Canada, focusing on the impact of sex and age. Although the overall incidence rate is higher in females than in males, when several high risk groups, including health care workers and long-term care residences, which are predominantly females, were excluded, we found that females had a lower incidence rate than males between the ages of 20s to 70s. Interestingly, this sex-based difference is more evident in females of the reproductive ages (20–49) than in postmenopausal patients (60s or older). Males have significantly higher hospitalization, ICU admission, and case fatality rates; however, a greater difference was observed in the older age groups. Finally, symptom manifestation varied between sexes. Some of the symptoms, which were more frequently observed in patients who recovered than patients who died, were more commonly observed in females of the reproductive age compared to their male counterparts. Since only females of the reproductive age have much higher circulating estrogens than males, these findings suggest that estrogens may play a role in reducing COVID-19 incidence and in the development of symptoms, especially those related to better survival.","O’Brien, Jacob; Du, Kevin Y.; Peng, Chun",J Ovarian Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-020-00734-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33234144/,249

Methods Data on candidate risk factors were extracted from patients’ last checkup records. Propensity score-matched cohorts were constructed, and logistic regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was death or severe COVID-19, defined as requiring supplementary oxygen or higher ventilatory support. Results Among 7,649 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 2,231 (29.2%) received checkups and Severe COVID-19 occurred in 307 patients (13.8%). A BMI of 25.0–29.9 was associated with the outcome among women (aOR, 2.29; 95% CI,: 1.41–3.73) and patients aged 50–69 years (aOR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.06–2.54).

594564,Correction: Convalescent Plasma for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Analysis,2021-06-30,"Protein S-palmitoylation is a covalent and reversible lipid modification that specifically targets cysteine residues within many eukaryotic proteins. In mammalian cells, the ubiquitous palmitoyltransferases (PATs) and serine hydrolases, including acyl protein thioesterases (APTs), catalyze the addition and removal of palmitate, respectively. The attachment of palmitoyl groups alters the membrane affinity of the substrate protein changing its subcellular localization, stability, and protein-protein interactions. Forty years of research has led to the understanding of the role of protein palmitoylation in significantly regulating protein function in a variety of biological processes. Recent global profiling of immune cells has identified a large body of S-palmitoylated immunity-associated proteins. Localization of many immune molecules to the cellular membrane is required for the proper activation of innate and adaptive immune signaling. Emerging evidence has unveiled the crucial roles that palmitoylation plays to immune function, especially in partitioning immune signaling proteins to the membrane as well as to lipid rafts. More importantly, aberrant PAT activity and fluctuations in palmitoylation levels are strongly correlated with human immunologic diseases, such as sensory incompetence or over-response to pathogens.

595176,A Guide to Chatbots for COVID-19 Screening at Pediatric Health Care Facilities,2020-04-30,"New coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is capable to infect humans and cause a novel disease COVID-19. Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population. In conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Klaassen, Kristel; Stankovic, Biljana; Zukic, Branka; Kotur, Nikola; Gasic, Vladimir; Pavlovic, Sonja; Stojiljkovic, Maja",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771700/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820303294?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104498; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820303294,249

Starting from suitable peptide templates, based on selected ACE2 segments (natural RBD binder), we gradually modify the templates by random mutations, while retaining those mutations that maximize their RBD-binding free energies. In this adaptive evolution, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the template-RBD complexes are iteratively perturbed by the peptide mutations, which are retained under favorable Monte Carlo decisions.

Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. Methods: Samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA. Results: The Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection. Conclusions: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) is comparable to ELISA and showed consistent results across different sample types. Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid testing in the community and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Black, Margaret A; Shen, Guomiao; Feng, Xiaojun; Beltran, Wilfredo Garcia; Feng, Yang; Vasudevaraja, Varshini; Allison, Douglas; Lin, Lawrence H.; Gindin, Tatyana; Astudillo, Michael; Yang, Diane; Murali, Mandakolathur; Iafrate, A.

The objective of this study was to determine platelet-bound antibodies (PBA) by a flow cytometric assay in both healthy and thrombocytopenic cats. Direct PBA testing was performed in 42 thrombocytopenic cats (platelet counts 6–179 × 10(9)/l, median 56 × 10(9)/l). Of these 42 cats, 19 had positive PBA test results, 17 of which were considered to have secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (sITP). Underlying diseases included fat necroses (four cases), feline infectious peritonitis (three), feline leukaemia virus (two) or feline immunodeficiency virus (two) infections, lymphoma (two), leukaemia (one), hepatitis (one), pyelonephritis (one), or hyperthyroidism (one). In two cats, no underlying disease was found suggesting a primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (pITP). The PBA test was negative in 23 cats diagnosed with varying underlying diseases and in 47 healthy control cats with platelet values within the reference range. Only seven of the 42 cats with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10–57 × 10(9)/l, median 34 × 10(9)/l) had spontaneous bleeding. This study suggests that immune-mediated destruction of platelets might be an important pathological mechanism for feline thrombocytopenia caused by various underlying diseases.

METHODS: In hospitalized patients, the acute phase disease duration was followed using the Brescia‐COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). Noninvasive ventilation was administered based on clinical judgment. Patients requiring oropharyngeal intubation were excluded from the study. For parameters to be measured at the hospital entrance, age, clinical history, National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2, a multiparametric score system), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F ratio), C‐reactive protein, and blood cell count were selected. RESULTS: In 64 patients, age (direct relationship), P/F, and platelet number (inverse relationship) independently accounted for 43% of the acute phase duration of the disease (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the present results revealed that the acute phase duration of non‐complicated pneumonia, resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is independently predicted from a patient's age, as well as based on the hospital entrance values of P/F ratio and peripheral blood platelet count.

More than half of veterans who meet mental illness criteria do not seek help. This study screened for clinical symptoms and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, online social‐contact‐based video intervention in increasing treatment‐seeking intentions among veterans. We hypothesized that the video‐based intervention would increase treatment‐seeking intentions more than written vignette and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred seventy‐two veterans were randomized to either a (a) brief video‐based intervention; (b) written vignette intervention, or (c) nonintervention control group. In the 3‐min video, a veteran previously diagnosed with PTSD described his symptom reactivation by Covid‐19, his barriers to care, and how therapy helped him to cope. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at 14‐ and 30‐day follow‐ups. RESULTS: A total of 91 (53%) veterans reported high levels of clinical symptoms, especially those self‐reporting Covid‐19 exposure. The brief video‐based intervention yielded greater increase in treatment‐seeking intentions among veterans. Within the video group, women showed an increase in treatment‐seeking intentions from baseline to postintervention only, whereas men showed a more sustained effect, from baseline to Day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed veterans reported high symptoms levels. A brief video intervention increased treatment‐seeking intention, likely through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. This easily disseminable video‐based intervention has the potential to increase likelihood of seeking care. Future research should examine longer term sustainability and changes in help‐seeking behavior.","Amsalem, Doron; Lazarov, Amit; Markowitz, John C.; Gorman, Daniel; Dixon, Lisa B.; Neria, Yuval",Depress Anxiety,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734539/; https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23149,249

Although literature is beginning to emerge on pregnancy as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, these studies are heterogeneous and use primary outcomes such as intensive care unit admission or hospitalization as surrogate markers that may subject analyses to misclassification bias in pregnant patients. OBJECTIVE: We aim determine the risk of severe COVID-19 among pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women using non-admission based, standardized clinical criteria for severe disease. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of women aged 13-45 years and diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 between May 28-July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19 as defined by two sets of non-admission based, clinical criteria: the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement and the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team. Adjusted risk ratios were estimated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 262 women aged 13-45 years with symptomatic COVID-19, 22 (8.4%) were pregnant and 240 (91.6%) were non-pregnant.

605826,The Importance of Restricting Youth Access to Marijuana in the Age of Legalization: Lessons Learned From Tobacco Control Efforts and COVID-19 Restrictions.,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND: The first Covid-19 epidemic outbreak has enormously impacted the delivery of clinical healthcare and hospital management practices in most of the hospitals around the world. In this context, it is important to assess whether the clinical management of non-Covid patients has not been compromised. Among non-Covid cases, patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and stroke need non-deferrable emergency care and are the natural candidates to be studied. Preliminary evidence suggests that the time from onset of symptoms to emergency department (ED) presentation has significantly increased in Covid-19 times as well as the 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We check, in a causal inference framework, the causal effect of the hospital’s stress generated by Covid-19 pandemic on in-hospital mortality rates (primary end-point of the study) of AMI and stroke over several time-windows of 15-days around the implementation date of the State of Emergency restrictions for COVID-19 (March, 9(th) 2020) using two quasi-experimental approaches, regression-discontinuity design (RDD) and difference-in-regression-discontinuity (DRD) designs. Data are drawn from Spedali Civili of Brescia, one of the most hit provinces in Italy by Covid-19 during March and May 2020. FINDINGS: Despite the potential adverse effects on expected mortality due to a longer time to hospitalization and staff extra-burden generated by the first wave of Covid-19, the AMI and stroke mortality rates are overall not statistically different during the first wave of Covid-19 than before the first peak. The obtained results provided by RDD models are robust also when we account for seasonality and unobserved factors with DRD models. INTERPRETATION: The non-statistically significant impact on mortality rates for AMI and stroke patients provides evidence of the hospital ability to manage -with the implementation of a dual track organization- the simultaneous delivery of high-quality cares to both Covid and non-Covid patients.","Rossi, Camillo; Berta, Paolo; Curello, Salvatore; Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio; Magoni, Mauro; Metra, Marco; Roccaro, Aldo Maria; Verzillo, Stefano; Vittadini, Giorgio",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34597292/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257910,249

Reciprocally, whether an epidemic can deter citizens from voting has not been often studied. We aimed to investigate such relationships for France during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) epidemic. METHODS: We performed an observational study and dynamic modelling using a sigmoidal mixed effects model. All hospitals with COVID-19 patients were included (18 March 2020–17 April 2020). Abstention rate of a concomitant national election was collected. RESULTS: Mean abstention rate in 2020 among departments was 52.5% ± 6.4% and had increased by a mean of 18.8% as compared with the 2014 election. There was a high degree of similarity of abstention between the two elections among the departments (P < 0.001). Among departments with a high outbreak intensity, those with a higher participation were not affected by significantly higher COVID-19 admissions after the elections. The sigmoidal model fitted the data from the different departments with a high degree of consistency. The covariate analysis showed that a significant association between participation and number of admitted patients was observed for both elections (2020: β = –5.36, P < 1e(−9) and 2014: β = –3.15, P < 1e(−6)) contradicting a direct specific causation of the 2020 election. Participation was not associated with the position of the inflexion point suggesting no effect in the speed of spread.

In this paper we present a model-based approach allowing the estimation of the functional link between the survival probability and a time-varying covariate when data are grouped and time-period censored. The approach is based on an underlying model consisting in non-stationary Markov processes and describing the survival of individuals. The underlying model is aggregated in time and at the group level to handle the group structure of data and the censoring. The aggregation yields a generalized non-linear mixed model. Then, a Bayesian procedure allows the estimation of the model parameters and the description of the link between the survival probability and the time-varying covariate. This approach is applied in order to explore the relationship between the daily survival probability of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and their time-varying lengths (small mosquitofish die with a higher rate than large ones because they are more affected by predation, cannibalism and environmental stress).","Soubeyrand, Samuel; Beaudouin, Rémy; Desassis, Nicolas; Monod, Gilles",Math Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17706252/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556407001320; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556407001320,249

Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1±0.6 (Mean±SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.","Erster, Oran; Shkedi, Omer; Benedek, Gil; Zilber, Eyal; Varkovitzky, Itay; Shirazi, Rachel; Oriya Shorka, Dorit; Cohen, Yuval; Bar, Tzahi; Yechieli, Rafi; Tepperberg Oikawa, Michal; Venkert, Dana; Linial, Michal; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Mandelboim, Michal; Livneh, Zvi; Shenhav-Saltzman, Gilat; Mendelson, Ella; Wolf, Dana; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Mor, Orna; Lewis, Yair; Zeevi, Danny",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784369/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249149,249
621511,Health workforce management in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic: A survey of physicians in Serbia,2021-04-04,"Recombinant interferon (IFN) β-1b was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1993. Since that time, clinical trials and real-world observational studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of IFN therapies. The pivotal intramuscular IFN β-1a phase III trial published in 1996 was the first to demonstrate that a DMT could reduce accumulation of sustained disability in MS. Patient adherence to treatment is higher with intramuscular IFN β-1a, given once weekly, than with subcutaneous formulations requiring multiple injections per week. Moreover, subcutaneous IFN β-1a is associated with an increased incidence of injection-site reactions and neutralizing antibodies compared with intramuscular administration. In recent years, revisions to MS diagnostic criteria have improved clinicians’ ability to identify patients with MS and have promoted the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis and disease monitoring. MRI studies show that treatment with IFN β-1a, relative to placebo, reduces T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions and gray matter atrophy. Since the approval of intramuscular IFN β-1a, a number of high-efficacy therapies have been approved for MS, though the benefit of these high-efficacy therapies should be balanced against the increased risk of serious adverse events associated with their long-term use. For some subpopulations of patients, including pregnant women, the safety profile of IFN β formulations may provide a particular benefit. In addition, the antiviral properties of IFNs may indicate potential therapeutic opportunities for IFN β in reducing the risk of viral infections such as COVID-19.","Cohan, Stanley L.; Hendin, Barry A.; Reder, Anthony T.; Smoot, Kyle; Avila, Robin; Mendoza, Jason P.; Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca",CNS Drugs,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-021-00822-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228301/,249
622532,Assessment of Patient Safety Culture in Public General Hospital in Capital City of Vietnam,2021-07-31,"OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to translate and adapt the Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire (TSUQ) and Telemedicine Patient Questionnaire (TPQ) into Turkish, thereafter to analyze the psychometric properties of both questionnaires. METHODS: A total of 149 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were recruited in the study. For 4 years, all patients were supervised by a department clinician using telemedicine. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to assess internal consistency. By evaluating the scores of 41 retested patients 1 week later, the test-retest reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the construct validity (r). RESULTS: A total of 149 patients (103 women, 46 men) with a mean age of 40.9±10.9 years were included in the study. MS duration of the patients was 9.15±6.24 years. Internal consistency of all items and the total score of the TSUQ were excellent (>0.80; ranged 0.971–0.974). On the other hand, the internal consistency of all items and total score of the TPQ was excellent, either (>0.80; ranged 0.878–0.890). The ICC of the TSUQ’s and TPQ’s total score was excellent (>0.80). The correlation between TSUQ and TPQ was strong (r=0.734, p<0.01). In addition, there was moderate relationship between the TSUQ and the Beck Depression Scale (BDS) (r=−0.363, p<0.01). On the other hand, there was low correlation between TPQ and BDS (r=−0.217, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the TSUQ and the TPQ is valid and reliable in individuals with MS.","Özkeskin, Mehmet; Özden, Fatih; Ekmekçi, Özgül; Yüceyar, Nur",Neurol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05519-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342782/,249
622760,Use of personal protective equipment to protect against respiratory infections in Pakistan: A systematic review,2020-03-04,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are mediated by the activation of various kinds of signaling pathways in the innate immune system. Particularly, NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling are involved in the production and secretion of these cytokines. Each signaling is participated in the two steps necessary for IL-1β, a representative pro-inflammatory cytokine, to be processed into a form secreted by cells. In the priming step stimulated by LPS, pro-IL-1β is synthesized through NF-κB activation. Pro-IL-1β cleavages into mature IL-1β by formed NLRP3 inflammasome in the activation step induced by ATP. The mature form of IL-1β is subsequently secreted out of the cell, causing inflammation. Moreover, IL-6 and TNF-α are known to increase in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated conditions. Here, we found that fucoxanthin, one of the major components of Phaeodactylum tricornutum, has an inhibitory effect on NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by the combination of LPS and ATP in bone marrow-derived immune cells as well as astrocytes. Fucoxanthin, which is abundant in the EtOH fraction of Phaeodactylum tricornutum extracts, has shown to have less cell toxicity and found to decrease the production of major pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Fucoxanthin has also shown to suppress the expression of cleaved caspase-1 and the oligomerization of ASC, which are the main components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, phosphorylated IκBα and pro-IL-1β expression decreased in the presence of fucoxanthin, suggesting that fucoxanthin can negatively regulate the priming step of inflammasome signaling. Thus, our results provide reliable evidence that fucoxanthin may serve as a key candidate in the development of potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases as well as neurodegenerative diseases caused by NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","Lee, A-Hyeon; Shin, Hye-Yoon; Park, Jong-Hwi; Koo, Song Yi; Kim, Sang Min; Yang, Seung-Hoon",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80748-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436909/,249

A French nationwide online survey of 11,391 participants",2020-09-15,"CASE REPORT: Metaphyseal osteopathy (MO) was diagnosed in three Australian Kelpie puppies that were presented for veterinary assessment of lameness. The three puppies were siblings. Each was from a different litter by the same breeding pair. The puppy in case one was seen by the authors, and the puppies in cases two and three were patients at other veterinary hospitals. However, the medical records and radiographs were examined and reviewed for this report. Radiographic investigation of the lameness revealed pathognomonic appearance of MO affecting the metaphyseal region of the long bones in all three puppies. The diagnosis was confirmed on histopathology in one patient. CONCLUSION: MO is considered a disease of large and giant‐breed dogs, being rarely reported in non‐large‐breed dogs, and has not been reported in the Australian Kelpie, which is considered a medium‐breed dog. This case series suggests a previously unreported breed predisposition to MO in the Australian Kelpie.","Greenwell, CM; Brain, PH; Dunn, AL",Aust Vet J,https://doi.org/10.1111/avj.12162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673138/,249

Given literature suggesting a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes induction, we examined pancreatic expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key entry factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNA-seq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization, western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated prominent expression of ACE2 in pancreatic ductal epithelium and microvasculature, but we found rare endocrine cell expression at the mRNA level. Pancreata from individuals with COVID-19 demonstrated multiple thrombotic lesions with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein expression that was primarily limited to ducts. These results suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection of pancreatic endocrine cells, via ACE2, is an unlikely central pathogenic feature of COVID-19-related diabetes.","Kusmartseva, Irina; Wu, Wenting; Syed, Farooq; Van Der Heide, Verena; Jorgensen, Marda; Joseph, Paul; Tang, Xiaohan; Candelario-Jalil, Eduardo; Yang, Changjun; Nick, Harry; Harbert, Jack L.; Posgai, Amanda L.; Paulsen, John David; Lloyd, Richard; Cechin, Sirlene; Pugliese, Alberto; Campbell-Thompson, Martha; Vander Heide, Richard S.; Evans-Molina, Carmella; Homann, Dirk; Atkinson, Mark A.",Cell Metab,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120306008?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413120306008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207244/,249
629108,"The prevalence and stressors of job burnout among medical staff in Liaoning, China: a cross-section study",2021-04-23,"BACKGROUND: Surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Central Africa began only recently, and few data are therefore available on the circulation of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronaviruses NL63/HKU1, rhinovirus/human parechovirus, and enterovirus/parainfluenza virus 3. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 1041 specimens, of which 639 (61%) were positive for at least one virus. Three-quarters of the patients were children under five years old. We therefore focused on this age group, in which 68.1% of patients were positive for at least one virus. The most common viruses were adenoviruses (17.5%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4 (16.8%), enteroviruses (EV) (14.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). The prevalence of some viruses was subject to geographic and seasonal variations. One-third of positive samples contained more than one virus. CONCLUSIONS: Like most studies in the world, the virus PIVs, EV, RSV, Influenza virus, HRV were predominant among children under five years old in Gabon. An exception is made for adenoviruses which have a high prevalence in our study. However adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. These finding gave a better knowledge of the circulation and the seasonality of the viruses involved in ILI in Gabon.","Lekana-Douki, Sonia Etenna; Nkoghe, Dieudonné; Drosten, Christian; Ngoungou, Edgar Brice; Drexler, Jan Felix; Leroy, Eric M",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000832/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-373,249
629179,Improving patient care and demonstrating value during a global pandemic: Recommendations from leaders of the Pharmacy Accountability Measures Work Group,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality rates of low birth weight (LBW) newborns at term are higher than rates in normal birth weight (NBW) newborns. LBW newborns are at greater risk to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life possibly as an outcome of compromised innate immune functions. As adaptive immunity is in a naive state, increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW newborns may reflect impairments in innate immunity. METHODOLOGY: To characterize the increased susceptibility to infections in LBW newborns we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression in LBW newborns (n = 8) compared to NBW newborns (n = 4) using cord blood. The results obtained from the microarray study were validated on a larger number of samples using real time RT-PCR (LBW = 22, NBW = 18) and western blotting (LBW = 12, NBW = 12). The Interferome database was used to identify interferon (IFN) signature genes and ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways and biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in LBW newborns. ELISAs for IFNs and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were performed in both LBW and NBW newborns and in adults (LBW = 18, NBW = 18, Adults = 8). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Upon microarray analysis, we identified 1,391 differentially expressed genes, of which, 1,065 genes were down-regulated and 326 genes were up-regulated in the LBW compared to NBW newborns. Of note, 70 IFN-signature genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in LBW compared to NBW newborns. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed pattern recognition receptors signaling including Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) -1, -5, and -8 genes and IFN signaling as the most significantly impacted pathways. Respiratory infectious diseases were the most significantly affected bio-functions in LBW newborns. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Diminished PRRs, IFN-signature, and BPI gene expression raises the possibility that impairments in these pathways contribute to the susceptibility of LBW term infants to infection.","Singh, Vikas Vikram; Chauhan, Sudhir Kumar; Rai, Richa; Kumar, Ashok; Singh, Shiva M.; Rai, Geeta",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23626859/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062845,249
629966,Identification and Management of COVID-19 Related Child and Adolescent Mental Health Problems: A Multi-Tier Intervention Model,2021-02-04,"OBJECTIVES: Affordable options for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance are needed. Virus detection by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is sensitive but costly, and antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are cheap but with reduced sensitivity; both detect current infection but not exposure. RDT-IgM/IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detect exposure but have poor sensitivity for current infection. We investigated if the integration of symptomatic, demographical and diet-related comorbidities data with antibody RDTs improves their potential to assess infection rates in addition to exposure, thereby broadening their utility for surveillance. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2. Health workers collected nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR and RDT antigen assessments and venous blood for RDT-IgM/IgG from symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. Data on age, gender, contact history, symptoms (ie, fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, dyspnoea and diarrhoea), diet-related comorbidities (ie, diabetes and hypertension) and chest radiology were collected. SETTING: High-risk communities in Jakarta, Indonesia, in May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 343 community members’ data were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: RDT-IgM/IgG sensitivity, specificity and predictive values and area under receiver operating characteristic curve for RT-PCR positivity using RDT results alone and in combination with other predictors, including symptom components derived from principal component analysis. RESULTS: There were 24 PCR-confirmed infections. RDT-IgM/IgG-positive tests were associated with infection (OR 10.8, 95% CI 4.43 to 26.4, p<0.001) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.708% and 50% sensitivity, 91.5% specificity, 30.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 96.1% negative predictive value (NPV). RDT results combined with age, gender, contact history, symptoms and comorbidities increased the AUC to 0.787 and yielded 62.5% sensitivity, 87.0% specificity, 26.6% PPV and 96.9% NPV. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RDT-IgM/IgG results integrated with other predictors may be an affordable tool for epidemiological surveillance for population-based COVID-19 exposure and current infection, especially in groups with outbreaks or high transmission.","Agustina, Rina; Syam, Ari Fahrial; Wirawan, Fadila; Widyahening, Indah S; Rahyussalim, Ahmad Jabir; Yusra, Yusra; Rianda, Davrina; Burhan, Erlina; Salama, Ngabila; Daulay, Rebekka; Halim, Ahmad Rhyza Vertando; Shankar, Anuraj H",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376448/,249

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) adds to the urgency of developing effective means to reduce pathogen transmission in mass-gathering public buildings such as schools, hospitals, and airports. To inform occupants and guide facility managers to prevent and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, this study proposed a framework to assess room-level outbreak risks in buildings by modeling built environment characteristics, occupancy information, and pathogen transmission. Building information modeling (BIM) is exploited to automatically retrieve building parameters and possible occupant interactions that are relevant to pathogen transmission. The extracted information is fed into an environment pathogen transmission model to derive the basic reproduction numbers for different pathogens, which serve as proxies of outbreak potentials in rooms. A web-based system is developed to provide timely information regarding outbreak risks to occupants and facility managers. The efficacy of the proposed method was demonstrated by a case study, in which building characteristics, occupancy schedules, pathogen parameters, as well as hygiene and cleaning practices are considered for outbreak risk assessment. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by computationally integrating building, occupant, and pathogen information modeling for infectious disease outbreak assessment, and communicating actionable information for built environment management.","Li, Shuai; Xu, Yifang; Cai, Jiannan; Hu, Da; He, Qiang",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132484/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107394; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320307630?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320307630,249

Individuals’ perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users’ perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 166,005 English tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion. RESULTS: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4% indicate uncertainty about weather’s impact, 33.5% indicate no effect, and 26.1% indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion. DISCUSSION: There is no consensus among the public for weather’s potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weather’s effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenza’s seasonality, President Trump’s comments on weather’s effect, and social distancing.

Thus, we sought to analyze the temporal profiles of specific antibodies, as well as the correlations between the antibodies, proinflammatory cytokines, and survival of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 1830 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recruited. The temporal profiles of the virus, antibodies, and cytokines of the patients until 12 weeks since illness onset were fitted by the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS) method. The mediation effect of cytokines on the associations between antibody responses and survival were explored by mediation analysis. Of the 1830 patients, 1435 were detectable for SARS-CoV-2, while 395 were positive in specific antibodies only. Of the 1435 patients, 2.4% presented seroconversion for neither immunoglobulin G (IgG) nor immunoglobulin M (IgM) during hospitalization. The seropositive rates of IgG and IgM were 29.6% and 48.1%, respectively, in the first week, and plateaued within five weeks. For the patients discharged from the hospital, the IgM decreased slowly, while high levels of IgG were maintained at around 188 AU·mL(−1) for the 12 weeks since illness onset. In contrast, in the patients who subsequently died, IgM declined rapidly and IgG dropped to 87 AU·mL(−1) at the twelfth week. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-2R (IL-2R), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were observed in the deceased patients in comparison with the discharged patients, and 12.5% of the association between low IgG level and mortality risk was mediated by these cytokines.

Several already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported following the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid hub/PubMed, Scopus, ISI web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg's test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P=0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in the Favipiravir group than in the control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P=0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P=0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between the two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant.

Though not viewed as a life threatening condition, it is also recognized to impose significant burden to the quality of life of sufferers and their caretakers and imposes an economic cost to society. Through a PubMed online search of the literature from 2006 to September 2011, this paper aims to review the published literature on rhinitis in young children below the age of 6 years. It is apparent from epidemiology studies that rhinitis in this age group is a relatively common problem. The condition has a heterogenous etiology with classification into allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Respiratory viral infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of long standing rhinitis, but definitive studies are still lacking. Treatment guidelines for management are lacking for this age group, and is a significant unmet need. Although the consensus is that co-morbidities including otitis media with effusion, adenoidal hypertrophy and asthma, are important considerations of management of these children. Pharmacotherapy is limited for young children especially for those below the age of 2 years. This review underscores the lack of understanding of rhinitis in early childhood and therefore the need for further research in this area.","Hardjojo, Antony; Shek, Lynette PC; van Bever, Hugo PS; Lee, Bee Wah",Asia Pac Allergy,https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2011.1.3.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22053307/,249

This study examined gender differences across broad indicators of adolescent well‐being during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Iceland, and explored potential explanations for these differences. METHODS: In total, 523 youth (56.5% girls) born in Iceland in 2004 completed measures on mental health problems (depressive symptoms, anger and suicide attempts) and measures designed for this study to assess broad indicators of adolescent well‐being (e.g., day‐to‐day life, academic performance, family and peer relationships, and mental and physical health) and behavioral changes during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Mental health problems during the pandemic were compared to expected scores based on nationwide ratings of same‐aged peers in 2018. RESULTS: Although both boys and girls appeared affected, girls reported a greater negative impact across all the broad indicators of well‐being and behavioral change during COVID‐19 than boys, and their depressive symptoms were above and beyond the expected nationwide scores (t(1514) = 4.80, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.315). Higher depressive symptoms were associated with increased passive social media use and decreased connecting with family members via telephone or social media among girls, and decreased sleeping and increased online gaming alone among boys. Concern about others contracting COVID‐19, changes in daily and school routines, and not seeing friends in person were among the primary contributors to poor mental health identified by youth, particularly girls. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents were broadly negatively affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic and accompanying restrictions; however, this negative impact was more pronounced in girls. The findings suggest that a steady routine and remaining socially connected may help youth cope with the uncertainty and social restrictions associated with a pandemic. Moreover, healthcare providers, teachers, and other professionals should pay close attention to depressive symptoms among girls during a pandemic.","Halldorsdottir, Thorhildur; Thorisdottir, Ingibjorg Eva; Meyers, Caine C.

Objectives: To assess clinical and weekly laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE. Methods: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset were compared between PE and non-PE patients. Results: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD13.7) vs 69.9 (SD12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p=0.04); 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p=0.03); and 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p=0.01). Median fold-increase of D-dimer between week 1 and 2 differed between groups (6.64 [3.02-23.05] vs 1.57 [0.64-2.71], p=0.003); ROC curve AUC was 0.879 (p=0.003) with a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 86% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, D-dimer levels are higher at weeks 2, 3 and 4 after COVID-19 symptom onset in patients who develop PE.

This review discusses the invaluable insight revealed from vaccine clinical trials in women who were vaccinated and inadvertently became pregnant during the trial period. It further explores a number of clinical avenues in their management and proposes a drug development strategy in‐line with clinical trials for vaccines and drug treatments for the drug development community. Little is known of the long‐term effects of COVID‐19 on the mother and the baby. Our hypothesis that COVID‐19 predisposes pregnant women to preeclampsia or hypertensive disorders during pregnancy is supported by a clinical study and this may also adversely impact a woman’s cardiovascular disease risk later in life. It may also increase the risk of preeclampsia in their subsequent pregnancy. This is an ever‐evolving landscape and early knowledge for healthcare providers and drug innovators is offered to ensure benefits outweigh the risks. COVID‐19 mRNA vaccines appear to generate robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women. This novel approach to vaccination also offers new ways to therapeutically tackle disorders of many unmet medical needs.,"Abbas‐Hanif, Allyah; Rezai, Homira; Ahmed, S.

648554,Cleveland Clinic International IV Robotics Summit,2021-02-18,"Objective: To evaluate the incidence of postpartum depression in mothers who endured maternal-neonatal separation at delivery and in the postpartum period due to their SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR status. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 18th to May 12th 2020, when maternal-neonatal separation was recommended for SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers by the American Academy of Pediatrics. We excluded women who were less than 18 years of age at the time of delivery and those who experienced an IUFD or neonatal death. We investigated the difference in postpartum depression rates between SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers. SARS-CoV-2 status was determined using a nasopharyngeal PCR swab upon admission to labor and delivery. We conducted analyses using Fischer Exact Tests, where a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result(s): The incidence of postpartum depression was 2.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers versus 10.3% in SARS-COV-2 positive mothers with a p-value of 0.02. The relative risk of developing PPD in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers was 3.73 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.03-13.4 with a p-value of 0.04. Conclusion(s): There was increased incidence and relative risk of postpartum depression in patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients and providers should be made aware of this possible association. One possible contributing factor to the increased incidence of postpartum depression may have been maternal-neonatal separation. Current CDC evidence demonstrates low risk of neonatal acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic positive mothers. The results of this study suggest another reason to follow the updated American Academy of Pediatrics SARS-CoV-2 recommendation, that asymptomatic mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be allowed to room in with their neonate and not endure maternal-neonatal separation.

The strict disciplinary measures implemented by China were very effective and thus were subsequently adopted by most world countries to various degrees. The infection duration and number of infected persons are of critical importance for the battle against the pandemic. We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading in China as a benchmark and utilize infection data from eight countries to estimate the complete evolution of the infection in each of these countries. The analysis predicts successfully both the expected number of daily infections per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each country. Our quantitative approach is based on a Gaussian spreading hypothesis that is shown to arise as a result of imposed measures in a simple dynamical infection model. This may have consequences and shed light in the efficiency of policies once the phenomenon is over.","Barmparis, G.D.; Tsironis, G.P.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302423; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341627/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302423?v=s5; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14334v4.pdf,249

In early 2020, we saw an increase in panic buying as a response to a real and/or perceived lack of resources due to COVID-19. Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors. This article will focus on psychodynamic understandings of panic buying as a response to events that result in negative emotions. By providing a psychodynamic understanding of panic buying, authors hope to contribute to the therapy of clients presenting with related behaviors and their associated negative affect.","Cooper, Marty A.; Gordon, Jamie L.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.666715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937180/,249

METHODS: In the present prospective observational study, 225 healthy individuals in Kumamoto General Hospital, Japan, who received two BNT162b2 doses in February 2021, were enrolled. Correlates of BNT162b2-elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity (50% neutralization titer: NT(50); assessed using infectious virions and live target cells) with SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding-IgG and -IgM levels, adverse effects (AEs), ages, and genders were examined. The average half-life of neutralizing activity and the average time length for the loss of detectable neutralizing activity were determined and the potency of serums against variants of concerns was also determined. FINDINGS: Significant rise in NT(50)s was seen in serums on day 28 post-1st dose. A moderate inverse correlation was seen between NT(50)s and ages, but no correlation was seen between NT(50)s and AEs. NT(50)s and IgG levels on day 28 post-1st dose and pain scores following the 2nd shot were greater in women than in men. The average half-life of neutralizing activity in the vaccinees was approximately 67.8 days and the average time length for their serums to lose the detectable neutralizing activity was 198.3 days. While serums from elite-responders (NT(50)s>1,500-fold: the top 4% among all participants’ NT(50)s) potently to moderately blocked the infectivity of variants of concerns, some serums with moderate NT(50)s failed to block the infectivity of a beta strain. INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2-elicited immune response has no significant association with AEs. BNT162b2-efficacy is likely diminished to under detection limit by 6–7 months post-1st shot. High-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums potently to moderately block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants; however, a few moderate-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums failed to do so. If BNT162b2-elicited immunity memory is short, an additional vaccine or other protective measures would be needed.","Maeda, Kenji; Amano, Masayuki; Uemura, Yukari; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Matsushima, Tomoko; Noda, Kenta; Shimizu, Yosuke; Fujiwara, Asuka; Takamatsu, Yuki; Ichikawa, Yasuko; Nishimura, Hidehiro; Kinoshita, Mari; Matsumoto, Shota; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Yoshimura, Kazuhisa; Oka, Shin-ichi; Mikami, Ayako; Sugiura, Wataru; Sato, Toshiyuki; Yoshida, Tomokazu; Shimada, Shinya; Mitsuya, Hiroaki",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.27.21261237v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.27.21261237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373860/,249

657684,"Mental Health Symptoms, Binge Drinking, and the Experience of Abuse During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Mexico",2021-07-22,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavinus, contains a nonsegmented RNA genome. We have previously shown that MHV could undergo RNA-RNA recombination in crosses between temperature-sensitive mutants and wild-type viruses at a very high frequency (S. Makino, J. G. Keck, S. A. Stohlman, and M. M. C. Lai (1986) J. Virol. 57, 729–737). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different sets of MHV strains. Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5′-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5′-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5′-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5′-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of “copy-choice” recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.","Keck, James G.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Side, Lisa H.; Makino, Shinji; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027982/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287904132; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287904132,249

Although such thrombotic events are more commonly seen during phases of active AAV, they are also recognized to occur during AAV in remission. Endothelial injury is a key pathogenic event in AAV. Endothelial injury can be caused by neutrophil activation and release of thrombogenic tissue factor into the circulation. Neutrophil activation further results in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs contribute to thrombosis by expressing tissue factor. NETs have also been detected in cutaneous thrombi from patients with AAV induced by hydralazine. Activated neutrophils in AAV patients release thrombogenic microparticles loaded with tissue factor which further enhances clotting of blood. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs) have been detected in up to a third of AAV and might also be induced by drugs such as cocaine adulterated with levamisole and propylthiouracil, which are known to trigger AAV. Such APLs further drive the thrombosis in AAV. Once thrombogenesis occurs, the homeostatic mechanisms resulting in clot dissolution are further impaired in AAV due to anti-plasminogen antibodies. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with endothelial injury and NETosis, mechanisms which are in common with AAV. Reports of new-onset AAV following COVID-19 have been described in the literature, and there could be shared mechanisms driving these processes that require further evaluation.","Misra, Durga Prasanna; Thomas, Koshy Nithin; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Zimba, Olena",Clin Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-021-05790-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109491/,249

Here, we raise the issue of false-positive on rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 with the first case of acute HIV infection who repeatedly positive for the rapid antigen test. A 39-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of high-grade fever, dry cough, general fatigue, and anorexia. The rapid antigen test performed on a nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive, therefore the patient was separated in an isolated room apart from the COVID-19 ward while awaiting the confirmatory RT-PCR result. However, the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 performed on nasopharyngeal swabs was repeatedly negative (three times), while the antigen test was repeatedly positive (three times in total). This patient was eventually diagnosed with acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on a high titer of HIV-RNA and absence of plasma HIV-1/2 antibodies.

665581,"Addressing Public Health Emergencies via Facebook Surveys: Advantages, Challenges, and Practical Considerations",2020-12-14,"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unparalleled pursuit of vaccines to induce specific adaptive immunity, based on virus-neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. Although several vaccines have been developed just a year after SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, global deployment will take months or even years. Meanwhile, the virus continues to take a severe toll on human life and exact substantial economic costs. Innate immunity is fundamental to mammalian host defense capacity to combat infections. Innate immune responses, triggered by a family of pattern recognition receptors, induce interferons and other cytokines and activate both myeloid and lymphoid immune cells to provide protection against a wide range of pathogens. Epidemiological and biological evidence suggests that the live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) targeting tuberculosis, measles, and polio induce protective innate immunity by a newly described form of immunological memory termed “trained immunity.” An LAV designed to induce adaptive immunity targeting a particular pathogen may also induce innate immunity that mitigates other infectious diseases, including COVID-19, as well as future pandemic threats. Deployment of existing LAVs early in pandemics could complement the development of specific vaccines, bridging the protection gap until specific vaccines arrive. The broad protection induced by LAVs would not be compromised by potential antigenic drift (immune escape) that can render viruses resistant to specific vaccines. LAVs might offer an essential tool to “bend the pandemic curve,” averting the exhaustion of public health resources and preventing needless deaths and may also have therapeutic benefits if used for postexposure prophylaxis of disease.","Chumakov, Konstantin; Avidan, Michael S.; Benn, Christine S.; Bertozzi, Stefano M.; Blatt, Lawrence; Chang, Angela Y.; Jamison, Dean T.; Khader, Shabaana A.; Kottilil, Shyam; Netea, Mihai G.; Sparrow, Annie; Gallo, Robert C.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101718118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006644/,249

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; α = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether CCP will reduce intubation or death non-intubated adults with COVID-19.

669846,The coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic's impact on mental health,2020-06-22,"BACKGROUND: The success of government-recommended mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic depends largely on information uptake and implementation by individual citizens. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess citizens’ knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 recommendations in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. METHODS: A cross-sectional electronic survey with open and closed questions was disseminated by community-based partners prior to the relaxation of government restrictions. Outcomes included citizen knowledge (9-question measure) and worry about the virus, perception of government measures, and recommendations for improvements. Comparisons used linear regression, controlling for age, sex, education, and health literacy. Free-text answers were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Of 807 people who accessed the survey, 684 (85%) completed all questions and 479 (60%) gave free-text recommendations. Overall, 75% were female, the mean age was 48 years, and 93% had high health literacy. Knowledge scores were high, with a median score of 8 out of 9. Mean levels of worry about the COVID-19 pandemic were higher in women than men (55/100 versus 44/100, P<.001), and in respondents with lower health literacy (57/100 versus 52/100, P=.03). Self-reported adherence to recommendations was high (85%) and increased with age and worry (both P<.001). Respondents rated their own adherence higher than others (85% versus 61%, P<.001). Moreover, 34% of respondents reported having self-quarantined; this rose to 52% for those aged ≥75 years. Those who had self-quarantined reported higher levels of fear. Nearly half (49%) of respondents felt the government response had been adequate, though younger age and higher levels of worry were associated with considering the response to be insufficient (both P<.001). Analysis of open-text answers revealed 4 major themes: access to and use of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer; government messaging; lockdown and lockdown exit plan communication; and testing for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge, adherence, and satisfaction regarding government recommendations and response were high in this sample, but many desired greater access to personal protective equipment. Those with lower health literacy and those who have been in self-isolation reported greater concerns about the pandemic.","Selby, Kevin; Durand, Marie-Anne; Gouveia, Alexandre; Bosisio, Francesca; Barazzetti, Gaia; Hostettler, Maxime; D'Acremont, Valérie; Kaufmann, Alain; von Plessen, Christian",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/20871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156809/,249

De hecho, no existe todavía un tratamiento claramente efectivo, además de las medidas de soporte, contra el SARS-CoV-2. Los esfuerzos se han centrado en recuperar fármacos antivirales empleados previamente contra otras infecciónes viricas y en el uso de antiinflamatorios, dado el estado hiperinflamatorio que pueden sufrir los pacientes con COVID-19 y que se asocia con un peor pronóstico de la enfermedad. Sin embargo, estos fármacos, usados en ocasiones de manera compasiva, pueden causar efectos secundarios graves o interacciones farmacológicas que se debe conocer. El objetivo de este artículo es revisar el estado actual del conocimiento sobre los tratamientos farmacológicos más usados contra la COVID-19 en nuestro medio, prestando una especial atención a los efectos secundarios y las interacciones farmacológicas relacionadas con el sistema cardiovascular. The search for effective treatments against COVID-19 in the current pandemic has presented the scientific community with an enormous challenge. In fact, there is still no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, apart from supportive measures. Research has focused on re-examining antiviral drugs that were previously used against other viral infections and on the use of anti-inflammatories, since COVID-19 patients can develop a hyperinflammatory state, which is associated with a poorer disease prognosis. However, these drugs, sometimes administered on a compassionate-use basis, can cause serious side effects or drug interactions that we should be aware of. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of what is currently known about the pharmacological therapies most frequently used against COVID-19 in our field, while paying particular attention to the adverse events and drug interactions that can affect the cardiovascular system.","Iglesias, Mercedes; Benavent, Eva; Murillo, Óscar; Luis Ferreiro, José",Revista Española de Cardiología Suplementos,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1131358720300339; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1131358720300339,249

Disconcertingly, their frequency persists, with four “major” pandemics disrupting the planet in the last 65 years and more expected in the future. While many of the economic and health consequences of pandemics are well-documented, their marketing implications are less understood. Addressing this gap, we develop a broad, conceptual framework to highlight the characteristics and impacts of pandemics as they relate to marketing. We first identify four macro-level forces that characterize pandemics and highlight their marketing implications. Next, using the 7P marketing mix model as the organizing structure, we discuss these implications at a micro-level and identify a set of research questions to stimulate further inquiry, not only to generate deeper insights pertaining to pandemics’ marketing implications but also to envision new developments in these areas. Finally, we identify pandemics’ disproportionate impacts on and implications for some industry sectors, including healthcare, retail, education, hospitality, and tourism.","Das, Gopal; Jain, Shailendra Pratap; Maheswaran, Durairaj; Slotegraaf, Rebecca J.; Srinivasan, Raji",J Acad Mark Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11747-021-00786-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994600/,249

We analyzed more than eight million randomly selected Twitter posts from the first wave of the pandemic to study the role of the author’s social status (Health Expert or Influencer) and the informational novelty of the tweet in the diffusion of several key types of information. Our results show that health-related information and political discourse propagated faster than personal narratives, economy-related or travel-related news. Content novelty further accelerated the spread of these discussion themes. People trusted health experts on health-related knowledge, especially when it was novel, while influencers were more effective at propagating political discourse. Finally, we observed a U-shaped relationship between the informational novelty and the number of retweets. Tweets with average novelty spread the least. Tweets with high novelty propagated the most, primarily when they discussed political, health, or personal information, perhaps owing to the immediacy to mobilize this information. On the other hand, economic and travel-related information spread most when it was less novel, and people resisted sharing such information before it was duly verified.","Photiou, Antonis; Nicolaides, Christos; Dhillon, Paramveer S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635687/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99060-y,249

Widespread public health measures and travel restrictions have dampened viral spread but outbreaks are expected as restrictions are raised. This study was carried out in order to devise an approach that may help to predict deaths based on upsurges (spikes or waves) of cases. Methods Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to August 2020 was obtained from the Our World In Data website. For the purposes of more detailed analysis, in addition to total global data, three countries were chosen for sub analysis: Italy, Germany and the United States. Results Delay to death (days) were as follows: World: 20.6 (95% CI: 8.4-32.8); USA: 19.8 (95% CI: 9.3-30.4); Germany: 18.8 (95% CI: 6.1-31.6); Italy: 2.4 (95% CI -10.2-15.0). Discussion Countries may be able to contain viral resurgence by adhering to WHO advice for reopening from restrictions/lockdowns. However, outbreaks are almost inevitable and deaths are to be expected approximately 20 days after rises in cases. This paper may therefore aid healthcare systems and hospitals for surges in cases as positive COVID-19 swabs increase in any given locality.","Grech, Victor; Scherb, Hagen",Early Hum Dev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220306940; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105210; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220306940?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039257/,249

Slightly more than two decades ago, a new type of IFN was discovered: the lambda IFN (type III IFN). Like other IFN, the type III IFN display antiviral activity against a wide variety of infections, they induce expression of antiviral, interferon-stimulated genes (MX1, OAS, IFITM1), and they have immuno-modulatory activities that shape adaptive immune responses. Unlike other IFN, the type III IFN signal through distinct receptors is limited to a few cell types, primarily mucosal epithelial cells. As a consequence of their greater and more durable production in nasal and respiratory tissues, they can determine the outcome of respiratory infections. This review is focused on the role of IFN-λ in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, with influenza as a prime example. The influenza virus is a major public health problem, causing up to half a million lethal infections annually. Moreover, the virus has been the cause of four pandemics over the last century. Although IFN-λ are increasingly being tested in antiviral therapy, they can have a negative influence on epithelial tissue recovery and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, IFN-λ expression deserves increased scrutiny as a key factor in the host immune response to infection.","Lozhkov, Alexey A.; Klotchenko, Sergey A.; Ramsay, Edward S.; Moshkoff, Herman D.; Moshkoff, Dmitry A.; Vasin, Andrey V.; Salvato, Maria S.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255985/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9120989,249

We performed a moving total of > 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in parallel to standard routine testing since the start of the outbreak. A LIS implementation team dedicated to develop tools to remove the bottlenecks, primarily situated in the pre- and post-analytical phase, was established early in the crisis. RESULTS: We outline the design, implementation and requirements of LIS functionality related to managing increased test demand during the COVID-19 crisis, including tools for test ordering, standardized order sets integrated into a computerized provider order entry module, notifications on shipping requirements, automated triaging based on digital metadata forms, and the establishment of databases with contact details of other laboratories and primary care physicians to enable automated reporting. We also describe our approach to data mining and reporting of actionable daily summary statistics to governing bodies and other policymakers. DISCUSSION: Rapidly developed, agile extendable LIS functionality and its meaningful use alleviates the administrative burden on laboratory personnel and improves turn-around-time of SARS-CoV-2 testing.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: The emergency expansion of an ICU from eight general beds to 30 coronavirus disease 2019 beds. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the ICU of Luigi Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) for greater than or equal to 48 hours between February 21, 2020, and April 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of bloodstream infections per 1,000 days of ICU stay was calculated in 89 coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the cumulative probability of bloodstream infection was estimated using death and ICU discharge as competing events. Sixty patients (67.4%) experienced at least one of the 93 recorded episodes of bloodstream infection, a frequency of 87 per 1,000 days of ICU stay (95% CI, 67–112).The patients who experienced a bloodstream infection had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score upon ICU admission (9.5; interquartile range, 8–12 vs 8, interquartile range, 5–10; p = 0.042), a longer median ICU stay (15 d; interquartile range, 11–23 vs 8, interquartile range, 5–12; p < 0.001), and more frequently required invasive mechanical ventilation (98.3% vs 82.8%; p = 0.013) than those who did not. The median time from ICU admission to the first bloodstream infection episode was 10 days. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 74 episodes (79.6%), with Enterococcus species being the most prevalent (53 episodes, 55.8%). Thirty-two isolates (27.3%) showed multidrug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 seemed to increase the frequency of bloodstream infections (particularly Enterococcus-related bloodstream infection) after ICU admission.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lockdown on glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) followed through telemedicine. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This observational study involved patients with T1D using the real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) Dexcom G6(®). Ambulatory glucose profile data from the 3-months before schools closure (November 26, 2019–February 23, 2020; T0) and from the 3-months of consecutive lockdown (February 24–May 18, 2020; T1) were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-two children and adolescents (11.1 ± 4.37 years, 50% males) with T1D (median time disease 3.67 years) were enrolled in the study. Insulin total daily dose was unchanged, while time spent on physical activities was decreased (p<0.0001). Despite the lack of statistical significance, median value of the glucose management indicator decreased from 7.4% to 7.25%. Glucose standard deviation (p<0.0001) and coefficient of variation (p=0.001) improved across the study. Median time in range increased from 60.5% to 63.5% (p=0.008), time above range decreased from 37.3% to 34.1% (p=0.048), and time below range decreased from 1.85% to 1.45% (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in our children and adolescents with T1D glycemic control improved during lockdown. Despite patients were confined to their homes and limited to exercise, our data suggest that the use of real-time CGM, the continuous parental management, and the telemedicine can display beneficial effects on T1D care.","Predieri, Barbara; Leo, Francesco; Candia, Francesco; Lucaccioni, Laura; Madeo, Simona F.; Pugliese, Marisa; Vivaccia, Valentina; Bruzzi, Patrizia; Iughetti, Lorenzo",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424771/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.595735,249
