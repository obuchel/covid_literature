4541,What about lay counselors’ experiences of task-shifting mental health interventions? Example from a family-based intervention in Kenya,2020-02-20,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus was reported in Wenshan City, southwestern China in 2017. The study describes the epidemiological and virological features of the outbreak and discusses the origin of the infection. METHODS: Poultry exposure and timelines of key events for each patient were collected. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: Five patients were reported in the outbreak. An epidemiological investigation showed that all patients had been exposed at live poultry markets. The A(H7N9) isolates from these patients had low pathogenicity in avian species. Both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences indicated that the source of infection was from Guangxi Province, which lies 100 km to the east of Wenshan City. CONCLUSIONS: In the study, a sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9 was documented in urban area of Wenshan City. Chickens were an important carrier in the H7N9 virus spreading from Guangxi to Wenshan. Hygienic management of live poultry markets and virological screening of chickens transported across regions should be reinforced to limit the spread of H7N9 virus.","Jiang, Li; Zhao, Xiaonan; Xu, Wen; Zhou, Xuehua; Luo, Chunrui; Zhou, Jiunan; Fu, Xiaoqing; Chen, Yaoyao; Li, Duo",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031964/,444

Anxiety, aggression, rage, incomprehension, and distraction are only a few feelings of the concerned people which intensive care staff must take care of. Crisis intervention, developed in the middle of the last century, offers a framework with its concepts for the healthcare staff of how to work with the bereaved people during the first few hours. The BASIS model is a sort of counseling technique that guides nurses and physicians: bonding and urging the acceptance of the facts, providing structure and information, and securing backup support networks. Professionals who offer help need a high level of empathy and compassion for their work. But it is essential to offer help only in situations where advice is possible. Otherwise, physicians and nurses are at high risk to develop compassion fatigue. The right training, advanced education, and supervision are necessary, so that healthcare professionals can support people in crisis.","Brauchle, M.; Wildbahner, T.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222894/,444

Novel designs with simultaneous application of different AOPs can offer better solutions for cleaner water. METHODS: We have comparatively studied two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on decolourisation of Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) azo dye pollutant from water: gas plasma treatment by low power atmospheric pressure plasma using novel plasma needle configuration, and semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalysis using titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) nanopowders. Additionally, simultaneous application of two advanced oxidation processes on azo dye decolourisation was studied. RESULTS: It was found that plasma treatment is very efficient system for the dye removal even for low flow rates (1 slm) of the Ar as feed gas. The presence of 10% of O(2) in Ar flow intensified dye oxidation process and shortened required time for total decolourisation. When plasma and catalyst were simultaneously applied, TiO(2) was activated with a few Watts plasma source as well as 300 W UV lamp source. The synergic effect of two AOPs was more pronounced for higher feed gas flow rates, resulting in improved decolourisation efficiency. CONCLUSION: Plasma needle can efficiently remove Reactive Orange 16 azo dye from water with a power consumption of only few Watts. With the addition of TiO(2) the removal efficiency is significantly improved.

12150,"Acceptability and Utility of an Open-Access, Online Single-Session Intervention Platform for Adolescent Mental Health",2020-06-30,"For the sake of solving the optimization problem of urban waste collection and transportation in China, a priority considered green vehicle routing problem (PCGVRP) model in a waste management system is constructed in this paper, and specific algorithms are designed to solve the model. We pay particular concern to the possibility of immediate waste collection services for high-priority waste bins, e.g., those containing hospital or medical waste, because the harmful waste needs to be collected immediately. Otherwise, these may cause dangerous or negative effects. From the perspective of environmental protection, the proposed PCGVRP model considers both greenhouse gas (GHG) emission costs and conventional waste management costs. Waste filling level (WFL) is considered with the deployment of sensors on waste bins to realize dynamic routes instead of fixed routes, so that the economy and efficiency of waste collection and transportation can be improved. The optimal solution is obtained by a local search hybrid algorithm (LSHA), that is, the initial optimal solution is obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and then a local search is performed on the initial optimal solution, which will be optimized by a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm by virtue of the global search capability. Several instances are selected from the database of capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) so as to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed LSHA algorithm. In addition, to obtain credible results and conclusions, a case using data about waste collection and transportation is employed to verify the PCGVRP model, and the effectiveness and practicability of the model was tested by setting a series of values of bins’ number with high priority and WFLs. The results show that (1) the proposed model can achieve a 42.3% reduction of negative effect compared with the traditional one; (2) a certain value of WFL between 60% and 80% can realize high efficiency of the waste collection and transportation; and (3) the best specific value of WFL is determined by the number of waste bins with high priority. Finally, some constructive propositions are put forward for the Environmental Protection Administration and waste management institutions based on these conclusions.","Wu, Hailin; Tao, Fengming; Yang, Bo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400456/,444
13317,Bollywood on the brain: gender and mental health in Hindi cinema,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diagnosed chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among pregnant women in the Netherlands is 0.26%, yet many cases remain undiagnosed. HCV screening and treatment of pregnant HCV carriers could reduce the burden of disease and limit vertical transmission from mother to child. We assessed the impact of HCV screening and subsequent treatment with new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among pregnant women in the Netherlands. METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov transition state model was developed, to evaluate the public-health and economic impact of HCV screening and treatment. Besides all 179,000 pregnant women in the Netherlands (cohort 1), we modelled 3 further cohorts: all 79,000 first-time pregnant women (cohort 2), 33,000 pregnant migrant women (cohort 3) and 16,000 first-time pregnant migrant women (cohort 4). Each cohort was analyzed in various scenarios: i no intervention, i.e., the current practice, ii screen-and-treat, i.e., the most extensive approach involving treatment of all individuals found HCV-positive, and iii screen-and-treat/monitor, i.e., a strategy involving treatment of symptomatic (F1–F4) patients and follow-up of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers with subsequent treatment only at progression. RESULTS: For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (ii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €9,306 and €10,173 per QALY gained and 5 year budget impacts varying between €6,283,830 and €19,220,405. For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (iii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €1,739 and €2,749 per QALY gained and budget impacts varying between €1,468,670 and €5,607,556. For all cohorts, the ICERs (scenario iii versus ii) involved in delayed treatment of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers varied between €56,607 and €56,892, well above the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained and even above a threshold of €50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Universal screening for HCV among all pregnant women in the Netherlands is cost-effective. However, it would be reasonable to consider smaller risk groups in view of the budget impact of the intervention.

Although the precise physiological role of INSL5/RXFP4 remains elusive, a number of studies have suggested it to be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and other metabolic disorders. Since selective agonists of RXFP4 are scarcely available and peptidic analogs of INSL5 are hard to make, we conducted a high-throughput screening campaign against 52,000 synthetic and natural compounds targeting RXFP4. Of the 109 initial hits discovered, only 3 compounds were confirmed in secondary screening, with JK0621-D008 displaying the best agonism at human RXFP4. Its S-configuration stereoisomer (JK1) was subsequently isolated and validated by a series of bioassays, demonstrating a consistent agonistic effect in cells overexpressing RXFP4. This scaffold may provide a valuable tool to further explore the biological functions of RXFP4.","Lin, Guang-yao; Lin, Lin; Cai, Xiao-qing; Dai, An-tao; Zhu, Yue; Li, Jie; Liu, Qing; Yang, De-hua; Bathgate, Ross A.

The widespread expression of H-1 receptor on different cells in the skin and various biologic functions of H-1 antihistamines indicate the possible treatment potentials of H-1 antihistamines in dermatology. A literature search was performed on PubMed and Embase, targeting articles reporting use of antihistamine for purposes other than itch and urticaria control in dermatological practice. Several off-label usages of antihistamines were identified, including alopecia, acne, Darier disease, eosinophilic dermatoses, paraneoplastic dermatoses, psoriasis, lichen nitidus, radiation dermatitis, skin dysesthesia, and cutaneous malignancies. Additional benefits were observed when H-1 antihistamines were used either alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities. Although various novel uses of H-1 antihistamines have been uncovered, the evidence level of most included studies is weak. Further randomized control trials are warranted to better evaluate the efficacy and dosage of H-1 antihistamine for dermatological disorders.","Hsieh, Chang-Yu; Tsai, Tsen-Fang",Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8163952/,444

STUDY DESIGN: Study of 266 ELGANs born at gestational age (GA) ≤ 28 weeks (w). Primary Outcome measure—composite outcome of moderate-severe BPD/Death using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD’s (2001) BPD definition. RESULT: Cohort’s mean GA and birth-weight (BW) were 25.3 ± 1.4w and 724 ± 14 g respectively with an overall mortality of 19% and moderate-severe BPD of 67%. Prevalence of moderate-severe BPD/death decreased significantly with increasing GA (86–93%) at 23–24 w; to <60% at 27–28w (OR 0.63; 95% CI; 0.52–0.77). On univariate analysis, other risk factors included BW(OR 1.005; 95% CI; 1.003–1.007), Sepsis (OR 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3–6.4), PDA needing treatment (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3–3.9); air leaks (OR 2.7; 95% CI; 1.02–7.3) FiO(2) requirement >25%(OR 1.06; 95% CI; 1.01–1.11); and mechanical ventilation(MV) on Day7 (OR5.5; 95% CI; 2.8–10.8).

20177,What’s in a Name? A Lot! Ours Is Now the National Council for Mental Wellbeing,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: The widespread use of low-dose chest CT screening has improved the detection of early lung adenocarcinoma. Radical surgery is the best treatment strategy for patients with early lung adenocarcinoma; however, some patients present with postoperative recurrence and poor prognosis. Through this study, we hope to establish a model that can identify patients that are prone to recurrence and have poor prognosis after surgery for early lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened prognostic and relapse-related genes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the GSE50081 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE30219 dataset was used to further screen target genes and construct a risk prognosis signature. Time-dependent ROC analysis, calibration degree analysis, and DCA were used to evaluate the reliability of the model. We validated the TCGA dataset, GSE50081, and GSE30219 internally. External validation was conducted in the GSE31210 dataset. RESULTS: A novel four-gene signature (INPP5B, FOSL2, CDCA3, RASAL2) was established to predict relapse-related survival outcomes in patients with early lung adenocarcinoma after surgery. The discovery of these genes may reveal the molecular mechanism of recurrence and poor prognosis of early lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, ROC analysis, calibration analysis and DCA were used to verify the genetic signature internally and externally. Our results showed that our gene signature had a good predictive ability for recurrence and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: We established a four-gene signature and predictive model to predict the recurrence and corresponding survival rates in patients with early lung adenocarcinoma after surgery. These may be helpful for reforumulating post-operative consolidation treatment strategies.","Han, Peng; Yue, Jiaqi; Kong, Kangle; Hu, Shan; Cao, Peng; Deng, Yu; Li, Fan; Zhao, Bo",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349519/,444

34318,High level of vaccination and protection against hepatitis B with low rate of HCV infection markers among hospital health care personnel in north of Iran: a cross-sectional study,2020-06-12,"Neural networks (NN) are taking over ever more decisions thus far taken by humans, even though verifiable system-level guarantees are far out of reach. Neither is the verification technology available, nor is it even understood what a formal, meaningful, extensible, and scalable testbed might look like for such a technology. The present paper is a modest attempt to improve on both the above aspects. We present a family of formal models that contain basic features of automated decision making contexts and which can be extended with further orthogonal features, ultimately encompassing the scope of autonomous driving. Due to the possibility to model random noise in the decision actuation, each model instance induces a Markov decision process (MDP) as verification object. The NN in this context has the duty to actuate (near-optimal) decisions. From the verification perspective, the externally learnt NN serves as a determinizer of the MDP, the result being a Markov chain which as such is amenable to statistical model checking. The combination of a MDP and a NN encoding the action policy is central to what we call “deep statistical model checking” (DSMC). While being a straightforward extension of statistical model checking, it enables to gain deep insight into questions like “how high is the NN-induced safety risk?”, “how good is the NN compared to the optimal policy?” (obtained by model checking the MDP), or “does further training improve the NN?”. We report on an implementation of DSMC inside The Modest Toolset in combination with externally learnt NNs, demonstrating the potential of DSMC on various instances of the model family.","Gros, Timo P.; Hermanns, Holger; Hoffmann, Jörg; Klauck, Michaela; Steinmetz, Marcel","Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281856/,444
34360,Adapting for Unique Settings,2020-06-14,"While there is not much discussion on the importance of formally describing and analysing quantitative requirements in the process of software construction; in the paradigm of API-based software systems it could be vital. Quantitative attributes can be thought as attributes determining the Quality of Service – QoS provided by a software component published as a service. In this sense, they play a determinant role in classifying software artifacts according to specific needs stated as requirements. In previous works we presented an efficient, and fully automatic, analysis technique for establishing Service Level Agreements – SLA. Such a proposal relays on describing QoS contracts as convex specifications, and compliance checking is performed by the application of an analysis algorithm based on state of the art techniques used in hybrid system verification. Such a technique succeeds in offering a procedure for determining SLA but fails in the more realistic scenario where, potentially, no service fully satisfies the requirements. In this scenario the running application may still prefer to invoke the service that offers the best chances of successfully executing with values for QoS attributes meeting the requirements satisfactorily. In this work we propose and implement a metric for automatically quantifying partial satisfaction of QoS requirements, leading to a way of ranking services according to such notion of partial compliance.","Martinez Suñé, Agustín Eloy; Lopez Pombo, Carlos Gustavo",Coordination Models and Languages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282844/,444

We created a pipeline that segmented chest X-Ray (CXR) images prior to classifying them and we compared the performance of our framework with the existing ones. We demonstrated that pre-trained models and simple classifiers such as shallow neural networks can compete with the complex systems. We also validated our framework on the publicly available Shenzhen and Montgomery lung datasets and compared its performance to the currently available solutions. Our method was able to reach the same level of accuracy as the best performing models trained on the Montgomery dataset however, the advantage of our approach is in smaller number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, our InceptionV3 based model almost tied with the best performing solution on the Shenzhen dataset despite being computationally less expensive.","Zak, Matthew; Krzyżak, Adam",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304013/,444

As an NP-hard problem with exponential complexity it imposes limitations on the size of practically solvable problems. In this paper, we present a solution to the challenge of scheduling workflow applications with the help of the D-Wave quantum annealer. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work directly addressing workflow scheduling using quantum computing. Our solution includes transformation into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and discussion of experimental results, as well as possible applications of the solution. For our experiments we choose four problem instances small enough to fit into the annealer’s architecture. For two of our instances the quantum annealer finds the global optimum for scheduling. We thus show that it is possible to solve such problems with the help of the D-Wave machine and discuss the limitations of this approach.","Tomasiewicz, Dawid; Pawlik, Maciej; Malawski, Maciej; Rycerz, Katarzyna",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304716/,444

Results: 89.6% of countries were inefficient in pandemic control and 79% were inefficient in treatment measures. Sensitivity analysis underlines resources as a critical factor. Further examination points to absence of a robust and uniform mitigation measure against the pandemic in most countries. Conclusions: Preventing spread is not only the first line of defense; it is the only line of defense. The lack of a global public health database support system and uniform response compounded inefficiency. A robust pandemic response management framework is developed based on practices of key performers.

A multiple case-study research is conducted comprising five cases representative of the diversity of social enterprise models. The results suggest that the operations strategy in social enterprises is influenced by their dual organizational identity and entails some operational practices and capabilities beyond those traditionally reported in manufacturing companies. They adopt a greater diversity of practices aimed at improvement and cooperation capabilities and their specificities lead to the development of the mobilization of resources capability and the openness capability. Social enterprises with a high social identity show greater evidence of the development of these operational capabilities. This study contributes to the literature on operations strategy by identifying a set of operational practices and capabilities developed by social enterprises and exploring how they are influenced by their dual organizational identity. It responds to the claims that suggest that studying social enterprises would be a fertile ground to advance theoretical and empirical research in the field of service operations. Developing knowledge on the operations management of social enterprises provides valuable insights into improving the performance of such organizations.,"Ávila, Liliana; Ferreira, Luís Miguel D.

67162,Career advancement in health-system pharmacy: Clinical pharmacists as future leaders.,2021-03-27,"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widespread tool used to guide decision-makers towards optimal strategic choices for sustainable growth. A key aspect of LCA studies of waste management systems where recycling activities are present is to account for resource recovery and the related substitution effects. Although multiple scientific papers assume a 1:1 substitution ratio between similar materials/products, this is often incorrect as the actual ratio is likely to vary. The focus of this paper is on the calculation of the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics. A state of the art literature review showed that many different calculation procedures were applied, which led to a wide variety of substitutability coefficients (sometimes provided under different terminology). In this perspective, the objective of this paper is to provide guidelines on the procedure to be followed to calculate the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials, based on technical characteristics. These guidelines are then applied to two waste management case studies, one dealing with bottom ashes from incineration and the other with plastic waste. In total, sixteen technical substitutability coefficients are given for ten secondary materials, based on state of the art and presented case studies. The paper thus represents a step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management LCA studies. The guidelines presented may allow other case studies to enrich the list of coefficients, useful for all LCA practitioners in a harmonized way allowing a more correct evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with recycling activities.","Rigamonti, L; Taelman, S E; Huysveld, S; Sfez, S; Ragaert, K; Dewulf, J",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32688065/,444

For female genital prolapse, sacrocolpopexy is the gold standard. Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy is a relatively new and promising technique correcting rectal prolapse. There is no literature combining the 2 robotically assisted techniques. OBJECTIVE This study was designed to evaluate the safety, quality of life, and functional and sexual outcomes of robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy for multicompartment prolapse of the pelvic floor. DESIGN This was a prospective, observational cohort study. SETTINGS The study was conducted in a tertiary care setting. PATIENTS All sexually active patients undergoing robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy at our institution between 2012 and 2014 were included. INTERVENTION Robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy was the study intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preoperative and postoperative (12 months) questionnaires using the Urinary Distress Inventory, Pescatori Incontinence Scale, Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire were completed. In addition Wexner and Vaizey incontinence scores and the Wexner constipation score were recorded postoperatively. RESULTS Fifty-one patients underwent robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy (median follow-up, 12.5 months). The simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification improved significantly (p < 0.0005) for all 4 of the anatomic landmarks. Both median fecal (preoperative and postoperative Pescatori 4 vs 3, p = 0.002) and urinary incontinence scores (Urinary Distress Inventory, 27.8 vs 22.2; p < 0.0005) improved significantly at 12 months. Postoperatively median Wexner (3) and Vaizey incontinence (6) and Wexner Constipation (7) scores were noted. A positive effect on sexual function (Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire score 31.8 vs 35.9; p = 0.002) and quality of life for each compartment (p < 0.0005) was observed. One patient (2%) developed mesh erosion. No multicompartment recurrences were detected. LIMITATIONS This was a observational study with a limited follow-up, no control group, and no preoperatively validated constipation score. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy is a safe and effective technique for multicompartment prolapse in terms of functional outcome, quality of life, and sexual function.","van Iersel, Jan J; de Witte, Chris J; Verheijen, Paul M; Broeders, Ivo A M J; Lenters, Egbert; Consten, Esther C J; Schraffordt Koops, Steven E",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27602928/,444

Therefore, the detection of particularly serious patients at an early stage is extremely important in terms of controlling the outbreak and improving the prognosis. We investigated the role of inflammatory markers studied in patients suspected of COVID-19 at an emergency department in predicting PCR and CT results. METHODS This retrospective study was carried out with 133 patients who were admitted between 13 March and 1st April 2020 with suspicion of COVID-19. The patients were divided into four groups according to CT and RT-PCR results and evaluated. RESULTS Considering all patients, no specific findings were found in the hematological and biochemical values of patients in the laboratory analyses. Although all of the results remained within the reference range, there was a significant difference in white blood cell, neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte values when the groups were compared [p = 0.000; p = 0.004; p = 0.022; p = 0.023]. CONCLUSION Laboratory is not specific enough in the pre-diagnosis. In addition, this result does not alter with PCR or CT positivity. However, minimal changes observed in laboratory results may be partially guiding in patients in whom both PCR and CT are positive.","Guneysu, Fatih; Yurumez, Yusuf; Guclu, Ertugrul; Koroglu, Mehmet; Karacan, Alper; Guner, Necip Gokhan; Durgun, Yesim",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.s2.58; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965358/,444
74279,Strategies for Promoting Hand Hygiene Compliance on Inpatient Psychiatric Units.,2020-10-21,"FUNDAMENTALS Many asthma exacerbations are caused by respiratory viral infections that induce the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses. However, the time trends for Th1 and Th2 immune responses during these phenomena have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE To identify possible mechanisms underlying the link between respiratory viral infections and asthma exacerbations. PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited 40 adults aged 21-58 years for 4 groups. A. Healthy, B. Healthy with viral infection, C. Mild to moderate asthma and D. Same as C, but with viral infection. Th1 and Th2 cytokines in induced sputum samples during the course of acute upper respiratory viral infections in otherwise healthy and asthmatic subjects were monitored. IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma were assayed by ELISA. Viral infection symptoms and asthma severity scores were monitored. Time trends were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS IL-4 and IL-5 levels in groups C and D were higher than in groups A and B. IFN-gamma levels and viral infection symptoms scores in group B spiked by day 2 and rapidly declined by day 7, while in group D, IFN-gamma and symptoms scores for viral infection and asthma peaked much later (days 3-5) and slowly declined. The ratios of IL-4 and IL-5 to IFN-gamma in group D were significantly higher than in group C. CONCLUSIONS Infection-induced asthma exacerbations may be due to impaired anti-viral Th1-immune responses. There appears to be a critical window of 3-5 days for therapeutic intervention.","Zhang, Ding; Xia, Jingwen; Chen, Xiaodong",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2010.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573437/,444

Generally, CO2 methanation needs abundant of energy input to overcome the eight-electron-transfer barrier. Abiotic-biotic hybrid system represents one of the cutting-edge technologies that use renewable electric/solar energy to realize eight-electron-transfer CO2 biomethanation. However, the incompatible abiotic-biotic hybrid can result in low efficiency of electron transfer and CO2 biomethanation.

We primarily introduce the CO2 biomethanation mechanism, and further summarize state-of-the-art electrochemical and photochemical CO2 biomethanation in hybrid systems. We also propose excellent synthetic biology strategies, which are useful to design tunable methanogenic microorganisms or enzymes when cooperating with electrode/semiconductor in hybrid systems. This review provides theoretical guidance of abiotic-biotic hybrid and also shows the bright future of sustainable fuel production in the form of CO2 biomethanation.","Fang, Zhen; Zhou, Jun; Zhou, Xiangtong; Koffas, Mattheos A G",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118677/,444
75990,"The SARS outbreak in a general hospital in Tianjin, China: clinical aspects and risk factors for disease outcome.",2009,"BACKGROUND MR-generated acoustic noise can contribute to patient discomfort and potentially be harmful. One way to reduce this noise is by altering the gradient output and/or waveform using software optimization. Such modifications might influence image quality and switched gradient field exposure, and different techniques appear to affect sound pressure levels (SPLs) to various degrees. PURPOSE To evaluate SPLs, image quality, switched gradient field exposure, and participants' perceived noise levels during two different acoustic noise reduction (ANR) techniques, Quiet Suite (QS) and Whisper Mode (WM), and to compare them with conventional T2-weighted turbo spin echo (T2W TSE) of the lumbar spine. DESIGN Prospective. SUBJECTS Forty adults referred for lumbar MRI. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE Conventional T2W TSE, T2W TSE with QS, and T2W TSE with WM were acquired at 1.5 T. ASSESSMENT Peak SPL (A-weighted decibels, dBA), perceived noise levels (Borg CR10®-scale), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), three radiologists' qualitative assessments in image quality on an ordinal scale 1-4, switched gradient field exposure (% general public), and gradient currents were measured. Interobserver reliability was reported as percentage agreement. STATISTICAL TESTS Repeated measures ANOVA, Friedman's ANOVA, and Wilcoxon's Signed-Rank Test for acoustic noise measurements and image quality assessments. RESULTS Mean peak SPLs were 89.9 dBA, 74.3 dBA, and 78.8 dBA for conventional, QS, and WM, respectively (P < 0.05). Participants perceived QS as the quietest and conventional as the loudest sequence (P < 0.05). No qualitative differences in image quality were seen (P > 0.05), although QS showed significantly improved SNR and CNR (P < 0.05). Switched gradient field exposure was reduced by 66% and 48% for QS and WM, respectively. DATA CONCLUSION Without degrading image quality, both QS and WM are viable ANR techniques in lumbar T2W TSE. QS provided the lowest SPL, the lowest gradient field exposure and was perceived as the most silent among the three sequences.

76308,"Locations of Physical Activity: Where Are Children, Adolescents, and Adults Physically Active? A Systematic Review.",2021-01-30,"BACKGROUND Heterologous production of natural products in Escherichia coli has emerged as an attractive strategy to obtain molecules of interest. Although technically feasible most of them are still constrained to laboratory scale production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop reasonable scale-up strategies for bioprocesses aiming at the overproduction of targeted natural products under industrial scale conditions. To this end, we used the production of the antibiotic valinomycin in E. coli as a model system for scalable bioprocess development based on consistent fed-batch cultivations. RESULTS In this work, the glucose limited fed-batch strategy based on pure mineral salt medium was used throughout all scales for valinomycin production. The optimal glucose feed rate was initially detected by the use of a biocatalytically controlled glucose release (EnBase® technology) in parallel cultivations in 24-well plates with continuous monitoring of pH and dissolved oxygen. These results were confirmed in shake flasks, where the accumulation of valinomycin was highest when the specific growth rate decreased below 0.1 h(-1). This correlation was also observed for high cell density fed-batch cultivations in a lab-scale bioreactor. The bioreactor fermentation produced valinomycin with titers of more than 2 mg L(-1) based on the feeding of a concentrated glucose solution. Valinomycin production was not affected by oscillating conditions (i.e. glucose and oxygen) in a scale-down two-compartment reactor, which could mimic similar situations in industrial bioreactors, suggesting that the process is very robust and a scaling of the process to a larger industrial scale appears a realistic scenario. CONCLUSIONS Valinomycin production was scaled up from mL volumes to 10 L with consistent use of the fed-batch technology. This work presents a robust and reliable approach for scalable bioprocess development and represents an example for the consistent development of a process for a heterologously expressed natural product towards the industrial scale.","Li, Jian; Jaitzig, Jennifer; Lu, Ping; Süssmuth, Roderich D; Neubauer, Peter",Microbial cell factories,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-015-0272-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063334/,444

Though emerging approaches such as immunotherapy is promising, it is still faced with immune tolerance, an obstacle that may be overcome by targeting autophagy-related (ATG) genes. After identifying three differentially expressed ATG genes (RIPK2, MUL1 and CXCR4), we constructed an ATG gene risk signature by Kaplan-Meier, univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate Cox regression, followed by internal and external validation using K-M and ROC analysis. Since gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that the signature was strongly associated with immune cell functions, CIBERSORT, LM22 matrix and Pearson correlation were further performed, showing that the risk signature was significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes. In conclusion, we identified and independently validated an ATG gene risk signature for LGG patients, as well as discovering its significant association with LGG immune microenvironment.","Lin, Jia-Zhe; Lin, Nuan",Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.10.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069830/,444
77549,How Our Technology Use Changed in 2020: Perspectives From Three Youths.,2021-09-15,"OBJECTIVE The need for esophageal lengthening (EL) as part of hiatal hernia (HH) repair is perceived to elevate perioperative risk and provide functionally inferior outcomes. Our objectives were to determine the risk factors of undergoing EL and to compare outcomes between operations with and without EL. We hypothesized that operative and functional outcomes for HH repair were similar in patients whether they required EL or not. METHODS We reviewed institutional experience with EL as part of HH repair. The patients underwent symptom evaluation before and after surgery using a validated tool. RESULTS Between 1999 and 2009, a total of 375 patients underwent HH repair. The operative approach was thoracotomy, 153 (41%); laparotomy, 18 (5%); laparoscopy, 167 (44%); or combined, 37 (10%). Of these, 168 (45%) required EL. There was a higher need for thoracotomy in the patients undergoing EL (79/168 vs 74/207, χ = 4.88, P = 0.034). The incidence of perioperative complications (leak, pneumonia, ileus, respiratory failure, and bleeding) was similar between the groups. Sixty-five selected patients undergoing EL were compared with 63 patients with comparable demographics not requiring EL. In a well-validated questionnaire that assessed symptoms before and after surgery, the patients undergoing EL showed significant improvement in their heartburn (76.8%), dysphagia (67.6%), regurgitation (71.7%), chest pain (91.9%), and nausea (86.5%) (P < 0.05). The patients not undergoing EL also showed significant improvement in their heartburn (81.1%), dysphagia (71.1%), regurgitation (64.4%), chest pain (64.1%), and nausea (61.0%) (P < 0.05). Improvement in symptoms, the continued use of antacid medications, and overall surgery satisfaction score were statistically similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Operative and functional outcomes for HH repair with or without EL are acceptable and comparable. Thoracic surgeons should use EL without reservations for appropriate indications.","Puri, Varun; Jacobsen, Kyle; Bell, Jennifer M; Crabtree, Traves D; Kreisel, Daniel; Krupnick, Alexander S; Patterson, G Alexander; Meyers, Bryan F",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24346582/,444

This study investigated the emergence of new psychiatric symptoms and the worsening of pre-existing mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, identified factors associated with psychological worsening, and assessed changes in mental health service use. METHODS An online survey was circulated between April 3 and June 23, 2020. Respondents were asked to complete mental health questionnaires based on 2 time referents: currently (i.e., during the outbreak) and in the month preceding the outbreak. A total of 4,294 Canadians between 16 and 99 years of age were subdivided based on the presence of self-reported psychiatric diagnoses. RESULTS The proportion of respondents without prior psychiatric history who screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder and depression increased by 12% and 29%, respectively, during the outbreak. Occurrences of clinically important worsening in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation symptoms relative to pre-outbreak estimates were significantly higher in those with psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, 15% to 19% of respondents reported increased alcohol or cannabis use. Worse psychological changes relative to pre-outbreak estimate were associated with female sex, younger age, lower income, poorer coping skills, multiple psychiatric comorbidities, previous trauma exposure, deteriorating physical health, poorer family relationships, and lower exercising. Reductions in mental health care were associated with increased suicidal ideation.

79775,The Mental Health Impact of the COVID19 Crisis: The Battle Ahead for Inpatient Survivors.,2020-04-08,"Background and objectives: The active and passive structures of the foot act in unison to not only be compliant enough to assist in ground reaction force attenuation but also resist deformation to provide a stable base of support. A foot that is unable to adjust to the imposed demands during high-intensity sporting activities may alter the moments and forces acting on the joints, increasing the risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament ruptures (ACLR) and lateral ankle sprains (LAS). Prophylactic strengthening programs are often used to reduce the risk of these injuries, but at present, very few prophylactic programs include foot-specific strengthening strategies. The aim of this theoretical review is to ascertain the prophylactic role strengthening muscles acting on the foot may have on ACLR and LAS injury risk. Methods: Literature relating to risk factors associated with ACLR and LAS injury and the anatomy and biomechanics of normal foot function was searched. In addition, ACLR and LAS injury prevention programs were also sought. A theoretical, narrative approach was followed to synthesize the information gathered from the articles. Results: The foot segments are governed by the congruity of the articulations and the activity of the foot muscles. As such, there is a coupling effect between shank, calcaneus, midfoot, and hallux movement which play a role in both ACLR and LAS injury risk. Conclusions: Strengthening the muscles acting on the foot may have a significant impact on ACLR and LAS injury risk.","van der Merwe, Carla; Shultz, Sarah P; Colborne, G Robert; Fink, Philip W",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2020.1739605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633706/,444

METHODS Data were gathered on the number of dependent older patients treated, emergency treatment provided and the revenues generated by a specialised clinic for geriatric dentistry during the current pandemic period and compared with the recorded clinical activity from the preceding year. Hypothetical projections were generated for the remainder of the current year based on the assumption that restrictions due to COVID-19 would remain. RESULTS A significant decrease in the total number of dependent older patients treated was recorded during the periods of January-March 2020 (P = .026) and April-May 2020 (P = .001) when compared to 2019. According to projections, by December 2020 the clinic will be providing 81.14% less clinical activity compared to 2019 (P < .0001), including a complete cessation of domiciliary services. Despite decreases in expenditure, revenues generated by the clinic have decreased significantly due to reduced clinical activity during January-March 2020 (P = .268) and April-May 2020 (P = .010) compared to 2019, and would decline further by 899.61% by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS The restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a significant reduction in oral healthcare provision for dependent older adults. Within this clinic, dedicated to dependent older adults, clinical activity is projected to reduce by 81% by the end of 2020 with associated reductions in revenue generation. Given the importance of oral healthcare delivery for this patient group, this may have significant and lasting impacts.","Lundberg, Andrea; Hillebrecht, Anna-Lena; McKenna, Gerald; Srinivasan, Murali",Gerodontology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ger.12509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169864/,444

83993,"Optimism, mindfulness, and resilience as potential protective factors for the mental health consequences of fear of the coronavirus.",2021-04-06,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Postoperative ileus is characterized by delayed gastrointestinal (GI) transit and is a major determinant of recovery after colorectal surgery. Both laparoscopic surgery and fast-track multimodal perioperative care have been reported to improve clinical recovery. However, objective measures supporting faster GI recovery are lacking. Therefore, GI transit was measured following open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery with or without fast-track care. METHODS Patients (n = 93) requiring elective colonic surgery were randomized to laparoscopic or conventional surgery with fast-track multimodal management or standard care, resulting in 4 treatment arms. Gastric emptying and colonic transit were scintigraphically assessed from days 1 to 3 in 78 patients and compared with clinical parameters such as time to tolerance of solid food and/or bowel movement and time until (ready for) discharge. RESULTS A total of 71 patients without mechanical bowel obstructions or surgical complications requiring intervention were available for analysis. No differences in gastric emptying 24 hours after surgery between the different groups were observed (P = .61). However, the median colonic transit of patients undergoing laparoscopic/fast-track care was significantly faster compared with the laparoscopic/standard, open/fast-track, and open/standard care groups. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both laparoscopic surgery and fast-track care were significant independent predictive factors of improved colonic transit. Both were associated with significantly faster clinical recovery and shorter time until tolerance of solid food and first bowel movement. CONCLUSIONS Colonic transit recovers significantly faster after laparoscopic surgery and the fast-track program; laparoscopy and fast-track care lead to faster recovery of GI motility and improve clinical recovery.","van Bree, Sjoerd H W; Vlug, Malaika S; Bemelman, Willem A; Hollmann, Markus W; Ubbink, Dirk T; Zwinderman, Aeilko H; de Jonge, Wouter J; Snoek, Susanne A; Bolhuis, Karen; van der Zanden, Esmerij P M; The, Frans O; Bennink, Roel J; Boeckxstaens, Guy E E",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2011.05.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699777/,444

84960,Are Tertiary Care Paediatricians Prepared for Disaster Situations?,2016,"PURPOSE The safety of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has been proven in well-selected patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether SILC can be offered to all patients with any indication for cholecystectomy. METHODS A total of 173 consecutive SILCs were performed between January 2010 and November 2012 with no exclusion criteria. Demographic data, operative, and postoperative outcomes were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Patients with acute cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis had longer operative times and a higher conversion to 4-port cholecystectomy than patients with biliary colic. Similar relationships were seen when comparing patients with obesity to nonobese patients. There were no differences in complication rates between the groups. CONCLUSIONS SILC can be safely offered to patients with a wide spectrum of biliary disease with the understanding that this may result in increased operative times and a higher likelihood of conversion to multiport laparoscopy.","Beninato, Toni; Kleiman, David A; Soni, Ashwin; Nissan, David A; Filicori, Filippo; Servais, Elliot L; Fahey, Thomas J; Zarnegar, Rasa","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25187074/,444
85033,Integrating Behavioral Health into Primary Care: The Role of Psychiatric Nursing in the Development of the Interprofessional Team.,2021-02-04,"UNLABELLED Prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to combat infections caused by the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we have developed a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), designated Mersmab1, which potently blocks MERS-CoV entry into human cells. Biochemical assays reveal that Mersmab1 specifically binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and thereby competitively blocks the binding of the RBD to its cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Furthermore, alanine scanning of the RBD has identified several residues at the DPP4-binding surface that serve as neutralizing epitopes for Mersmab1. These results suggest that if humanized, Mersmab1 could potentially function as a therapeutic antibody for treating and preventing MERS-CoV infections. Additionally, Mersmab1 may facilitate studies of the conformation and antigenicity of MERS-CoV RBD and thus will guide rational design of MERS-CoV subunit vaccines. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV is spreading in the human population and causing severe respiratory diseases with over 40% fatality. No vaccine is currently available to prevent MERS-CoV infections. Here, we have produced a neutralizing monoclonal antibody with the capacity to effectively block MERS-CoV entry into permissive human cells. If humanized, this antibody may be used as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against MERS-CoV infections. Specifically, when given to a person (e.g., a patient's family member or a health care worker) either before or after exposure to MERS-CoV, the humanized antibody may prevent or inhibit MERS-CoV infection, thereby stopping the spread of MERS-CoV in humans. This antibody can also serve as a useful tool to guide the design of effective MERS-CoV vaccines.","Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Yang, Yang; Qiu, Hongjie; Wang, Lili; Kou, Zhihua; Tao, Xinrong; Yu, Hong; Sun, Shihui; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Fang; Zhou, Yusen",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00433-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719424/,444

METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent single-incision VATS major pulmonary resection from March 2012 to May 2013 were included. The fifth intercostal space was incised (3-5 cm) at the anterior or posterior axillary line according to the tumour location. RESULTS In total, 60 patients (39 men, 21 women; median age, 61 years; interquartile range, 53-69 years) were included in this study. Malignant lung disease was diagnosed preoperatively in 56 patients (93%) and benign disease in 4 (7%) patients. Lobectomy was performed in the majority of patients (n = 55), bilobectomy in 1, sleeve lobectomy in 1 and segmentectomy in 3. Four patients (7%) required a second incision, and conversion to thoracotomy was required in 2 (3%). In 50 lung cancer cases completed using a single-incision technique, the median surgical duration was 145 min (interquartile range, 90-182 min), and the total number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was 22 (interquartile range, 10-28 min). The chest tube was removed 5 days (interquartile range, 3-6 days) postoperatively, and there were no cases involving major perioperative morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision VATS major pulmonary resection is feasible, and following a two-incision technique learning period, may yield results similar to those obtained with conventional VATS lobectomy.","Kim, Hyun Koo; Choi, Young Ho",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivu405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25476456/,444
86581,"Editorial: Evidence, policy and practice - gold standard, good enough or doing it differently?",2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate whether baseline lesion complexity affects drug-eluting stent (DES) outcomes according to diabetic status. BACKGROUND Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding DES safety and efficacy in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS Patient-level data from 18 prospective randomized trials were pooled. DES treatment outcomes in patients with versus without DM were analyzed in 2 propensity score-matched groups further stratified according to lesion complexity (American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association class A/B1 vs. B2/C). Remaining baseline differences were adjusted for by multivariate analysis. RESULTS DM was present in 3,467 of 18,441 patients (18.8%). DM was a predictor of 1-year repeat revascularization (target lesion revascularization: hazard ratio: 1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.70; target vessel revascularization: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.72) and cardiac death or myocardial infarction (hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.81). Rates of target lesion and target vessel revascularization were significantly higher in patients with versus those without DM with type B2/C lesions (8.0% vs. 4.5% and 10.6% vs. 5.9%, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both), but not in patients with only type A/B1 lesions (4.6% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.87, and 7.4% vs. 6.8%, p = 0.47, respectively), with a significant interaction between DM and lesion type observed for both endpoints (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). No interaction was observed for death or myocardial infarction (p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS In the DES era, patients with DM remain at increased risk for cardiac death or myocardial infarction. However, DM is a risk factor for repeat revascularization only in those patients with complex lesions; patients with DM and noncomplex lesions have similar rates of 1-year freedom from repeat revascularization as do patients without DM.","Kedhi, Elvin; Généreux, Philippe; Palmerini, Tullio; McAndrew, Thomas C; Parise, Helen; Mehran, Roxana; Dangas, George D; Stone, Gregg W",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632279/,444

Methods We searched Embase, Medline, and Cochrane in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA), in December 2019. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that reported outcomes following treatment of BPH for prostate less than 80g with Aquablation, Rezum, or UroLift, were included in the analysis. Results A total of 4 RCTs reporting the outcomes after treatment with newer MIST for BPH were identified. Patients undergoing the resective procedures i.e. TURP and Aquablation, had greater improvement in urinary domain outcomes: International Prostate Symptom Score, Quality of Life, peak flow rate and Post Voiding Residual compared to patients undergoing non-resective procedures: UroLift and Rezum. Patients in UroLift group maintained a higher sexual function domain score compared to TURP but not Aquablation. Our multiple comparison analysis did not reveal a significant difference in urinary and sexual domain scores between patients undergoing UroLift and Rezum at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusions Aquablation and TURP necessitate general or regional anesthesia, both produced significantly better urinary domain scores compared to Rezum and UroLift. On the other hand, UroLift demonstrated better sexual function domain scores compared to TURP but not Aquablation. There was no significant difference in urinary domain scores between UroLift and Rezum at 24 months follow up.","Tanneru, Karthik; Jazayeri, Seyedbehzad; Muhammad, Alam; Kumar, Jatinder; Bazargani, Soroush; Kuntz, Gretchen; PalayapalayamGanapathi, Hariharan; Bandyk, Mark; Marino, Robert; Koochekpour, Shahriar; Gautam, Shiva; K C, Balaji; Costa, Joseph",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.0739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962442/,444
87682,A trauma informed response to COVID 19 and the deteriorating mental health refugees and asylum seekers with insecure status in Australia.,2021-09-10,"Over the past decade, in silico genome and transcriptome mining has led to the identification of many new crustacean peptide families, including the agatoxin-like peptides (ALPs), a group named for their structural similarity to agatoxin, a spider venom component. Here, analysis of publicly accessible transcriptomes was used to expand our understanding of crustacean ALPs. Specifically, transcriptome mining was used to investigate the phylogenetic/structural conservation, tissue localization, and putative functions of ALPs in decapod species. Transcripts encoding putative ALP precursors were identified from one or more members of the Penaeoidea (penaeid shrimp), Sergestoidea (sergestid shrimps), Caridea (caridean shrimp), Astacidea (clawed lobsters and freshwater crayfish), Achelata (spiny/slipper lobsters), and Brachyura (true crabs), suggesting a broad, and perhaps ubiquitous, conservation of ALPs in decapods. Comparison of the predicted mature structures of decapod ALPs revealed high levels of amino acid conservation, including eight identically conserved cysteine residues that presumably allow for the formation of four identically positioned disulfide bridges. All decapod ALPs are predicted to have amidated carboxyl-terminals. Two isoforms of ALP appear to be present in most decapod species, one 44 amino acids long and the other 42 amino acids in length, both likely generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. In carideans, a gene or terminal exon duplication appears to have occurred, with alternative splicing producing four ALPs, two 44 and two 42 amino acid isoforms. The identification of ALP precursor-encoding transcripts in nervous system-specific transcriptomes (e.g., Homarus americanus brain, eyestalk ganglia, and cardiac ganglion assemblies, finding confirmed using RT-PCR) suggests that members of this peptide family may serve as locally-released and/or hormonally-delivered neuromodulators in decapods. Their detection in testis- and hepatopancreas-specific transcriptomes suggests that members of the ALP family may also play roles in male reproduction and innate immunity/detoxification.","Christie, Andrew E; Rivera, Cindy D; Call, Catherine M; Dickinson, Patsy S; Stemmler, Elizabeth A; Joe Hull, J",General and comparative endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916171/,444

Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE via Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL. RESULTS The electronic searches identified 846 articles. Screening revealed that six articles met all eligibility inclusion criteria. Interventions showing statistically significant benefits to reduce oral mucositis associated pain compared to placebo included doxepin (p < 0.001, 95% CI -6.7 to -2.1), amitriptyline (p = 0.04), diclofenac (p < 0.01) and benzydamine (p = 0.014).

97182,The Purported Increase in Social Narcissism: Nursing Implications.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Moral injury (MI) is consistently associated with adverse mental health outcomes, including the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidality. METHODS We investigated neural activation patterns associated with MI event recall using functional magnetic resonance imaging in participants with military and public safety-related PTSD, relative to civilian MI-exposed controls. RESULTS MI recall in the PTSD as compared to control group was associated with increased neural activation among salience network nodes involved in viscerosensory processing and hyperarousal (right posterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; dACC), regions involved in defensive responding (left postcentral gyrus), and areas responsible for top-down cognitive control of emotions (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dlPFC). Within the PTSD group, measures of state and trait shame correlated negatively with activity among default mode network regions associated with self-related processing and moral cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; dmPFC) and salience network regions associated with viscerosensory processing (left posterior insula), respectively. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that MI event processing is altered in military and public safety-related PTSD, relative to MI-exposed controls. Here, it appears probable that as individuals with PTSD recall their MI event, they experience a surge of blame-related processing of bodily sensations within salience network regions, including the right posterior insula and the dACC, which in turn, prompt regulatory strategies at the level of the left dlPFC aimed at increasing cognitive control and inhibiting emotional affect. These results are consistent with previous findings showing enhanced sensory processing and altered top-down control in PTSD samples during autobiographical memory recall.","Lloyd, Chantelle S; Nicholson, Andrew A; Densmore, Maria; Théberge, Jean; Neufeld, Richard W J; Jetly, Rakesh; McKinnon, Margaret C; Lanius, Ruth A",Depression and anxiety,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369799/,444

MATERIAL AND METHODS The FD within a tumor region was determined using a box counting algorithm and compared to the lymph node involvement (NI) and metastatic involvement (MI) and overall stage as determined from PET. A Mann-Whitney U test was applied to the extracted FD features for the NI and the MI. RESULTS The two tests showed good significance with p < .05 (pNI = 0.0139, pMI = 0.0194). Also after performing fractal analysis to all cases, it was found that for those who had a CT of stage I or II had a higher likelihood of the NI and/or MI stage being upstaged by PET, Odds Ratio 5.38 (95% CI 0.99-29.3). For those who are CT stage III or IV had an increased likelihood of the NI and/or MI stage being down staged by PET, Odds Ratio: 7.33 (95% CI 0.48-111.2). CONCLUSION Initial results of this study indicate higher FD in CT images of NSCLC is associated with advanced stage and greater FDG uptake on PET.

The aim of this study was to determine risk outcomes from gastric spillage in a rat survival model by measuring local and systemic inflammatory markers, adhesive disease, and morbidity. METHODS We performed a minilaparotomy with needle aspiration of 2 ml of gastric contents mixed with 2 ml of sterile saline (study group, SG) or 4 ml of sterile saline (control group, CG) injected into the peritoneal cavity of 60 male rats. Inflammatory markers (TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-10) were analyzed at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h postoperatively by obtaining plasma levels and peritoneal washings. At necropsy, the peritoneal cavity was examined grossly for adhesions. RESULTS Adhesions were seen more frequently in the SG versus the CG (100% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.014). There was a significant difference in the peritoneal TNFalpha levels in the SG compared with the CG, which peaked 1 h after surgery (p < 0.02). Both peritoneal IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in the SG versus the CG, which peaked 3 h after surgery (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). All peritoneal inflammatory markers returned to undetectable levels at 24 h for both groups. Plasma cytokines were undetectable at all time intervals. CONCLUSION The inflammatory response was found to be a localized and not systemic event, with plasma cytokine levels remaining normal while peritoneal washings revealed a brisk, short-lived localized inflammatory response. There was a significantly higher rate of adhesive disease in the SG compared with the CG; this, however did not translate into a difference in apparent clinical outcome. We conclude that gastric leakage in this NOTES rodent model induces a localized inflammatory response, followed by mild to moderate adhesive disease. This may be important in human NOTES.","Ramamoorthy, Sonia L; Lee, Jeffrey K; Luo, Linda; Mintz, Yoav; Cullen, John; Easter, David W; Savu, Michelle K; Chock, Alana; Carethers, John; Horgan, Santiago; Talamini, Mark A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0636-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19688397/,444

108077,'The problem is greater than it's ever been': US universities urged to invest in mental-health resources.,2021-01-25,"Tuberculosis is a serious public health problem aggravated by the slow progress in the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The hyper-reactive TB patients have suffered from chronic inflammation which could cause deleterious effects on their bodies. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an adjunctive therapy based on inflammatory modulation during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. The present study aims to investigate the immune regulatory effects of Andrographolide (Andro) on Mtb-infected macrophages and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that Andro inhibits the production of IL-1β and other inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. The down-regulation of IL-1β expression causes the declining expression of IL-8 and MCP-1 in lung epithelial cells which were co-cultured with Mtb-infected macrophages. The inhibition of the activation of NF-κB pathway, but not the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway, accounts for the anti-inflammatory role of Andro. Further studies elucidated that Andro could evoke the activation of autophagy to degrade NLRP3, which ultimately inhibited inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β production. Finally, the relevant results demonstrated that Andro inhibited the Notch1 pathway to down-regulate the phosphorylation of Akt/mTOR and NF-κB p65 subunit. Taken together, Andro has been found to suppress the Notch1/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. Both Akt inhibition-induced autophagy and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway contributed to restraining the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β production. Then, the decreased production of IL-1β influenced chemokine expression in lung epithelial cells. Based on these results, anti-inflammatory effect of Andro in TB infection is merit further investigation.","He, Weigang; Sun, Jinxia; Zhang, Qingwen; Li, Yinhong; Fu, Yan; Zheng, Yuejuan; Jiang, Xin",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.3ma1119-584rrr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991757/,444

Previous studies suggested that GPR109A mediates effects of diet-derived phenolic acids such as hippuric acid (HA) and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (3-3-PPA) on promoting bone formation. However, the role of GPR109A in metabolic bone homeostasis and osteoclast differentiation has not been investigated. Using densitometric, bone histologic and molecular signaling analytic methods, we uncovered that bone mass and strength were significantly higher in tibia and spine of standard rodent diet weaned 4-week-old and 6-month-old GPR109A gene deletion (GPR109A-/-) mice, compared to their wild type controls. Osteoclast numbers in bone and in ex vivo bone marrow cell cultures were significantly decreased in GPR109A-/- mice compared to wild type controls. In accordance with these data, CTX-1 in bone marrow plasma and gene expression of bone resorption markers (TNFα, TRAP, Cathepsin K) were significantly decreased in GPR109A-/- mice, while on the other hand, P1NP was increased in serum from both male and female GPR109A-/- mice compared to their respective controls. GPR109A deletion led to suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoclast precursors to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and activity. Indeed, HA and 3-3-PPA substantially inhibited RANKL-induced GPR109A expression and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteoclast precursors and osteoclast differentiation. Resultantly, HA significantly inhibited bone resorption and increased bone mass in wild type mice, but had no additional effects on bone in GPR109A-/- mice compared with their respective untreated control mice.

113073,"Half-a-Century of Terrorist Attacks: Weapons Selection, Casualty Outcomes, and Implications for Counter-Terrorism Medicine.",2021-08-16,"INTRODUCTION The first laparoscopic case of ileal interposition was reported in 2000, proving the feasibility of the procedure in a minimally invasive fashion by duplicating the principles of open surgery. Robotic applications in urology are expanding worldwide, given the unique features of the robotic platform, which facilitates more advanced laparoscopic procedures. In this study, we report a case of completely intracorporeal robotic ileal ureter and thoroughly describe our technique for this complex minimally invasive procedure. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS A 50-year-old gentleman with a history of right renal stones underwent multiple right ureteroscopies and thereafter developed 2 proximal ureteral strictures of 5 mm. Preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate was 71 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Renal scan showed preserved function. The treatment options were discussed, and the patient elected to undergo a robotic ileal ureter interposition. Total operative time was 7 hours, the estimated blood loss was approximately 50 mL, and the patient progressed to regular diet on postoperative day 4 without any problem, being discharged without complications. On the postoperative day 12, a cystogram demonstrated no extravasation, and the Foley catheter was removed. After 1 month, renal scan showed the left kidney with 60.1% and the right kidney with 39.9% of total renal function. At 2 years follow-up, his serum creatinine was 1.14 and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 70 mL/min/1.73 m(2). CONCLUSION Robot-assisted laparaoscopic ileal ureter with a completely intracorporeal technique is feasible and appears to be safe. A larger number of procedures using this technique and longer follow-up are needed to further define its role in the treatment of ureteral strictures.","Brandao, Luis Felipe; Autorino, Riccardo; Zargar, Homayoun; Laydner, Humberto; Krishnan, Jayram; Samarasekera, Dinesh; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Kaouk, Jihad H; Chalikonda, Sricharan; Stein, Robert J",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2013.11.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518286/,444

However, until now, the flaws caused by indoor multipath propagation formed a fundamental hurdle for the adoption of such technology in practical healthcare applications where reliability and robustness are crucial. Multipath reflections, originated from one person, combine with the direct signals and multipaths of other people and stationary objects, thus jeopardizing individual vital signs extraction and localization. This work focuses on tackling indoor multipath propagation. METHODS We describe a methodology, based on accurate models of the indoor multipaths and of the radar signals, that enables separating the undesired multipaths from desired signals of multiple individuals, removing a key obstacle to real-world contactless vital signs monitoring and localization. RESULTS We also demonstrated it by accurately measure individual heart rates, respiration rates, and absolute distances (range information) of paired volunteers in a challenging real-world office setting. CONCLUSION The approach, validated using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, was shown to function in an indoor environment where radar signals are severely affected by multipath reflections. SIGNIFICANCE Practical applications arise for health care, assisted living, geriatric and quarantine medicine, rescue and security purposes.","Mercuri, Marco; Lu, Yiting; Polito, Salvatore; Wieringa, Fokko; Liu, Yao-Hong; Van der Veen, Alle-Jan; Van Hoof, Chris; Torfs, Tom",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2021.3066876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729919/,444

118616,Pandemic Anxiety: How Can I Help?,2020-07-01,"Objectives Cancer care is excessively influenced by the COVID-19 outbreak for various reasons. One of the major concerns is the tendency for delayed surgical treatment of breast cancer patients. The outbreak has urged clinicians to find alternative treatments until surgery is deemed to be feasible and safe. Here in this paper, we report the results of a consensus procedure which aimed to provide an expert opinion-led guideline for breast cancer management during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. Material and Methods We used the Delphi method with a 9-scale Likert scale on two rounds of voting from 51 experienced surgeons and medical oncologists who had the necessary skills and experience in breast cancer management. Voting was done electronically in which a questionnaire-formatted form was used. Results Overall, 46 statements on 28 different case scenarios were voted. In the first round, 37 statements reached a consensus as either endorsement or rejection, nine were put into voting in the second round since they did not reach the necessary decision threshold. At the end of two rounds, for 14 cases scenarios, a statement was endorsed as a recommendation for each. Thirty-two statements for the remaining 14 were rejected. Conclusion There was a general consensus for administering neoadjuvant systemic therapy in patients with node-negative, small-size triple negative, HER2-positive and luminal A-like tumors until conditions are improved for due surgical treatment. Panelists also reached a consensus to extend the systemic treatment for patients with HER2-positive and luminal B-like tumors who had clinical complete response after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.","Sezer, Atakan; Cicin, İrfan; Karadeniz Çakmak, Güldeniz; Özkan Gürdal, Sibel; Başaran, Gül; Oyan, Başak; Eralp, Yeşim; Güllüoğlu, Bahadır M",Turkish journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.5578/turkjsurg.4815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015560/,444
119187,"Debate: COVID crisis, natural capital and clinical care - 'building back better' for a new values-based CAMHS.",2020-07-30,"The members of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokine family and their receptors were identified decades ago. Unlike IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), which heterodimerizes with IL-17RB, IL-17RC, and IL-17RD and mediates proinflammatory gene expression, IL-17RB plays a distinct role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis upon stimulation with IL-17B. However, the molecular basis by which IL-17RB promotes oncogenesis is unknown. Here, we report that IL-17RB forms a homodimer and recruits mixed-lineage kinase 4 (MLK4), a dual kinase, to phosphorylate it at tyrosine-447 upon treatment with IL-17B in vitro. Higher amounts of phosphorylated IL-17RB in tumor specimens obtained from patients with pancreatic cancer correlated with worse prognosis. Phosphorylated IL-17RB recruits the ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing 56 to add lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains to lysine-470 of IL-17RB, which further assembles NF-κB activator 1 (ACT1) and other factors to propagate downstream oncogenic signaling. Consequentially, IL-17RB mutants with substitution at either tyrosine-447 or lysine-470 lose their oncogenic activity. Treatment with a peptide consisting of amino acids 403 to 416 of IL-17RB blocks MLK4 binding, tyrosine-477 phosphorylation, and lysine-470 ubiquitination in vivo, thereby inhibiting tumorigenesis and metastasis and prolonging the life span of mice bearing pancreatic tumors. These results establish a clear pathway of how proximal signaling of IL-17RB occurs and provides insight into how this pathway provides a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.","Wu, Heng-Hsiung; Tsai, Lung-Hung; Huang, Chun-Kai; Hsu, Pang-Hung; Chen, Mei-Yu; Chen, Yi-Ing; Hu, Chun-Mei; Shen, Chia-Ning; Lee, Chen-Chen; Chang, Ming-Chu; Chang, Yu-Ting; Tien, Yu-Wen; Jeng, Yung-Ming; Lee, Eva Y-H P; Lee, Wen-Hwa",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abc2823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658352/,444
123569,Pharmacogenetics: Knowledge assessment amongst Syrian pharmacists and physicians.,2021-10-01,"CXCL1, a functional murine orthologue of the human chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8), and its CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors were investigated in a murine model of acquired epilepsy developing following status epilepticus (SE) induced by intra-amygdala kainate. CXCL8 and its receptors were also studied in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The functional involvement of the chemokine in seizure generation and neuronal cell loss was assessed in mice using reparixin (formerly referred to as repertaxin), a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of CXCR1/2 receptors. We found a significant increase in hippocampal CXCL1 level within 24 h of SE onset that lasted for at least 1 week. No changes were measured in blood. In analogy with human TLE, immunohistochemistry in epileptic mice showed that CXCL1 and its two receptors were increased in hippocampal neuronal cells. Additional expression of these molecules was found in glia in human TLE. Mice were treated with reparixin or vehicle during SE and for additional 6 days thereafter, using subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. Drug-treated mice showed a faster SE decay, a reduced incidence of acute symptomatic seizures during 48 h post-SE, and a delayed time to spontaneous seizures onset compared to vehicle controls. Upon reparixin discontinuation, mice developed spontaneous seizures similar to vehicle mice, as shown by EEG monitoring at 14 days and 2.5 months post-SE. In the same epileptic mice, reparixin reduced neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus vs vehicle-injected mice, as assessed by Nissl staining at completion of EEG monitoring. Reparixin administration for 2 weeks in mice with established chronic seizures, reduced by 2-fold on average seizure number vs pre-treatment baseline, and this effect was reversible upon drug discontinuation. No significant changes in seizure number were measured in vehicle-injected epileptic mice that were EEG monitored in parallel. Data show that CXCL1-IL-8 signaling is activated in experimental and human epilepsy and contributes to acute and chronic seizures in mice, therefore representing a potential new target to attain anti-ictogenic effects.","Di Sapia, Rossella; Zimmer, Till S; Kebede, Valentina; Balosso, Silvia; Ravizza, Teresa; Sorrentino, Diletta; Castillo, Manuel Alejandro Montano; Porcu, Luca; Cattani, Franca; Ruocco, Anna; Aronica, Eleonora; Allegretti, Marcello; Brandolini, Laura; Vezzani, Annamaria",Neurobiology of disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2021.105468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358616/,444

126022,Are Long-Distance Walks Therapeutic? A Systematic Scoping Review of the Conceptualization of Long-Distance Walking and Its Relation to Mental Health.,2021-07-21,"BACKGROUND Antibiotic resistance is a global public health threat. Antibiotics are very commonly prescribed for children presenting with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), but there is little evidence from randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of antibiotics, both overall or among key clinical subgroups. In ARTIC PC, we assessed whether amoxicillin reduces the duration of moderately bad symptoms in children presenting with uncomplicated (non-pneumonic) LRTI in primary care, overall and in key clinical subgroups. METHODS ARTIC PC was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 56 general practices in England. Eligible children were those aged 6 months to 12 years presenting in primary care with acute uncomplicated LRTI judged to be infective in origin, where pneumonia was not suspected clinically, with symptoms for less than 21 days. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive amoxicillin 50 mg/kg per day or placebo oral suspension, in three divided doses orally for 7 days. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse (measured using a validated diary) for up to 28 days or until symptoms resolved. The primary outcome and safety were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN79914298). FINDINGS Between Nov 9, 2016, and March 17, 2020, 432 children (not including six who withdrew permission for use of their data after randomisation) were randomly assigned to the antibiotics group (n=221) or the placebo group (n=211). Complete data for symptom duration were available for 317 (73%) patients; missing data were imputed for the primary analysis. Median durations of moderately bad or worse symptoms were similar between the groups (5 days [IQR 4-11] in the antibiotics group vs 6 days [4-15] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 1·13 [95% CI 0·90-1·42]). No differences were seen for the primary outcome between the treatment groups in the five prespecified clinical subgroups (patients with chest signs, fever, physician rating of unwell, sputum or chest rattle, and short of breath). Estimates from complete-case analysis and a per-protocol analysis were similar to the imputed data analysis. INTERPRETATION Amoxicillin for uncomplicated chest infections in children is unlikely to be clinically effective either overall or for key subgroups in whom antibiotics are commonly prescribed. Unless pneumonia is suspected, clinicians should provide safety-netting advice but not prescribe antibiotics for most children presenting with chest infections.

It was hypothesized that an articulating paper positioned between dental arches during MVC elicits a different muscular activity compared with the occlusion on natural dentition (without the occlusal indicator). 30 healthy adult subjects with a complete, natural dentition were recruited; SEMG activity was recorded in the following experimental conditions: MVC with cotton rolls for standardization purposes; MVC on natural dentition; MVC onto the 40μm or 200μm paper indicator positioned on right or left side of the dental arch. Percentage Overlapping Coefficient (POC; separate values obtained for TA and MS), antero-posterior coefficient (APC) and total muscle activities (IMP) were the analyzed SEMG parameters. The use of an occlusal indicator statistically changed POC_TA, POC_MS and IMP median values (p<0.05). Both 40μm and 200μm occlusal papers did not significantly affect APC values (P=0.86). A pronounced asymmetric muscular activity has been recorded with the introduction of an interocclusal media. All indices of muscular activity did not differ between sexes (Kruskal Wallis test, P>0.05). In conclusion, the examined articulating papers affected two specific SEMG parameters (POC and IMP); the recorded muscular activity with the occlusal indicator varied regardless left or right side positioning, and independently from tested paper thicknesses.","Augusti, Davide; Augusti, Gabriele; Re, Dino; Dellavia, Claudia; Giannì, Aldo Bruno",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelekin.2015.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25956545/,444

129849,"Improving mental health literacy among young people aged 11-15 years in Java, Indonesia: co-development and feasibility testing of a culturally-appropriate, user-centred resource (IMPeTUs) - a study protocol.",2019,"UNLABELLED Coronaviruses (CoVs) and low-pathogenicity influenza A viruses (LP IAVs) depend on target cell proteases to cleave their viral glycoproteins and prime them for virus-cell membrane fusion. Several proteases cluster into tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), suggesting that TEMs are preferred virus entry portals. Here we found that several CoV receptors and virus-priming proteases were indeed present in TEMs. Isolated TEMs, when mixed with CoV and LP IAV pseudoparticles, cleaved viral fusion proteins to fusion-primed fragments and potentiated viral transductions. That entering viruses utilize TEMs as a protease source was further confirmed using tetraspanin antibodies and tetraspanin short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Tetraspanin antibodies inhibited CoV and LP IAV infections, but their virus-blocking activities were overcome by expressing excess TEM-associated proteases. Similarly, cells with reduced levels of the tetraspanin CD9 resisted CoV pseudoparticle transductions but were made susceptible by overproducing TEM-associated proteases. These findings indicated that antibodies and CD9 depletions interfere with viral proteolytic priming in ways that are overcome by surplus proteases. TEMs appear to be exploited by some CoVs and LP IAVs for appropriate coengagement with cell receptors and proteases. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses use their surface glycoproteins to catalyze membrane fusion, an essential cell entry step. Host cell components prime these viral surface glycoproteins to catalyze membrane fusion at specific times and places during virus cell entry. Among these priming components are proteases, which cleave viral surface glycoproteins, unleashing them to refold in ways that catalyze virus-cell membrane fusions. For some enveloped viruses, these proteases are known to reside on target cell surfaces. This research focuses on coronavirus and influenza A virus cell entry and identifies TEMs as sites of viral proteolysis, thereby defining subcellular locations of virus priming with greater precision. Implications of these findings extend to the use of virus entry antagonists, such as protease inhibitors, which might be most effective when localized to these microdomains.","Earnest, James T; Hantak, Michael P; Park, Jung-Eun; Gallagher, Tom",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00543-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25833045/,444

The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe out-ofhospital emergency care providers' experiences of identifying elder abuse. METHODS Individual theme interviews were conducted with nine prehospital emergency care providers and three community paramedics in spring 2019. The transcribed data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS Although the short duration of care contacts made the identification of elder abuse challenging, the emergency care providers detected indicators of physical, psychological and social abuse, unethical action, material exploitation, and self-neglect/self-abuse. The professionals based their observations on patient and family interviews, on clues in the home environment, on caregiving quality combined with the patient's medical history, and on physical signs, which were the easiest to identify. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The identification of elder abuse may be improved by multiprofessional collaboration, by increased attention given to risk groups and common indicators of abuse, and by adoption or creation of screening tools to assist detection and reporting. Training on the detection of elder abuse should be included in nursing and social work curricula and in the continuing professional development of emergency care providers.","Salminen-Tuomaala, Mari; Tiainen, Juha; Mikkola, Riitta; Paavilainen, Eija",Research and theory for nursing practice,https://doi.org/10.1891/rtnp-d-20-00074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140415/,444

Recently, a few trials of anorectal transplantation in animals have been published as a potential alternative to colostomies; however, further development of this technique is required. In this study, we utilized a canine model of anorectal transplantation, evaluated the patency of our microsurgical anastomoses, and assessed the perfusion of the transplanted anus. We designed a canine anorectal transplantation model, wherein anorectal autotransplantation was performed in four healthy beagle dogs by anastomoses of the lower rectum, the bilateral pudendal arteries (PAs) and veins (PVs), and pudendal nerves (PNs). Postoperative graft perfusion was measured by indocyanine green (ICG) angiography and histological examination. The length of the anorectal graft including perianal skin, anal sphincter muscle, bilateral PAs, PVs, and PNs was 4.9 ± 0.3 cm. All diameters of the PAs, PVs, and PNs were large enough to be microscopically anastomosed. Both ICG angiography and histological examination demonstrated good graft perfusion, except for one case that lead to venous congestion. These results show that anastomosis of the bilateral PAs, PVs, and PNs is required for anorectal transplantation.

Here, we show that recombinant IFITM3 reconstituted into lipid vesicles induces negative membrane curvature and that this effect maps to its small amphipathic helix (AH). We demonstrate that AH (i) partitions into lipid-disordered domains where IAV fusion occurs, (ii) induces negative membrane curvature, and (iii) increases lipid order and membrane stiffness. These effects on membrane properties correlate with the fusion-inhibitory activity, as targeting the ectopically expressed AH peptide to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the cell plasma membrane diminishes IAV-cell surface fusion induced by exposure to acidic pH. Our results thus imply that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion by imposing an unfavorable membrane curvature and increasing the order and stiffness of the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which cells block entry of diverse enveloped viruses.","Guo, Xiangyang; Steinkühler, Jan; Marin, Mariana; Li, Xiang; Lu, Wuyuan; Dimova, Rumiana; Melikyan, Gregory B",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c10567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656312/,444

145419,New Data on Access to Mental Health and Addictions Services and Home and Community Care.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms relies on coaxial catheter support systems to provide safe and stable access. Large-bore distal intracranial catheters have become necessary for aneurysm treatment with flow diverting devices including the Pipeline embolization device (PED). These catheters must accommodate 0.027 inch microcatheters, be supple enough to track distally and be able to provide sufficient support for manipulations required for PED deployment. METHODS A single-center aneurysm database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent anterior circulation aneurysm embolization with the PED while using the Navien distal intracranial catheter. Data were collected regarding the equipment used, cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) tortuosity, intraprocedural Navien positions and periprocedural complications. RESULTS The Navien catheter (5 Fr, 0.070 inch outer diameter, 0.058 inch inner diameter, 115 cm) was used in 78 cases of anterior circulation PED. It was tracked into position over a Marksman microcatheter in 76 of the 78 cases (97%). The final catheter tip position was in the cervical ICA (1/78, 1%), petrous ICA (23/78, 30%), proximal cavernous ICA (48/78, 62%), distal cavernous/clinoidal ICA (3/78, 4%), supraclinoid ICA (2/78, 2%) and the M1 segment (1/78, 2%). In each case the catheter was tracked to its desired position (100% clinical success) despite significant proximal vessel tortuosity in 34 cases (44%). No clinically significant catheter-related complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The Navien intracranial catheter is an important component of the triaxial system for embolization of cerebral aneurysms with the PED. This catheter is highly trackable to distal positions, atraumatic and provides sufficient support for the microcatheter manipulations used during typical PED deployments.","Colby, Geoffrey P; Lin, Li-Mei; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23516269/,444

Despite advances in surgical repair of hiatus hernias, there remains a high radiological recurrence rate. We performed a novel technique incorporating bilateral oesophageal fixation and evaluated outcomes, principally symptom improvement and hernia recurrence. Methods. A retrospective study was performed on a prospective database of patients undergoing hiatus hernia repair with bilateral oesophageal fixation. Retrospective and prospective quality of life (QOL), PPI usage, and patient satisfaction data were obtained. Hernia recurrence was assessed by either barium swallow or gastroscopy. Results. 87 patients were identified in the database with a minimum of 3 months followup. There were significant improvements in QOL scores including GERD HRQL (29.13 to 4.38, P < 0.01), Visick (3 to 1), and RSI (17.45 to 5, P < 0.01). PPI usage decreased from a median of daily to none, and there was high patient satisfaction (94%). 57 patients were assessed for recurrence with either gastroscopy or barium swallow, and one patient had evidence of recurrence on barium swallow at 45 months postoperatively. There was an 8% complication rate and no mortality or oesophageal perforation. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that our technique is both safe and effective in symptom control, and our recurrence investigations demonstrate at least short term durability.","Mendis, Rajith; Cheung, Caran; Martin, David",Surgery research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/693138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26065030/,444

METHODS The medical records of patients who underwent adjustable graded augmentation of SRT with or without adjustable medial rectus recession (MRc) from February 2017 to December 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. A Mendez ring was used to monitor torsional change after transposition of the superior rectus muscle to the lateral rectus muscle and after sequential placement of 2 or 3 augmentation sutures by superior rectus-lateral rectus loop myopexy. If excessive mechanical intorsion was induced, the responsible augmentation suture was severed intraoperatively. If torsional or vertical diplopia was noted after recovery, the distal-most augmentation suture was cut. Exotropia was managed by severing the distal-most augmentation suture or by medial rectus adjustment. RESULTS A total of 8 patients who underwent adjustable graded augmentation of SRT were included (6 using the 3-suture technique): 3 for esotropic Duane syndrome, 2 for abducens nerve palsy, 1 for Moebius syndrome, and 2 for combined trochlear and abducens nerve palsies. Of the 8 patients, 4 had prior strabismus surgery, and 1 patient had previously undergone treatment with botulinum toxin. Severing one augmentation suture in 3 cases resolved vertical (n = 2) or torsional (n = 1) diplopia and consecutive exotropia (n = 1), resulting in excellent alignment and reduction of torticollis to <4° in 7 cases. The technique proved insufficient in 1 patient, who had undergone 3 prior strabismus procedures. CONCLUSIONS In this study cohort, adjustable graded augmentation of SRT effectively managed the risk of postoperative vertical or torsional diplopia.","Dagi, Linda R; Elhusseiny, Abdelrahman M",Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2020.05.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977023/,444

Here, we investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in male reproductive investment in the terrestrial-breeding frog Pseudophryne guentheri. Like most anurans, breeding activity in P. guentheri is cued by precipitation, and therefore the timing and duration of breeding seasons differ among geographically separated populations, potentially leading to differences in the level of sperm competition. We, therefore, anticipated local adaptation in sperm traits that reflect these phenological differences among populations. Our analysis of six natural populations across a rainfall gradient revealed significant divergence in testes and ejaculate traits that correspond with annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality; males from the northern and drier edge of the species range had significantly smaller testes containing fewer, smaller and less motile sperm compared with those from mesic central populations. These findings may reflect spatial variation in the strength of postcopulatory sexual selection, likely driven by local patterns of precipitation.","Rudin-Bitterli, Tabitha S; Mitchell, Nicola J; Evans, Jonathan P",Biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991823/,444
154208,Debate: Child and adolescent mental health services in Pakistan; Do we need in-patient mental health facilities for children and young people?,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest white matter structure in the brain and has a significant role in central nervous system diseases. Its volume correlates with the severity and/or extent of neurodegenerative disease. Even though the CC's role has been extensively studied over the last decades, and different algorithms and methods have been published regarding CC segmentation and parcellation, no reviews or surveys covering such developments have been reported so far. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review of computational methods focusing on CC segmentation and parcellation acquired on magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS IEEExplore, PubMed, EBSCO Host, and Scopus database were searched with the following search terms: ((Segmentation OR Parcellation) AND (Corpus Callosum) AND (DTI OR MRI OR Diffusion Tensor Imag* OR Diffusion Tractography OR Magnetic Resonance Imag*)), resulting in 802 publications. Two reviewers independently evaluated all articles and 36 studies were selected through the systematic literature review process. RESULTS This work reviewed four main segmentation methods groups: model-based, region-based, thresholding, and machine learning; 32 different validity metrics were reported. Even though model-based techniques are the most recurrently used for the segmentation task (13 articles), machine learning approaches achieved better outcomes of 95% when analyzing mean values for segmentation and classification metrics results. Moreover, CC segmentation is better established in T1-weighted images, having more methods implemented and also being tested in larger datasets, compared with diffusion tensor images. CONCLUSIONS The analyzed computational methods used to perform CC segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging have not yet overcome all presented challenges owing to metrics variability and lack of traceable materials.","Cover, G S; Herrera, W G; Bento, M P; Appenzeller, S; Rittner, L",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29249344/,444

The authors report the off-label use of intraarterial eptifibatide during endovascular ischemic stroke revascularization procedures for reocclusion after documented recanalization or formed fresh thrombi in distal vessels that were inaccessible to endovascular devices. METHODS Patients who received intraarterial eptifibatide were identified from a prospectively collected database of patients in whom endovascular revascularization for acute ischemic stroke was attempted between 2005 and 2008. Data were analyzed retrospectively. The intraarterial eptifibatide dose was a single-bolus dose of 180 μg/kg body weight. Primary outcome measures were angiographic recanalization (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Grade 2 or 3), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate, overall mortality rate, and favorable 3-month modified Rankin Scale score (≤ 2). RESULTS The study included 35 patients (mean age 62 years, range 18-85 years). The median presenting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 13. Two patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator before endovascular therapy. The median time from symptom onset to therapy initiation was 230 minutes (range 90-1370 minutes). Twelve patients (34%) received intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator without mechanical measures. Mechanical revascularization measures used were Merci retriever in 19 (54%), Penumbra device in 1 (3%), balloon angioplasty in 15 (43%), and stent placement in 22 (63%) patients. The mean dose of intraarterial eptifibatide was 11.6 mg (range 5-16.6 mg). Partial-to-complete recanalization (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Grade 2 or 3) was achieved in 27 patients (77%). Postprocedure intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 13 patients (37%), causing symptoms in 5 (14%). In the 5 symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage cases, all patients but one presented more than 8 hours after symptom onset and all received intraarterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. The median discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 7 (range 0-17). At 3 months postprocedure, 21 patients (60%) had a modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2, and 8 patients (23%) had died. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive intraarterial eptifibatide is a feasible option for salvage of reocclusion and thrombolysis of distal inaccessible thrombi during endovascular stroke revascularization. Its safety and efficacy need to be studied further in larger, multicenter, controlled studies.","Memon, Muhammad Zeeshan; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Sharma, Jitendra; Mathews, Marlon S; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2010.8.jns10318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20868216/,444

Because DTP has been linked to deleterious nonspecific effects (NSEs) and OPV to beneficial NSEs, we followed up this cohort to 3 years of age and examined the effects of DTP with OPV on all-cause mortality and the interactions of DTP and OPV with the measles vaccine (MV). METHODS DTP and OPV were offered at 3 monthly community weighing sessions. Vaccination groups were defined by the last vaccine received. We compared overall mortality for different groups in Cox proportional hazards regression models, reporting hazards ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. FINDINGS The study cohort included 1491 children born in Bandim from December 1980 to December 1983. From 3 to 35 months of age, with censoring for MV, children vaccinated with DTP and/or OPV had higher mortality than both unvaccinated children (HR = l.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.69) and OPV-only vaccinated children (HR = 2.81; 95% CI, 1.02-7.69); DTP-only vaccinated children had higher mortality than OPV-only vaccinated children (HR = 3.38; 95% CI, 1.15--9.93). In the age group of 3-8 months, before MV is administered, DTP-only vaccination was associated with a higher mortality than DTP with OPV (HR = 3.38; 95% CI, 1.59-7.20). Between 9 and 35 months of age, when MV is given, DTP-vaccinated and MV-unvaccinated children had higher mortality (HR = 2.76; 95% CI, 1.36-5.59) than children who had received MV after DTP, and among children who received DTP with MV or after MV, DTP-only vaccination was associated with a higher mortality than DTP with OPV (HR = 6.25; 95% CI, 2.55-15.37). IMPLICATIONS Because the 2 vaccines had differential effects and the healthiest children were vaccinated first, selection biases are unlikely to explain the estimated impact on child survival. OPV had beneficial NSEs, and administration of OPV with DTP may have reduced the negative effects of DTP.

Mental Health Data Collection in the Estonian Biobank: Instruments, Methodology and Preliminary Results",2021,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted via mosquitoes and sex to cause congenital neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly. Inherited forms of microcephaly (MCPH) are associated with disrupted centrosome organization. Similarly, we found that ZIKV infection disrupted centrosome organization. ZIKV infection disrupted the organization of centrosomal proteins including CEP63, a MCPH-associated protein. The ZIKV nonstructural protein NS3 bound CEP63, and expression of NS3 was sufficient to alter centrosome architecture and CEP63 localization. Loss of CEP63 suppressed ZIKV-induced centrosome disorganization, indicating that ZIKV requires CEP63 to disrupt centrosome organization. ZIKV infection or loss of CEP63 decreased the centrosomal localization and stability of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a regulator of the innate immune response. ZIKV infection or loss of CEP63 also increased the centrosomal accumulation of the CEP63 interactors, Mindbomb1 (MIB1) and DTX4, ubiquitin ligases that respectively activate and degrade TBK1. Therefore, we propose that ZIKV NS3 binds CEP63 to increase centrosomal DTX4 localization and destabilization of TBK1, thereby tempering the innate immune response. In addition to identifying a mechanism by which CEP63 controls the innate immune responses in ZIKV infection, we propose that the altered centrosomal organization caused by altered CEP63 function may contribute to ZIKV-associated microcephaly.","Kodani, Andrew; Knopp, Kristeene A.; Di Lullo, Elizabeth; Retallack, Hanna; Kriegstein, Arnold R.; DeRisi, Joseph L.; Reiter, Jeremy F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.298083,444

Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies across many diseases in the lung have profiled this diversity transcriptionally, defining new cellular states and their association with disease. Despite these massive cellular profiling efforts, many studies have focused on defining myeloid dysfunction in specific diseases without identifying common pan-disease trends in the mononuclear phagocyte compartment within the lung. To address these gaps in our knowledge, we collate, process, and analyze 561,390 cellular transcriptomes from 12 studies of the human lung across multiple human diseases. We develop a computational framework to identify and compare dominant gene markers and gene expression programs and characterize MNP diversity in the lung, proposing a conserved dictionary of gene sets. Utilizing this reference, we efficiently identify disease-associated and rare MNP populations across multiple diseases and cohorts. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this dictionary in characterizing a recently published dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls which further reveal novel transcriptional shifts directly relatable to other diseases in the lung. These results underline conserved MNP transcriptional programs in lung disease, provide an immediate reference for characterizing the landscape of lung MNPs and establish a roadmap to dissecting MNP transcriptional complexity across tissues.","Peters, Joshua M.; Blainey, Paul C.; Bryson, Bryan D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.06.240424,444

This focus, however, neglects potential cross-national, and especially sub-national, geographic variations in pain, even though geographic comparisons could shed new light on factors that drive or protect against pain. This article presents the first comparative analysis of pain in the U.S. and Canada, comparing the countries in aggregate and analyzing variation across states and provinces. Analyses are based on cross-sectional data collected in 2020 from 2,124 U.S. and 2,110 Canadian adults 18 years and older. Our pain measure is a product of pain frequency and pain-related interference with daily activities. We use regression and decomposition methods to link socioeconomic characteristics and pain, and inverse-distance weighting spatial interpolation to map pain scores. We find significantly and substantially higher pain in the U.S. than in Canada. The difference is accounted for by Americans' lower economic wellbeing. Additionally, we find variation in pain within countries; the variation is statistically significant across U.S. states. Further, we identify nine hotspot states in the Deep South, Appalachia, and the West where respondents have significantly higher pain than those in the rest of the U.S. or Canada. This excess pain is partly attributable to economic distress, but a large part remains unexplained; we speculate that it may reflect the sociopolitical context of the hotspot states. Overall, our findings identify areas with high need for pain prevention and management; they also other scholars to consider geographic factors as important contributors to population pain.","Zajacova, A.; Lee, J.; Grol-Prokopczyk, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.15.21263635v1?rss=1,444

The regions of three clones pJMS1010, pJS112 and pJS92, which together encompass the surface protein gene have been sequenced by the chain termination method. The sequence of the primary translation product, deduced from the DNA sequence, predicts a polypeptide of 1,235 amino acids with a molecular weight of 136,600. This polypeptide displays the features characteristic of a group 1 membrane protein; an amino-terminal signal sequence and carboxy-terminal membrane and cytoplasmic domains. There are 21 potential glycosylation sites in the polypeptide and a cysteine-rich region in the vicinity of the transmembrane domain. During maturation proteolytic processing of the polypeptide occurs and at positions 624 to 628 the sequence Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg-Arg is found, which is similar to a number of basic sequences involved in the cleavage of enveloped RNA virus glycoproteins. The fusogenic properties of the MHV surface protein do not appear to correlate with a strongly hydrophobic region at the putative amino terminus of the carboxy-terminal cleavage product.","Schmidt, I; Skinner, M; Siddell, S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027248/,444

Unfortunately, post-embolization follow-up angiographic images can be obscured by artifact. The dual-volume reconstruction technique was developed in order to reduce artifact and enhance the visualization of the aneurysm, the parent vessel and side branches, and endovascular devices. The purpose of this study was to compare the reliability of dual- vs single-volume reconstruction of 3D DSA in evaluation of follow-up images after endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms. METHOD Four cerebrovascular neurosurgeons independently and blindly reviewed 20 randomly selected dual-and single-volume reconstructions of 3D DSAs demonstrating cerebral aneurysms treated with primary coil embolization, stent-assisted coil embolization, or Pipeline embolization. Five images were repeated for each modality (single and dual volume) in order to assess intra-rater reliability. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated as a measure of the overall inter-rater agreement. Cohen's kappa value was used to assess repeat measurement consistency for each rater. RESULTS Overall inter-rater agreement using dual- and single-volume reconstruction was 0.81 and 0.75, respectively. Dual-volume reconstruction resulted in superior agreement in assessing location, occlusion status, position of aneurysm recanalization or residual, status of nearby branches, presence of coil migration and presence of intravascular devices (stent or Pipeline). CONCLUSION Three-dimensional reconstruction is an important complementary imaging technique in evaluating the angioarchitecture of aneurysms and recanalization after endovascular embolization. Dual-volume reconstruction imaging was associated with superior inter- and intra-rater reliability.","Adeeb, Nimer; Griessenauer, Christoph J; Patel, Apar S; Moore, Justin; Dolati-Ardejani, Parviz; Gupta, Raghav; Motiei-Langroudi, Rouzbeh; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Thomas, Ajith J","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530137/,444

It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the beta-coronavirus genus that also includes SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS). While the typical presentation is given by respiratory symptoms and fever, some patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Several studies have identified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in enterocytes. In this short review, we report the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in infected patients and suggest possible implications for disease management, transmission, and infection control.","Caio, Giacomo; Lungaro, Lisa; Cultrera, Rosario; Giorgio, Roberto De; Volta, Umberto",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244376/,444

Infection of mice lacking CCR2 (CCR2(-/-)) with MHV resulted in increased mortality and enhanced viral recovery from the brain that correlated with reduced (p < or = 0.04) T cell and macrophage/microglial (determined by F4/80 Ag expression, p < or = 0.004) infiltration into the CNS. Moreover, MHV-infected CCR2(-/-) mice displayed a significant decrease in Th1-associated factors IFN-gamma (p < or = 0.001) and RANTES/CCL5 (p < or = 0.002) within the CNS as compared with CCR2(+/+) mice. Further, peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from immunized CCR2(-/-) mice displayed a marked reduction in IFN-gamma production in response to viral Ag and did not migrate into the CNS of MHV-infected recombination-activating gene (RAG)1(-/-) mice following adoptive transfer. In addition, macrophage/microglial infiltration into the CNS of RAG1(-/-) mice receiving CCR2(-/-) splenocytes was reduced (p < or = 0.05), which correlated with a reduction in the severity of demyelination (p < or = 0.001) as compared with RAG1(-/-) mice receiving splenocytes from CCR2(+/+) mice.

DESIGN: Analysis of data (n=9515) from the Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation partnership COVID-19 survey collected online between 1 and 8 April 2020. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: 9515 people with self-reported long-term respiratory conditions. 81% female, age ranges from &#8804;17 years to 80 years and above, from all nations of the UK. Long-term respiratory conditions reported included asthma (83%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%) and 'other' (<1%) (eg, lung cancer and pulmonary endometriosis). OUTCOME MEASURES: Study responses related to impacts on key elements of healthcare, as well as practical, psychological and social consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures. RESULTS: 45% reported disruptions to care, including cancellations of appointments, investigations, pulmonary rehabilitation, treatment and monitoring. Other practical impacts such as difficulty accessing healthcare services for other issues and getting basic necessities such as food were also common. 36% did not use online prescriptions, and 54% had not accessed online inhaler technique videos. Psychosocial impacts including anxiety, loneliness and concerns about personal health and family were prevalent. 81% reported engaging in physical activity.

Several health authorities have implemented specific precautionary measures worldwide to combat the spread of the disease. The influence of these measures on tackling the spread of the disease remains to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of precautionary measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Data for this study were gathered from publicly available data sources such as the Worldometer and World Health Organization websites. The expected number of new cases is calculated using a mathematical formula to assess the difference between the observed and expected number of cases, thus indicating the impact of precautionary measures on the spread of COVID-19. Results: The preventive measures massively impacted the reduction of COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia from the expected number of 437,097 accumulated cases by May 4, 2020, to the observed number of 28,656 accumulated cases. Thus, the fatality rate is reduced from the expected 15,735 accumulated deaths by May 4 to 191 accumulated deaths.

In this retrospective, single-center, observational study, we enrolled the initial 131 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Jin-Yin-Tan Hospital who had at least one-time antibody tested during their hospitalization. The dynamic changes of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in 226 serum samples were detected by ELISA. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG ELISA detection were analyzed. Result showed that the sensitivity of the IgG ELISA detection (92.5%) was significantly higher than that of the IgM (70.8%) (P < 0.001). The meantimes of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were 6 days and 3 days, respectively. The IgM and IgG antibody levels peaked at around 18 days and 23 days, and then IgM fell to below the baseline level at about day 36, whereas IgG maintained at a relatively high level.

Serological testing intended for point-of-care or laboratory use can be used to determine more accurate individual and population assessments of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2; improve our understanding of the degree to which immunity is conveyed to subsequent exposures; and quantify immune response to future vaccines. In response to this pandemic, initially more than 90 companies deployed serology assays to the U.S. market, many of which made overstated claims for their accuracy, regulatory approval status, and utility for intended purpose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration subsequently instituted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) procedure requiring that manufacturers submit validation data, but allowing newly developed serological tests to be marketed without the usual approval process during this crisis. Although this rapid deployment was intended to benefit public health, the incomplete understanding of immune response to the virus and lack of assay vetting resulted in quality issues with some of these tests, and thus many were withdrawn after submission. Common assay platforms include lateral flow assays which can serve an important niche of low cost, rapid turnaround, and increased accessibility whereas established laboratory-based platforms based on ELISAs and chemiluminescence expand existing technologies to SARS-CoV-2 and can provide throughput and quantification capabilities. While most of the currently EUA assays rely on these well-established platforms, despite their apparent technical simplicity, there are numerous practical challenges both for manufacturers in developing and for end-users in running and interpreting such assays. Within are discussed technical challenges to serology development for SARS-CoV-2, with an emphasis on lateral flow assay technology.","Ernst, Emilie; Wolfe, Patricia; Stahura, Corrine; Edwards, Katie A",Talanta,,444

This essay argues that in order to fully understand the politics arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to focus on the individual and collective experiences of death, loss, and grief. While the emerging scholarly discourse on the pandemic, particularly in political science and international relations, typically considers death only in terms of its effects on formal state-level politics and as a policy objective for mitigation, we argue that focusing on the particularities of the experience of death resulting from COVID-19 can help us fully understand the ways in which the pandemic is reordering our worlds. Examining the ambiguous sociopolitical meaning of death by COVID-19 can provide broader analytical comparisons with other mass death events. Ultimately, the essay argues that centering the impact of the pandemic on the experience of death and loss directly poses the question of how politics should value human lives in the post-pandemic world, helping us better formulate the normative questions necessary for a more ethical future.

223690,COVID-19: Restrictive practices and the law during a global pandemic - an Australian perspective,2020,"Macroglia, comprising astrocytes and oligodendroglial lineage cells, have long been regarded as uniform cell types of the central nervous system (CNS). Although regional morphological differences between these cell types were initially described after their identification a century ago, these differences were largely ignored. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that macroglial cells form distinct populations throughout the CNS, based on both functional and morphological features. Moreover, with the use of refined techniques including single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, additional evidence is emerging for regional macroglial heterogeneity at the transcriptional level. In parallel, several studies revealed the existence of regional differences in remyelination capacity between CNS grey and white matter areas, both in experimental models for successful remyelination as well as in the chronic demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we provide an overview of the diversity in oligodendroglial lineage cells and astrocytes from the grey and white matter, as well as their interplay in health and upon demyelination and successful remyelination. In addition, we discuss the implications of regional macroglial diversity for remyelination in light of its failure in MS.

232468,Delivering exposure therapy via telehealth: Benefits and challenges,2021,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for college-aged individuals worldwide and in the United States. Recent studies have identified preliminary evidence of widening disparities in suicidal behaviors across sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status among college students. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of on-campus and off-campus suicide interventions, nor is collated information available for different types of screening, assessment, treatment, and postvention plans. Further challenges have been identified since the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for cost-effective and innovative interventions to address increased rates of suicidal behaviors among college students facing unprecedented stressors. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most effective and cost-effective intervention components for universal and targeted (indicated and selected) suicide prevention among college students in a global context. Special attention will be placed on disparities in suicide prevention across sociodemographic subgroups, inclusive interventions beyond campus, global context, and intervention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sensitive search strategy will be executed across MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest), Scopus, Global Index Medicus, SciELO, African Journals Online, Global Health (CABI), and Google Scholar. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by three independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model and subgroup analysis will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: The initial search was completed in December 2020 and updated with additional other-language studies in March 2020. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing rates of suicidal behaviors among college students, few preventative efforts have targeted this population, and fewer focus on factors that might place specific demographic groups at heightened risk. The impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviors among college students highlights and exacerbates the urgent need for rapid and effective interventions that might differ from traditional approaches. This equity-focused study will address these gaps and provide a valuable analysis of the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs and interventions. Findings will inform clinicians, researchers, policy makers, families, and organizations about evidence-based interventions for reducing the gaps in the suicide crisis among college students from different sociodemographic groups.

BACKGROUND: TAD is an increasingly recognized entity associated with poor outcomes in patients with valvular heart disease. METHODS: The maximal septolateral diameter of the tricuspid annulus was measured in consecutive patients with 3-dimensional multidetector row computed tomographic datasets undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Receiver-operating curve characteristic analysis was performed to obtain an ideal, body surface area-normalized cutoff for TAD. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional ethics board. RESULTS: The study included 1,137 patients, of whom 299 died within a mean follow-up period of 1.8 ± 1.0 years. TAD was identified in 446 patients (39.2%) on the basis of a receiver-operating characteristic cutoff of 23 mm/m2. TAD had no impact on procedural outcomes, including device failure defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. Patients with TAD experienced significantly greater mortality (hazard ratio: 1.99; 95% confidence interval: 1.59 to 2.51; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis including clinical and echocardiographic parameters confirmed the predictive value of TAD (hazard ratio: 1.78; 95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 2.38; p < 0.001), while echocardiographic variables, including estimated pulmonary artery pressure and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, did not reach statistical significance. The predictive value of TAD was incremental to a baseline model of clinical and echocardiographic parameters (continuous net reclassification improvement 0.204; p < 0.01) and incremental to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (continuous net reclassification improvement 0.209; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TAD is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","Deseive, Simon; Steffen, Julius; Beckmann, Markus; Jochheim, David; Orban, Mathias; Zadrozny, Magda; Gschwendtner, Sarah; Braun, Daniel; Rizas, Konstantinos; Curta, Adrian; Hagl, Christian; Theiss, Hans D; Mehilli, Julinda; Massberg, Steffen; Hausleiter, Jörg",JACC cardiovasc. interv,,444
242334,Targeting Arousal and Sleep through Noninvasive Brain Stimulation to Improve Mental Health,2020,"Background: Severe COVID-19 has a high mortality rate. Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope. We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death. Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs. A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists. Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients. Findings: The median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52-79). Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]). Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course. We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis. Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined. Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]). Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients. The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients. Interpretation: Our series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion. Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.

242956,Variation in value of annual effective natural gamma dose rate during lockdown in the pandemic situation in various countries,2020,"Quantum dots (QDs) are synthetic semiconductor nanocrystals with unique optical and electronic properties due to their size (2-10 nm) such as high molar absorption coefficient (10-100 times higher than organic dyes), resistance to chemical degradation, and unique optoelectronic properties due to quantum confinement (high quantum yield, emission color change with size). Compared to organic fluorophores, the narrower emission band and wider absorption bands of QDs offer great advantages in cell imaging and biosensor applications. The optoelectronic features of QDs have prompted their intensive use in bioanalytical, biophysical, and biomedical research. As the nanomaterials have been integrated into microfluidic systems, microfluidic technology has accelerated the adaptation of nanomaterials to clinical evaluation together with the advantages such as being more economical, more reproducible, and more susceptible to modification and integration with other technologies. Microfluidic systems serve an important role by being a platform in which QDs are integrated for biosensing applications. As we combine the advantages of QDs and microfluidic technology for biosensing technology, QD-based biosensor integrated with microfluidic systems can be used as an advanced and versatile diagnostic technology in case of pandemic. Specifically, there is an urgent necessity to have reliable and fast detection systems for COVID-19 virus. In this review, affinity-based biosensing mechanisms which are developed with QDs are examined in the domain of microfluidic approach. The combination of microfluidic technology and QD-based affinity biosensors are presented with examples in order to develop a better technological framework of diagnostic for COVID-19 virus.","Sahin, Sultan; Ünlü, Caner; Trabzon, Levent",Emergent Mater,,444

Research on virtual teams has followed that of co-located face-to-face teams through lenses such as trust, communication, teamwork, leadership and collaboration. This paper introduces a new paradigm for examining the development of virtual teams, arguably one that would facilitate the consideration of technology as part of a virtual team rather than simply as an alternate to face-to-face teams.

246326,Back to Basics: Improving Care for Psychosis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The live bird market (LBM) plays an important role in the dynamic evolution of the avian influenza H5N1 virus. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to monitor the genetic diversity of the H5N1 viruses in LBMs in Indonesia. METHODS: Therefore, the disease surveillance was conducted in the area of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Jakarta Province, Indonesia from 2014 to 2019. Subsequently, the genetic characterization of the H5N1 viruses was performed by sequencing all 8 segments of the viral genome. RESULTS: As a result, the H5N1 viruses were detected in most of LBMs in both bird' cloacal and environmental samples, in which about 35% of all samples were positive for influenza A and, subsequently, about 52% of these samples were positive for H5 subtyping. Based on the genetic analyses of 14 viruses isolated from LBMs, genetic diversities of the H5N1 viruses were identified including clades 2.1.3 and 2.3.2 as typical predominant groups as well as reassortant viruses between these 2 clades. CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence, zoonotic transmission to humans in the market could be occurred from the exposure of infected birds and/or contaminated environments. Moreover, new virus variants could emerge from the LBM environment. Therefore, improving pandemic preparedness raised great concerns related to the zoonotic aspect of new influenza variants because of its high adaptivity and efficiency for human infection.","Dharmayanti, Ni Luh Putu Indi; Hewajuli, Dyah Ayu; Ratnawati, Atik; Hartawan, Risza",J Vet Sci,,444

This systematic literature review aims to do just that, following PRISMA guidelines in a review of over 500 English articles that yielded 62 algorithm audit studies. The studies are synthesized and organized primarily by behavior (discrimination, distortion, exploitation, and misjudgement), with codes also provided for domain (e.g. search, vision, advertising, etc.), organization (e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), and audit method (e.g. sock puppet, direct scrape, crowdsourcing, etc.). The review shows how previous audit studies have exposed public-facing algorithms exhibiting problematic behavior, such as search algorithms culpable of distortion and advertising algorithms culpable of discrimination. Based on the studies reviewed, it also suggests some behaviors (e.g. discrimination on the basis of intersectional identities), domains (e.g. advertising algorithms), methods (e.g. code auditing), and organizations (e.g. Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn) that call for future audit attention. The paper concludes by offering the common ingredients of successful audits, and discussing algorithm auditing in the context of broader research working toward algorithmic justice.","Bandy, Jack",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04256v1.pdf,444

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) performed with different heating/cooling rates enabled the precise determination of enthalpy values, which deviate from literature values. Weak and previously unnoticed thermal phenomena at temperatures below 190â K were also observed. Their presence was confirmed by low-temperature in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Through DSC measurements and TEM observations, a model of the discovered phenomenon was proposed, which may have an impact on a better understanding of the physics of magnetic shape memory materials.","Zak, Andrzej; Danczak, Anna; Dudzinski, Wlodzimierz",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,444

They are fecund, short-lived, and have a complex life history involving offshore spawning, inshore mangrove-lined nursery grounds, and migrations between the two locations. We have reviewed and assessed published research on: the fisheries and aquaculture; taxonomy and identification; distribution and habitat preferences; growth; mortality; food and feeding; predation, and the importance of the mangrove habitat to banana prawns. We have examined the life history patterns of these two banana prawns and the many environmental and biological factors that affect different life history stages, often resulting in large interannual variations in abundances of adult prawns and commercial catches. We have also reviewed research on the ecosystem relationships involving these prawns, including fishery impacts on the environment and other species caught as bycatch. In reviewing the published information on factors affecting recruitment dynamics and variability, we have sometimes found contrasting and confounding results, suggesting that these factors are not yet fully understood. Therefore, for each aspect of the prawns' biology we have pointed to areas with incomplete or conflicted understanding, which will hopefully guide future research on these extremely valuable prawn species.","Vance, David J; Rothlisberg, Peter C",Adv Mar Biol,,444

The human nervous system is tuned to detect safety and danger, integrating body and brain responses via the autonomic nervous system. Polyvagal Theory provides a perspective to understand the impact of the pandemic on mental and physical health. This perspective highlights the important role of the state of the autonomic nervous system in exacerbating or dampening threat reactions to the pandemic. In addition, the theory alerts us to the impact of clinical history (e.g., trauma) on autonomic regulation as an important compounding risk factor lowering the threshold to behaviorally and physiologically destabilize in response to the pandemic. The theory provides a strategy to dampen the adverse reactions to threat (e.g., acute stress disorders) through portals of social engagement that evolved to downregulate defenses to promote calmness and connectedness.","Porges, Stephen W.",Clin.

This study aims to understand how digital literacy, parental mediation, and self-control affects online risk during the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This paper elaborated a quantitative method with SEM-PLS to raise the comprehension of the phenomenon studied. A questionnaire was voluntarily responded to approximately 300 elementary school students who engaged in online-based learning. The structural equation modeling estimation indicates that digital literacy, parental mediation, and self-control influences online risk. However, parental mediation failed in promoting students’ self-control. These findings suggest that both digital literacy and parental mediation needs to be penetrated to reduce the impact of online risk in the teaching and learning process. This is the first step for schools and parents’ alertness in assisting and considering the appropriate and safe media using technology.","Purnama, Sigit Ulfah Maulidya Machali Imam Wibowo Agus Narmaditya Bagus Shandy",Heliyon,,444

BACKGROUND. An increase in frequency of acute ischemic strokes has been observed among patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes in patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms. METHODS. This retrospective case-control study included patients for whom a code for stroke was activated from March 16 to April 30, 2020, at any of six New York City hospitals that are part of a single health system. Demographic data (age, sex, and race or ethnicity), COVID-19 status, stroke-related risk factors, and clinical and imaging findings pertaining to stroke were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes. RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 329 patients for whom a code for stroke was activated (175 [53.2%] men, 154 [46.8%] women; mean age, 66.9 ± 14.9 [SD] years). Among the 329 patients, 35.3% (116) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed with imaging; 21.6% (71) had large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke; and 14.6% (48) had small vessel occlusion (SVO) stroke. Among LVO strokes, the most common location was middle cerebral artery segments M1 and M2 (62.0% [44/71]). Multifocal LVOs were present in 9.9% (7/71) of LVO strokes. COVID-19 was present in 38.3% (126/329) of the patients. The 61.7% (203/329) of patients without COVID-19 formed the negative control group. Among individual stroke-related risk factors, only Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with COVID-19 (38.1% of patients with COVID-19 vs 20.7% of patients without COVID-19; p = 0.001). LVO was present in 31.7% of patients with COVID-19 compared with 15.3% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.001). SVO was present in 15.9% of patients with COVID-19 and 13.8% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.632). In multivariate analysis controlled for race and ethnicity, presence of COVID-19 had a significant independent association with LVO stroke (odds ratio, 2.4) compared with absence of COVID-19 (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is associated with LVO strokes but not with SVO strokes. CLINICAL IMPACT. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute neurologic symptoms warrant a lower threshold for suspicion of large vessel stroke, and prompt workup for large vessel stroke is recommended.","Kihira, Shingo; Schefflein, Javin; Mahmoudi, Keon; Rigney, Brian; N Delman, Bradley; Mocco, J; Doshi, Amish; Belani, Puneet",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,444
269869,Belief in a COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory as a Predictor of Mental Health and Well-Being of Health Care Workers in Ecuador: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,2020,"A viral outbreak with a lower respiratory tract febrile illness causes pulmonary syndrome named COVID-19. Pulmonary consolidations developed in the lungs of the patients are imperative factors during prognosis and diagnosis. Existing Deep Learning techniques demonstrate promising results in analyzing X-ray images when employed with Transfer Learning. However, Transfer Learning has its inherent limitations, which can be prevaricated by employing the Progressive Resizing technique. The Progressive Resizing technique reuses old computations while learning new ones in Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), enabling it to incorporate prior knowledge of the feature hierarchy. The proposed classification model can classify pulmonary consolidation into normal, pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2 classes by analyzing X-rays images. The method exhibits substantial enhancement in classification results when the Transfer Learning technique is applied in consultation with the Progressive Resizing technique on EfficientNet CNN. The customized VGG-19 model attained benchmark scores in all evaluation criteria over the baseline VGG-19 model. GradCam based feature interpretation, coupled with X-ray visual analysis, facilitates improved assimilation of the scores. The model highlights its strength to assist medical experts in the COVID-19 identification during the prognosis and subsequently for diagnosis. Clinical implications exist in peripheral and remotely located health centers with the paucity of trained human resources to interpret radiological investigations' findings.","Bhatt, Anant Ganatra Amit Kotecha Ketan",Heliyon,,444

Rapid screening and detection of infected patients is important step in fighting against this disease, so that proper measures can be taken to stop it from further spreading. Majority of the countries who have been successful in controlling the disease, have done it through effective early detection. The same factor is very evident in the countries where COVID-19 has gone out of control that they were or are not successful in early detection of suspected patients. This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based approach to provide new screening approach to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. More than thirty-five thousand local/international negative and positive corona X-ray images were obtained to train VGG-16 model. Proposed method has two classifiers, first classifier distinguishes between negative cases and other infected cases, second classifier identifies pneumonia and other infected cases. These other infected cases will be recognized as COVID-19. Experimental evaluation on different X-ray imaging were conducted where this method classified positive and negative cases very effectively. A comparative study with publicly available network such as COVID-NET is also carried out. Proposed method outperformed COVID-NET in all three major areas such as overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Overall accuracy for our technique is 95.08%, while sensitivity and specificity values are 100% and 93.15% respectively, while overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity values for COVID-NET are 52.36%, 86.79% and 27.39% respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Baloch, S.; Oayyum, U.; Ahmed, M.; Sajid, M.; Javed, H.; Ahmed, F.

During the first lockdown, extrafamilial contact was significantly reduced. Many parents had to look after their children and work from home while the economic pressure increased. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health problems in children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: In a cross-sectional online survey 687 parents of underaged children in Germany were included. Demographic and psychosocial predictors for IPV and associations with mental health problems of children before and during the first lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. The survey ran from 18 May 2020 to 21 July 2020 and the lockdown in Germany began on 23 March 2020 and ended via a gradual relaxation. The first schools reopened on 22 April and the opening of schools, kindergartens and daycare centers extended to the end of June 2020. Results: Lower household incomes and the experience of own adverse childhood experiences increased the risk of participants reporting violence in their relationship. According to the participating parents, children and adolescents living in families in which violence was reported by intimate partners were more likely to have higher levels of externalizing problems before and during the pandemic. There were no significant differences with respect to emotional problems. Conclusion: Adverse childhood experiences increase the risk of intimate partner violence, which in turn increases the risk of mental health problems in the children. Therefore, in the psychotherapeutic practice questions should also be systematically asked about corresponding experiences and appropriate treatment offers should be recommended.","Clemens, Vera; Köhler-Dauner, Franziska; Keller, Ferdinand; Ziegenhain, Ute; Fegert, Jörg M; Kölch, Michael",Psychotherapeut (Berl),,444

306898,From adversity to resilience in the COVID-19 era: strengthening mental health systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of roster reorganization on ensuring uninterrupted services while providing necessary relief to healthcare workers (HCW) in the obstetrics department of a tertiary care center amid the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The COVID-19 rostering response began in April 2020 and evolved in two phases: (1) development of new areas for screening and managing suspected/positive cases of COVID-19; and (2) team segregation according to area of work. The impact of these changes on HCWs and patients was assessed 3 months later. RESULTS: Developing separate areas helped to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and HCWs to those with COVID-19. Residents and consultants worked intensively in clinical areas for 1 week followed by 1-2 weeks of non-clinical or standby assignments, providing adequate opportunity for isolation. Frequent re-evaluation of the roster was nevertheless required as the pandemic progressed. Segregating teams vertically significantly reduced the number of contacts identified on contact tracing and quarantine leaves, while maintaining patient satisfaction with no increase in adverse events. Residents found the roster to be ""smart"" and ""pandemic-appropriate."" CONCLUSION: The ""COVID emergency roster"" helped ensure quality care with minimum risk of exposure and sufficient breaks for physical and psychological recovery of HCWs.","Mahey, Reeta; Sharma, Aparna; Kumari, Archana; Kachhawa, Garima; Gupta, Monica; Meena, Jyoti; Bhatla, Neerja",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,444

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a descriptive research design conducted in Chennai, India between May to July 2020 wherein 1,000 COVID 19 patients were studied. The convenience sampling method is used by the researcher for data collection. In this research paper, define-measure-analysis-improve-control methodology has been applied and factors such as assurance, process standardization, infrastructure, waiting time, cost were analyzed using quality function deployment (QFD), regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Findings: The applied six sigma model indicated that process standardization contributed the most toward the variation in COVID 19 patients’ satisfaction. Assurance by doctors is the second important factor. The interpersonal quality is important, which indicates a higher level of psychological needs in COVID 19 patients. Waiting time is another important factor influencing COVID 19 patients’ satisfaction. One of the unexpected findings is that cost is insignificant in influencing COVID 19 patients’ satisfaction. Originality/value: Six Sigma focuses on process variation improvement that encourages data analysis and problem-solving statistical techniques and evaluates the ability of a process to perform defect-free. Six sigma focused toward COVID 19 patients’ satisfaction has not been carried out, which this paper has done. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Raja Mohamed, K. B. N.; M, P. R.; S, S.; A, J.

319338,"Debate: Is there a true global children and young people's mental health crisis, fact or fiction?",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to review the literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and propose mitigation measures to address these risks. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused surgeons the world over to re-evaluate their approach to surgical procedures given concerns over the risk of aerosolization of viral particles and exposure of operating room staff to infection. International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case. A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large. Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.","Chadi, Sami A; Guidolin, Keegan; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Sharkawy, Abdu; Spinelli, Antonino; Quereshy, Fayez A; Okrainec, Allan",Ann Surg,,444

321978,Chicago community task force seeks to address trauma's role in violence,2020,"In recent times, computational methods played an important role in the down selection of chemical compounds, which could be a potential drug candidate with a high affinity to target proteins. However, the screening methodologies, including docking, often fails to identify the most effective compound, which could be a ligand for the target protein. To solve that, here we have integrated meta-dynamics, an enhanced sampling molecular simulation method, with all-atom molecular dynamics to determine a specific compound that could target the main protease of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). This combined computational approach uses the enhanced sampling to explore the free energy surface associated with the protein's binding site (including the ligand) in an explicit solvent. We have implemented this method to find new chemical entities that exhibit high specificity of binding to the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) present in the SARS-CoV-2 and segregated to the most strongly bound ligands based on free energy and scoring functions (defined and implemented) from a set of 17 ligands which were prescreened for synthesizability and druggability. Additionally, we have compared these 17 ligands' affinities against controls, N3 and 13b &#945;-ketoamide inhibitors, for which experimental crystal structures are available. Based on our results and analysis from the combined molecular simulation approach, we could identify the best compound which could be further taken as a potential candidate for experimental validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

324715,Self-efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation among Malaysian adolescents,2017,"BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has raised concerns in the rheumatology community about the management of immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. It is not clear whether the use of biological agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID-19 occur as a result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production. This prompted the use of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra) in severe COVID-19 disease and more recently JAK1/2 inhibitor (baricitinib). Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide a great opportunity to learn about the use of biological agents as protective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVES: To estimate COVID-19 infection rate in patients treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RMD), determine the influence of biological agents treatment as risk or protective factors and study the prognosis of patients with rheumatic diseases receiving biological agents compared to the general population in a third-level hospital setting in León, Spain. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients seen at our rheumatology department who received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases between December 1st 2019 and December 1st 2020, and analysed COVID-19 infection rate. All patients who attended our rheumatology outpatient clinic with diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving treatment with biological agents were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. The covariates were age, sex, comorbidities, biological agent, duration of treatment, mean dose of glucocorticoids and need for intensive care unit . We performed an univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess risk factors of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: There were a total of 4464 patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. 40 patients out of a total of 820 patients with rheumatic diseases (4.8%) receiving bDMARDs contracted COVID-19 and 4 required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID-19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 3.6%, and it was 0.89% among the group with underlying rheumatic diseases. 90% of patients receiving bDMARDS with COVID-19 did not require hospitalisation. Out of the 4464 patients, 869 patients died, 2 of which received treatment with biological agents. Patients with rheumatic diseases who tested positive for COVID-19 were older (female: median age 60.8 IQR 46-74; male: median age 61.9 IQR 52-70.3) than those who were negative for COVID-19 (female: median age 58.3 IQR 48-69; male: median age 56.2 IQR 47-66), more likely to have hypertension (45% vs 26%, OR 2.25 (CI 1.18-4.27),p 0.02), cardiovascular disease (23 % vs 9.6%, OR 2.73 (1.25-5.95), p 0.02), be smokers (13% vs 4.6%, OR 2.95 (CI 1.09-7.98), p 0.04), receiving treatment with rituximab (20% vs 8%, 2.28 (CI 1.24-6.32), p 0.02) and a higher dose of glucocorticoids (OR 2.5 (1.3-10.33, p 0.02) and were less likely to be receiving treatment with IL-6 inhibitors (2.5% vs 14%, OR 0.16, (CI 0.10-0.97, p 0.03). When exploring the effect of the rest of the therapies between groups (affected patients vs unaffected), we found no significant differences in bDMARD proportions. IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and belimumab-treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID-19 among adult patients with rheumatic diseases. We found no differences in sex or rheumatological disease between patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and patients who tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID-19. Patients with rheumatic disease diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to be receiving a higher dose of glucocorticoids and treatment with rituximab. IL-6 inhibitors may have a protective effect.","Santos, Cristiana Sieiro; Férnandez, Xenia Cásas; Moriano Morales, Clara; Álvarez, Elvira Díez; Álvarez Castro, Carolina; López Robles, Alejandra; Pérez Sandoval, Trinidad",,,444

This retrospective cohort study is a comprehensive analysis of the initial symptoms, comorbidities and laboratory evaluation of patients, diagnosed with COVID-19 in Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, from 4th February to 12th March, 2020. Based on the data collected from 63 severely ill patients from the onset of symptoms till the full recovery or demise, we found not only age (average 70) but also blood indicators as significant risk factors associated with multiple organ failure. The blood indices of all patients showed hepatic, renal, cardiac and hematopoietic dysfunction with imbalanced coagulatory biomarkers. We noticed that the levels of LDH (85%, P < .001), HBDH (76%, P < .001) and CRP (65%, P < .001) were significantly elevated in deceased patients, indicating hepatic impairment. Similarly, increased CK (15%, P = .002), Cre (37%, P = 0.102) and CysC (74%, P = 0.384) indicated renal damage. Cardiac injury was obvious from the significantly elevated level of Myoglobin (52%, P < .01), Troponin-I (65%, P = 0.273) and BNP (50%, P = .787). SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the hemolymphatic system as WBC# (73%, P = .002) and NEUT# (78%, P < .001) were significantly elevated in deceased patients. Likewise, the level of D-dimer (80%, P < .171), PT (87%, P = .031) and TT (57%, P = .053) was elevated, indicating coagulatory imbalances. We identified myoglobin and CRP as specific risk factors related to mortality and highly correlated to organ failure in COVID-19 disease.","Ali, Ashaq; Noman, Muhammad; Guo, Yong; Liu, Xu; Zhang, Rong; Zhou, Juan; Zheng, Yang; Zhang, Xian-En; Qi, Yong; Chen, Xiaohua; Men, Dong",Sci Rep,,444

Exploring the epidemiological characteristics could provide a basis for responding to imported cases abroad and to formulate prevention and control strategies in areas where COVID-19 is still spreading rapidly. METHODS: The number of confirmed cases, daily growth, incidence and length of time from the first reported case to the end of the local cases (i.e., non-overseas imported cases) were compared by spatial (geographical) and temporal classification and visualization of the development and changes of the epidemic situation by layers through maps. RESULTS: In the first wave, a total of 539 cases were reported in Sichuan, with an incidence rate of 0.6462/100,000. The closer to Hubei the population centres were, the more pronounced the epidemic was. The peak in Sichuan Province occurred in the second week. Eight weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, the health crisis had eased. The longest epidemic length at the city level in China (except Wuhan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) was 53 days, with a median of 23 days. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of China showed positive spatial correlation (Moran's Index > 0, p < 0.05). Most countries outside China began to experience a rapid rise in infection rates 4 weeks after their first case. Some European countries experienced that rise earlier than the USA. The pandemic in Germany, Spain, Italy, and China took 28, 29, 34, and 18 days, respectively, to reach the peak of daily infections, after their daily increase of up to 20 cases. During this time, countries in the African region and Southeast Asian region were at an early stage of infections, those in the Eastern Mediterranean region and region of the Americas were in a rapid growth phase. CONCLUSIONS: After the closure of the outbreak city, appropriate isolation and control measures in the next 8 weeks were key to control the outbreak, which reduced the peak value and length of the outbreak.

Recent studies propose an active role of coagulation disorders in disease progression. This hypercoagulability has been displayed by marked increase in D-dimer in hospitalized patients. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, generation of cytokine storm, the interdependence between inflammation and coagulation, its consequences and the possible management options for coagulation complications like venous thromboembolism (VTE), microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and systemic and local coagulopathy. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for relevant reports using COVID-19, cytokine storm, and coagulation as keywords. EXPERT OPINION: A prophylactic dose of 5000-7500 units of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in order to prevent VTE. Treatment dose of LMWH, based on disease severity, is being contemplated for patients showing a marked rise in levels of D-dimer due to possible pulmonary thrombi. Additionally, targeting PAR-1, thrombin, coagulation factor Xa and the complement system may be potentially useful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection induced lung injury, microvascular thrombosis, VTE and related outcomes like DIC and multi-organ failure.","Savla, Shreya R; Prabhavalkar, Kedar S; Bhatt, Lokesh K",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,444

For Mexico, UK and Russia, the fits are consistent with a slope down pattern. For Brazil we found a subtle trend down, but with significant uncertainties. The USA, UK and India data shown a first peak with a higher growth rate when compared to the second one, demonstrating the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions of sanitary measures and social distance flattening the curve. For USA, a third peak seems quite plausible, most likely related with the recent relaxation policies. Brazil's data are satisfactorily described by two highly overlapped Gompertz functions with similar growth rates, suggesting a two-steps process for the pandemic spreading. The 95% CI for the total number of deaths ($\times 10^3$) predicted by the model for Aug 31, 2020 are 160 to 220, 110 to 130, 59 to 62, 46.6 to 47.3, 54 to 63 and 16.0 to 16.7 for USA, Brazil, Mexico, UK, India and Russia, respectively. Our estimates for the prevalences of infections are in reasonable agreement with some preliminary reports from serological studies carried out in USA and Brazil. The method represents an effective framework to estimate the line-shape of the infection curves and the uncertainties of the relevant parameters based on the actual data.","Rodrigues, Tulio; Helene, Otaviano",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04989v1.pdf,444

In late spring, a number of Northern Hemisphere countries were in a transition period from lockdown to a new normality. Malta, a European country, praised by the Commonwealth General Secretary as the country that 'has done the best in the whole of Europe' was also at this stage. The aim was to summarise the transition period in Malta while describing the different transition phases and interventions adopted to return to a new normality. Subject and method: A literature search was conducted using Google search engines and Maltese online newspapers. Results: Up till 21 June 2020, a total of 665 cases were identified, with 40 cases being active and nine deaths. Eight weeks after the first reported COVID-19 case, the first transition phase with relaxation of some lockdown measures came into effect. A spike in positive cases was observed after this phase. The second and third transition phases followed suite in 2 week intervals, at the end of which all services were re-opened. However, the travel ban was to be lifted on 1 July 2020. Of note, the number of positive cases remained relatively low after the latter two transition phases. Conclusion: Malta's COVID-19 response team managed to contain the first wave following an all-of-society and all-of-government approach. The healthcare system was equipped with an adequate number of beds and ventilators. The three transition phases instituted have shifted the Maltese population from a partial lockdown to a new normality with low fluctuating COVID-19 daily positive cases during the transition period.","Cuschieri, Sarah",Z Gesundh Wiss,,444

346326,"Suicide hotlines: Perception, practice, and possibilities",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses novel health issues. However, the benefits and costs of the pandemic and policies to address it have a familiar economic structure. Chief among the health-related benefits are the monetized values of the U.S. mortality costs of $3.9 trillion in 2020. The combined U.S. mortality and morbidity costs are $5.5-5.9 trillion. Global mortality costs in 2020 total $10.1 trillion. The skewed age distribution of COVID-19 illnesses has stimulated increased advocacy of downward adjustments in the value of a statistical life (VSL) for older people. This article examines the role of age for policy analysis generally and for the rationing of scarce medical treatments, such as ventilators. Mortality risk reduction benefits should be based on the reduced probability of death multiplied by the pertinent VSL. Effective communication of risks to foster precautions hinges on the credibility of the information source, which public officials have jeopardized. Efficient control of risks imposes limits on personal freedoms to foster health improvements.","Viscusi, W Kip",Southern economic journal,,444

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to characterise the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted using multisource data from all acute NHS hospitals in England. All consecutive patients hospitalized with diagnosis of ACS with or without COVID-19 infection between 1st March- 31st May 2020 were included. The primary outcome was in-hospital and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 12,958 patients were hospitalized with ACS during the study period, of which 517 (4.0%) were COVID-19 positive and were more likely to present with non-ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. COVID-19 ACS group were generally older, Black Asian and Minority ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting clinical characteristics such as elevated cardiac troponin, pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock and poor left ventricular systolic function compared with non-COVID-19 ACS group. They were less likely to receive an invasive coronary angiography (67.7% vs 81.0%), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (30.2% vs 53.9%) and dual antiplatelet medication (76.3% vs 88.0%). After adjusting for all the baseline differences, patients with COVID-19 ACS had higher in-hospital (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.27 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.41-4.42) and 30-day mortality (aOR 6.53 95%CI 5.1-8.36) compared to the non COVID-19 ACS group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was present in 4% of patients hospitalized with an ACS in England and is associated with lower rates of guideline recommended treatment and significant mortality hazard.","Rashid, Muhammad; Wu, Jianhua; Timmis, Adam; Curzen, Nick; Clarke, Sarah; Zaman, Azfar; Nolan, James; Shoaib, Ahmad; Mohamed, Mohamed O; de Belder, Mark A; Deanfield, John; Gale, Chris P; Mamas, Mamas A",J. intern. med,,444

The etiological agent of COVID-19 is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory system's epithelial cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, causing from non or mild symptoms to severe viral pneumonia, and in some cases, death. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately, various reports substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite conflicting results regarding ACE2 expression in brain tissue, the latest data show that ACE2 is robustly expressed by CNS cells, suggesting that CNS is a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type within the CNS and play a role in axon guidance and synaptic support, control the blood-brain barrier flow, and regulate neuroinflammation. To test if SARS-CoV-2 can enter into the CNS via astrocytes and then elicit adverse neurological effects, we have initiated studies to test if astrocytes express ACE2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect human astrocytes via this receptor. We have found that astrocytes robustly express ACE2 at the mRNA and protein levels. We are currently testing if astrocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could subsequently lead to neuronal damage and possibly account for some of the neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. We hope to contribute to gain insights into the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS and its potential physiological effects with this work.","Costa, Ricardo Burgos-Ramos Emma Gomez Torres Oscar Cruz-Topete Diana",The FASEB Journal,,444

357902,Predictors of COVID-19 Information Sources and Their Perceived Accuracy in Nigeria: Online Cross-sectional Study,2021,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected nursing homes. Vulnerable nursing home residents are at high risk for adverse outcomes, but improved understanding is needed to identify risk factors for mortality among nursing home residents. Objective: To identify risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality among US nursing home residents with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted at 351 US nursing homes among 5256 nursing home residents with COVID-19-related symptoms who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing between March 16 and September 15, 2020. Exposures: Resident-level characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, symptoms, chronic conditions, and physical and cognitive function. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death due to any cause within 30 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Results: The study included 5256 nursing home residents (3185 women [61%]; median age, 79 years [interquartile range, 69-88 years]; and 3741 White residents [71%], 909 Black residents [17%], and 586 individuals of other races/ethnicities [11%]) with COVID-19. Compared with residents aged 75 to 79 years, the odds of death were 1.46 (95% CI, 1.14-1.86) times higher for residents aged 80 to 84 years, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.25-2.03) times higher for residents aged 85 to 89 years, and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.70-2.69) times higher for residents aged 90 years or older. Women had lower risk for 30-day mortality than men (odds ratio [OR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.60-0.80]). Two comorbidities were associated with mortality: diabetes (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.05-1.40]) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.33 [95%, 1.11-1.61]). Fever (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.41-1.96]), shortness of breath (OR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.00-3.16]), tachycardia (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04-1.64]), and hypoxia (OR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.68-2.50]) were also associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality. Compared with cognitively intact residents, the odds of death among residents with moderate cognitive impairment were 2.09 (95% CI, 1.68-2.59) times higher, and the odds of death among residents with severe cognitive impairment were 2.79 (95% CI, 2.14-3.66) times higher. Compared with residents with no or limited impairment in physical function, the odds of death among residents with moderate impairment were 1.49 (95% CI, 1.18-1.88) times higher, and the odds of death among residents with severe impairment were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.30-2.08) times higher. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US nursing home residents with COVID-19, increased age, male sex, and impaired cognitive and physical function were independently associated with mortality. Understanding these risk factors can aid in the development of clinical prediction models of mortality in this population.","Panagiotou, Orestis A; Kosar, Cyrus M; White, Elizabeth M; Bantis, Leonidas E; Yang, Xiaofei; Santostefano, Christopher M; Feifer, Richard A; Blackman, Carolyn; Rudolph, James L; Gravenstein, Stefan; Mor, Vincent",JAMA intern. med.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it has been detected in nearly 200 countries and is an ongoing concern in the United States. Various reports provided anecdotal evidence that many ethnic minorities and specifically African Americans have become ill and died from COVID-19. Coincidentally, several states have provided data that at least initially corroborate the anecdotes. Narratives and descriptive data were compiled from medical and public health professionals to ascertain whether medical evidence supports the over-representation of state-level total infections and deaths of African Americans. The ramifications are critical for African Americans, non-medical professional, citizens, and also to the reduction and mitigation of the novel coronavirus as an American pandemic. The medical and health policy literature suggests that African Americans are burdened with a disproportionate share of persons contracting and dying due to COVID-19. Authors and witnesses believe that their occupation as essential workers, poverty, health access, government distrust, comorbidities, and Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are important factors for further research. For these reasons, federal funding of a rigorous and robust national public health study of COVID-19 and African Americans is highly recommended and the next logical step to develop mitigation strategies that reduce infection, mortality, and disparate medical outcomes.","Mangum, Vincent E",J Afr Am Stud (New Brunsw),,444

Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we estimate this effect - the treatment effect on the controls (ETC) - by re-weighting expansion regions to approximately balance the covariates from non-expansion regions using an extension of the stable balancing weights objective function (Zubizaretta (2015)). We contribute to the balancing weights literature by accounting for hierarchical data structure and covariate measurement error when calculating our weights, and to the synthetic controls literature (see, e.g. Abadie et al 2010) by outlining a set of assumptions that identifies the ETC using time-series cross-sectional data. We estimate that Medicaid expansion would have changed the uninsurance rate by -2.33 (-3.49, -1.16) percentage points. These results are smaller in absolute magnitude than existing estimates of the treatment effect on the treated (ETT), though may not be directly comparable due to the study design, target population, and level of analysis. Regardless, we caution against making inferences about the ETC using estimates of the ETT, and emphasize the need to directly estimate the appropriate counterfactual when they are the quantity of interest.","Rubinstein, Max; Haviland, Amelia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02381v2.pdf,444

363571,'The problem is greater than it's ever been': US universities urged to invest in mental-health resources,2021,"Introduction Metacognition, the ability to plan, monitor, and assess one's understanding and performance, has been shown to improve student learning outcomes. Anatomy is often recognized as one of the toughest courses in professional health care curricula, and students enrolled in such courses could potentially benefit from metacognitive activities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the changes in metacognition of allied health students as they progress through a gross anatomy course. Methods First-year physician assistant (PA), physical therapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT) students (n=129) participating in a doctoral-level anatomy course were invited to participate in this IRB-approved study. The course was conducted entirely online due to COVID and consisted of asynchronous lectures and virtual synchronous laboratory sessions. Students? anatomical knowledge was assessed with four exams. At the beginning and end of the course, students were invited to complete a de-identified pre-/post-survey including the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI), a 52-item survey that assesses metacognition. Pre- and post-MAI scores were analyzed in SPSS using Spearman's rho, Wilcoxon Signed Rank, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. Throughout the course, students were then asked to participate in reflective discussion boards to encourage development of metacognitive skills. Topics included study strategies, comprehension monitoring, exam reflections, and advice for future students. Discussion board posts were thematically analyzed by two researchers, with coding disagreements discussed to consensus. Results A total of 113 (88%) and 59 (46%) students completed the pre- and post-surveys, respectively, resulting in 52 matched pairs (40%). As a whole, students significantly increased their metacognition scores after completion of the course (p&lt;0.01). Several specific findings were noted, for example that PA students were found to monitor their learning less frequently compared to PTs and OTs (p=0.03). Discussion board participation ranged from 97% to 22%, with a steady decline over time. Qualitative analysis of discussion board posts revealed students reported changing their study strategies the most between Exams 1 and 2, after which they relied on existing strategies. Students frequently cited time constraints, time management, and volume of material as major factors that made anatomy difficult to learn. Indeed, students understood the educational value of the discussion boards but chose not to participate to prioritize studying the course content. Conclusion Overall, students were more receptive to metacognitive activities and modifying study strategies early in the course. As time progressed, receptiveness decreased, mainly due to time constraints. At this point, students tended to ?double-down? on strategies that worked previously rather than continuously monitor and modify their approach to studying. Significance To maximize effectiveness, metacognitive activities peripheral to the course content should be positioned early in the course when students are more receptive. Students will then be well-equipped to learn but can focus their limited time on course content.","Cale, Andrew McNulty Margaret",The FASEB Journal,,444

This study aimed to leverage the rapid implementation of telehealth due to COVID-19 to understand the perspectives of young people and clinicians on how telehealth impacts service delivery, service quality, and to develop pathways for future uses. Youth mental health service users (aged 12-25) and clinicians took part in an online survey exploring service provision, use, and quality following the adoption of telehealth. Service use data from the period were also examined. Ninety-two clinicians and 308 young people responded to the survey. Service use was reduced compared to the same period in 2019, however, attendance rates were higher. Across eight domains of service quality, the majority of young people reported that telehealth positively impacted service quality, and were significantly more likely to rate telehealth as having a positive impact on service quality than clinicians.

We highlight the conditions rooted in place that generate short- and long-term negative impacts for Latina immigrants' health. Fear and anxiety about the deportation of themselves and their family members make them ill and also generate apprehension about contacting medical institutions, driving, and spending time in public spaces. These circumstances coalesce in women's lives to block access to medical care and undermine women's roles in their communities. Following gendered expectations, women turn to their informal networks to seek health care for their families. In the context that the enforcement regime has created, these ties can turn exploitative.","Cervantes, Andrea Gómez; Menjívar, Cecilia",J Health Soc Behav,,444

In addition to demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural differences, hospital infrastructure and healthcare varies across all 27 federative units. Therefore, the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic did not manifest itself in a homogeneous and predictable trend across the nation. In late 2020 and early 2021, new waves of the COVID-19 outbreak have caused an unprecedented sanitary collapse in Brazil. Unlike the first COVID-19 wave, in subsequent waves, preliminary evidence has pointed to an increase in the daily reported cases among younger people being hospitalized, overloading the healthcare system. In this comprehensive retrospective study, confirmed cases of hospitalization, ICU admission, IMV requirement and in-hospital death from Brazilian COVID-19 patients throughout 2020 until the beginning of 2021 were analyzed through a spatio-temporal study for patients aged 20-59 years. All Brazilian federative units had their data disaggregated in six periods of ten epidemiological weeks each. We found that there is a wide variation in the waves dynamic due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in the first and in subsequent outbreaks in different federative units over the analyzed periods. As a result, atypical waves can be seen in the Brazil data as a whole. The analysis showed that Brazil is experiencing a numerical explosion of hospitalizations and deaths for patients aged 20-59 years, especially in the state of Sao Paulo, with a similar proportion of hospitalizations for this age group but higher proportion of deaths compared to the first wave.","Souza, Fernanda Sumika Hojo; Hojo-Souza, Natália Satchiko; Oliveira, Daniela Carine Ramires de; Silva, Cristiano Maciel da; Guidoni, Daniel Ludovico",,,444

Asthma does not represent a risk factor for COVID-19 in several published cohorts. We hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains T cell epitopes, which are potentially cross-reactive to allergen epitopes. We aimed at identifying homologous peptide sequences by means of two distinct complementary bioinformatics approaches. Pipeline 1 included prediction of MHC Class I and Class II epitopes contained in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and allergens along with alignment and elaborate ranking approaches. Pipeline 2 involved alignment of SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptides with known allergen-derived T cell epitopes. Our results indicate a large number of MHC Class I epitope pairs including known as well as de novo predicted allergen T cell epitopes with high probability for cross-reactivity. Allergen sources, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Phleum pratense and Dermatophagoides species are of particular interest due to their association with multiple cross-reactive candidate peptides, independently of the applied bioinformatic approach. In contrast, peptides derived from food allergens, as well as MHC class II epitopes did not achieve high in silico ranking and were therefore not further investigated. Our findings warrant further experimental confirmation along with examination of the functional importance of such cross-reactive responses.","Balz, Kathrin; Kaushik, Abhinav; Chen, Meng; Cemic, Franz; Heger, Vanessa; Renz, Harald; Nadeau, Kari; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Sci Rep,,444

375050,A Path Forward: Mental Health and the U.S. Pandemic Response,2021,"Emission from Saggitarius A* is highly variable at both X-ray and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Observations over the last ~20 yr have revealed X-ray flares that rise above a quiescent thermal background about once per day, while faint X-ray flares from Sgr A* are undetectable below the constant thermal emission. In contrast, the IR emission of Sgr A* is observed to be continuously variable. Recently, simultaneous observations have indicated a rise in IR flux density around the same time as every distinct X-ray flare, while the opposite is not always true (peaks in the IR emission may not be coincident with an X-ray flare). Characterizing the behavior of these simultaneous X-ray/IR events and measuring any time lag between them can constrain models of Sgr A*'s accretion flow and the flare emission mechanism. Using 100+ hours of data from a coordinated campaign between the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we present results of the longest simultaneous IR and X-ray observations of Sgr A* taken to date. The cross-correlation between the IR and X-ray light curves in this unprecedented data set, which includes four modest X-ray/IR flares, indicates that flaring in the X-ray may lead the IR by approximately 10-20 min with 68% confidence. However, the 99.7% confidence interval on the time-lag also includes zero, i.e., the flaring remains statistically consistent with simultaneity. Long-duration and simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of additional bright flares will improve our ability to constrain the flare timing characteristics and emission mechanisms, and must be a priority for Galactic Center observing campaigns.","Boyce, H; Haggard, D; Witzel, G; Willner, S P; Neilsen, J; Hora, J L; Markoff, S; Ponti, G; Baganoff, F; Becklin, E E; Fazio, G G; Lowrance, P; Morris, M R; Smith, H A",,,444
375051,A Path Forward: Mental Health and the U.S. Pandemic Response,2021,"Social and technical trends have significantly changed methods for evaluating and disseminating computing research. Traditional venues for reviewing and publishing, such as conferences and journals, worked effectively in the past. Recently, trends have created new opportunities but also put new pressures on the process of review and dissemination. For example, many conferences have seen large increases in the number of submissions. Likewise, dissemination of research ideas has become dramatically through publication venues such as arXiv.org and social media networks. While these trends predate COVID-19, the pandemic could accelerate longer term changes. Based on interviews with leading academics in computing research, our findings include: (1) Trends impacting computing research are largely positive and have increased the participation, scope, accessibility, and speed of the research process. (2) Challenges remain in securing the integrity of the process, including addressing ways to scale the review process, avoiding attempts to misinform or confuse the dissemination of results, and ensuring fairness and broad participation in the process itself. Based on these findings, we recommend: (1) Regularly polling members of the computing research community, including program and general conference chairs, journal editors, authors, reviewers, etc., to identify specific challenges they face to better understand these issues. (2) An influential body, such as the Computing Research Association regularly issues a""State of the Computing Research Enterprise""report to update the community on trends, both positive and negative, impacting the computing research enterprise.

During the COVID-19 pandemic the question arises if laparoscopy, as an aerosol forming procedure, poses a potential risk for viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers. Methods. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE. Articles reporting information regarding COVID-19 or other relevant viruses and laparoscopy, surgical smoke, aerosols and viral transmission were included. Results. Although aerosols produced during laparoscopy do not originate from the respiratory tract, the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, research did show SARS-CoV-2 to be present in other body fluids. The transmission risk via this route is however considered very low. As previous research showed potential viral transmission during laparoscopy for viruses that spread through contaminated body fluids, there might be a potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during laparoscopy, albeit considered very small. Conclusion. Due to the small risk compared to widely known benefits of laparoscopy, there is no reason to replace laparoscopy by laparotomy due to COVID-19 infection. To avoid the potential small risk of viral transmission, additional safety measures are advised.","Tummers, Fokkedien Hmp; Draaisma, Werner A; Demirkiran, Ahmet; Brouwer, Tammo A; Lagerveld, Brunolf W; van Schrojenstein Lantman, Esther S; Spijkers, Klaartje; Coppus, Sjors Fpj; Jansen, Frank Willem",Surg Innov,,444
377457,Initial Training for Mental Health Peer Support Workers: Systematized Review and International Delphi Consultation,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emerged the necessity of the identification of sequences sites in viral proteome appropriate as antigenic sites and treatment targets. In the present study, we apply a novel approach for deciphering the virus-host organism interaction, by analyzing the Unique Peptides of the virus with a minimum amino acid sequence length defined as Core Unique Peptides (CrUPs) not of the virus per se, but against the entire proteome of the host organism. The result of this approach is the identification of the CrUPs of the virus itself, which do not appear in the host organism proteome. Thereby, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for identification of CrUPs against the Human Proteome and they are defined as C/H-CrUPs. We found that SARS-CoV-2 include 7.503 C/H-CrUPs, with the SPIKE_SARS2 being the protein with the highest density of C/H-CrUPs. Extensive analysis indicated that the P681R mutation produces new C/H-CrUPs around the R685 cleavage site, while the L452R mutation induces the loss of antigenicity of the NF9 peptide and the strong(er) binding of the virus to ACE2 receptor protein. The simultaneous existence of these mutations in variants like Delta results in the immune escape of the virus, its massive entrance into the host cell, a notable increase in virus formation, and its massive release and thus elevated infectivity.","Pierros, Vasileios; Kontopodis, Evangelos; Stravopodis, Dimitrios; Tsangaris, George Theodore",,,444
384427,COVID-19 lockdown: A perfect storm for older people's mental health,2020,"BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, the number of octogenarians requiring primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasing. Recently, primary TKA has become a common treatment option in octogenarians. However, surgeons may still be hesitant about performing revision TKA on octogenarians because of concern about risk and cost benefit. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes, postoperative complications, and mid-term lifetime survival in octogenarians after primary and revision TKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 231 primary TKAs and 41 revision TKAs performed on octogenarians between 2000 and 2016. The mean age of patients undergoing primary TKA was 81.9 years and that of patients undergoing revision TKA was 82.3 years (p = 0.310). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index was higher in revision TKA (4.4 vs. 4.8, p = 0.003). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The incidence of postoperative complications (TKA-related, specific or systemic) and lifetime survival rate (endpoint death determined by telephone or mail communication with patient or family) were investigated. RESULTS: The WOMAC and ROM improved significantly after primary and revision TKA, although postoperative results were worse in the revision group (33.1 vs. 47.2; 128.9° vs. 113.6°; p < 0.001, respectively). There were no cases of aseptic or septic component failure in either group. One case of periprosthetic fracture was observed in the revision group (0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.151), and three cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) (one case of DVT and two cases of PTE) were observed in the primary group (1.3% vs. 0%, p = 1.000). The most common systemic complication in both groups was delirium (7.4% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.131). There were no differences between the two groups in the other systemic complication rates. The 5-year and 10-year lifetime survival rates were 87.2% and 62.9%, respectively, in primary TKA and 82.1% and 42.2%, respectively, in revision TKA (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Both primary and revision TKA are viable options for octogenarians, based on the satisfactory clinical outcomes, TKA-related complication rates, and mid-term lifetime survival. Delirium needs to be managed appropriately as the most common systemic complication in both primary and revision TKA in octogenarians.

385629,"As outpatient services decline, telehealth rises for SMI patients",2021,"In swine and nonhuman primates, kidney allografts can induce tolerance of heart allografts, leading to their long-term, immunosuppression-free survival. We refer to this phenomenon as kidney-induced cardiac allograft tolerance (KICAT). In this study, we have developed a murine model for KICAT to determine the underlining cellular/molecular mechanisms. Here, we show that spontaneously accepted DBA/2J kidneys in C57BL/6 recipients induce systemic tolerance that results in the long-term acceptance of DBA/2J heart allografts but not third-party cardiac allografts. The state of systemic tolerance of hearts was established 2 weeks after transplantation of the kidney, after which time, the kidney allograft is no longer required. Depletion of Foxp3+ T cells from these mice precipitated rejection of the heart allografts, indicating that KICAT is dependent on Treg function. Acceptance of kidney allografts and cotransplanted heart allografts did not require the thymus. In conclusion, these data show that kidney allografts induce systemic, donor-specific tolerance of cardiac allografts via Foxp3 cells, and that tolerance is independent of the thymus and continued presence of the kidney allograft. This experimental system should promote increased understanding of the tolerogenic mechanisms of the kidney.","Yang, Chao; Ge, Jifu; Rosales, Ivy; Yuan, Qing; Szuter, Edward; Acheampong, Ellen; Russell, Paul S; Madsen, Joren C; Colvin, Robert B; Alessandrini, Alessandro",JCI insight,,444

In order to improve psychological safety in healthcare teams, an in-depth understanding of the complex and nuanced nature of psychological safety is needed. Psychological safety concepts, including voice, silence, learning behaviour, support and familiarity, informed the current study's investigation of psychological safety. This study aims to use a mixed-methods approach to develop an in-depth understanding of psychological safety within healthcare teams and to build on this understanding to inform the development of future interventions to improve it. METHODS: Survey, observational and interview data are triangulated in order to develop an in- depth understanding of psychological safety within four healthcare teams, working within one case study hospital. The teams taking part included one multidisciplinary and three unidisciplinary teams. Observational and survey data were collected during and immediately following team meetings. Individual interviews were conducted with 31 individuals across the four teams. Thematic analysis was used to analyse these interviews. RESULTS: Survey results indicated a high level of psychological safety. However, observations and interviews captured examples of silence and situations where participants felt less psychologically safe. Findings from across all three data sources are discussed in relation to voice and silence, learning, familiarity and support. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide a detailed description and in-depth understanding of psychological safety within four healthcare teams.

The effect is present only in the rich countries, as well as in countries with the highest pandemic death toll (where it disappears only after 8 years) and in countries that were hit by the pandemic during economic recessions. We found that the past pandemics increased the share of electricity generated from renewable sources within the fiveyear horizon by 1.9-2.3 percentage points in the OECD countries and by 3.2-3.9 percentage points in countries experiencing economic recessions.

Recent research has demonstrated that young adults, including young Jews, have experienced higher rates of mental health difficulties than older individuals during the pandemic. Using data from a survey of Jewish young adults who applied to participate in Birthright Israel summer 2020 trips but were unable to participate due to the pandemic, we examined the factors contributing to young adults' mental health difficulties. We found that loneliness, rather than financial worries or concerns about the health impacts of COVID-19, was the single most important driver of reported emotional or mental health difficulties. Results also suggested that simply increasing the frequency of contacts between individuals is unlikely to reduce loneliness, unless these are positive, substantial connections, such as those among members of a ""social support network."" Building and rebuilding deep, meaningful social connections between Jewish young adults should be a top priority for Jewish organizations going forward.","Wright, Graham; Volodarsky, Sasha; Hecht, Shahar; Saxe, Leonard",Contemp Jew,,444
392229,Back to normality with full capacity,2021,"The spread of COVID-19 has sparked racism, hate, and xenophobia in social media targeted at Chinese and broader Asian communities. However, little is known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic and the role of counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over 87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another, instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place. Overall, this work presents a comprehensive overview of anti-Asian hate and counterhate content during a pandemic.

Several emerging studies have produced varying results; this systematic review aims to provide a more accurate estimate of the incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: For this systematic review, a literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Scopus/EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering all observational and experimental studies reporting the incubation period and published from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2020.We estimated the mean and 95th percentile of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. RESULTS: We included seven studies (N= 792) in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity (I2 83.0%, p< 0.001)was significantly decreased when we included the study quality and the statistical model used as moderator variables (I2 15%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.6 (95%CI: 5.2 to 6.0) to 6.7 days (95% CI: 6.0 to 7.4) according to the statistical model. The 95th percentile was 12.5 days when the mean age of patients was 60 years, increasing 1 day for every 10 years. CONCLUSION: Based on the published data reporting the incubation period of COVID-19, the mean time between exposure and onset of clinical symptoms depended on the statistical model used, and the 95th percentile depended on the mean age of the patients. It is advisable to record sex and age when collecting data in order to analyze possible differential patterns.","Quesada, J A; López-Pineda, A; Gil-Guillén, V F; Arriero-Marín, J M; Gutiérrez, F; Carratala-Munuera, C",Rev. clin. esp.

Moreover, prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes in children. OBJECTIVES: Assess prenatal exposure to GDM on anxiety levels and physical activity in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Sixty-five children age 9 to 15 reported their physical activity and anxiety levels using the 24-hours physical activity recall and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children via phone or video meetings. Prenatal exposure to GDM was obtained from maternal electronic medical records. RESULTS: The 38 GDM-exposed children reported significantly higher anxiety levels and were less likely to engage in any vigorous physical activity (VPA) (5% vs 30%) compared to the 27 GDM-unexposed children. Lower levels of physical activity were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety. Less engagement in VPA explained 75% of the association between GDM exposure and anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly amongst GDM-exposed children.","Alves, Jasmin M; Yunker, Alexandra G; DeFendis, Alexis; Xiang, Anny H; Page, Kathleen A",Clin Obes,,444

The objectives herein were to assess the differences in anxiety levels between these populations and to detect factors that may influence them. The anxiety levels (measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale) of the HP and PCP groups were compared using data collected from a cross-sectional study. The secondary variables included demographic and health data, confinement factors, contact with COVID-19 patients, having suffered from COVID-19, perceptions of protection, caregiver overload, threat, and satisfaction with management. We found anxiety ""case"" (35.6%) and ""at-risk"" (21%), with statistically significant differences in the group ""at risk"", and higher scores in the PCP group. The factors associated with the perception of threat and protection were significant determinants of an increase in anxiety, with all of them showing statistically significant differences. There were greater symptoms of anxiety in the PCP group than the HP group (32% vs. 18%). The factors associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms were the perceptions of threat, protection, management, caregiver overload, and perceived degree of threat associated with COVID-19.","Londoño-Ramírez, Ana C; García-Pla, Sandro; Bernabeu-Juan, Purificación; Pérez-Martínez, Enrique; Rodríguez-Marín, Jesús; van-der Hofstadt-Román, Carlos J",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,444

The study team sought to compare real-time assay results with panspecies conventional molecular diagnostics to compare sensitivities and learn if novel viruses had been missed. Methods: Specimens were studied for evidence of adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV) and coronavirus (CoV) with panspecies gel-based nested PCR/RT-PCR assays. Gene sequences of specimens positive by panspecies assays were sequenced and studied with the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software. Results: There was considerable discordance between real-time and conventional molecular methods. The real-time AdV assay found a positivity of 10.4%; however, the AdV panspecies assay detected a positivity of 12.4% and the conventional AdV-Hexon assay detected a positivity of 19.6%. The CoV and EV panspecies assays similarly detected more positive specimens than the real-time assays, with a positivity of 7.8% by the CoV panspecies assay versus 4.2% by rRT-PCR, and 8.0% by the EV panspecies assay versus 1.0% by rRT-PCR. We were not able to ascertain virus viability in this setting. While most discordance was likely due to assay sensitivity for previously described human viruses, two novel, possible zoonotic AdV were detected. Conclusions: The observed differences in the two modes of amplification suggest that where a problem with sensitivity is suspected, real-time assay results might be supplemented with panspecies conventional PCR/RT-PCR assays.","Fieldhouse, Jane K; Bailey, Emily S; Toh, Teck-Hock; Hii, King-Ching; Mallinson, Kerry A; Ting, Jakie; Lednicky, John A; Berita, Antoinette; Nguyen, Tham Thi; Galan, Diego; Than, Son T; Wong, See-Chang; Wong, Toh-Mee; Blair, Patrick J; Gray, Gregory C",Trop Dis Travel Med Vaccines,,444

First identified in November/December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread worldwide. We analyzed 2790 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 56 countries that were available on April 2, 2020, to assess the evolution of the virus during this early phase of its expansion. We aimed to assess sequence variations that had evolved in virus genomes, giving the greatest attention to the S gene. We also aimed to identify haplotypes that the variations may define and consider their geographic and chronologic distribution. Variations at 1930 positions that together cause 1203 amino acid changes were identified. The frequencies of changes normalized to the lengths of genes and encoded proteins were relatively high in ORF3a and relatively low in M. A variation that causes an Asp614Gly near the receptor-binding domain of S were found at a high frequency, and it was considered that this may contribute to the rapid spread of viruses with this variation. Our most important findings relate to haplotypes. Sixty-six haplotypes that constitute thirteen haplotype groups (H1-H13) were identified, and 84.6% of the 2790 sequences analyzed were associated with these haplotypes. The majority of the sequences (75.1%) were associated with haplotype groups H1-H3. The distribution pattern of the haplotype groups differed in various geographic regions. A few were country/territory specific. The location and time of emergence of some haplotypes are discussed. Importantly, nucleotide variations that define the various haplotypes and Tag/signature variations for most of the haplotypes are reported. The practical applications of these variations are discussed.","Safari, Iman; InanlooRahatloo, Kolsoum; Elahi, Elahe",J. med. virol,,444

The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge of symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID-19, stress levels and clinical practice modifications of Turkish dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey (15 questions) was sent to Turkish dentists from May 5 to 12 May, 2020. The survey comprised questions about dentists' demographic characteristics, their knowledge about COVID-19, stress levels and the measures taken in dental clinics against COVID-19. This study included a total of 1,095 Turkish dentists. The data were expressed as frequency with percentage values for overall variables. Dentists were most familiar with high fever among the symptoms of COVID-19 (99.4%) and 99.2% of them reported that COVID-19 was transmitted with eye, mouth and nasal mucosa contact on surfaces contaminated with the droplets of infected persons. While the stress levels of females were higher than males, the stress levels of dentists with more than 20 years of professional experience were found to be lower. Regarding the precautions to be taken as a preventive measure when working again, 86.6% of the dentists took precautions by increasing daily patient care intervals and only 38.4% of the dentists wore an N95 mask. During this pandemic, knowing the conditions about when the treatments can be applied and the precautions to be taken will shed light on dentistry staff.

The TiO2 sensor exhibits under UV illumination highly selective detection of formaldehyde and ethanol with negligible cross-responses to other indoor pollutants. The coating of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) composed of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-7) nanoparticles and polymers on TiO2 sensing films removed ethanol interference completely by molecular sieving, enabling an ultrahigh selectivity (response ratio > 50) and response (resistance ratio > 1,100) to 5 ppm formaldehyde at room temperature. Furthermore, a monolithic and flexible sensor is fabricated successfully using a TiO2 film sandwiched between a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate and MMM overlayer.

The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike proteins are large trimers that are relatively unstable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 for prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike proteins. Here, we test multiple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike proteins with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, proline mutations, or a combination thereof, besides the wild-type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the K986P and V987P (PP) mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.IMPORTANCE A vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validate the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutations and suggest that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site may lead to a further-optimized design.","Amanat, Fatima; Strohmeier, Shirin; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Schotsaert, Michael; Coughlan, Lynda; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Krammer, Florian",mBio (Online),,444

The unique properties of several fluorinated ionic liquids (FILs), such as their high surfactant power in aqueous solutions, their chemical and biological stability, and low toxicity, favor their application in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the numerous combinations between cations and anions, in the FILs design, enlarge the possibilities to construct a successful delivery system. Several FILs also proved to not affect the activity, stability, and secondary structure of the therapeutic protein lysozyme. This work aims to study the aggregation behavior of distinct FILs in the protein suitable medium, in the presence or absence of lysozyme. Besides, different incubation conditions were tested to guarantee the optimal enzymatic activity of the protein at more stable delivery systems. Following the optimization of the incubation conditions, the quantification of the encapsulated lysozyme was performed to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency of each FIL-based system. The release of the protein was tested applying variables such as time, temperature, and ultrasound frequency. The experimental results suggest that the aggregation behavior of FILs is not significantly influenced by the protein and/or protein buffer and supports their application for the design of delivery systems with high encapsulation efficiencies, maintaining the biological activity of either encapsulated and released protein.","Vieira, N S M; Castro, P J; Marques, D F; Araújo, J M M; Pereiro, A B",,,444

In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management. PURPOSE: This commentary aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Nicholls, Stephen J; Redfern, Julie; Brown, Alex; Hare, David L",Heart Lung Circ,,444

Characterization of films using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and various microscopies shows that the films obtained through the two different routes vary in their retained BDBA proportion, crystal size and macroscale morphology. Gas adsorption measurements give specific surface areas of 579 ± 7 m2/g and 739 ± 11 m2/g respectively, suggesting that the average porosity of these films is competitive with bulk-synthesized COF-1 particles. The films have a stratified structure, with a dense, thin top layer and a thicker, sponge-like base layer. Using nanoindentation, we measured the Young's modulus at the top surface of the SVA and SA films to be 3.64 ± 1.20 GPa and 3.33 ± 0.12 GPa respectively, with the smaller uncertainty for the SA film attributed to a more uniform morphology. These measurements provide useful experimental data pertaining to COF-1 mechanical properties, furnishing information relevant to the use of these free-standing membranes in applications such as gas filtration or storage.","Turangan, Nikka; Xu, Yanan; Spratt, Henry; Rintoul, Llew; Bottle, Steven; MacLeod, Jennifer",,,444
439990,APA: Country's unpredictability causing stress across the aisle,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping across the globe, public health systems worldwide faced severe challenges. Amid the pandemic, one simulation game, Plague Inc., has received substantial attention. This game has indirectly drawn greater public attention to public health issues by simulating pathogen transmission and disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Against this backdrop, this research investigates whether the gameful experience of Plague Inc. has indirectly affected public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was conducted through social networking services in Taiwan from May 6-28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 486 subjects participated in this study, of which 276 (56.8%) had played Plague Inc. This study had several findings. First, participants who had played Plague Inc. demonstrated higher levels of knowledge (P=.03, median 7, IQR 7-8) and attitudes (P=.007, median 8, IQR 7-8) than participants who had not played Plague Inc. (knowledge: median 7, IQR 6-8; attitude: median 7, IQR 6-8). Second, there was a significant correlation between creative thinking (&#961;=.127, P=.04) and dominance (&#961;=.122, P=.04) in attitude. Finally, there was a significant correlation between creative thinking (&#961;=.126, P<.001) and dominance (&#961;=.119, P=.049) in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Serious games highlighting the theme of pathogen transmission may enhance public knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19. Furthermore, the creative thinking and dominance involved in gameful experiences may act as critical factors in public attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19. These findings should be further verified through experimental research in the future.","Peng, Li-Hsun; Bai, Ming-Han",JMIR Serious Games,,444
440161,Improving Predictions of COVID-19 Preventive Behavior: Development of a Sequential Mediation Model,2021,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. We show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by human and mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 restriction occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation, indicating a restrictive capacity distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx&#934; motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into infection enhancers. In sum, we uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal SARS-CoV-2 restriction.","Shi, Guoli; Kenney, Adam D; Kudryashova, Elena; Zani, Ashley; Zhang, Lizhi; Lai, Kin Kui; Hall-Stoodley, Luanne; Robinson, Richard T; Kudryashov, Dmitri S; Compton, Alex A; Yount, Jacob S",EMBO J,,444
441601,Assessing Mental Health in Emerging Adulthood through a Mental Health Navigator: A Study Protocol,2021,"This article draws on the research project Post-abortion narratives shared by Perth women via face-to-face interviews. The project was subsequently disrupted by the arrival of COVID-19 in Perth, Australia, making it necessary to conduct interviews via video call. The experience of using an online platform to conduct interviews became an opportunity to consider more carefully the practice of ‘deep listening’. This kind of listening involves creating an emotional connection with the participant so that the interviewer is able to hear multiple layers of meaning and context. It includes listening mixed with perception in which one can hear the emotions of the other. In a paradigm where the interview is seen as an interaction between two embodied individuals and the interviewer herself is the instrument of research, this article examines the communication that occurs in the space between two co-present, embodied individuals and explicates the practice of deep listening. While interviewing via video call is an excellent tool, I argue that a layer of meaning is removed by the technological medium, which impacts the researcher relationship and thus the ability to listen deeply.

Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Albania,2020,"The relationship between the SLC31A1 (protein: copper transporter 1) rs10981694 A > C and ATP7B (protein: P-type adenosine triphosphatase 7B) rs9535828 A > G polymorphisms on the overall survival and disease-free survival of 104 Japanese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was investigated. Chemotherapy consisted of protracted infusion of 5-fluoracil (800 mg/m2/day) on days 1-5 and cisplatin or nedaplatin (80 mg/m2/day) on day 1. The median (range) follow-up was 47 (6-127) months. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 71.2% and 60.6%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients with the SLC31A1 rs10981694 C allele compared with the rs10981694 A/A genotype (91.7% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.018). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly higher in patients with the SLC31A1 rs10981694 C allele compared with the rs10981694 A/A genotype (79.2% vs. 55.0%, P = 0.043). In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses showed the SLC31A1 rs10981694 A > C polymorphism to be a significant prognostic factor affecting 5-year overall survival after neoadjuvant CRT. However, the overall and disease-free survival rates after surgery did not differ significantly among the ATP7B rs9535828 genotypes. In conclusion, only the SLC31A1 rs10981694 A/A genotype was an independent predictor of a poorer 5-year overall survival. Therefore, in neoadjuvant CRT for ESCC patients, the effect of platinum was affected by the SLC31A1 rs10981694 A > C polymorphism. The presence of this polymorphism should be considered when devising neoadjuvant CRT regimens or treatment strategies for ESCC.","Fujita, Kazuma; Motoyama, Satoru; Sato, Yusuke; Wakita, Akiyuki; Nagaki, Yushi; Minamiya, Yoshihiro; Miura, Masatomo",Med Oncol,,444

Methods: Our eye health pyramid model has a network of eye care centers in four Indian states. The network constitutes a center of excellence (CoE) at the apex followed by tertiary care centers (TC) located in urban areas, secondary care centers (SC), and primary care vision centers (VC) at the base located in rural areas. We collected data on patients seen between June 2019 and June 2020, which included age, gender, total patients seen (new or follow-up), and socioeconomic status (paying and nonpaying). A comparative study was done between the data for outpatients and surgeries performed pre-COVID-19 and during Unlock-I in COVID-19 period. Results: There was a 36.71% reduction in the overall outpatients seen in June 2020 (n = 83,161) compared to June 2019 (n = 131,395). The reduction was variable across different levels of the pyramid with the highest reduction in CoE (54.18%), followed by TCs (40.37%), SCs (30.49%) and VCs (18.85%). Similar pattern was seen for new paying patients with the highest reduction in CoE (54.22%), followed by TCs (25.86%) and SCs (4.9%). A 43.67% reduction was noted in the surgeries performed in June 2020 (n = 6,168), compared to June 2019 (n = 10,950).

Moreover, traveling by public transport during a pandemic is a concerning factor, and analysis of the vehicle’s cabin environments could demonstrate how to decrease the risk and create a safer journey for passengers. Therefore, this article presents airflow analysis, air changes per hour (ACH), and respiration aerosols’ trajectory inside three vehicles, including a typical car, bus, and airplane. In this regard, three vehicles’ cabin environment boundary conditions and the HVAC systems of the selected vehicles were determined, and three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling. The analysis of the airflow patterns and aerosol trajectories in the selected vehicles demonstrate the critical impact of inflow, outflow, and passenger’s locations in the cabins. The CFD model results exhibited that the lowest risk could be in the airplane and the highest in the bus because of the location of airflows and outflows. The discrete CFD model analysis determined the ACH for a typical car of about 4.3, a typical bus of about 7.5, and in a typical airplane of about 8.5, which were all less than the standard protocol of infection prevention, 12 ACH. According to the results, opening windows in the cars could decrease the aerosol loads and improve the low ACH by the HVAC systems. However, for the buses, a new design for the outflow location or an increase in the number of outflows appeared necessary. In the case of airplanes, the airflow paths were suitable, and by increasing the airflow speed, the required ACH might be achieved. Finally, in the closed (recirculating) systems, the role of filters in decreasing the risk appeared critical.","Pirouz, Behrouz Mazzeo Domenico Palermo Stefania Anna Seyed Navid Naghib Turco Michele Piro Patrizia",Sustainability,,444
466847,Reintegrating droperidol into emergency medicine practice,2020,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has begun to infect people. The virus first occurred in Wuhan, China, but the whole world is now struggling with the pandemic. Over 13 million confirmed cases and 571,000 deaths have been reported so far, and this number is growing. Older people, who constitute a notable proportion of the world population, are at an increased risk of infection because of altered immunity and chronic comorbidities. Thus, appropriate health care is necessary to control fatalities and spread of the disease in this specific population. The chapter provides an overview of diagnostic methods, laboratory and imaging findings, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 in aged people. Possible mechanisms behind the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly include immunosenescence and related impaired antiviral immunity, mature immunity and related hyper-inflammatory responses, comorbidities and their effects on the functioning of critical organs/systems, and the altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This evidence defines the herding behavior of COVID-19 in relation to ACE2 under the influence of immune dysregulation. Then, identifying the immunogenetic factors that affect the disease susceptibility and severity and as well as key inflammatory pathways that have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets needs to remain an active area of research.","Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,444

Using National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data from January 6, 2019-September 6, 2020, CDC tabulated weekly numbers of emergency department (ED) visits related to child abuse and neglect and calculated the proportions of such visits per 100,000 ED visits, as well as the percentage of suspected or confirmed ED visits related to child abuse and neglect ending in hospitalization, overall and stratified by age group (0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). The total number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect began decreasing below the corresponding 2019 period during week 11 (March 15-March 22, 2020) for all age groups examined, coinciding with the declaration of a national emergency on March 13 (2); simultaneously, the proportion of these visits per 100,000 ED visits began increasing above the 2019 baseline for all age groups. Despite decreases in the weekly number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect, the weekly number of these visits resulting in hospitalization remained stable in 2020; however, the yearly percentage of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect resulting in hospitalization increased significantly among all age groups. Although the increased proportion of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect might be associated with a decrease in the overall number of ED visits, these findings also suggest that health care-seeking patterns have shifted during the pandemic. Hospitalizations for child abuse and neglect did not decrease in 2020, suggesting that injury severity did not decrease during the pandemic, despite decreased ED visits. Child abuse is preventable; implementation of strategies including strengthening household economic supports and creating family-friendly work policies can reduce stress during difficult times and increase children's opportunities to thrive in safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments (3).","Swedo, Elizabeth; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Leemis, Ruth; Dias, Taylor; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; Stein, Zachary; Chen, May; Agathis, Nickolas; Holland, Kristin",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,444

492691,A Clarion Call for Nurses and the Profession of Nursing,2021,"The spatio-temporal dynamics of an outbreak provide important insights to help direct public health resources intended to control transmission. They also provide a focus for detailed epidemiological studies and allow the timing and impact of interventions to be assessed.A common approach is to aggregate case data to administrative regions. Whilst providing a good visual impression of change over space, this method masks spatial variation and assumes that disease risk is constant across space. Risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. population density, deprivation and ethnicity) vary from place to place across England so it follows that risk will also vary spatially. Kernel density estimation compares the spatial distribution of cases relative to the underlying population, unfettered by arbitrary geographical boundaries, to produce a continuous estimate of spatially varying risk.Using test results from healthcare settings in England (Pillar 1 of the UK Government testing strategy) and freely available methods and software, we estimated the spatial and spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 infection across England for the first 6 months of 2020. Widespread transmission was underway when partial lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March 2020 and the greatest risk erred towards large urban areas. The rapid growth phase of the outbreak coincided with multiple introductions to England from the European mainland. The spatio-temporal risk was highly labile throughout.In terms of controlling transmission, the most important practical application of our results is the accurate identification of areas within regions that may require tailored intervention strategies. We recommend that this approach is absorbed into routine surveillance outputs in England. Further risk characterisation using widespread community testing (Pillar 2) data is needed as is the increased use of predictive spatial models at fine spatial scales.","Elson, Richard; Davies, Tilman M; Lake, Iain R; Vivancos, Roberto; Blomquist, Paula B; Charlett, Andre; Dabrera, Gavin",Epidemiol Infect,,444

For a greater research project to be developed in the future, a pilot study was done, where 165 Venezuelan students were asked in a survey to rate their agreement with conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Although the majority of subjects were skeptical of these claims, the percentage of acceptance of COVID-19 conspiracy theories was still fairly high, if compared to other medical conspiracy theories. Educational level was not a significant predictive factor in acceptance of these conspiracy theories. Acceptance of other conspiracy theories has a significant relation, but only if they cohere with ideological positioning in the Venezuelan context. Likewise, ethnicity also correlated with belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, but again, mediated by political alignments in the Venezuelan context.","ANDRADE, GABRIEL",Rev. colomb. psicol,,444

502221,The Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing in a Representative Sample of Australian Adults,2020,"BACKGROUND: In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, mental health-related burden and associated adverse outcomes are quite prevalent. However, exploration of sleep-related issues in general, and more specifically of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been scarce and restricted to a single location. The present study investigated the prevalence of insomnia and its predictive factors in the general population, and included Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify regional heterogeneities of insomnia in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Information related to socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behaviors related to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, and insomnia were included in a questionnaire, and coupled with GIS-based spatial analysis to identify regional susceptibility to insomnia. RESULTS: Approximately 30.4%, 13.1% and 2.8% of participants reported sub-threshold, moderate, and severe forms of insomnia, respectively. Independent predictive risk factors of insomnia symptoms included female gender, college education, urban residence, presence of comorbidities, using social media, taking naps during daytime, and fear of COVID-19. District-wide variations in the spatial distribution of fear of COVID-19 and insomnia were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Insomnia is frequently present during a pandemic, and exhibits regional variability along with multifactorial determinants. These analytic approaches should enable improved detection and targeting of at-risk sectors of the population, and enable implementation of appropriate measures to ensure improved sleep quality.","Al Mamun, Firoj; Gozal, David; Hosen, Ismail; Misti, Jannatul Mawa; Mamun, Mohammed A",Sleep medicine,,444

We investigated the association between the C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR) and in-hospital mortality in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. A total of 176 patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. The CAR was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect independent predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. A cutoff value of CAR was obtained for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for survival analysis in the study population. The CAR values were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors with hypertension. Moreover, the CAR was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in patients with hypertensive COVID-19, as shown in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cutoff value of 20.75 for the CAR for predicting in-hospital death in patients with hypertension. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients with hypertensive COVID-19 with a CAR value of &#8805;20.75 had a higher incidence of in-hospital death.

512194,May is Mental Health Awareness Month,2021,"INTRODUCTION: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5-92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8-74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9-80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0-30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7-51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1-9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2-21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Cardona-Ospina, Jaime A; Gutiérrez-Ocampo, Estefanía; Villamizar-Peña, Rhuvi; Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer; Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo; Alvarado-Arnez, Lucia Elena; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Franco-Paredes, Carlos; Henao-Martinez, Andrés F; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Lagos-Grisales, Guillermo J; Ramírez-Vallejo, Eduardo; Suárez, Jose A; Zambrano, Lysien I; Villamil-Gómez, Wilmer E; Balbin-Ramon, Graciela J; Rabaan, Ali A; Harapan, Harapan; Dhama, Kuldeep; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Kataoka, Hiromitsu; Ahmad, Tauseef; Sah, Ranjit",Travel Med Infect Dis,,444

GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit coronavirus replication. Treatment with the GABAA-R-specific agonist homotaurine, but not the GABAB-R-specific agonist baclofen, significantly reduced the severity of pneumonitis and death rates in MHV-1-infected mice, indicating that the therapeutic effects were mediated primarily through GABAA-Rs.

514128,Multiphasic process model of interventions: Revisiting school-based mental health provider responses to student's mental health in the wake of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The major medical and social challenge of the 21st century is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Critical issues include the rate at which the coronavirus spreads and the effect of quarantine measures and population vaccination on this rate. Knowledge of the laws of the spread of COVID-19 will enable assessment of the effectiveness and reasonableness of the quarantine measures used, as well as determination of the necessary level of vaccination needed to overcome this crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish the laws of the spread of COVID-19 and to use them to develop a mathematical model to predict changes in the number of active cases over time, possible human losses, and the rate of recovery of patients, to make informed decisions about the number of necessary beds in hospitals, the introduction and type of quarantine measures, and the required threshold of vaccination of the population. METHODS: This study analyzed the onset of COVID-19 spread in countries such as China, Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany based on publicly available statistical data. The change in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered persons over time was examined, considering the possible introduction of quarantine measures and isolation of infected people in these countries. Based on the data, the virus transmissibility and the average duration of the disease at different stages were evaluated, and a model based on the principle of recursion was developed. Its key features are the separation of active (nonisolated) infected persons into a distinct category and the prediction of their number based on the average duration of the disease in the inactive phase and the concentration of these persons in the population in the preceding days. RESULTS: Specific values for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and COVID-19 duration were estimated for different countries. In China, the viral transmissibility was 3.12 before quarantine measures were implemented and 0.36 after these measures were lifted. For the other countries, the viral transmissibility was 2.28-2.76 initially, and it then decreased to 0.87-1.29 as a result of quarantine measures. Therefore, it can be expected that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will be suppressed if 56%-64% of the total population becomes vaccinated or survives COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted in most countries are too weak compared to those previously used in China. Therefore, it is not expected that the spread of COVID-19 will stop and the disease will cease to exist naturally or owing to quarantine measures. Active vaccination of the population is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the required specific percentage of vaccinated individuals depends on the magnitude of viral transmissibility, which can be evaluated using the proposed model and statistical data for the country of interest.","Ilyin, Sergey O",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,444

514284,Implementing Mental Health Promotion Initiatives-Process Evaluation of the ABCs of Mental Health in Denmark,2020,"The issue in respiratory sound classification has attained good attention from the clinical scientists and medical researcher's group in the last year to diagnosing COVID-19 disease. To date, various models of Artificial Intelligence (AI) entered into the real-world to detect the COVID-19 disease from human-generated sounds such as voice/speech, cough, and breath. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented for solving a lot of real-world problems on machines based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this context, one dimension (1D) CNN is suggested and implemented to diagnose respiratory diseases of COVID-19 from human respiratory sounds such as a voice, cough, and breath. An augmentation-based mechanism is applied to improve the preprocessing performance of the COVID-19 sounds dataset and to automate COVID-19 disease diagnosis using the 1D convolutional network. Furthermore, a DDAE (Data De-noising Auto Encoder) technique is used to generate deep sound features such as the input function to the 1D CNN instead of adopting the standard input of MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient), and it is performed better accuracy and performance than previous models. Results: As a result, around 4% accuracy is achieved than traditional MFCC. We have classified COVID-19 sounds, asthma sounds, and regular healthy sounds using a 1D CNN classifier and shown around 90% accuracy to detect the COVID-19 disease from respiratory sounds. Conclusion: A Data De-noising Auto Encoder (DDAE) was adopted to extract the acoustic sound signals in-depth features instead of traditional MFCC. The proposed model improves efficiently to classify COVID-19 sounds for detecting COVID-19 positive symptoms.","Lella, K. K.; Pja, A.",Aims Public Health,,444

Antiviral drugs considered for this condition include atazanavir, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, and favipiravir. Whilst the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir has been previously linked to prolongation of the QT&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; interval on the ECG and risk of torsades de pointes arrhythmia, less is known in this regard about atazanavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Unwanted abnormalities of drug-induced QT&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; prolongation by diverse drugs are commonly mediated by a single cardiac anti-target, the hERG potassium channel. This computational modeling study was undertaken in order to explore the ability of these five drugs to interact with known determinants of drug binding to the hERG channel pore.","Al-Moubarak, E.; Sharifi, M.; Hancox, J.

521976,Specialization Within a Specialty: Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nursing Pathways for the Greatest Good,2021,"In early 2020, a novel coronavirus quickly spread across the globe. In response to the rapidly increasing number of confirmed U.S. cases, state and local governments suggested social distancing, issued stay-at-home orders, and restricted travel, fundamentally changing how individuals allocate time. Directly impacted time activities, such as work, eating food away from home, grocery shopping, and childcare significantly impact two food-related topics: household food waste and diet quality. In order to investigate these non-marginal time changes, we predict weekly time allocated to seven activities for households in the National Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey using information from the American Time Use Survey. Jointly estimating household production functions for food waste and diet quality, we find that time events that are related to fresh produce consumption, such as increased grocery store trips and time spent in FAH activities, are related to higher diet quality, but lower food waste. While time events that are associated with quick convenient meals, such as time spent in secondary childcare and work time, are also associated with lower food waste, these events decrease household diet quality. We then predict the level of household food waste and diet quality for three COVID-19 scenarios: one where the household head is likely able to work remotely, another where the household head is likely to lose their job, and a third, where the household head is likely to be considered an essential worker. Households without children that are likely able to work remotely are predicted to have lower levels of food waste and higher diet quality, while households without children in the other two COVID-19 scenarios are predicted to have only minor differences.","Scharadin, Benjamin; Yu, Yang; Jaenicke, Edward C",Rev Econ Househ,,444

First non-representative studies from China, India, Brazil, the US, Spain, Italy, and Germany pointed to a negative mental health impact. The current study is the first nationwide representative study to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health of children and adolescents in Germany from the perspective of children themselves. A representative online survey was conducted among n = 1586 families with 7- to 17-year-old children and adolescents between May 26 and June 10. The survey included internationally established and validated instruments for measuring HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10), mental health problems (SDQ), anxiety (SCARED), and depression (CES-DC). Results were compared with data from the nationwide, longitudinal, representative BELLA cohort study (n = 1556) conducted in Germany before the pandemic. Two-thirds of the children and adolescents reported being highly burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced significantly lower HRQoL (40.2% vs. 15.3%), more mental health problems (17.8% vs. 9.9%) and higher anxiety levels (24.1% vs. 14.9%) than before the pandemic. Children with low socioeconomic status, migration background and limited living space were affected significantly more. Health promotion and prevention strategies need to be implemented to maintain children’s and adolescents’ mental health, improve their HRQoL, and mitigate the burden caused by COVID-19, particularly for children who are most at risk.

To develop effective and safe therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has become the major global public health concern. Traditional medicine (TM)/herbal medicines (HMs) have been used to treat multiple epidemics in human history, which brings hope for the fight against COVID-19 in some areas. For example, in China, India, and South Korea with traditional medication history and theory, the governments issued a series of guidelines to support TM/HMs in the medication of COVID-19. In contrast, other countries e.g. North American and European governments are typically silent on these practices, unless to warn of possible harm and overselling. Such difference is due to the discrepancy in culture, history and philosophical views of health care and medication, as well as unharmonized policies and standards in the regulation and legalization of TM/HMs among different areas. Herein, we reviewed the responses and scientific researches from seven selected countries on the policies and legalization of TM/HMs to treat COVID-19, and also analyzed the major challenges and concerns to utilize the traditional knowledge and resource.","Xiong, Yin; Gao, Min; van Duijn, Bert; Choi, Hoyoung; van Horssen, Frits; Wang, Mei",Pharmacol Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661821000566?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661821000566; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592272/,444

Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are actually recommended to identify and minimize infectious risks. However, there is still no guideline on the implementation of RATs in a dental or medical setting. METHODS: Based on data and an extensive literature research regarding rapid antigen testing and reflecting the recommendations given by the various professional societies a task force was formed to determine a specific testing and treatment strategy. RESULTS: A comprehensive test and treatment strategy and risk analysis was developed with practical suggestions for a wide range of typical activities in dental and medical offices. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants via aerosols and droplets as well as the difficulties to maintain the minimum distance form special challenges to the dental routine. RATs might in addition to optimal and necessary hygienic standards in combination with the use of adequate personal protection equipment be an important instrument in managing the challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The present work gives recommendations for dental routine operation (dental practices, outpatient clinics) to provide the necessary dental care for the population while protecting the doctor, practice team and patient at the same time.","Durner, Jürgen; Beikler, Thomas; Watts, David C.; Becker, Marc; Draenert, Miriam E.",Head Face Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13005-021-00289-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481505/,444

Viruses subvert or manipulate this cellular machinery to favor viral propagation and to evade host immune response. The UPS serves as a double-edged sword in viral pathogenesis: on the one hand, the UPS is utilized by many viruses to maintain proper function and level of viral proteins; while on the other hand, the UPS constitutes a host defense mechanism to eliminate viral components. To combat this host anti-viral machinery, viruses have evolved to employ the UPS to degrade or inactivate cellular proteins that limit viral growth.

We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8%), two thirds (66.9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Souza, William Marciel de; Buss, Lewis Fletcher; da Silva Candido, Darlan; Carrera, Jean Paul; Li, Sabrina; Zarebski, Alexander; Vincenti-Gonzalez, Maria; Messina, Janey; Sales, Flavia Cristina da Silva; Andrade, Pamela dos Santos; Prete, Carlos A; Nascimento, Vitor Heloiz; Ghilardi, Fabio; Pereira, Rafael Henrique Moraes; Santos, Andreza Aruska de Souza; Abade, Leandro; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Kraemer, Moritz U.

The main principle is that there should be no substantial differences in the provision of health care for COVID-19 between persons with pre-existing mental health disorders and the ones without previous disorders. Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factors—they often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","Kuzman, Martina Rojnic; Curkovic, Marko; Wasserman, Danuta",Eur Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431255/,444

TREC/KREC analysis was performed by multiplex real-time quantitative PCR on a sample of 36 patients aged 45 years or younger. The reduced TREC/KREC level was observed in ARDS patients compared with non-ARDS patients, and similar results were found for the deceased patients. During days 6 to 20 of hospitalization, a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was detected in ARDS patients compared with non-ARDS patients. TREC/KREC negatively correlated with NLR; the highest correlation was recorded for TREC per 100,000 cells with the coefficient of determination R(2) = 0.527.

Understanding Wuhan COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effects of prevention approaches is of significant importance for containing virus global transmission. However, most of the recent studies focused on the early outbreaks without considering improvements in diagnostic capability and effects of prevention measures together, thus the estimated results may only reflect the facts in a given period of time. Methods: We constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, embedding with latent periods under different prevention measures and proportions of documented infections to characterize the Wuhan COVID-19 transmission cross different stages of the outbreak. The epidemiological parameters were estimated using a particle filtering approach. Results: Our model successfully reproduced the dynamics of the Wuhan local epidemic with two peaks on February 4 and February 12 separately. Prevention measures determined the time of reaching the first peak and caused an 87% drop in the R_t from 3.09 (95% CI, 2.10 to 3.63) to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.66). An improved diagnostic capability created the second peak and increased the number of documented infections. The proportion of documented infections changed from 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%) to 37% (95% CI, 33% to 41%) when the detection kits were released after January 26, and later up to 73% (95% CI, 64% to 80%) after the diagnostic criteria were improved.","LIANG, Jingbo; Yuan, Hsiang-Yu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049387,444

This pandemic disease became particularly threatening after the start of a new wave. Vaccines of tested efficacy to stop COVID-19 infection are being investigated vigorously worldwide. Currently, some specific drugs have been authorized for COVID-19, but the improvement of antivirals requires time. Hence, a faster way of treatment is done by drug repurposing. Repurposing of drugs is promising for treating and reducing the symptoms of the disease, and it a fast, easy, and safe method to address the crisis, because of their previously known applications. Some antimalarial drugs, especially chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have been repurposed, as they exhibited promising results in vitro and in vivo.

Viruses like respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and influenza may act as sole pathogens or may predispose to bacterial pneumonia by a variety of mechanisms. New, emerging, or reemerging viral pathogens occasionally cause outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection in children. The 2009–2010 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic resulted in increased rates of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths in children. Rapid viral diagnostic tests based on antigen detection or nucleic acid amplification are increasingly available for clinical use and confirm the importance of viral infection in children hospitalized with CAP. Recently published guidelines for the management of CAP in children note that positive viral test results can modify clinical decision making in children with suspected pneumonia by allowing antibacterial therapy to be withheld in the absence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that suggest bacterial coinfection.","Woods, Charles R.; Bryant, Kristina A.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23371408/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-013-0324-6,444

In the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App (mAFA)-II trial, the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology, incorporating AF screening and integrated management strategy, was associated with improved short-term clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to report adherence/persistence and long term (≥1 year) clinical outcomes of the mAFA-II trial, with mHealth-supported optimised stroke prevention, symptom control and comorbidity management. Methods. We studied an adult population screened for AF, where identified patients could enter a structured program of holistic and integrated care based on the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway using mHealth with a mAFA intervention. In this cluster randomised trial, comparing mHeath intervention to usual care, the primary composite outcome was ‘stroke/thromboembolism, all-cause death and rehospitalization’. Results. The 1261 subjects (mean age 67.0 years, 38.0% female) who were followed up over one year (mean follow-up 687 (standard deviation, SD 191) days) in the intervention arm, had a lower risk of the composite outcome of ‘ischaemic stroke/systemic thromboembolism, death, and rehospitalization’ (hazard ratio, HR 0.18, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.13–0.25, P < 0.001), compared to usual care (1212 subjects, mean age 70.1 years, 42.1% female). Of 842 patients using their smart devices for ‘Better symptom management’, 70.8% had good management adherence (monitoring time/follow-up since initial monitoring ≥ 70%), with the persistence of use of 91.7%.

It has resulted into degradation of a broad range of habitats and ecosystems by destroying natural functions, water quality, and environmental sustainability. However, the government agencies, scientific communities, and the public, have started to give attention to this issue. So, in the present study, we used the correlation methods to check the relationship between COVID-19 affected population with the medical plastic waste (MPW) that has developed a conceptual model of the inter-linkages between the preventive measures of COVID-19 pandemic problems and the reduction challenges of plastic waste during and after pandemic scenarios. Emerging issues in the waste management during and after the COVID-19 are established by reviewing the literature, reports, policy briefs, and information from the website concerning COVID-19. Considering MPW management issues, we selected India as a case study to analyse the plastic waste footprint (PWF) due to COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation results showed COVID-19 affected population and MPW; COVID-19 affected population and PWF have a significant relationship (R(2) = 0.60; Area under ROC curve 81.4%). It suggests an urgent need for plastic waste management initiatives. Moreover, substantial plastic products, human awareness, strict government regulations, and inclusive research can check plastic waste footprints in India and worldwide. Then discuss the specific pathways through which the immediate and long-term impacts operate and highlight the issues of hampering the sustainable development goals (SDGs) progress in India and beyond. Finally, call for coordinated assessment, support and appropriate short- and long-term mitigation and the policy measures of plastic waste problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mallick, Suraj K.; Pramanik, Malay; Maity, Biswajit; Das, Pritiranjan; Sahana, Mehebub",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721040237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34271381/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148951; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721040237,444
633696,The voice of mental health practice in Australia: a mixed-method cross-sectional study of gaps and areas of need,2021,"BACKGROUND: To identify the clinical findings and outcomes of children with COVID‐19 and factors predicting RT‐PCR positivity. METHODS: The data retrospectively analyzed for suspected and confirmed pediatric COVID‐19 patients between March 20 and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: There were 404 children, of them, 176 (43.6%) patients were confirmed to have COVID‐19 which were less symptomatic on admission (67.6% to 95.6%). Cough (44.9%), fever (38.1%), sore throat (18.5%), and smell‐taste loss (12.7%) were the most common symptoms. Confirmed cases had 92.6% identified history of contact with COVID‐19. Close contact with COVID‐19 positive family members and coughs increased the RT‐PCR positivity 23.8 and 5.0 times, respectively; while positivity decreased by 0.4 times if fever was over 38°C. Asymptomatic and mild cases were categorized as ‘group 1’ (n=153), moderate, severe and critical cases as ’group 2’ (n=23) in terms of disease severity. Group 2 cases had higher C‐reactive protein (40.9% to 15.9%) and procalcitonin (22.7% to 4.9%) levels and had more frequent lymphopenia (45.5% to 13.1%). Out of 23 cases, 19 had abnormal chest x‐ray findings; of them, 15 patients underwent chest CTs, and all had abnormal findings. However, 26.0% of them needed respiratory support, and no patient required invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: Children with COVID‐19 have milder clinical course and SARS‐CoV‐2 rarely causes severe disease in children. Contact history with COVID‐19 and sore throat are the most important predictors for RT‐PCR positivity. Consequently, the role of asymptomatic children in the contamination chain must be fully established and considered for the control of pandemic.","Arslan, Gazi; Aktürk, Hüseyin; Duman, Murat",Pediatr Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426754/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14602,444

We aim to analyze trends in COVID-19 CFR, population density, and socioeconomic status (SES) indicators (unemployment, median household income) to identify ZCs heavily burdened by COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional study to investigate the US prevalence of COVD-19 fatalities by ZC and SES. CFRs were calculated from state/county Departments of Health. Inclusion criteria were counties that reported cases/deaths by ZC and a CFR≥2%. This study was reported in line with the STROCSS criteria. RESULTS: 609/1,853 ZCs, spanning 327 counties in 7 states had CFRs ≥2%. A significant positive correlation was found between the CFR and median household income (Pearson correlation:0.107; 95% CI [289.1,1937.9]; p < 0.001). No significant correlations exist between the CFR, and population/mi (Sen-Crowe et al., 2020) [2] or unemployment rate. Significant associations exist between the CFR and young males and elderly females without public insurance. CFR was inversely associated with persons aged <44 and individuals aged ≥65. The percentage of nursing homes (NHs) within cities residing within high CFR ZCs range from 8.7% to 67.6%. CONCLUSION: Significant positive association was found between the CFR and median household income. Population/mi (Sen-Crowe et al., 2020) [2] and unemployment rates, did not correlate to CFR. NHs were heavily distributed in high CFR zip codes. We recommend the targeted vaccination of zip codes with a large proportion of long-term care facilities.

The emergence of socially constructed knowledge based on connected learning is democratising education and re-framing how formal and informal learning is considered. What we currently understand connected learning to be is limited to a combination of individual interests, networked and interdependent relationships with interconnected experiences that transcend temporal, spatial and cultural boundaries. Connected learning does not reduce learning to a phenomenon that takes place exclusively in the restricted spaces of formal education, neither does it focus exclusively on the online learning phenomenon. As such our conceptualisation of connected learning needs to deepen to effectively be able to rationalise how people learn in a digital age. This paper begins to unlock concepts and ideas associated with connected learning using current examples, setting out to build a theoretical model which begins to frame the complexities of conceptualized self-driven global learning interactions.","Prestridge, Sarah; Jacobsen, Michele; Mulla, Sadaqat; Paredes, Sandra Gudiño; Charania, Amina",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584079/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-09968-5,444
635024,Integrated Behavioral Health for Preschool Children in Pediatric Primary Care,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor is a small-molecule cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator regimen shown to be efficacious in patients with at least one Phe508del allele, which indicates that this combination can modulate a single Phe508del allele. In patients whose other CFTR allele contains a gating or residual function mutation that is already effectively treated with previous CFTR modulators (ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor), the potential for additional benefit from restoring Phe508del CFTR protein function is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial involving patients 12 years of age or older with cystic fibrosis and Phe508del-gating or Phe508del-residual function genotypes. After a 4-week run-in period with ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor, patients were randomly assigned to receive elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or active control for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline through week 8 in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group. RESULTS: After the run-in period, 132 patients received elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor and 126 received active control. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor resulted in a percentage of predicted FEV1 that was higher by 3.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8 to 4.6) relative to baseline and higher by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.7) relative to active control and a sweat chloride concentration that was lower by 22.3 mmol per liter (95% CI, 20.2 to 24.5) relative to baseline and lower by 23.1 mmol per liter (95% CI, 20.1 to 26.1) relative to active control (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The change from baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) with elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was 10.3 points (95% CI, 8.0 to 12.7) and with active control was 1.6 points (95% CI, -0.8 to 4.1). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups; adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in one patient (elevated aminotransferase level) in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group and in two patients (anxiety or depression and pulmonary exacerbation) in the active control group. CONCLUSIONS: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was efficacious and safe in patients with Phe508del-gating or Phe508del-residual function genotypes and conferred additional benefit relative to previous CFTR modulators.

A French nationwide online survey of 11,391 participants",2020-05-08,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are considered widespread among cattle in Norway and worldwide. This cross-sectional study was conducted based on antibody-ELISA of bulk tank milk (BTM) from 1347 herds in two neighboring counties in western Norway. The study aims were to determine the seroprevalence at herd level, to evaluate risk factors for BRSV and BCoV seropositivity, and to assess how these factors were associated with the spatial distribution of positive herds. The overall prevalence of BRSV and BCoV positive herds in the region was 46.2% and 72.2%, respectively. Isopleth maps of the prevalence risk distribution showed large differences in prevalence risk across the study area, with the highest prevalence in the northern region. Common risk factors of importance for both viruses were herd size, geographic location, and proximity to neighbors. Seropositivity for one virus was associated with increased odds of seropositivity for the other virus. Purchase of livestock was an additional risk factor for BCoV seropositivity, included in the model as in-degree, which was defined as the number of incoming movements from individual herds, through animal purchase, over a period of five years. Local dependence and the contribution of risk factors to this effect were assessed using the residuals from two logistic regression models for each virus. One model contained only the x- and y- coordinates as predictors, the other had all significant predictors included. Spatial clusters of high values of residuals were detected using the normal model of the spatial scan statistic and visualized on maps. Adjusting for the risk factors in the final models had different impact on the spatial clusters for the two viruses: For BRSV the number of clusters was reduced from six to four, for BCoV the number of clusters remained the same, however the log-likelihood ratios changed notably. This indicates that geographical differences in proximity to neighbors, herd size and animal movements explain some of the spatial clusters of BRSV- and BCoV seropositivity, but far from all. The remaining local dependence in the residuals show that the antibody status of one herd is influenced by the antibody status of its neighbors, indicating the importance of indirect transmission and that increased biosecurity routines might be an important preventive strategy.","Toftaker, Ingrid; Sanchez, Javier; Stokstad, Maria; Nødtvedt, Ane",Prev Vet Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716303233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720029/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.09.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716303233,444

In this review, we discuss the role of the gut microbiota in response to cancer immunotherapy, the mechanisms that the gut microbiota influences cancer immunotherapy, and therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota to improve cancer immunotherapy.","Li, Bolei; Gong, Tao; Hao, Yu; Zhou, Xuedong; Cheng, Lei",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.721249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589427/,444
641551,"Parasocial Interactions, Intolerance to Uncertainty and Mental Health Rehabilitation During Pandemics",2021-03-19,"We present an approach to investigate SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences based on alignment-free methods for RNA sequence comparison. In particular, we verify a given clustering result for the GISAID data set, which was obtained analyzing the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic trees. For this purpose, we use alignment-free dissimilarity measures for sequences and combine them with learning vector quantization classifiers for virus type discriminant analysis and classification. Those vector quantizers belong to the class of interpretable machine learning methods, which, on the one hand side provide additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations, and on the other hand can be equipped with a reject option. This option gives the model the property of self controlled evidence if applied to new data, i.e. the models refuses to make a classification decision, if the model evidence for the presented data is not given. After training such a classifier for the GISAID data set, we apply the obtained classifier model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus data set. On the one hand side, this allows us to assign new sequences to already known virus types and, on the other hand, the rejected sequences allow speculations about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Author summary The currently emerging global disease COVID-19 caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses requires all scientific effort to investigate the development of the viral epidemy, the properties of the virus and its types. Investigations of the virus sequence are of special interest. Frequently, those are based on mathematical/statistical analysis. However, machine learning methods represent a promising alternative, if one focuses on interpretable models, i.e. those that do not act as black-boxes. Doing so, we apply variants of Learning Vector Quantizers to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We encoded the sequences and compared them in their numerical representations to avoid the computationally costly comparison based on sequence alignments. Our resulting model is interpretable, robust, efficient, and has a self-controlling mechanism regarding the applicability to data. This framework was applied to two data sets concerning SARS-CoV-2. We were able to verify previously published virus type findings for one of the data sets by training our model to accurately identify the virus type of sequences. For sequences without virus type information (second data set), our trained model can predict them. Thereby, we observe a new scattered spreading of the sequences in the data space which probably is caused by mutations in the viral sequences.","Kaden, Marika; Bohnsack, Katrin Sophie; Weber, Mirko; Kudła, Mateusz; Gutowska, Kaja; Blazewicz, Jacek; Villmann, Thomas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.097741,444

The methods used include the derivation of the Pandemic Equation describing the mitigation measures via the evolution of the growth time constant in the Pandemic Equation resulting in an asymmetric pandemic curve with a steeper rise than a decrease and mitigation measures. The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time. The Pandemic Equation parameters extracted from the well advanced pandemic curves can be used for predicting the pandemic evolution in the localities, where the pandemics is still in the initial stages. Using the multiple pandemic locations for the parameter extraction allows for the uncertainty quantification in predicting the pandemic evolution using the introduced Pandemic Equation. Compared with other pandemic models our approach allows for easier parameter extraction amenable to using Artificial Intelligence models.","Shur, Michael",J Healthc Inform Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41666-020-00084-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437912/,444

We estimated the number of “quanta” in the exhaled liquid from viral concentrations of 10(6) to 10(11)/mL, based on the Human Infective Dose 50 of 218 viral particles. We employed the Wells–Riley equation to estimate the risk of infection in typical meeting rooms for a one-hour meeting of 2, 4 and 6 people observing a 2 m distance. The four participating adults released a mean of 1.28 nLm(3) while breathing, 1.68 nL/m(3) while speaking normally, and two adults released a mean of 4.44 nL/m(3) while talking with a raised voice. The combination of 50% breathing, 45% talking normally and 5% speaking with a raised voice increased the risk of infection above 5% for a one-hour meeting of two people. The result is based on 6 quanta released, corresponding to an initial virus concentration of 1000/nL (10(9)/mL) in the fluid of the upper respiratory tract.

This study aimed to explore the levels and determinants of HCWs’ IPC behaviors based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF), which has been shown to be effective in guiding behavior change. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Wuhan, China in January 2020. Self-reported hand hygiene and droplet isolation behaviors (including the use of masks, gloves, goggles and gowns) were set as dependent variables. TDF domains and HCWs’ characteristics were independent variables. Negative binomial regression analyses were performed to explore their relationships. RESULTS: HCWs reported good IPC behaviors, while the compliance with goggle and gown use was relatively low (below 85%). Environmental context and resources domain was significantly related to hand hygiene (β = 0.018, p = 0.026), overall droplet isolation behaviors (β = 0.056, p = 0.001), goggle (β = 0.098, p = 0.001) and gown use (β = 0.101. p < 0.001). Knowledge domain was significantly related to goggle (β = 0.081, p = 0.005) and gown use (β = 0.053, p = 0.013). Emotion domain was a predictor of overall droplet isolation behaviors (β = 0.043, p = 0.016), goggle (β = 0.074, p = 0.026) and gown use (β = 0.106, p < 0.001). Social influences domain was a predictor of overall droplet isolation behaviors (β = 0.031, p = 0.029) and gown use (β = 0.039, p = 0.035). HCWs in high-risk departments had better behaviors of gown use (β = 0.158, p = 0.032). HCWs who had encountered confirmed or suspected patients reported worse behaviors of goggle (β = − 0.127, p = 0.050) and gown use (β = − 0.153, p = 0.003).

STUDY DESIGN: EPICO-AEP is a multicenter study conducted in Spanish children to assess the characteristics of COVID-19. In a subset of patients, three serial RT-PCR tests on nasopharyngeal swab specimens were performed after the first RT-PCR test, and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was performed in the acute and follow up (<14 and ≥14 days after diagnosis) phase. RESULTS: In total, 324 patients were included in the study. Median [IQR] time to RT-PCR negativity was 17 [8–29] days, and 35% of patients remained positive >4 weeks after the first RT-PCR test. The probability of RT-PCR negativity did not differ across groups defined by sex, disease severity, immunosuppressive drugs, or clinical phenotype. Globally, 24% of children failed to seroconvert after infection. Seroconversion was associated with hospitalization, persistence of RT-PCR positivity and days of fever. CONCLUSIONS: Time to RT-PCR negativity was long, regardless of severity of symptoms or other patients’ features. This should be considered when interpreting RT-PCR results in a child with symptoms, especially those with mild symptoms. Seroprevalence and post-immunization studies should consider that one in four infected children fail to seroconvert.","Tagarro, A.; Sanz-Santaeufemia, F.J.; Grasa, C.; Cobos, E.; Yebra, J.; Alonso-Cadenas, J.A.; Baquero-Artigao, F.; Mesa, Guzmán JM.; Perez, Seoane B.; Calvo, C.; Herreros, M.L.; Epalza, C.; Melendo, S.; Dominguez-Rodriguez, S.; Vidal, P.; Pacheco, M.; Ballesteros, A.; Bernardino, M.; Villanueva-Medina, S.; Rodríguez, Molino P.; Miragaya, Castro S.; Rivière, J.; Garcés, R.; Santiago, B.; Fumadó, V.; Urretavizcaya-Martínez, M.; García-García, M.L.; Penín, M.; Cava, F.; Sáez, E.; Iglesias-Bouzas, M.I.; Herrero, B.; Reinoso, T.; Moraleda, C.",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571020/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347621009057?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.09.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347621009057,444

NiV was first identified during an outbreak of a disease in Malaysia in 1998 and then occurred periodically since 2001 in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. We used bioinformatics tools to analyze the codon usage patterns in a genome-wide manner among 11 genomes of NiV as no work was reported yet. The compositional properties revealed that the overall GC and AT contents were 41.96 and 58.04%, respectively i.e. Nipah virus genes were AT-rich. Correlation analysis between overall nucleotide composition and its 3(rd) codon position suggested that both mutation pressure and natural selection might influence the CUB across Nipah genomes.

649068,Editorial: Liminality and COVID-19 - what do we already know?,2021,"Most SARS-CoV2 infections will not develop into severe COVID-19. However, in some patients, lung infection leads to the activation of alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells that will release proinflammatory cytokines. IL-6, TNF, and IL-1β increase expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and VEGF, thereby increasing permeability of the lung endothelium and reducing barrier protection, allowing viral dissemination and infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. In the blood, these cytokines will stimulate the bone marrow to produce and release immature granulocytes, that return to the lung and further increase inflammation, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This lung-systemic loop leads to cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Concurrently, the acute phase response increases the production of platelets, fibrinogen and other pro-thrombotic factors. Systemic decrease in ACE2 function impacts the Renin-Angiotensin-Kallikrein-Kinin systems (RAS-KKS) increasing clotting. The combination of acute lung injury with RAS-KKS unbalance is herein called COVID-19 Associated Lung Injury (CALI). This conservative two-hit model of systemic inflammation due to the lung injury allows new intervention windows and is more consistent with the current knowledge.","Polidoro, Rafael B.; Hagan, Robert S.; de Santis Santiago, Roberta; Schmidt, Nathan W.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714336/,444

This protective function is especially important at the time of weaning, when animals are exposed to infectious agents and to numerous stresses such as the change of environment and diet. Diets supplemented with spray-dried plasma or plasma protein fractions have been shown to improve growth performance of farm animals and have been proposed as an alternative to antibiotics. In this review, we summarize our findings on the mechanism of action of dietary plasma proteins using a rat model of intestinal inflammation, based on the administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B activates the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), increasing T-lymphocytes in Peyer's patches and the number of activated T lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (organized GALT). In the lamina propria SEB increased cytotoxic T δγ and natural killer cell populations of the diffuse GALT. Staphyloccocal enterotoxin B significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines in Peyer's patches and mucosa. Plasma protein supplements modulated the mucosal immune response in organized and diffuse GALT, protecting GALT from possible excessive activation by the SEB challenge. These effects are accompanied by a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production, supporting the view that changes in cytokine production mediate the effects of dietary plasma proteins during intestinal inflammation. The increase in mucosal permeability and intestinal secretion induced by SEB was associated with decreased expression of mucosal tight-junction and adherent-junction proteins. Both plasma and plasma protein fractions prevented the effects of SEB on intestinal permeability, thus reducing the exposure of the host to microbial and food antigens across the interstitial space. These findings indicate that dietary plasma proteins modulate functional and structural properties of the intestinal mucosa.","Moretó, M.; Pérez-Bosque, A.",J Anim Sci,https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-1381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820151/,444

We evaluated pattern and effects of corticosteroid use in these patients during an early surge of the pandemic. METHODS Observational study of 136 SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to the Intensive care Unit between March 1 and April 27, 2020 at a tertiary care hospital in Indianapolis, USA. Statistical comparison between cohorts and dosing pattern analysis was done. Outcome measures included number of patients requiring intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Of 136 patients, 72 (53%) received corticosteroids. Groups demographics: Age (60.5 vs. 65; p .083), sex (47% male vs. 39% female; p .338) and comorbidities were similar. Corticosteroid group had increased severity of illness: PaO2/FiO2 (113 vs. 130; p .014) and SOFA (8 vs. 5.5; p < .001). Overall mortality (21% vs. 30%; p .234) or proportion of patients intubated (78 vs. 64%; p .078) was similar. Mortality was similar among mechanically ventilated (27% vs. 15%; p .151) however there were no deaths among patients who were not mechanically ventilated and received corticosteroids (0% vs. 57%; p <.001). Early administration (within 48 hours) showed decrease in proportion of intubation (66% vs. 87 vs. 100%; p.045), ICU days (6 vs., 16 vs. 18; p <.001), and ventilator days (3 vs. 12 & 14; p <.001). 45% received methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids were used more frequently in SARS CoV-2 patients with higher severity of illness.

Data regarding antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines in this population is limited. Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in older, vaccinated residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living facilities. Design A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15-April 1, 2021 in the Pittsburgh region. Setting and Population Participants were volunteers at assisted living, personal care, and independent living facilities, who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that obviate immune responses were exclusionary criteria. Methods Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to evaluate relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Results All participants (N=70) had received two rounds of vaccination for COVID-19 and were found to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There was wide variation in relative levels of antibodies as determined by extinction coefficients. Antibody levels trended lower in male sex, advanced age, steroid medications, and longer length of time from vaccination. Conclusions and Implications Higher functioning long-term care residents mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines. This study provides preliminary information on level of population risk of assisted living, personal care, and independent living residents which can inform reopening strategies. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects of such vaccination programs remain to be determined in larger studies. Clinical protection is afforded not just by pre-formed antibody levels, but by ongoing adaptive immunity, which is known to be decreased in older individuals. Thus, the implications of these levels of antibodies in preventing COVID-19 disease must be determined by clinical follow-up.","Nace, D. A.; Kip, K. E.; Peck Palmer, O. M.; Shurin, M.

This has raised an unprecedented need to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines, which requires profound knowledge of the fundamental pathology of the virus, including its entry, replication, and release from host cells. The genome of coronaviruses comprises around 30 kb of positive single-stranded RNA, representing one of the largest RNA genomes of viruses. The 5′ part of the genome encodes a large polyprotein, PP1ab, which gives rise to 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1– nsp16). Two proteases encoded in nsp3 and nsp5 cleave the polyprotein into individual proteins. Most nsps belong to the viral replicase complex that promotes replication of the viral genome and translation of structural proteins by producing subgenomic mRNAs. The replicase complexes are found on double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that contain viral double-stranded RNA. Expression of a small subset of viral proteins, including nsp3 and nsp4, is sufficient to induce formation of these DMVs in human cells, suggesting that both proteins deform host membranes into such structures. We will discuss the formation of DMVs and provide an overview of other membrane remodeling processes that are induced by coronaviruses.","Mohan, Jagan; Wollert, Thomas",Fac Rev,https://doi.org/10.12703/r/10-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718934/,444

To investigate the current status of health care waste management at different levels of health care facilities (HCF) after the implementation of these regulations, one tertiary hospital, one secondary hospital, and four primary health care centers from Binzhou District were visited and 145 medical staff members and 24 cleaning personnel were interviewed. Generated medical waste totaled 1.22, 0.77, and 1.17 kg/bed/day in tertiary, secondary, and primary HCF, respectively. The amount of medical waste generated in primary health care centers was much higher than that in secondary hospitals, which may be attributed to general waste being mixed with medical waste.

We conducted a seroprevalence study of banked human serum samples collected in 2012 from Southern Saudi Arabia. Sera from 300 animal workers (17% with daily camel exposure) and 50 non-animal-exposed controls were examined for serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection by a pseudoparticle MERS-CoV spike protein neutralization assay. None of the sera reproducibly neutralized the MERS-CoV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector. These data suggest that serological evidence of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV was not common among animal workers in Southern Saudi Arabia during July 2012.,"Memish, Ziad A; Alsahly, Ahmad; Masri, Malak al; Heil, Gary L; Anderson, Benjamin D; Peiris, Malik; Khan, Salah Uddin; Gray, Gregory C",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470665/,444

Fever, headache and anosmia may occur early during the disease course. Other neurological sequalae such as encephalitis may occur in later phases. We report a case of acute myelitis in a 32 year old male Covid-19 positive patient who presented with a two-day history of flu-like symptoms then sudden onset paraplegia and urinary retention. The incidence is not known and the pathogenesis of the disease behind this manifestation is still not fully understood. Nevertheless considering the broad differential diagnosis of acute myelitis, prompt clinical and diagnostic work up was crucial to exclude other causes. Patients presenting with neurological symptoms such as loss of consciousness, ataxia, convulsions, status epilepticus, encephalitis, myelitis or neuritis should raise concerns for Covid-19 infection during this pandemic prompting early diagnosis and initiation of proper management.","AlKetbi, Reem; AlNuaimi, Dana; AlMulla, Muna; AlTalai, Nouf; Samir, Mohammed; Kumar, Navin",Radiol Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2020.06.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1930043320302478?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1930043320302478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32685076/,444

Recognising the need to reform the health system and primary care in particular, on 1 July 2018 the Polish government launched POZ Plus—a pilot programme of coordinated primary care. Its objectives are to improve the quality and coordination of care and to expand its scope. The objectives are to be delivered through preventive health checks in patients aged 20–65 years, predefined chronic disease management programmes, as well as coordination and monitoring of care carried out by primary care teams. The programme provoked a heated debate and mixed reactions from different stakeholders in Poland. On the positive side, POZ Plus improves patient experience and seems to be a promising preventive tool. During the first 14 months of programme life, 10,956 health checks resulted in 13,361 new diagnoses. The critics of the programme point out that the scope of care is too wide and unnecessary in general population, and the health checks are too long, given the scarcity of medical professionals in Poland. The programme requires significant up-front investment of time and resources, thus favouring big clinics from densely populated areas. Financing may be sufficient during the pilot phase, but the programme may turn out to be too costly for country-wide implementation. The programme is a promising start toward achieving better primary care coordination in Poland. However, its success is conditional on sound public financing, rational workforce strategy, and close collaboration of all stakeholders.","Karasiewicz, Monika; Chawłowska, Ewelina M.; Lipiak, Agnieszka; Staszewski, Rafał",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850591/,444

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. SETTING: International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. RESULTS: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken.

Two previous viruses foreshadowed that a coronavirus could potentially have devastating consequences in 2002 [severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV)] and in 2012 [Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)]. The question that arises is why these viruses are so different from the relatively harmless cold viruses. On the basis of an analysis of the current literature and using bioinformatic approaches, we examined the potential human miRNA interactions with the SARS-CoV-2’s genome and compared the miRNA target sites in seven coronavirus genomes that include SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and four nonpathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we discuss the possibility that pathogenic human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, could modulate host miRNA levels by acting as miRNA sponges to facilitate viral replication and/or to avoid immune responses.","Bartoszewski, Rafal; Dabrowski, Michal; Jakiela, Bogdan; Matalon, Sadis; Harrod, Kevin S.; Sanak, Marek; Collawn, James F.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32755307/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00252.2020,444

680555,Coping with Stress During the Coronavirus Outbreak: the Contribution of Big Five Personality Traits and Social Support,2021-01-21,"[Image: see text] The rise in coronavirus variants has resulted in surges of the disease across the globe. The mutations in the spike protein on the surface of the virion membrane not only allow for greater transmission but also raise concerns about vaccine effectiveness. Preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, its variants, and other viruses from person to person via airborne or surface transmission requires effective inactivation of the virus. Here, we report a water-borne spray-on coating for the complete inactivation of viral particles and degradation of their RNA. Our nanoworms efficiently bind and, through subsequent large nanoscale conformational changes, rupture the viral membrane and subsequently bind and degrade its RNA. Our coating completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (VIC01) and an evolved SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (B.1.1.7 (alpha)), influenza A, and a surrogate capsid pseudovirus expressing the influenza A virus attachment glycoprotein, hemagglutinin. The polygalactose functionality on the nanoworms targets the conserved S2 subunit on the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface spike glycoprotein for stronger binding, and the additional attachment of guanidine groups catalyze the degradation of its RNA genome. Coating surgical masks with our nanoworms resulted in complete inactivation of VIC01 and B.1.1.7, providing a powerful control measure for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Inactivation was further observed for the influenza A and an AAV-HA capsid pseudovirus, providing broad viral inactivation when using the nanoworm system. The technology described here represents an environmentally friendly coating with a proposed nanomechanical mechanism for inactivation of both enveloped and capsid viruses. The functional nanoworms can be easily modified to target viruses in future pandemics, and is compatible with large scale manufacturing processes.","Bobrin, Valentin A.; Chen, Sung-Po; Grandes Reyes, Carlos Fitzgerald; Sun, Bing; Ng, Chun Ki; Kim, Youry; Purcell, Damian; Jia, Zhongfan; Gu, Wenyi; Armstrong, Jason W.; McAuley, Julie; Monteiro, Michael J.",ACS Nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c05075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423970/,444

However, during viral infections, dysregulation of these processes can be present and can participate in the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. In this review, we describe some features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and some immunopathogenic mechanisms characterizing the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Lymphopenia and monocytopenia are important contributors to COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. The fine mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still unknown, and several hypotheses have been raised, some of which assign a role to cell death as far as the reduction of specific types of immune cells is concerned. Thus, we discuss three major pathways such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, and suggest that all of them likely occur simultaneously in COVID-19 patients. We describe that SARS-CoV-2 can have both a direct and an indirect role in inducing cell death. Indeed, on the one hand, cell death can be caused by the virus entry into cells, on the other, the excessive concentration of cytokines and chemokines, a process that is known as a COVID-19-related cytokine storm, exerts deleterious effects on circulating immune cells. However, the overall knowledge of these mechanisms is still scarce and further studies are needed to delineate new therapeutic strategies.","Paolini, Annamaria; Borella, Rebecca; De Biasi, Sara; Neroni, Anita; Mattioli, Marco; Lo Tartaro, Domenico; Simonini, Cecilia; Franceschini, Laura; Cicco, Gerolamo; Piparo, Anna Maria; Cossarizza, Andrea; Gibellini, Lara",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10071585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201847/,444

Pathological conditions associated to nutrients overload, such as dyslipidaemia, may disturb cellular metabolic homeostasis and, in turn, affect cellular response and activation, thus contributing to disease progression. At the vascular/immune interface, the site of atherosclerotic plaque development, many of these changes occur. Here, an intimate interaction between endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and immune cells, mainly monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, dictates physiological versus pathological response. Furthermore, atherogenic stimuli trigger metabolic adaptations both at systemic and cellular level that affect the EC layer barrier integrity, VSMC proliferation and migration, monocyte infiltration, macrophage polarization, lymphocyte T and B activation. Rewiring cellular metabolism by repurposing “metabolic drugs” might represent a pharmacological approach to modulate cell activation at the vascular immune interface thus contributing to control the immunometabolic response in the context of cardiovascular diseases.","Bonacina, F.; Da Dalt, L.; Catapano, A.L.; Norata, G.D.",Mol Aspects Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032828/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0098299720301205; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2020.100918; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299720301205,444

Although the catalytic activity of the ACE2, APN, and DPP4 peptidases is not required for virus entry, co-expression of other host proteases allows efficient viral entry. In addition, evolutionary conservation of these receptors may permit interspecies transmissions.

Addressing this research gap, we conducted a word learning study to test the effects of changing gestures on children’s slow mapping. We applied a within-subject design and tested 51 children, aged 6.7 years (SD = 0.4), who learned unknown words from a story. The storyteller acted on the basis of two conditions: In one condition, in which half of the target words were presented, the story presentation was enhanced with progressively reduced iconic gestures (PRG); in the other condition, half of the target words were accompanied by fully executed iconic gestures (FEG). To ensure a reliable gesture presentation, children were exposed to a recorded person telling a story in both conditions. We tested the slow mapping effects on children’s productive and receptive word knowledge three minutes as well as two to three days after being presented the story.

This report explores low-impact interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 with a minimum of social and economic disruption. Methods An agent-based model simulated the population of King County, Washington, with agents that interact in homes, schools, workplaces, and other community sites. SARS-CoV-2 transmission probabilities were estimated by fitting simulated to observed hospital admissions from February-May 2020. Interventions considered were (a) encouraging telecommuting; (b) reducing contacts to seniors and nursing home residents; (c) modest reductions to contacts outside of the home; (d) encouraging self-isolation of persons with COVID-19 symptoms; (e) rapid testing and household quarantining. Results Individual interventions are not expected to have a large impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. No intervention reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by more than 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0% to 13.3%). Removing all interventions would result in nearly 42,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations between June 2020 and January 2021, with peak hospital occupancy exceeding available beds 6-fold. Combining the interventions is predicted to reduce total hospitalizations by 48% (95% CI, 47-49%), with peak COVID-19 hospital occupancy of 70% of total beds. Targeted school closures can further reduce the peak occupancy. Conclusions Combining low-impact interventions may mitigate the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, keeping hospital burden within the capacity of the healthcare system. Under this approach SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the community, moving toward herd immunity, while minimizing social and economic disruption.","Jackson, M.

CONCLUSION: It is common for patients with COVID-19 to have the coexistence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and so on, which may exacerbate the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, optimal management of hypertension and other comorbidities is essential for better clinical outcomes.","Chen, Liqin; Chen, Jiankun; Wu, Yuwan; Zhong, Jinyao; Zhou, Fuzhen; Liu, Yuntao; Xu, Aiting; Li, Jiqiang; Cai, Huayang",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429644/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s324077,444
