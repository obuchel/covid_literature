Modulating the activity and stability of cGAS provides potential strategies for treating viral or autoimmune diseases. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 29 (USP29) deubiquitinates and stabilizes cGAS and promotes cellular antiviral responses and autoimmunity. Knockdown or knockout of USP29 severely impairs Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)- or cytosolic DNA-induced expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Consistently, Usp29(m/m) mice produce decreased type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines after HSV-1 infection and are hypersensitive to HSV-1 infection compared to the wild-type littermates. In addition, genetic ablation of USP29 in Trex1(−/−) mice eliminated the detectable pathological and molecular autoimmune phenotypes. Mechanistically, USP29 constitutively interacts with cGAS, deconjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from cGAS and stabilizes cGAS in uninfected cells or after HSV-1 infection. Reconstitution of cGAS into Usp29(−/−) cells fully rescues type I IFN induction and cellular antiviral responses after HSV-1 infection. Our findings thus reveal a critical role of USP29 in the innate antiviral responses against DNA viruses and autoimmune diseases and provide insight into the regulation of cGAS.","Zhang, Qiang; Tang, Zhen; An, Ran; Ye, Liya; Zhong, Bo",Cell Res,648,1

This Article investigates SVRR, using a lifetime utility model in which individuals are differentiated by age, lifetime income profile, and lifetime risk profile. We consider both the utilitarian SWF and a “prioritarian” SWF, which applies a strictly increasing and strictly concave transformation to individual utility. We show that the prioritarian SVRR provides a rigorous basis in economic theory for the “fair innings” concept, proposed in the public health literature: as between an older individual and a similarly situated younger individual (one with the same income and risk profile), a risk reduction for the younger individual is accorded greater social weight even if the gains to expected lifetime utility are equal. The comparative statics of prioritarian and utilitarian SVRRs with respect to age, and to (past, present, and future) income and baseline survival probability, are significantly different from the conventional value per statistical life (VSL). Our empirical simulation based upon the U.S. population survival curve and income distribution shows that prioritarian SVRRs with a moderate degree of concavity in the transformation function conform to widely held views regarding lifesaving policies: the young should take priority but income should make no difference.","Adler, Matthew D.; Ferranna, Maddalena; Hammitt, James K.; Treich, Nicolas",J Health Econ,648,1

Although the use of rituximab greatly reduces the morbidity of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), severe adverse effects, such as infection and biliary complications, still seriously threaten the survival of transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to replace rituximab in ABO-i LT. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with severe hepatic failure undergoing ABO-i LT were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: the MSC group and the rituximab group. The safety of the application of MSCs and the incidence of allograft rejection, including antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and acute cellular rejection (ACR), were evaluated in both groups at the 2-year follow-up period as primary endpoints. Recipients and graft survival and other postoperative complications were compared as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: No severe MSC-related adverse events were observed during the trial. MSC treatment yielded comparable, if not better, results than rituximab at decreasing the incidence of acute rejection (9.1% vs 27.3%). Inspiringly, compared to those in the rituximab group, the rates of biliary complications (0% vs 45.5%) and infection (9.1% vs 81.8%) were significantly decreased in the MSC group. In addition, there were no significant differences in 2-year graft and recipient survival between the two groups (81.8% vs 72.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that MSC transfusion is comparable to rituximab treatment for AMR prophylaxis following ABO-i LT. Additionally, the results indicate that MSCs are more beneficial to the prevention of infection and biliary complications and may be introduced as a novel immunosuppressive approach for ABO-i LT.

Scaffold/ Matrix attachment regions (S/MAR) punctuate these attachment sites and govern the nuclear architecture by establishing chromatin boundaries. In this context, specific proteins that interact with and bind to MAR sequences called MAR binding proteins (MARBPs), are of paramount importance, as these sequences spool the proteins that regulate transcription, replication, repair and recombination. Recent evidences also suggest a role for these cis-acting elements in viral integration, replication and transcription, thereby affecting host immune system. Owing to the complex nature of these nucleotide sequences, less is known about the MARBPs that bind to and bring about diverse effects on chromatin architecture and gene function. Several MARBPs have been identified and characterized so far and the list is growing. The fact that most the MARBPs exist in a co-repressor/ co-activator complex and bring about gene regulation makes them quintessential for cellular processes. This participation in gene regulation means that any perturbation in the regulation and levels of MARBPs could lead to disease conditions, particularly those caused by abnormal cell proliferation, like cancer. In the present chapter, we discuss the role of MARs and MARBPs in eukaryotic gene regulation, recombination, transcription and viral integration by altering the local chromatin structure and their dysregulation in disease manifestation","Chattopadhyay, Samit; Pavithra, Lakshminarasimhan",Chromatin and Disease,648,1

The interest in developing a vaccine arose both because FIV is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in pet cats and because the feline virus provides a model for its counterpart in man, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for which an effective vaccine is urgently required to halt the current tragic pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Shortly after the discovery of FIV and its characterization as a lentivirus, attempts were made to produce a vaccine and success was soon achieved with relatively simple inactivated virus or inactivated virus-infected cell vaccines.82 Further development of this approach led to the introduction in 2002 of the first commercial vaccine against FIV.59 With an estimated prevalence of the infection of up to 25% in populations of pet cats, an effective FIV vaccine could have a significant influence on animal welfare.

RESEARCH: Many studies seek to enhance the effects of catechins on the human body and boost their protective power against UV radiation. There are many examples of the positive anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergenic, and anti-cancer effects of catechins. Catechins increase the penetration and absorption of healthy functional foods and bio cosmetics into the body and the skin, thus improving their utility. High value-added anti-oxidant substances have been extracted from food and plant sludge, and experiments have shown that catechins are safe when applied to the human body. The stability of catechins is very important for their absorption into the human body and the effectiveness of their anti-oxidant properties. CONCLUSION: Continued research on the strong anti-oxidant effects of catechins is expected to result in many advances in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.","Bae, Joonseo; Kim, Nayoung; Shin, Yunyoung; Kim, Soo-Yeon; Kim, You-Jeong",,648,17

To deal with the issue, we propose to model the interactions between attributes, instead of globally embedding an entity with all the attributes. We further propose a joint framework to merge the alignments inferred from the attributes and the structures.

Identifying potential decision options and communicating them to stakeholders is a challenging task as it requires the translation of the decision option’s technical dimension to a stakeholder-compliant language which describes the impact of the decision (e.g., financial, political). Existing knowledge-driven decision support methods generate decision options by automatically processing available data and knowledge. Ontology-based methods emerged as a sub-field in the medical domain and provide concrete instructions for given medical problems. However, the research field lacks an evaluated practical approach to support the full cycle from data and knowledge assessment to the actual decision making. This work advances the field by: (i) a problem-driven ontology engineering method which (a) supports creating the necessary ontology model for the given problem domain and (b) harmonizes relevant data and knowledge sources for automatically identifying decision options by reasoners, and (ii) an approach which translates technical decision options into a language that is understood by relevant stakeholders.

In conventional morphing simulations, a simulation is performed while deforming a model shape and the computational grid using the boundary fitting grid. However, it is necessary to deform the computational grid each time, and it is difficult to apply to a model with complicated shape. The present method does not require grid regeneration or deformation. In order to apply the present method to models with various shapes on the Cartesian grid, the seamless immersed boundary method (SIBM) is used. Normally, when the SIBM is applied to a deformed object, the velocity condition on the boundary is imposed by the moving velocity of the boundary. In the present method, the velocity condition is imposed by zero velocity even if the object is deformed because the purpose of the present morphing simulation is to obtain simulation results for a stationary object. In order to verify the present method, two-dimensional simulations for the flow around an object were performed. In order to obtain drag coefficients of multiple models, the object was deformed in turn from the initial model to each model in the present morphing simulation. By using the present method, the drag coefficients for some models could be obtained by one simulation. It is concluded that the flow simulation for shape optimization can be performed very easily by using the present morphing simulation method.","Tajiri, Kyohei; Tanaka, Mitsuru; Yamakawa, Masashi; Nishida, Hidetoshi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,648,16

However, BFO performs poorly in convergence when coping with more complex optimization problems, especially multimodal and high dimensional tasks. Aiming to address these issues, we therefore seek to propose a hybrid strategy to improve the BFO algorithm in each stage of the bacteria’s’ foraging behavior. Firstly, a non-linear descending strategy of step size is adopted in the process of flipping, where a larger step size is given to the particle at the very beginning of the iteration, promoting the rapid convergence of the algorithm while later on a smaller step size is given, helping enhance the particles’ global search ability. Secondly, an adaptive adjustment strategy of particle aggregation is introduced when calculating step size of the bacteria’s swimming behavior. In this way, the particles will adjust the step size according to the degree of crowding to achieve efficient swimming. Thirdly, a roulette strategy is applied to enable the excellent particles to enjoy higher replication probability in the replication step. A linear descent elimination strategy is adopted finally in the elimination process. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved algorithm performs well in both single-peak function and multi-peak function, having strong convergence ability and search ability.","Cao, Weifu; Tan, Yingshi; Huang, Miaojia; Luo, Yuxi",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,648,16

A recent clinical trial of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery reported no significant difference in mortality rates between the use of VAs and total intravenous anesthetics at 1 year postoperatively. However, oxygenator function may affect the VA pharmacokinetics. Thus, we measured the VA blood concentrations during CPB in patients managed with four different microporous polypropylene hollow fiber membrane oxygenators. METHODS: Twenty-four patients scheduled for elective CPB were randomly allocated to one of the two VA groups (desflurane and sevoflurane groups) and, then, randomly divided into one of four oxygenator groups: Terumo, LivaNova, Medtronic, and Senko (n = 3). Additionally, in each VA group, three patients were randomly selected and redundantly allocated to the human lung group (for control blood VA concentration without oxygenator). Blood samples collected 20 min after starting 6.0 vol% desflurane or 1.7 vol% sevoflurane were analyzed using gas chromatography. Oxygenator-related complications and structural changes in the membrane surface of each oxygenator after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) concentrations of desflurane and sevoflurane in the human lung were 182.4 (23.2) and 54.0 (9.6) μg/ml, respectively; not significantly different from those in the four oxygenator groups. No oxygenator-related complications occurred. Structural changes in membrane fibers did not occur after clinical use, except for difficulty in image acquisition with Senko products. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the blood concentrations of desflurane and sevoflurane passing through oxygenators used during CPB were similar to those in the human lung control.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. As there are no confirmed antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, discovering potent inhibitors or vaccines are urgently required for the benefit of humanity. The glycosylated Spike protein (S-protein) directly interacts with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein. As the S-protein is exposed to the surface and is essential for entry into the host, the S-protein can be considered as a first-line therapeutic target for antiviral therapy and vaccine development. In silico screening, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to identify repurposing drugs using DrugBank and PubChem library against the RBD of S-protein. The study identified a laxative drug, Bisoxatin (DB09219), which is used for the treatment of constipation and preparation of the colon for surgical procedures. It binds nicely at the S-protein–ACE2 interface by making substantial π-π interactions with Tyr505 in the ‘Site 1’ hook region of RBD and hydrophilic interactions with Glu406, Ser494, and Thr500. Bisoxatin consistently binds to the protein throughout the 100 ns simulation. Taken together, we propose that the discovered molecule, Bisoxatin may be a promising repurposable drug molecule to develop new chemical libraries for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host.","Unni, Sruthi; Aouti, Snehal; Thiyagarajan, Saravanamuthu; Padmanabhan, Balasundaram",J Biosci,648,22

Many radiological findings have shown that X-ray and CT imaging scans are an effective solution to assess disease severity during the early stage of COVID-19. Many artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis works have rapidly been proposed to focus on solving this classification problem and determine whether a patient is infected with COVID-19. Most of these works have designed networks and applied a single CT image to perform classification; however, this approach ignores prior information such as the patient’s clinical symptoms. Second, making a more specific diagnosis of clinical severity, such as slight or severe, is worthy of attention and is conducive to determining better follow-up treatments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) based dual-tasks network, named FaNet, that can perform rapid both diagnosis and severity assessments for COVID-19 based on the combination of 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms. Generally, 3D CT image sequences provide more spatial information than do single CT images. In addition, the clinical symptoms can be considered as prior information to improve the assessment accuracy; these symptoms are typically quickly and easily accessible to radiologists. Therefore, we designed a network that considers both CT image information and existing clinical symptom information and conducted experiments on 416 patient data, including 207 normal chest CT cases and 209 COVID-19 confirmed ones. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional symptom prior information as well as the network architecture designing. The proposed FaNet achieved an accuracy of 98.28% on diagnosis assessment and 94.83% on severity assessment for test datasets. In the future, we will collect more covid-CT patient data and seek further improvement.","Huang, Zhenxing; Liu, Xinfeng; Wang, Rongpin; Zhang, Mudan; Zeng, Xianchun; Liu, Jun; Yang, Yongfeng; Liu, Xin; Zheng, Hairong; Liang, Dong; Hu, Zhanli",Appl Intell,648,16

42624,42624,42624,Correction to: A Review of Pandemics,17.597494,4.4792194,2020-12-02,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Polysomnography (PSG) represents a fundamental diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of sleep disorders. It represents a simultaneous recording of sleep staging, eye movements, electromyographic tone, respiratory parameters, and electrocardiogram. It is particularly helpful in the assessment of sleep-disordered breathing and its management, propensity for excessive sleepiness, complex behaviors during sleep, including motor disturbances of sleep, sleep-related epilepsy, and parasomnias. This review is intended to summarize the indications for PSG, the limitations and challenges of this diagnostic tool, indications for home sleep apnea testing options, and new developments and trends in polysomnography. RECENT FINDINGS: The polysomnogram is fundamentally important in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in the setting of cardiovascular comorbidities and neurologic conditions such as neuromuscular disease, stroke, and epilepsy and in the evaluation of dream enactment behavior in the setting of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Because RBD is predictive of neurodegenerative disorders, recent data highlights the importance of PSG in corroborating the diagnosis of RBD and identifying people who may be at risk. However, due to cost as well as limitations in access to care, further testing has been developed and implemented including the home sleep apnea test (HSAT). The evolution of consumer wearable devices has also been a growing trend in sleep medicine; however, few have received appropriate validation. SUMMARY: PSG has been used in both the clinical and research settings and remains the gold standard clinical diagnostic test for suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA). Clinicians must be familiar with the basic indications for a PSG but also recognize when it is absolutely required. At this time, the PSG is essential in the evaluation of nocturnal hypoventilation disorders of sleep, periodic limb movements of sleep, and central nervous system hypersomnia (in the absence of CSF hypocretin) when combined with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and is probably the only way to help differentiate among complex behaviors during sleep, especially in the setting of RBD. The capacity to establish an early diagnostic risk of potential dementia would be of critical importance once neuroprotective agents become available.","Markun, Leslie C.; Sampat, Ajay",Curr Sleep Med Rep,648,1

ADAPTATION OF A GAMMA KNIFE ICON STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY PROGRAM IN THE FACE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC,17.249485,4.1695714,2020-11-09,"PURPOSE: Safety culture is known to be related to a wide range of outcomes, and measurement of safety culture is now required for many hospitals in the U.S.A. In previous reviews, the association with outcomes has been limited by the research design and strength of the evidence. The goal of this review was to examine recent literature on the relationship between safety culture and infection prevention and control-related (IPC) processes and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in U.S. healthcare organizations. We also sought to quantitatively characterize the challenges to empirically establishing these relationships and limitations of current research. RECENT FINDINGS: A PubMed search for U.S. articles published 2009–2019 on the topics of infection prevention, HAIs, and safety culture yielded 448 abstracts. After screening, 55 articles were abstracted for information on purpose, measurement, analysis, and conclusions drawn about the role of safety culture in the outcome. Approximately ½ were quality improvement (QI) initiatives and ½ were research studies. Overall, 51 (92.7%) concluded there was an association between safety culture and IPC processes or HAIs. However, only 39 studies measured safety culture and 26 statistically analyzed safety culture data for associations. Though fewer QI initiatives analyzed associations, a higher proportion concluded an association exists than among research studies. SUMMARY: Despite limited empirical evidence and methodologic challenges to establishing associations, most articles supported a positive relationship between safety culture, improvement in IPC processes, and decreases in HAIs. Authors frequently reported experiencing improvements in safety culture when not directly measured. The findings suggest that associations between improvement and safety culture may be bi-directional such that positive safety culture contributes to successful interventions and implementing effective interventions drives improvements in culture. Greater attention to article purpose, design, and analysis is needed to confirm these presumptive relationships.","Braun, Barbara I.; Chitavi, Salome O.; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Soyemi, Caroline A.; Puig-Asensio, Mireia",Curr Infect Dis Rep,648,1

In addition to mild to moderate clinical manifestations such as fever, cough, and fatigue, severe cases often developed lethal complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury. Given the alarming rate of infection and increasing trend of mortality, the development of underlying therapeutic and preventive treatment, as well as the verification of its effectiveness, are the top priorities. Current research mainly referred to and evaluated the application of the empirical treatment based on two precedents, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including antiviral drugs targeting different stages of virus replication, immunotherapy modulating the overactivated inflammation response, and other therapies such as herbal medicine and mesenchymal stem cells. Besides, the ongoing development of inventing prophylactic interventions such as various vaccines by companies and institutions worldwide is crucial to decline morbidity and mortality. This review mainly focused on promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 and collected recently updated evidence relevant to its feasibility in clinical practice in the near future.","Xiao, Yinan; Xu, Hanyue; Guo, Wen; Zhao, Yunuo; Luo, Yuling; Wang, Ming; He, Zhiyao; Ding, Zhenyu; Liu, Jiyan; Deng, Lei; Sha, Fushen; Ma, Xuelei",Mol Biomed,648,23

Our aim was to evaluate the short-term effect of HFNT versus NIV in patients with mild-to-moderate AECOPD, with the hypothesis that HFNT is non-inferior to NIV on CO(2) clearance after 2 h of treatment. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, non-inferiority randomized trial comparing HFNT and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in nine centers in Italy. Patients were eligible if presented with mild-to-moderate AECOPD (arterial pH 7.25–7.35, PaCO(2) ≥ 55 mmHg before ventilator support). Primary endpoint was the mean difference of PaCO(2) from baseline to 2 h (non-inferiority margin 10 mmHg) in the per-protocol analysis. Main secondary endpoints were non-inferiority of HFNT to NIV in reducing PaCO(2) at 6 h in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis and rate of treatment changes. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were analyzed (80 patients randomized). Mean differences for PaCO(2) reduction from baseline to 2 h were − 6.8 mmHg (± 8.7) in the HFNT and − 9.5 mmHg (± 8.5) in the NIV group (p = 0.404). By 6 h, 32% of patients (13 out of 40) in the HFNT group switched to NIV and one to invasive ventilation. HFNT was statistically non-inferior to NIV since the 95% confidence interval (CI) upper boundary of absolute difference in mean PaCO(2) reduction did not reach the non-inferiority margin of 10 mmHg (absolute difference 2.7 mmHg; 1-sided 95% CI 6.1; p = 0.0003). Both treatments had a significant effect on PaCO(2) reductions over time, and trends were similar between groups. Similar results were found in both per-protocol at 6 h and intention-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HFNT was statistically non-inferior to NIV as initial ventilatory support in decreasing PaCO(2) after 2 h of treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate AECOPD, considering a non-inferiority margin of 10 mmHg. However, 32% of patients receiving HFNT required NIV by 6 h. Further trials with superiority design should evaluate efficacy toward stronger patient-related outcomes and safety of HFNT in AECOPD. Trial registration: The study was prospectively registered on December 12, 2017, in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03370666).","Cortegiani, Andrea; Longhini, Federico; Madotto, Fabiana; Groff, Paolo; Scala, Raffaele; Crimi, Claudia; Carlucci, Annalisa; Bruni, Andrea; Garofalo, Eugenio; Raineri, Santi Maurizio; Tonelli, Roberto; Comellini, Vittoria; Lupia, Enrico; Vetrugno, Luigi; Clini, Enrico; Giarratano, Antonino; Nava, Stefano; Navalesi, Paolo; Gregoretti, Cesare",Crit Care,648,1

Respiratory pacing is an alternative approach using electrical stimulation-induced diaphragm contraction to ventilate the lung. Oxygenation and acid–base homeostasis are maintained by matching ventilation to metabolic needs; however, current pacing technology requires manual tuning and does not respond to dynamic user-specific metabolic demand, thus requiring re-tuning of stimulation parameters as physiological changes occur. Here, we describe respiratory pacing using a closed-loop adaptive controller that can self-adjust in real-time to meet metabolic needs. The controller uses an adaptive Pattern Generator Pattern Shaper (PG/PS) architecture that autonomously generates a desired ventilatory pattern in response to dynamic changes in arterial CO(2) levels and, based on a learning algorithm, modulates stimulation intensity and respiratory cycle duration to evoke this ventilatory pattern. In vivo experiments in rats with respiratory depression and in those with a paralyzed hemidiaphragm confirmed that the controller can adapt and control ventilation to ameliorate hypoventilation and restore normocapnia regardless of the cause of respiratory dysfunction. This novel closed-loop bioelectronic controller advances the state-of-art in respiratory pacing by demonstrating the ability to automatically personalize stimulation patterns and adapt to achieve adequate ventilation.","Siu, Ricardo; Abbas, James J.; Fuller, David D.; Gomes, Jefferson; Renaud, Sylvie; Jung, Ranu",Sci Rep,648,26

Questions explored perceptions of staff about effects on caregivers and implications for systems of support for caregivers. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using the Dedoose software. Caregiver effects included increased isolation, higher stress, loss of support, neglected health needs, and accelerated technology adoption. Caregivers at particular risk were those facing multiple demands and experiencing compromised resources under the pandemic, such as closure of adult day care. System effects included challenges with hastened virtual delivery, disruption in services, and new opportunities to serve clients virtually. Community resources, such as internet connectivity, exacerbated disparities for family caregivers. We make recommendations to mitigate these challenges including technology platforms to support service delivery and education, training and preparedness for both caregivers and providers.

We are facing four very deep and interconnected global environmental crises: human-induced climate change, unsustainable land use, mega-pollution, and increased frequency and intensity of pandemic zoonotic diseases. At the same time, we face massive social crises, including increasing inequality. There are six necessary SDG Transformations that each requires a major change in the organization of societal, political, and economic activities – which delineates also the critical role of business. The paper specifies four key questions that companies and their stakeholders can ask to effectively align with the ""Decade of Action"" needed to achieve the SDG ambitions.","Sachs, Jeffrey D.; Sachs, Lisa E.",J Int Bus Policy,648,16

As a vital component of built environments, green space plays a key role in individuals' psychological well-being; however, the mediating effect of residents' satisfaction with the green space environment on the relationship between urban greening and residents' mental health in Chinese contexts has yet to be thoroughly explored. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper attempts to reveal the internal logic and mechanism underlying the linkages between green space, residents' mental health, and their satisfaction with green space in Shenzhen, China. Specifically, this paper explores the mediating role of residents' satisfaction with a green space environment using questionnaire survey data, “Quick Bird-2” high-resolution remote sensing image data, and a multilevel regression model. Our empirical findings indicate that the relative range of neighboring green spaces can directly improve residents' mental health. More importantly, the relationship between the relative scope of green space and residents' mental health is mediated by residents' satisfaction with the green space environment rather than its direct health effects. Given the influence of green space on residents' satisfaction with the environment, green space indirectly affects mental health. These findings should provide the government useful guidance for considering the spatial distribution and quantity of green space. Our results should also help residents improve their actual experiences and subjective satisfaction with the green space environment.","Qiao, Yuhan; Chen, Zini; Chen, Yuqing; Zheng, Tianxiang",Front Public Health,648,3

The authors offer an epidemiology of ethics for a large, metropolitan, very-high-research-activity (R1) university in the U.S. Where epidemiology of a pandemic looks at quantifiable data on infection and exposure rates, control, and broad implications for public health, an epidemiology of ethics looks to parallel data on those same themes. Their hypothesis is that knowing more about how undergraduates are exposed to ethics will help us understand to what extent they are infected with interest in ethics literacy, and potentially what immunity they develop against unethical and unprofessional conduct. These data also tell a story about the ethical health of institutions: to what extent its members are empowered to cultivate a culture of ethics and inoculated against ethical missteps. The authors argue that pro-ethics inoculation at research institutions is shaped by issues of complexity (space given to “hard” vs. “soft” skills within curricula), connotation (differences in meaning of “ethics” among and within disciplines), and collaboration (tensions between Ethics-Across-the-Curriculum and Ethics-In-the-Disciplines approaches to ethics). These issues make assessment of where ethics is taught all the more difficult. The methodology used in this project can readily be taken up by other institutions, with much to be learned from inter-institutional comparisons about the distribution of ethics across the curriculum and within the disciplines.","Beever, Jonathan; Kuebler, Stephen M.; Collins, Jordan",International Journal of Ethics Education,648,16

In other words, the vulnerability assessment represents one of the main input elements for resilience analysis at urban scale. However, facing with a large-scale study, a building-specific assessment approach appears extremely difficult and time-consuming. In this optic, the definition of territorial-specific structural typologies and corresponding vulnerability classes represent a powerful tool for a rapid estimation of the “global vulnerability” of an examined area. As a matter of fact, the classification of the built heritage in a limited number of structural typologies (featuring similar characteristics) could sensibly reduce the complexity of the vulnerability assessment, hence resilience analysis, at urban scale. In this paper, an investigation on the built heritage of the city centre of Potenza (south of Italy) is proposed. In particular, the main typological and structural features of the residential Reinforced Concrete (RC) constructions, detected in the investigated territory, have been identified through an integrated approach involving: Census data, documentary analyses, site and virtual inspections (i.e. GIS-based analysis). The typological-structural characterization represents the first step of a comprehensive study, carried out within the PON-AIM 2014–2020 project, aimed at the evaluation of the seismic resilience of the examined area.","Flora, Amedeo; Iacovino, Chiara; Cardone, Donatello; Vona, Marco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,648,1

The view persists because it suits officials on both sides to consider this to be so, but what matters more in winning business in China is patience, determination, and good contacts. To date, however, the UK’s approach has been hampered by the lack of a clear strategy or consistent policy, with frequent and extreme changes in approach, together with an under-performing diplomatic presence in the country. This mattered less while it was a member of the EU, as this gave it ‘safety in numbers’ against possible Chinese retaliation. Outside the EU, the UK will be more isolated.

It has been accused of being an economically and racially elite practice, accessible to only rich white men and women. On the other hand, CrossFit has been embraced by a variety of both white and Black feminist fitness practitioners as a practice of freedom.

The situation is further compounded by human beings who are leading increasingly resource-intensive lifestyles. Climate change is a major threat to public health. Our health systems are already under pressure, and they are being further crippled by a rise in the incidence of heat waves, floods, droughts, and other vagaries of nature. It is the poor and developing countries that are bearing the highest brunt of climate change. According to some estimates, 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. The health consequences of this are already proving to be lethal, with the State of Global Air Report, 2019 highlighting that over 1.2 million deaths took place in India in 2017 due to air pollution on account of conditions such as stroke, heart disease, and lung cancer. In fact, the Global Burden of Disease Study, 2017, shows that “India accounts for a higher proportion of global health loss owing to air pollution as compared to the country’s proportion of the worldwide population.” In the recent past, the severity of the situation and therefore the need for urgent measures have gained traction within the political and policy spheres in the country. In this chapter, we review the global best practices along with their applicability to the Indian context, as well as initiatives that have been taken in India with respect to mitigating climate change and air pollution. Based on this, we also make recommendations for tackling this growing public health emergency and protecting the well-being of the current and future generations.

Followed U.S. theoretical framework, some studies discussed the differences between Chinese and U.S. online teaching and instructors. But how Chinese online instructors, especially beginning online instructors, perceiving the online teaching competencies, and how this framework would differ from the U.S. framework, was less discussed.

Faced with COVID-19, we took the opportunity to digitalise CGA documentation to preserve these benefits for patients whilst facing greater acuity, staffing and time pressures. An electronic solution was adopted to reduce paper-usage in COVID-receiving areas. Prior to COVID-19, CGA was recorded within case-notes, presenting challenges when patients were readmitted out-of-hours as these were stored off-site and not accessible out-of-hours. METHOD: Trakcare is the patient-management system in many Scottish hospitals. The Electronic Patient Record (EPR) was used to record pro-forma against admissions which were accessible and updatable for any patient 24–7-365. Patients meeting the Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) Frailty criteria were considered “frailty-positive”, with an e-alert added- reappearing on any re-admission. Providing no HIS-exclusion criteria, an electronic-CGA (e-CGA) was recorded or updated. The pro-forma designed contained information not immediately available to clerking practitioners. This evolved following discussion amongst the FIT to include information such as escalation-status, medication-arrangements and baseline cognition. RESULTS: Over 13 weeks, 116 EPRs were reviewed. During weeks 1–3 (n = 8, 12, 7 respectively), e-CGA completion averaged 31%. Following FIT collaboration, this rose to 82% (n = 9) by week 12. Qualitative feedback from the MDT indicated that FIT, downstream wards and night-staff felt that having access to previous escalation-plans made immediate-management easier to determine, and discussions with families more productive for patients. CONCLUSIONS: Development of the FVRH e-CGA is ongoing, with an electronic frailty-screening tool being implemented to improve frailty-identification on admission to ensure correct streaming of patients to the FIT. We have demonstrated a cost-neutral method for improving access to CGA for patients using existing IT systems whilst protecting staff time, preserving patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rodgerson, M J; McNeil, L",Age Ageing,648,20

This zoonotic pandemic is proving to be the most destructive disease outbreaks since decades. The increasing human population and anthropogenic activities have impacted the environment and have direct linkages with the current and other recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. Despite having a difference in their origin, major reasons behind the emergence and spread of zoonotic pandemics are related to activities such as habitat fragmentation, deforestation, biodiversity loss, intensive agriculture and livestock farming, uncontrolled urbanization, pollution, climate change and bushmeat hunting and trading. It is important to focus on environmental and climatic factors that are involved in the emergence of such pandemics involving novel human pathogens and viruses in particular. Research and data analysis, particularly in relation to COVID-19, has shown that meteorological factors along with population density and living conditions (particularly in the urban and semi-urban areas) play a crucial role in the intensity, evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Disease deterioration tends to occur when the virus is receding; however, whether other factors besides viral products are involved in the inflammatory cascade remains unclear. METHODS: Twenty-eight COVID-19 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital from January 23 to February 20, 2020 and nine healthy donors during the same period were recruited in the study. COVID-19 patients were grouped as mild, moderate, severe based on disease severity. Plasma damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), calprotectin (S100A8/A9), surfactant protein A (SP-A), cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP), and Histone H4 were detected by ELISA assay, and analyzed in combination with clinical data. Plasma cytokines, chemokines and lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Plasma levels of HMGB1 (38292.3 ± 4564.4 vs. 32686.3 ± 3678.1, P = 0.002), S100A8/A9 (1490.8 ± 819.3 vs. 742.2 ± 300.8, P = 0.015), and SP-A (6713.6 ± 1708.7 vs. 5296.3 ± 1240.4, P = 0.048) were increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors, while CIRBP (57.4 ± 30.7 vs. 111.9 ± 55.2, P = 0.004) levels decreased. Five DAMPs did not vary among mild, moderate, and severe patients. Moreover, SP-A levels correlated positively with inflammatory cytokines and negatively with time elapsed after symptom onset, whereas CIRBP showed an opposite pattern. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest SP-A may involve in the inflammation of COVID-19, while CIRBP likely plays a protective role.

Establishing a sound theoretical rationale is key to identifying “true” factors, and we emphasize the need to recognize data-mining concerns that may cast doubt on the relevance of many factors. From a practical investment perspective, much of the factor evidence documented by academics may be more apparent than real. The performance of many factors is dependent on the inclusion of small- and micro-cap stocks in academic studies, although such stocks would likely be excluded from the real investment universe due to illiquidity and transaction costs. Nevertheless, a parsimonious set of factors emerges in equities and other asset classes, including currencies, fixed income, and commodities.

A Systematic Review,17.71044,8.261641,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on healthcare service delivery. Acute cardiovascular care however remains a priority despite the pandemic. Patients presenting with non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) have been poorly characterised during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with NSTEMI during the peak of the pandemic between April-May 2020 at our tertiary centre in the UK. Data was collected from electronic patient clinical records including time from admission to angiography, length of stay, mortality, prescription of secondary prevention pharmacotherapy and referral to cardiac rehabilitation. We compared this data to the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: As can be seen from Table 1, in 2020, the mean age, median time to angiography and length of stay were all significantly lower than the control period of 2019. Prescription of secondary prevention medication (Aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, Beta-blocker, Statin and ACEi/ARB) and referral to cardiac rehabilitation also improved in 2020, however neither was statistically significant. During the 2020 period, 1 patient died due to late presentation NSTEMI and multi-organ failure. There were 3 deaths in 2019: complications following coronary bypass surgery, upper GI bleed and a subarachnoid haemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the mean age of the patients presenting with NSTEMI during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic was younger suggesting that elderly patients failed to present. Compared to 2019, there was significant improvement in patient treatment times with a significantly shorter stay in hospital, probably as a result of the reduction in elective activity allowing un-restrained access to the catheter labs. We also saw improvement in prescription for secondary prevention and referral to cardiac rehabilitation services during this time suggesting that there may have been improved focus on these aspects of care again.","Hussain, S; Osman, S; Osheiba, M; Choy, CH; Mortimer, N; Ludman, P; Townend, J; Nadir, A; Doshi, S; George, S; Zaphiriou, A; Khan, SQ",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,648,16

During the first wave of the pandemic, and in common with other departments, almost all our patient consultations happened over the phone. As the rate of infection fell, we felt it was crucial that the patient voice was heard as we re-organised clinical areas and re-opened services. In view of this, we conducted an online survey to better understand patient concerns around visiting our hospital for appointments and how we can adapt the way we work to ensure patient safety and satisfaction. Methods Using our electronic patient record, we identified patients from the clinic lists of 2 adult rheumatology consultants over a 6-week period between June and August 2020. This timeframe was selected as it was towards the end of the UK nationwide shielding period and our department was returning to deliver an increasing proportion of outpatient care face-to-face. Included patients had to have been treated with an immunosuppressive drug and only those on monotherapy hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine or prednisolone under 5mg were excluded. We consented each patient via telephone before sending them an email link to an online anonymised survey. This included a combination of 9 multiple choice and white space questions. Results 65 patients were identified of which 16 were excluded as we were unable to contact them or they declined consent. 49 patients were sent the survey of which 31 responses were received. 21/31 (67%) of patients had been shielding. The survey revealed six themes of concern. These include: lack of social distancing in common hospital areas, lack of personal protective equipment compliance amongst staff, prolonged time spent in waiting rooms, lack of knowledge on new hospital policies, logistics of using public transport to come to the hospital, and the importance of retaining virtual consultations going forward. 55% of patients stated they would feel safe in returning to the hospital for face-to-face appointments over the next few months. Conclusion Important themes have emerged from this project that we have presented to our rheumatology multi-disciplinary team, Director of Innovation and Head of Patient Experience. This has reinforced adaptations in our hospital environment such as installing safe distance seating in waiting rooms and scheduled phlebotomy slots. Further, where possible we call patients before face-to-face appointments to inform them of our safety measures and try to schedule these patients for outside peak travel hours. We acknowledge that using an online survey may limit responses from older individuals or those with English as a second language. Despite this, our project has shown the importance of recognising the unique concerns of rheumatology patients and the value in using their opinions to create a “new normal” for our outpatient environment.

In response to this unexpected situation, supply chain managers have decided to recover and reinforce their supply chains. Considering the expanse of these decisions, project management principle and tools seems inevitable to successfully manage the transformation from before pandemic to post-pandemic supply chains (SCs). In this study, the problem of time–cost tradeoff is extended to time, cost, and risk tradeoff. The risk factor is considered to convey the uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Since projects are affected by the level of pandemic expansion and different countries ruled out various quarantine policies (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lock-down), the tradeoff problem is influenced accordingly. Therefore, a scenario-based robust optimization model is proposed to deal with time, cost, and risk tradeoff problems to reflect the effects of the global pandemic of COVID-19 on managing projects in supply chains. In addition, various quarantine policies (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lock-down) as a prevalent response to the pandemic have been investigated separately. To illustrate the model, a real-world case study in the emerging economy of Iran is examined using the proposed approach. The results indicated that supply chain managers can use the designed model and approach as a tool for a flexible and adaptable decision-making framework dealing with a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad; Behnam, Maryam; Nekoughadirli, Boshra; Joshi, Rohit",Oper Manag Res,648,9

These elevated demands from military operations placed upon a small subset of the population may be resulting in a group of individuals more at-risk for a variety of debilitating health conditions. To better understand how the U.S Veterans health outcomes compared to non-Veterans, this study utilized the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to examine 10 different self-reported morbidities. Yearly age-adjusted, population estimates from 2003 to 2019 were used for Veteran vs. non-Veteran. Complex weights were used to evaluate the panel series for each morbidity overweight/obesity, heart disease, stroke, skin cancer, cancer, COPD, arthritis, mental health, kidney disease, and diabetes. General linear models (GLM’s) were created using 2019 data only to investigate any possible explanatory variables associated with these morbidities. The time series analysis showed that Veterans have disproportionately higher self-reported rates of each morbidity with the exception of mental health issues and heart disease. The GLM showed that when taking into account all the variables, Veterans disproportionately self-reported a higher amount of every morbidity with the exception of mental health. These data present an overall poor state of the health of the average U.S. Veteran. Our study findings suggest that when taken as a whole, these morbidities among Veterans could prompt the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) to help develop more effective health interventions aimed at improving the overall health of the Veterans.","Betancourt, Jose A.; Granados, Paula Stigler; Pacheco, Gerardo J.; Reagan, Julie; Shanmugam, Ramalingam; Topinka, Joseph B.; Beauvais, Bradley M.; Ramamonjiarivelo, Zo H.; Fulton, Lawrence V.",Healthcare (Basel),648,1

We sought to understand how the pandemic has impacted grocery shopping patterns among adolescents and young adults, including the shopping mediums (i.e., in-person, pick-up, or delivery) and types of goods purchased. METHODS: This research is part of MyVoice, a national text message survey of US adolescents and young adults between 14 and 24 years old. In November 2020, this cohort was asked these open-ended questions: 1) During the pandemic, how have you or your family been getting groceries (in-person, pick-up, delivery)? Why? 2) If you or your family have shopped for groceries online during the pandemic, was it pick-up or delivery? How did it go? 3) During the pandemic, have you or your family changed the types of food you are buying? Tell us about it. Responses were assessed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 889 responses (RR = 77.6%), 47% were female, 56% were White, 13% were Hispanic, and median age was 18 (interquartile range 17, 21). Since the pandemic began, 86% of respondents reported at least use of in-person grocery shopping. Meanwhile, 46% indicated they had used a form of online grocery shopping; 26% reported use of delivery and 27% reported use of pick-up. Over half of participants using online shopping had a positive experience. Half of respondents changed their grocery purchase choices since the pandemic began, among whom 33% reported healthier purchases, 27% bought more snack foods, 24% bought in bulk and/or more non-perishable foods, and 10% bought more foods to cook at home. CONCLUSIONS: Among young people, online grocery shopping is widely utilized with generally positive perceptions, although in-person shopping remains most prevalent. While many young people reported healthier purchases, there was a tendency toward more snack and non-perishable foods. Further investigation is needed to understand reasons behind changes in purchasing habits of adolescents and young adults and the impact of these changes on diet quality during the pandemic.

ABSTRACT: COVID-19 pandemic has induced governments to promote strict containment measures which inevitably altered patients’ lifestyle with potential effects on blood pressure (BP) control. We aimed to evaluate the changes in home BP (HBP) during the COVID-19 related lockdown in a cohort of hypertensive patients. Consecutive adult patients with arterial hypertension and stable medical treatment were recruited. HBP values were recorded before and after lockdown in March 2020. An additional set of HBP measurements, recorded one year before the pre-lockdown period, were also considered as reference because of similar environmental temperature. A total of 126 patients were included: 47% males, mean age 66 [58-72], reference HBP 124.78 (9.90)/76.19 (8.10) mmHg. In the whole group, patients during lockdown exhibited lower systolic and diastolic HBP values compared to the pre-lockdown period [123.23 vs 125.05 mmHg, p = 0.008 and 74.45 vs 75.28 mmHg, p = 0.023, respectively]. Patients with uncontrolled HBP showed the most consistent drop of systolic HBP [136.06 (8.36) and 138.0 (2.08) vs 130 (9.35) p = 0.001 and p < 0.001] and diastolic [81.30 (6.75) and 84.9 (1.85) vs 78.78 (9.25), p = 0.018 and p = 0.002] from pre-lockdown to lockdown and when considering reference values taken one year before, respectively. (Figure 1: Mean values at baseline, pre-lockdown and during lockdown in the 3 groups for systolic (A) and diastolic (B) blood pressure (dotted line = uncontrolled BP group, solid line = unstable BP control, dashed line = controlled BP group). *p<.001 (one year before lockdown vs lockdown SBP), #p = 0.001 (pre-lockdown vs lockdown SBP), $p = 0.002 (one year before lockdown vs lockdown DBP), §p = 0.018 (pre-lockdown vs lockdown DBP). Grey box refers to the lockdown period. SBP = systolic blood pressure, DBP = diastolic blood pressure.) In conclusion, this study reports for the first time the occurrence of no changes or even a reduction in home BP of treated hypertensive patients during lockdown due to COVID-19. These results may have implications for the management of patients with high blood pressure not only during the current pandemic but also in case of future lockdown conditions.","Pengo, M; Albini, F; Guglielmi, G; Mollica, C; Soranna, D; Zambra, G; Zambon, A; Bilo, G; Parati, G",Eur J Prev Cardiol,648,22

For example in the case of insomnia, sympathetic overactivity, intrusive thoughts, and emotional instability due to sleep loss can perpetuate further sleep loss the next night and so on. In this article, we put forward a perspective on breaking these vicious cycles based on preeminent theories in global and spatial cognition, that the foundation of the conscious mind is a spatial coordinate system. Based on this we discuss the potential and future of virtual reality therapeutic applications which utilize massive virtual spaces along with biofeedback designed to help break perpetual cycles in depression, anxiety, and insomnia. “Massive spaces” are those which are truly expansive such as when looking to the clear night sky. These virtual realities may take the form of a night sky, fantastical cosmic scenes, or other scenes such as mountain tops. We also hope to inspire research into such a spatial foundation of mind, use of perceived massive spaces for therapy, and the integration of biofeedback into virtual therapies.","Jerath, Ravinder; Beveridge, Connor",Front Psychiatry,648,1

Detection of ST and SPA in wastewater can be used as a surveillance strategy to determine burden of infection and identify priority areas for water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions and vaccination campaigns. However, sensitive and specific detection of ST and SPA in environmental samples has been challenging. In this study, we developed and validated two methods for concentrating and detecting ST/SPA from wastewater: the Moore swab trap method for qualitative results, and ultrafiltration (UF) for sensitive quantitative detection, coupled with qPCR. We then applied these methods for ST and SPA wastewater surveillance in Kolkata, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh, two enteric fever endemic areas. The qPCR assays had a limit of detection of 17 equivalent genome copies (EGC) for ST and 25 EGC for SPA with good reproducibility. In seeded trials, the Moore swab method had a limit of detection of approximately 0.05–0.005 cfu/mL for both ST and SPA. In 53 Moore swab samples collected from three Kolkata pumping stations between September 2019 and March 2020, ST was detected in 69.8% and SPA was detected in 20.8%. Analysis of sewage samples seeded with known amount of ST and SPA and concentrated via the UF method, followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation and qPCR detection demonstrated that UF can effectively recover approximately 8, 5, and 3 log(10) cfu of seeded ST and SPA in 5, 10, and 20 L of wastewater. Using the UF method in Dhaka, ST was detected in 26.7% (8/30) of 20 L drain samples with a range of 0.11–2.10 log(10) EGC per 100 mL and 100% (4/4) of 20 L canal samples with a range of 1.02–2.02 log(10) EGC per 100 mL. These results indicate that the Moore swab and UF methods provide sensitive presence/absence and quantitative detection of ST/SPA in wastewater samples.","Liu, Pengbo; Ibaraki, Makoto; Kapoor, Renuka; Amin, Nuhu; Das, Abhishek; Miah, Rana; Mukhopadhyay, Asish K.; Rahman, Mahbubur; Dutta, Shanta; Moe, Christine L.",Front Microbiol,648,1

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) database of people on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) at the end of 2019 in England and who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 01/03/2020 and 31/08/2020, to analyse incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 among different KRT modalities. Comparisons with 2015-2019 mortality data were used to estimate excess deaths. RESULTS: 2,783 individuals on KRT tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients from more deprived areas (most deprived vs least deprived HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.39) and those with diabetes compared to those without (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.39-1.64) were more likely to test positive. Approximately 25% of in-centre haemodialysis and transplanted patients died within 28 days of testing positive, compared to 36% of those on home therapies. Mortality was higher in those aged ≥80 years compared to those aged 60-79 years (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.34-2.19) and much lower in those listed for transplantation compared to those not listed (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.80). Overall, excess mortality in 2020 for people on KRT was 36% higher than the 2015-2019 average. Excess deaths peaked in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic and were characterised by wide ethnic and regional disparities. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on the English KRT population highlights their extreme vulnerability and emphasises the need to protect and prioritise this group for vaccination. COVID-19 has widened underlying inequalities in people with kidney disease making interventions that address health inequalities a priority.","Savino, Manuela; Santhakumaran, Shalini; Evans, Katharine M; Steenkamp, Retha; Benoy-Deeney, Fran; Medcalf, James F; Nitsch, Dorothea",Clin Kidney J,648,10

For this purpose, rainfall simulation experiments using organic mulching were conducted in Jiufeng National Forestry Park to analyze the influence of organic mulch under different slope and heavy rainfall events. The results showed that soil water content displayed a decreasing tendency with increasing mulch application. Compared to bare soil, a mulch application of 0.25 kg/m2 and 0.50 kg/m2 led to maximum soil water content and maximum runoff decrease occurred for 0.50 kg/m2 mulch. Higher application rate of mulch displayed less soil water content and greater runoff. The runoff amount and runoff generation rate decreased by 28-83% and 21-83%, respectively, as compared to bare soil. With a mulch application of 0.25-1.00 kg/m2, soil drainage accounted for 56-60% of total rainfall. Overall, an efficient mulch application was found to be 0.25-0.50 kg/m2. The results of this study are relevant for arid and semiarid urban regions that experience heavy rainfall.","Wang, Bing; Niu, Jianzhi; Berndtsson, Ronny; Zhang, Linus; Chen, Xiongwen; Li, Xiang; Zhu, Zhijun",Scientific reports,648,5

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification system is useful for predicting clinical prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. However, determining the presence of lymph node involvement in the early stages of gastric cancer is difficult without biopsy. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel serum biomarkers for TNM cancer staging and prognostic follow-up. In this study, we have reported fibrinopeptide-A (FPA) with alanine truncation at the N-terminal as a novel biomarker to differentiate gastric cancer with and without lymph node metastases. We analyzed 369 individual serum samples including gastric cancer patients without lymph node metastases (n = 33), gastric cancer patients with lymph node metastases (n = 157; confirmed by pathology), and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 179). The data showed that 85.4% of patients with lymph node metastases were positive for FPA with alanine truncation at the N-terminal (degAla-FPA, 1,465.63 Da), as determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Using degAla-FPA as the biomarker, the sensitivity was 85.4% for gastric cancer patients with lymph node metastases, and the specificity was 100% for gastric cancer patients without lymph node metastases. The high sensitivity and specificity achieved with serum degAla-FPA levels indicated that MS technology could facilitate the discovery of a novel and quantitative prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer with lymph node involvement.","Zhang, Mei-Hua; Xu, Xiao-Hong; Wang, Yue; Linq, Qi-Xin; Bi, Yun-Tao; Miao, Xiao-Jie; Ye, Chao-Fu; Gao, Shang-Xian; Gong, Cheng-Yu; Xiang, Hang; Dong, Mao-Sheng",Anatomical record,648,27

Data analysis was performed using Colizzi's phenomenological approach. Results Three themes and nine categories were extracted; the main themes were mental strains, physical manifestations, and coping mechanisms. Mental strains entailed concerns, fears and isolation, on the other hand, physical manifestations comprised nervous, respiratory and gastrointestinal system, and systemic disorders. Coping mechanisms included religiosity and home remedies categories. Conclusion Mental strains were the most important issues in the patients with COVID-19, which were interwoven with concerning physical manifestations. Most of the participants used self-medication and spiritual resources to cope with the disease. Therefore, it is recommended to carry out proper planning by healthcare personnel to psychologically and spiritually support these patients, while alleviating physical manifestations of the disease.","Jesmi, Ali-Asghar; Mohammadzade-Tabrizi, Zohreh; Rad, Mostafa; Hosseinzadeh-Younesi, Elyas; Pourhabib, Ali","Medicinski glasnik : official publication of the Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina",648,31

Administration by continuous infusion has been suggested to optimize antibiotic exposure and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment for β-lactams. In an observational study, unbound piperacillin concentrations (n=196) were assessed in 78 critically ill patients following continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam (ratio 8:1). The initial dose of 8, 12 or 16 g (piperacillin component) was determined by individual creatinine clearance (CRCL). Piperacillin concentrations were compared to the EUCAST clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/L), and the following PK/PD targets were evaluated: 100% fT>1xMIC and 100% fT>4xMIC. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM 7.4.3 consisting of a one-compartment disposition model with linear elimination separated into non-renal and renal (linearly increasing with patient CRCL) clearances. Target attainment was predicted and visualized for all individuals based on the utilized CRCL dosing algorithm. The target of 100% fT>1xMIC was achieved for all patients based on the administered dose, but few patients achieved the target of 100% fT>4xMIC. Probability of target attainment for a simulated cohort of patients showed, that increasing the daily dose by 4 g increments (piperacillin component) did not result in substantially improved target attainment for the 100% fT>4xMIC target. To conclude, in patients with high CRCL combined with high-MIC bacterial infections, even a CI regimen with a daily dose of 24 g may be insufficient to achieve therapeutic concentrations.","Klastrup, Vibeke; Thorsted, Anders; Storgaard, Merete; Christensen, Steffen; Friberg, Lena E; Öbrink-Hansen, Kristina",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,648,1

The epidemic has severely affected Thailand's economy and potentially impacted the financial and psychological wellbeing of Thai HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS Between 15 June and 10 December 2020, we conducted qualitative interviews with 26 MSM living with HIV in Thailand who participate in an Adam's Love We Care Study. We intentionally recruited individuals who may have experienced a greater impact of COVID-19. Interviews explored worry, stigma and stress surrounding COVID-19, and multiple domains of potential COVID-19 impact: financial/employment, HIV service delivery and antiretroviral (ART) adherence during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Participants perceived themselves as immunocompromised and susceptible, and feared contracting COVID-19. Participants worried that contracting COVID-19 would lead to HIV status disclosure and stigmatization. Participants had considerable worry about job loss as a result of the economic downturn, and some shared challenges associated with relocation and re-engaging with HIV care. Financial stress and lack of basic necessities caused by job losses were commonly reported. Participants reported optimal ART adherence as a consequence of local HIV service delivery responses, convenient ART refills and Adam's Love online support interventions. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic produced high levels of anxiety and concerns about additional stigma among MSM living with HIV. It had a significant negative effect on the daily lives of our participants. These findings indicate a need for the provision of confidential COVID-19 diagnosis and care, relief programmes, vaccination roll-out equity, and addressing employment needs of vulnerable populations.","Nitpolprasert, Chattiya; Anand, Tarandeep; Phanuphak, Nittaya; Reiss, Peter; Ananworanich, Jintanat; Peay, Holly Landrum",HIV medicine,648,1

It is associated with high morbidity among patients discharged from intensive care units. However, due to its complexities, which encompass physical, psychological, cognitive and social impairments, the exact nature of this condition has not been fully conceptualized. The aim of this analysis therefore was to define the concept of post-intensive care syndrome. This conceptual clarity provides a general definition that is essential for practitioners and researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the syndrome and provide for accurate measurement of its incidence and prevalence. DESIGN The Walker and Avant approach to concept analysis guided this investigation. DATA SOURCE An electronic search of the literature using PubMed, CINHAL, PsycArticles, Academic search complete, Science Direct, MEDLINE and Health Source databases informed the analysis. The search included both quantitative and qualitative studies related to post-intensive care syndrome published in English between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS Of the 3948 articles identified, 24 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. Analysis identified the defining attributes of post-intensive care syndrome as: (1) new or worsening multidimensional impairments; (2) physical dysfunction; (3) psychological disorder; (4) cognitive impairment; (5) failed social reconstruction; and (6) persistent impaired multidimensional symptoms extending beyond intensive care and hospital discharge. Antecedents were divided into two categories: pre-existing and those related to the intensive care admission. Consequences were identified as both positive (for example the establishment of coping processes) and adverse (for example decreased quality of life and caregiver burden). CONCLUSION Post-intensive care syndrome affects more than half of patients discharged from intensive care units. This operational definition and conceptual understanding of this syndrome will help improve understanding and inform the design of preventative strategies to improve long-term consequences of the syndrome. Future research and standardized instrument development will serve to better understand the scope and characteristics of this syndrome and inform the development of possible preventative interventions.","Yuan, Chu; Timmins, Fiona; Thompson, David R",International journal of nursing studies,648,31

METHODS We tested Caiman 5 (C5), Harmonic Scalpel Ace Plus (HA), Harmonic Ace +7 (HA7), LigaSure (LS), and Enseal G2 (ES) on small (2-5 mm), medium (5.1-7 mm), and large (7.1-9 mm) vessels obtained from 15 Yorkshire pigs. Vessels were randomly sealed and transected. We recorded sealing and transection time, charring and carbonization, thermal spread, and bursting pressure (BP). Specimens were sent for histopathologic evaluation of seal quality and thermal spread. RESULTS A total of 246 vessels were evaluated: 125 were arteries and 121 were veins. There was no difference in BPs for small size arteries. For medium arteries, C5 provided the highest BP (proximal and distal jaw), followed by HA7, ES, LS, and HA [1740, 1600, 1165, 1165, 981, and 571 mm Hg, respectively, HA<C5-D(<0.001); HA<C5-P(<0.001); HA<ES(0.002); HA<HA7(0.002); HA7<C5-P(0.026); ES<C5-P(0.026); LS<C5-P(0.001); LS<C5-D(0.014)]. For large arteries, C5 and LS provided highest BP followed by HA7, ES, and HA [1676, 530, 467, 467, and 254 mm Hg, respectively, C5<HA(<0.001); C5<HA7(0.006); C5<ES(0.006); C5<LS(0.012)]. There were no bursting pressure failures for C5, HA7, and LS up to 9 mm vessels. For medium and large size arteries, HA had bursting failure of 20% and 40%, respectively. The ES was significantly less efficient with small, medium, and large arteries with bursting failure rates of 10%, 40%, and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this study, C5 outperformed all other devices. However, all of the devices provide a seal that was superphysiologic in that all burst pressures were >250 mm Hg.","Okhunov, Zhamshid; Yoon, Renai; Lusch, Achim; Spradling, Kyle; Suarez, Melissa; Kaler, Kamaljot S; Patel, Roshan; Hwang, Christina; Osann, Kathy; Huang, Jiaoti; Lee, Thomas; Landman, Jaime",Journal of endourology,648,24

As a result, novel vaccine approaches are needed to generate long-lasting and universal broadly cross-reactive immunity against distinct influenza virus strains and subtypes. Several new vaccine candidates are currently under development and/or in clinical trials. The successful development of new vaccines requires testing in animal models, other than mice, which capture the complexity of the human immune system. Importantly, following vaccination or challenge, the assessment of adaptive immunity at the antigen-specific level is particularly informative. In this study, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cynomolgus macaques, we describe detection methods and in-depth analyses of influenza virus-specific B cells by recombinant hemagglutinin probes and flow cytometry, as well as the detection of influenza virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by stimulation with live influenza A virus and intracellular cytokine staining. We highlight the potential of these assays to be used with PBMCs from other macaque species, including rhesus macaques, pigtail macaques and African green monkeys. We also demonstrate the use of a human cytometric bead array kit in detecting inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from cynomolgus macaques to assess cytokine/chemokine milieu. Overall, the detection of influenza virus-specific B cells and T cells, together with inflammatory responses, as described in our study, provides useful insights for evaluating novel influenza vaccines.

We assessed the efficacy of a novel selective TYK2 inhibitor (TYK2i) in experimental colitis using pharmacological and genetic tools. METHODS At onset of T-cell transfer colitis RAG1 -/- mice received vehicle or TYK2i daily by oral gavage. T-cells lacking TYK2 kinase activity (TYK2 KE) were used to confirm selectivity of the inhibitor. To this end RAG1 -/- or RAG1 -/-TYK2 KE animals were transferred with either wild type (WT) or TYK2 KE-CD45RB high colitogenic T-cells. Loss of bodyweight, endoscopic disease, the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathology scores were recorded. Tissues were analysed ex vivo for lymphocyte populations by flow cytometry. The impact of TYK2 inhibition on human DC-T-cell interactions were studied using autologous Revaxis specific T-cell assays. RESULTS TYK2i (70 mg/kg) prevented weight loss and limited endoscopic activity during T-cell transfer colitis. TYK2i (70 mg/kg) decreased DAI. While transfer of WT T-cells into RAG -/-TYK2 KE hosts induced colitis, TYK2 KE T-cells transferred into RAG1 -/-TYK2 KErecipients failed to do so. Ex vivo analysis showed a decrease in colon tissue Th1 cells and an increase in Th17 cells upon transfer of TYK2 KE-CD45RB high cells. In human antigen triggered T-cells, TYK2i displayed reduced Th1 differentiation similar to murine Th1 cells. CONCLUSION Oral administration of TYK2i, as well as transfer of T-cells lacking TYK2 activity, reduced human Th1 differentiation and ameliorated the course of murine T-cell transfer colitis.

The whole genome of a Ghanaian G6P[6] strain designated PML1965 (2012) was analysed to understand how it evolved in Africa and to learn how its G6 VP7 gene was related to that of rotaviruses of human and artiodactyl origin. The genotype constellation of RVA/Human-wt/GHA/PML1965/2012/G6P[6] was G6-P-[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. It shared sublineages with G6P[6] strains previously detected in Italy and Africa in all genome segments except the VP6 gene of a few Burkinabe and Cameroonian strains and both the VP6 and NSP4 genes of Guinea Bissau strains. The VP7 gene of the G6P[6] strains appeared to derive from those of human G6P[9] strains, and they were distantly related to the VP7 genes of artiodactyl G6 or human G6P[14] strains. The time of the most recent common ancestor of the VP7 sequences of G6P[6] strains was estimated to be the year 1998. The evolutionary rates of the VP7 genes in bovine and human G6 rotaviruses were 6.93 × 10(-4) and 3.42 × 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions site(-1) year(-1), respectively, suggesting an accelerated adaptive process in the new host. The sequences of the remaining 10 genome segments of PML1965 clustered with those of G2 and G8 human rotaviruses detected in Africa possessing the DS-1-like genetic background. In conclusion, PML1965 evolved from G2 or G8 RVA strains with DS-1-like background, acquiring the G6 VP7 gene from a human G6P[9] RVA and not from an artiodactyl G6 RVA strain.","Agbemabiese, Chantal A; Nakagomi, Toyoko; Suzuki, Yoshiyuki; Armah, George; Nakagomi, Osamu",The Journal of general virology,648,31

In this study, we designed and validated a PREM to assess tolerability of endoscopy using conscious sedation. METHODS The patient-reported scale for tolerability of endoscopic procedures (PRO-STEP) consists of questions within 2 domains and is administered to outpatients at discharge from the endoscopy unit. Domain 1 (intraprocedural) consists of 2 questions regarding discomfort/pain and awareness, whereas Domain 2 (postprocedural) consists of 4 questions including pain, nausea, distention and either throat or anal pain. All questions are scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 10. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure internal consistency of the questions. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of higher scores, reported using adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS A total of 255 patients (91 colonoscopy, 73 gastroscopy, and 91 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) were included. Colonoscopy was the least tolerable procedure by recall, with mean intraprocedural awareness and discomfort scores of 5.1 +/- 3.8, and 2.6 +/- 2.7, respectively. Consistency between intraprocedural awareness and discomfort/pain yielded an acceptable Cronbach's alpha of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62 - 0.78). Higher use of midazolam during colonoscopy was inversely associated with an intraprocedural awareness score of 7 or higher (AOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54 per additional mg). CONCLUSIONS PRO-STEP is a simple PREM that can be administered after multiple endoscopic procedures using conscious sedation. Future work should focus on its performance characteristics in adverse event prediction.","Forbes, Nauzer; Chau, Millie; Koury, Hannah F; Lethebe, B Cord; Smith, Zachary L; Wani, Sachin; Keswani, Rajesh N; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Anderson, John T; Heitman, Steven J; Hilsden, Robert J",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,648,1

Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), the direct imaging of magnetic nanoparticles as positive contrast agent and sole signal source, enables high image contrast (no tissue background signal), potential high sensitivity, and quantifiable signal intensity. These properties confer a great potential for application to tumor apoptosis monitoring. In this study, a simple and robust method was used to conjugate Alexa Fluor 647-AnnexinV (AF647-Anx), which can avidly bind to apoptotic cells, to superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles, termed AF647-Anx-SPIO, which serves as an MPI-detectable tracer. Based on this apoptosis-specific tracer, MPI can accurately and unambiguously detect and quantify apoptotic tumor cells. AF647-Anx-SPIO showed relatively high affinity for apoptotic cells, and differences in binding between treated (apoptotic rate 67.21% ± 1.36%) and untreated (apoptotic rate 10.12 ± 0.11%) cells could be detected by MPI in vitro (P < 0.05). Moreover, the imaging signal was almost proportional to the number of apoptotic cells determined using an MPI scanner (R2 = 0.99). There was a greater accumulation of AF647-Anx-SPIO in tumors of drug-treated animals than in tumors of untreated animals (P < 0.05), and the difference could be detected by MPI ex vivo, while for in vivo imaging, no MPI imaging signal was detected in either group. Overall, this preliminary study demonstrates that MPI could be a potential imaging modality for tumor apoptosis imaging.","Liang, Xin; Wang, Kun; Du, Jiangfeng; Tian, Jie; Zhang, Hui",Physics in medicine and biology,648,1

COVID-19 has a range of symptoms that includes fever, fatigue, dry cough, aches, and labored breathing to acute respiratory distress and possibly death. Health systems and hospitals have been completely rearranged since March 2020 in order to limit the high rate of virus spreading. Hence, a great debate on postponable visits and treatments including phototherapy for skin diseases is developing. In particular, as regards phototherapy very few data are currently available regarding the chance to continue it, even if it may be an useful resource for treating numerous dermatological patients. However, phototherapy has an immunosuppressive action possibly facilitating virus infection. In the context of COVID-19 infection risk it is important to pointed out whether sunlight, phototherapy and in particular ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) constitute or not a risk for patients. In this review we aimed to focus on the relationship between UV-R, sunlight, phototherapy, and viral infections particularly focusing on COVID-19.","Megna, Matteo; Marasca, Claudio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Monfrecola, Giuseppe",Italian journal of dermatology and venereology,648,1

Theoretically, an intracorporeal single-stapling oesophagojejunostomy using a circular stapler could be commonly used and provide favourable outcomes for TLTG, as in open total gastrectomy(OTG), in which the use of circular staplers in oesophagojejunostomy is common and the standard procedure. This could be possible if use of a laparoscopic purse-string suture along the distal oesophagus were made easy and simple. However, the simple and optimal use of this procedure remains to be developed. METHODS Between October 2018 and March 2020, 21 consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent TLTG using the bracket-like suture method (BLSM) for intracorporeal circular-stapled oesophagojejunostomy in our institution. The surgical details and postoperative outcomes were analysed to evaluate this method. RESULTS The mean operation time was 227.6 ± 13.6 min. The median time for the two-sided purse-string suture was 4 min (range, 3-5 min). It took an average of 11.5 min for the completion of purse-string suture and anvil placement. Tumour-free margins were achieved in 21 patients with a median length of 2.5 cm (range, 2-6 cm) proximal margin. Three patients developed postoperative complications. There was no mortality. During the median follow-up period of 12 months, no anastomosis-related complications were observed. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the method cannot only facilitate safe and easy purse-string creation, using the simplest two-sided suture in a short amount of time by circular marking of the intended transection level for intracorporeal circular-stapled oesophagojejunostomy, but can also be completed by laparoscopic surgeons with basic laparoscopic suturing skills.","Du, Jianjun; Zhao, Lizhi; Xue, Hongyuan; Hu, Jian; Zhang, Ziqiang",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,648,19

This systematic review examines the evidence for different training methods of basic life support providers (laypersons and healthcare providers) using standard instructor-led courses as comparators, to assess whether alternative method of training can lead to effective skill acquisition, skill retention and actual performance whilst using the AED. METHOD OVID Medline (including Medline 1950-November 2010; EMBASE 1988-November 2010) was searched using ""training"" OR ""teaching"" OR ""education"" as text words. Search was then combined by using AND ""AED"" OR ""automatic external defibrillator"" as MESH words. Additionally, the American Heart Association Endnote library was searched with the terms ""AED"" and ""automatic external defibrillator"". Resuscitation journal was hand searched for relevant articles. RESULTS 285 articles were identified. After duplicates were removed, 172 references were reviewed for relevance. From this 22 papers were scrutinized and 18 were included. All were manikin studies. Four LOE 1 studies, seven LOE 2 studies and three LOE 4 studies were supportive of alternative AED training methods. One LOE 2 study was neutral. Three LOE 1 studies provided opposing evidence. CONCLUSION There is good evidence to support alternative methods of AED training including lay instructors, self directed learning and brief training. There is also evidence to support that no training is needed but even brief training can improve speed of shock delivery and electrode pad placement. Features of AED can have an impact on its use and further research should be directed to making devices user-friendly and robust to untrained layperson.","Yeung, Joyce; Okamoto, Deems; Soar, Jasmeet; Perkins, Gavin D",Resuscitation,648,33

METHODS The ED presents a unique opportunity to predict long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes with its potential for high-footfall, and large-scale routine data collection applied to underserved patient populations. A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to assess the prognostic performance and feasibility of ED-measured hypertension as a risk factor for long-term CVD outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases and gray literature sources. The target populations were undifferentiated ED patients. The prognostic factor of interest was hypertension. Feasibility outcomes included prevalence, reliability, and follow-up attendance. Meta-analyses were performed for feasibility using a random effect and exact likelihood. RESULTS The searches identified 1072 studies after title and abstract review, 53 studies had their full text assessed for eligibility, and 26 studies were included. Significant heterogeneity was identified, likely due to the international populations and differing study design. The meta-analyses estimate of prevalence for ED-measured hypertension was 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.25-0.37). ED hypertension was persistent outside the ED (FE estimate of 0.50). The proportion of patients attending follow-up was low with an exact likelihood estimate of 0.41. Three studies examined the prognostic performance of hypertension and demonstrated an increased risk of long-term CVD outcomes. CONCLUSION Hypertension can be measured feasibly in the ED and consequently used in a long-term cardiovascular risk prediction model. There is an opportunity to intervene in targeted individuals, using routinely collected data.","Reynard, Charles; van den Berg, Patricia; Oliver, Govind; Naguib, Mina Peter; Sammut-Powell, Camilla; McMillan, Brian; Heagerty, Anthony; Body, Richard",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,648,1

The aim of this study was to explore differences between incisional and organ/space surgical site infection types by evaluating risk factors, National Nosocomial Risk Index Scores, and clinical outcomes. DESIGN A random sample of adults undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery between June 2001 and July 2008 was extracted from a colorectal surgery practice database. Patient factors, comorbidities, intraoperative factors, postoperative factors, and infection were collected; risk score (from -1 to 3 points) was calculated. Variables associated with surgical site infection by univariate analysis were incorporated in a multivariable model to identify risk factors by infection type. Infection risk by risk score was evaluated by logistic regression. Length of stay, readmission, and mortality were examined by infection type. RESULTS Six hundred fifty subjects were identified: 312 were male, age was 59.8 (SD 17.8) years. Common preoperative diagnoses included colorectal cancer (36.9%) and inflammatory bowel disease (21.7%). Forty-five cases were emergencies, and 171 included rectal resections. Eighty-two patients developed incisional and 64 developed organ/space surgical site infections. Body mass index was associated with incisional infection (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.09), whereas previous radiation (OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.53-13.18), postoperative hyperglycemia (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.41-6.34), preoperative [albumin] (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.76), and case length (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47) were associated with organ/space infection. A risk score of 2 and above, compared with a score of <2, predicted organ/space (OR 5.92, 95% CI 3.16-11.09) but not incisional infection (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.41-2.16). Organ/space infections were associated with longer length of stay (P = .006) and higher readmission rates (P < .001) than incisional infections. CONCLUSIONS Risk factors for surgical site infections differ by type of infection. Clinical outcomes and value of the risk index score are different by infection type. It may be prudent to consider incisional and organ/space surgical site infections as different entities for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.","Ho, Vanessa P; Stein, Sharon L; Trencheva, Koiana; Barie, Philip S; Milsom, Jeffrey W; Lee, Sang W; Sonoda, Toyooki",Diseases of the colon and rectum,648,16

The problems mainly stemmed from chronic exposure to the chemicals contained in paint thinner, which is mainly toluene, used during automobile painting. Unfortunately, in Indonesia, there is no study on the reproductive health of male workers in automobile workshops, especially in relation to spermatogenesis. This study aimed to explore the possibility of reproductive problems, namely spermatozoa DNA fragmentation, among male workers in an automobile workshop in Malang. We recruited workers who have worked as automobile painters for years at an automobile workshop in Malang and have been chronically exposed to thinner. Semen samples were collected from 15 automobile workshop workers who were married and had children. Twelve office workers were used as the control group. The two groups of semen samples were tested with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay combined with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed a significant difference between DNA fragmentation of the control group and workshop workers at 14.9% and 47.66%, respectively. Risk factor analysis showed a significant increase in risk factors (p = 0.001). Taken together, chronic exposure to paint thinner in those engaged in painting at the automobile workshop increased the risk of DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa. Our study highlighted the importance of health education for the risked workers on minimization of exposure, which could be recommended to the health policy makers.","Irnandi, Dicky Faizal; Hinting, Aucky; Yudiwati, Rina",Toxicology and industrial health,648,24

Objective: In this double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial, we assessed the effect of repeated sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on cognition and brain connectivity in subjects with PD-MCI. Methods: Forty-one subjects were randomized to receive real (n = 21) or sham stimulation (n = 20). All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessments before, 1 day, and 1 month after stimulation. Subjects also underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and 48 h after stimulation. The primary outcome was the change in the cognitive domain (executive function, attention, memory, language, and visuospatial abilities) z-scores across time. Results: There was an insignificant effect on cognitive domain z-scores across time when comparing real with sham stimulation and correcting for multiple comparisons across cognitive domains (p > 0.05 Bonferroni correction). However, the real stimulation group demonstrated a trend toward improved executive functioning scores at the 1-month follow-up compared with sham (p < 0.05 uncorrected). After real stimulation, the connectivity of the stimulation site showed decreased connectivity to the left caudate head. There was no change in connectivity within or between the stimulation network (a network of cortical regions connected to the stimulation site) and the striatal network. However, higher baseline connectivity between the stimulation network and the striatal network was associated with improved executive function scores at 1 month. Conclusions: These results suggest that intermittent theta-burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in subjects with PD-MCI has minimal effect on cognition compared with sham, although there were trends toward improved executive function. This intervention may be more effective in subjects with higher baseline connectivity between the stimulation network and the striatal network. This trial supports further investigation focusing on executive function and incorporating connectivity-based targeting.

Healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments and specialists in Spain. METHODS Nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures and physicians of Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service. RESULTS Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of Gastroenterology and Hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancellation of elective liver transplant and TIPS. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying.

Adequate protection was acknowledged in >80% hospitals but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of Gastroenterology-related complications is expected due to resource diversion. Gastroenterologists have a high prevalence of infection although they may have been infected during a first phase of lower awareness and protection. Regular SARS-CoV-2 screening, adequate protection and quick reorganization of healthcare resources are still needed.","Crespo, Javier; Fernández Carrillo, Carlos; Iruzubieta, Paula; Hernández-Conde, Marta; Rasines, Laura; Jorquera, Francisco; Albillos, Agustín; Bañares, Rafael; Mora, Pedro; Fernández Vázquez, Inmaculada; Hernández-Guerra, Manuel; Turnes, Juan; Calleja, José Luis",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,648,31

So far, there are no studies in the Indian population comparing IADPSG with NICE criteria. OBJECTIVE To compare International Association of Pregnancy and Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus and its influence on maternal and perinatal outcomes. METHOD This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of a tertiary care institute in South India from March 2017 to October 2018. Six-hundred and eighty women with or without risk factors for GDM were recruited in the study and screened for GDM based on IADPSG and NICE criteria. Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus or with fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl were excluded. RESULTS The overall prevalence of GDM in our study was 27.2% by either IADPSG/NICE criteria. In this study, 25.1% women and 11.6% women were diagnosed as GDM using IADPSG and NICE criteria, respectively. The level of agreement between the two diagnostic criteria was found to be poor in our study and was statistically significant (kappa = 0.429, p < 0.001). Women testing IADPSG-positive NICE-negative had a higher risk of GHTN, abortions, PROM, preterm delivery, caesarean section and congenital anomalies, meconium-stained liquor, and low Apgar scores at 1 min when compared to non GDM group. In addition, except for preterm delivery, women diagnosed as GDM by both IADPSG and NICE criteria had adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia, urinary tract infection, and polyhydramnios. Women diagnosed as GDM in IADPSG-negative NICE-positive had no significant adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS IADPSG criteria appear to be more robust than NICE criteria for diagnosis of GDM. Women with substantial risk of maternal and perinatal outcomes are better identified by IADPSG criteria who would have been missed if NICE criteria was used.","Todi, Sushila; Sagili, Haritha; Kamalanathan, Sadish Kumar",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,648,1

This pilot trial tested the acceptability and feasibility of a multimodal, mind-body resiliency intervention targeting FOR among survivors of various cancers. METHODS Early stage cancer survivors 330 months post-treatment were recruited to participate in an eight-session in-person mind-body resiliency group intervention that taught relaxation skills, cognitive-behavioral techniques, healthy lifestyle behaviors, mindfulness meditation, and positive psychology skills all targeted for FOR. Primary outcomes were feasibility (enrollment rate, session attendance, survey completion, skills practice) and acceptability (enjoyableness, convenience, helpfulness, relevance). Patient-reported outcomes (FOR, uncertainty intolerance, cancer-related uncertainty, perceived stress, resiliency, positive affect, and coping skills) were collected at baseline, post-intervention, +1 month, and +3 months. Exit interviews assessed survivors' reported benefits. RESULTS Participants (N = 4 groups, 23 survivors, enrollment response rate = 58%) included survivors of seven common cancer types who were on average 12 months post-treatment. Attendance was high (M = 6.1 sessions), and 96% of survivors completed all surveys. Sustained increases in relaxation skills practice 3+ days/week were reported (baseline = 16%, post-intervention = 76%, +3 months = 71%). Most sessions (87%) were rated as highly or very highly acceptable. Moderate-to-large (d = 0.87) improvements in FOR severity were observed post-intervention (p < .01) and across assessments (p < .01), with similar changes observed in other patient-reported outcomes. Exit interviews revealed behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and existential benefits. CONCLUSIONS The targeted mind-body resiliency intervention shows promising acceptability, feasibility, and favorable changes in FOR and coping skills practice. Further adaptation and testing in a randomized trial are warranted.

Particularly, conventional coagulation parameters appear to be significantly altered in patients with poor prognosis. A wide-ranging cross- talk between coagulative haemostasis and inflammation, as well as the activation of coagulation cascade during viral infections, are well established. Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia. Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.

Using a randomized experiment that used interviewers to implement an information treatment, we show that reported beliefs are significantly shifted by interviewer knowledge. Trained interviewers primed respondents to use the exact numbers used in the training, nudging them away from higher answers; recorded responses decreased by about 0.3 standard deviations of the initial belief distribution. Furthermore, respondents with stronger prior beliefs were less affected by interviewer knowledge.

Online news articles provide timely information on disease outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we investigated automated detection of articles relevant to disease outbreaks using machine learning classifiers. In a real-life setting, it is expensive to prepare a training data set for classifiers, which usually consists of manually labeled relevant and irrelevant articles. To mitigate this challenge, we examined the use of randomly sampled unlabeled articles as well as labeled relevant articles. METHODS Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on 149 relevant and 149 or more randomly sampled unlabeled articles. Diverse classifiers were trained by varying the number of sampled unlabeled articles and also the number of word features. The trained classifiers were applied to 15 thousand articles published over 15 days. Top-ranked articles from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 1337 articles was reviewed by an expert analyst to evaluate the classifiers. RESULTS Daily averages of areas under ROC curves (AUCs) over the 15-day evaluation period were 0.841 and 0.836, respectively, for the naïve Bayes and SVM classifier. We referenced a database of disease outbreak reports to confirm that this evaluation data set resulted from the pooling method indeed covered incidents recorded in the database during the evaluation period. CONCLUSIONS The proposed text classification framework utilizing randomly sampled unlabeled articles can facilitate a cost-effective approach to training machine learning classifiers in a real-life Internet-based biosurveillance project. We plan to examine this framework further using larger data sets and using articles in non-English languages.","Torii, Manabu; Yin, Lanlan; Nguyen, Thang; Mazumdar, Chand T; Liu, Hongfang; Hartley, David M; Nelson, Noele P",International journal of medical informatics,648,24

METHODS Stability and nasogastric (NG) tube adsorption characteristics of a crushed rivaroxaban tablet were assessed. Then, in 55 healthy adults, relative bioavailability of rivaroxaban administered orally as a whole tablet (Reference [Whole-Oral]), crushed tablet in applesauce suspension (Crushed-Oral), or crushed tablet in water suspension via NG tube (Crushed-NG) were determined. RESULTS There were no significant changes in mean percent of non-degraded rivaroxaban recovered over 4 hours from crushed tablet suspensions (>98.4% recovery across all suspensions and time points) or after NG tube exposure (recovery: 99.1% for silicone and 98.9% for polyvinyl chloride NG tubes). Relative bioavailability was similar between Crushed-Oral and Reference dosing (Cmax and AUC∞ were within the 80-125% bioequivalence limits). Relative bioavailability was also similar between the Crushed-NG and Reference dosing (AUC∞ was within bioequivalence limits; Cmax [90% CI range: 78.5-85.8%] was only slightly below the 80% lower bioequivalence limit). CONCLUSIONS A crushed rivaroxaban tablet was stable and when administered orally or via NG tube, displayed similar relative bioavailability compared to a whole tablet administered orally.","Moore, Kenneth T; Krook, Mark A; Vaidyanathan, Seema; Sarich, Troy C; Damaraju, C V; Fields, Larry E",Clinical pharmacology in drug development,648,23

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the available evidence regarding the characteristics of enquirers and enquiries to PMHS, in order to develop recommendations for service improvement. METHODS Searches were conducted using Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and Web of Science, on 4 June 2019. Forward and backward citation searches were conducted, and grey literature was searched. Studies were included if they reported any characteristics of enquirers who use PMHS, and/or enquiries received. Study quality was assessed using the Axis tool. A narrative synthesis was conducted, and where appropriate, weighted means (WMs) were calculated. Where possible, outcomes were compared with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for England, to establish whether the profile of helpline users may differ to that of hospital patients. RESULTS Nineteen studies were included (~4362 enquiries). Risk of bias from assessed studies was 71%. Enquirers were predominantly female (WM=53%; HES mean=57%), elderly (WM=69 years; HES mean=53 years) and enquired regarding themselves (WM=72%). Out of inpatient and outpatient enquirers, 50% were inpatients and 50% were outpatients (WM). Six of 15 studies reported adverse effects as the main enquiry reason. Two of four studies reported antimicrobial drugs as the main enquiry drug class. From two studies, the main clinical origin of enquiries were general surgery and cardiology. Across six studies, 27% (WM) of enquiries concerned medicines-related errors. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that PMHS are often used by elderly patients, which is important since this group may be particularly vulnerable to experiencing medicines-related issues following hospital discharge. Over a quarter of enquiries to PMHS may concern medicines-related errors, suggesting that addressing such errors is an important function of this service. However, our study findings may be limited by a high risk of bias within included studies. Further research could provide a more detailed profile of helpline users (eg, ethnicity, average number of medicines consumed), and we encourage helpline providers to use their enquiry data to conduct local projects to improve hospital services (eg, reducing errors).

METHODS From June 23, 2020 to August 19, 2020, we conducted an electronic survey of U.S. DATA-waivered clinicians. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used for analysis. RESULTS Among 10,238 respondents, 68 % were physicians, 25 % nursing-related providers, and 6% physician assistants; 28 % reported never prescribing or not prescribing in the 12 months prior to the survey. Among the 72 % of clinicians who reported past 12-month buprenorphine prescribing (i.e. active practitioners during the pandemic) 30 % reported their practice setting closed to in-person visits during COVID-19; 33 % reported remote prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination. The strongest predictors of remote buprenorphine prescribing to new patients were prescribing buprenorphine to larger numbers of patients in an average month in the past year and closure of the practice setting during the pandemic; previous experience with remote prescribing to established patients prior to COVID-19 also was a significant predictor. Among clinicians prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination, 5.5 % reported difficulties with buprenorphine induction, most commonly withdrawal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth practices and prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination were adopted by DATA-waivered clinicians during the first six months of COVID-19. Permanent adoption of these authorities may enable expanded access to buprenorphine treatment.","Jones, Christopher M; Diallo, Mamadou M; Vythilingam, Meena; Schier, Joshua G; Eisenstat, Matthew; Compton, Wilson M",Drug and alcohol dependence,648,24

These defensin classes differ in structure, sites of expression and biological activities. Human alpha-defensins include peptides that are expressed primarily in neutrophils, whereas human beta-defensins are widely expressed in epithelial cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. Defensins were first studied for their broad spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi and viruses; however, it is now clear that they also recruit inflammatory cells and promote innate and adaptive immune responses. Recent evidence shows that defensins have anti-inflammatory effects as well. Hence, defensins can participate in all phases of an immune response in the lung, including initial killing of pathogens and mounting - and resolution -- of an immune or inflammatory response. The cathelicidin, LL-37, is an antimicrobial peptide produced by neutrophils and respiratory epithelial cells that has similar roles in lung immunity as the defensins. A major challenge for the coming years will be to sort out the relative contributions of defensins and LL-37 to overall immune responses in the lung and to determine which of their many in vitro activities are most important for lung immunity.","Tecle, Tesfaldet; Tripathi, Shweta; Hartshorn, Kevan L",Innate immunity,648,31

We have shown that these multimodal liposomes can be used as functional MR contrast agents as well as radionuclide tracers for SPECT, and that they can be optimized for each application. When shielded liposomes were formulated incorporating 50% of a lipid with a short n-EG spacer, to give nanoparticles with a shallow but even coverage of n-EG, they showed good cellular internalization in a range of tumour cells, compared to the limited cellular uptake of conventional shielded liposomes formulated with 7% 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[carboxy(polyethyleneglycol)(2000)] (DSPE-PEG2000). Moreover, by matching the depth of n-EG coverage to the length of the n-EG spacers of the DOTA lipids, we have shown that similar distributions and blood half lives to DSPE-PEG2000-stabilized liposomes can be achieved.

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used. The study sample consisted of 84 participants who cared for schizophrenic patients registered in a community mental health center. In the data collection, the 'Self-stigmatizing Scale for Families' and 'Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale' were used. The data were analyzed via frequency, mean, standard deviation, Cronbach's alpha analysis, linear regression, Pearson correlation analysis, independent samples t-test, and ANOVA test. RESULTS Self-stigmatization (32.48 ± 15.15) and perceived social support (44.36 ± 22.88) were found to be moderate in caregivers. Self-stigmatization was found to be higher in caregivers who do not work; have a spouse, mother, or father; have a disease; do not receive support from their family and have not received any education about schizophrenia (p < .05). It was determined that, with increasing age, perceived social support decreases, and the perception of social support increases in caregivers who are high school graduates, working, having children, have no illness, and are educated about schizophrenia (p < .05). It was determined that, as the level of perceived social support increases in caregivers, self-stigmatization decreases (p < .05). CONCLUSION It was determined that, as the perceived social support increases in caregivers, self-stigmatization decreases.

Daily use of compression garments on the leg has been recommended to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis, but there is limited evidence from trials regarding its effectiveness. METHODS In this single-center, randomized, nonblinded trial, we assigned participants with chronic edema of the leg and recurrent cellulitis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive leg compression therapy plus education on cellulitis prevention (compression group) or education alone (control group). Follow-up occurred every 6 months for up to 3 years or until 45 episodes of cellulitis had occurred in the trial. The primary outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis. Participants in the control group who had an episode of cellulitis crossed over to the compression group. Secondary outcomes included cellulitis-related hospital admission and quality-of-life assessments. RESULTS A total of 183 patients were screened, and 84 were enrolled; 41 participants were assigned to the compression group, and 43 to the control group. At the time of a planned interim analysis, when 23 episodes of cellulitis had occurred, 6 participants (15%) in the compression group and 17 (40%) in the control group had had an episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.59; P = 0.002; relative risk [post hoc analysis], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.02), and the trial was stopped for efficacy. A total of 3 participants (7%) in the compression group and 6 (14%) in the control group were hospitalized for cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.09 to 1.59). Most quality-of-life outcomes did not differ between the two groups. No adverse events occurred during the trial. CONCLUSIONS In this small, single-center, nonblinded trial involving patients with chronic edema of the leg and cellulitis, compression therapy resulted in a lower incidence of recurrence of cellulitis than conservative treatment.

Different systemic effects of these agents may change the preferences of clinical usage. Superiority of preventing ischemia/ reperfusion (IR) injury is a criterion for clinical preference of these agents. The present study was designed to compare the protective effects of alprostadil and iloprost in a rat model of IR injury. Materials and methods: Twenty-three male Sprague Dawley rats were used (aged 8-12 weeks, mean weight 230 ± 30 g). They were randomized into 4 groups: Group 1 (iloprost + IR), Group 2 (alprostadil + IR), Group 3 (saline + IR), and Group 4 (control). Under general anesthesia, in all groups except Group 4, the abdominal region was explored and the abdominal aorta was temporarily clamped for 60 min. After the clamp was removed, 120 min of reperfusion was applied. In Group 4, the rats were placed under general anesthesia and abdominal exploration was performed without the IR procedure. For all rats, body temperature was kept at 36 °C with a heater pad through the whole procedure. The rats were euthanized under general anesthesia to remove the kidneys and lungs for study. Histopathological and biochemical analyses were conducted with kidney and lung tissues. Histopathological scoring was done by analyzing cellular damage at tissue level. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase, and glutathione levels were studied for biochemical analysis. Results: Histopathologic analysis showed that, as compared with alprostadil, iloprost provided a significantly higher level of renal protection against IR injury (P < 0.01). Renal tissue levels of MDA were significantly lower in the alprostadil group as compared to Group 3 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Alprostadil and iloprost seem to provide protection against IR injury, with iloprost being more protective in renal tissue. Alprostadil is more effective than iloprost in protecting lung tissue against IR injury.","Çevirme, Deniz; Adademir, Taylan; Kafalı Başaran, Eylül; Şavluk, Ömer Faruk; Elibol, Ahmet; Erkanlı Şentürk, Gözde; Akkaya, Hatice; Yılmaz, Bayram",Turkish journal of medical sciences,648,16

The optimal rewarming rate is still unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 different protocols for rewarming after HCA on neurological outcome in an experimental animal model. METHODS Forty-four Sprague Dawley rats were cooled to 19 ± 1°C body core temperature by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). HCA was maintained for 60 min. Animals were randomized to receive slow (90 min) or fast (45 min) assisted rewarming with CPB to a target temperature of 35°C. After a total of 90 min of reperfusion in both groups, brain samples were collected and analysed immunohistochemically and with immunofluorescence. In 10 rats, magnetic resonance imaging was performed after 2 and after 24 h to investigate cerebral perfusion and cerebral oedema. RESULTS Interleukin 6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumour necrosis factor α in the hippocampus are significantly less expressed in the slow rewarming group, and microglia cells are significantly less activated in the slow rewarming group. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated better cerebral perfusion and less water content in brains that underwent slow rewarming at 2 and 24 h. CONCLUSIONS Slow rewarming after HCA might be superior to fast rewarming in neurological outcome. The present experimental study demonstrated reduction in the inflammatory response, reduction of inflammatory cell activation in the brain, enhancement of cerebral blood flow and reduction of cerebral oedema when slow rewarming was applied.","Linardi, Daniele; Walpoth, Beat; Mani, Romel; Murari, Angela; Tessari, Maddalena; Hoxha, Stiljan; Anderloni, Marco; Decimo, Ilaria; Dolci, Sissi; Nicolato, Elena; Bontempi, Pietro; Merigo, Flavia; Luciani, Giovanni B; Faggian, Giuseppe; Rungatscher, Alessio",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,648,5

Since de novo drug discovery is both expensive and time-consuming, drug repurposing approaches are believed to be of particular help. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is known to attach human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). We screened 1930 FDA-approved ligands for the selection of optimal ones blocking this interaction. Virtual screening predicted top 25 ligands docking to any of the reported binding sites. After exclusion of those ligands which were unsuitable for systemic use, the remaining 69 RBD-ligand complexes were screened based on the masking capacity of the amino acid residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction, excluding 47 RBD-ligand complexes. A short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis identified 11 globally stable complexes with the lowest RMSD (root-mean-square deviation). Next, a moderately long MD analysis revealed those six RBD-ligand complexes with the lowest RMSD variation, as a measure of global stability. Finally, a long MD analysis revealed two select candidate ligands, including ritonavir and naloxegol, highly stabilizing those key residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction. A similar MD analysis of a few antiviral drugs which are under clinical trials or approved for COVID-19 treatment showed them inferior to both select ligands in terms of stabilizing the RBD globally and locally at binding sites. Because of the crucial role of the S protein in virus virulence, our results highly propose ritonavir and naloxegol as the potentially helpful therapeutics against COVID-19, mandating appropriate clinical trials.

BACKGROUND Due to its less invasive nature, average length of hospital stay (LOHS) after the MitraClip procedure is shorter compared to mitral valve surgery. However, some patients have a prolonged LOHS. METHODS Records of consecutive patients who underwent MitraClip procedure were reviewed. A total of 41 consecutive patients with MitraClip implantation (76 ± 9 years, 59% men) were included. Median hospital stay was 7 days. Hospitalization lasting longer than 7 days was considered prolonged. RESULTS Procedural success was achieved in 88% of the cases. In-hospital death occurred in 4 of 41 patients (10%). Patients with a prolonged hospital stay (46%) had a higher EuroSCORE I (22.7% [IQR 10.3-28.3] vs. 6.7% [IQR 3.5-18.3], P = 0.017), a higher STS mortality score (6.1%[(IQR 3.7-7.5] vs. 2.6% [IQR 1.4-4.8]; P = 0.043) and a higher STS long-length-of-stay score (18.9% [IQR 11.3-22.5] vs. 9.6% [IQR 6.2-16.1]; P = 0.039) as well as a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (41 ml/min/1.73 m(2) [IQR 19-52] vs. 56 ml/min/1.73 m(2) [IQR 49-62]; P = 0.008) than those whose did not. In the multivariate model, lower eGFR was identified as predictor for a prolonged hospitalization.

Traditional processing methods (e.g., filtration or centrifugation) are not compatible with high-throughput testing because of the burden of additional processing costs and time. OF ""clarification"" using chemical flocculants is an alternative approach not widely explored. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of chitosan-based clarification treatment on a commercial PRRSV OF ELISA. Serum and individual OFs were collected from vaccinated pigs ( n = 17) at -7 to 42 d post-vaccination and subdivided into 4 aliquots. Each aliquot was clarified (treatment A, B, C), with the 4th aliquot serving as untreated control. All samples were tested by PRRSV OF ELISA immediately after treatment and then were held at 4°C to be re-tested at 2, 4, 6, and 14 d post-treatment. Quantitative and qualitative treatment effects were evaluated. A Kruskal-Wallis test found no significant difference in ELISA S/P responses among treatments by days post-treatment. No difference was detected in the proportion of positive PRRSV antibody samples among treatments (Cochran Q, p > 0.05). Treatment of swine OFs using chitosan-based formulations did not affect the performance of a commercial PRRSV OF ELISA. Chitosan (or other flocculants) could improve OF characteristics and could be adapted for use in the field or in high-throughput laboratories.","Henao-Díaz, Yuly A; Giménez-Lirola, Luis; Poonsuk, Korakrit; Cheng, Ting-Yu; Wang, Chong; Ji, Ju; Baum, David H; Main, Rodger G; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",648,1

Home confinement during COVID-19 made this less feasible. Our objective was to ascertain whether a transition to virtual online meetings among TS members took place, and whether it was potentially effective. METHODS Two thousand one hundred fifty-two long-standing USA members of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) were surveyed to ascertain their recovery-related experiences and their relation to the transition to virtual meetings. RESULTS During the previous week (ie, 'during COVID-19') respondents attended more virtual meetings ( = 4.13[SD4.64]) than they had attended both face-to-face meetings before COVID-19 ( = 3.35[SD2.05]), and also face-to-face meetings during COVID-19 ( = 0.75[SD1.8]). Many of the meetings were accessed from sites remote from their homes (44.4%), even overseas (21.5%). The majority (64.9%) found virtual meetings at least as effective in promoting their abstinence as were face-to-face meetings, and 41.8% estimated the same for newcomers. A shorter period of antecedent abstinence from drugs and increased loneliness were associated with increased craving during the transition period. Relative to Whites, Black respondents were less distressed, with a lesser increase in craving, and currently attended more virtual meetings. Data provided by a national program reflected a large increase in virtual TS attendance since the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS In a survey of well-established NA members, most had made a successful transition from face-to-face to virtual meetings, relative to their antecedent characteristics. This successful transition suggests the possibility of an enhanced opportunity for stabilizing TS membership.","Galanter, Marc; White, William L; Hunter, Brooke",Journal of addiction medicine,648,23

Determination of the appropriate tension applied to the suture can be difficult, particularly for the novice surgeon. OBJECTIVE To describe a technique for video-assisted unilateral cricoarytenoid laryngoplasty (VAUCAL) and to report short-term outcome in dogs undergoing VAUCAL. ANIMALS AND METHODS Dogs (n = 14) with bilateral idiopathic laryngeal paralysis undergoing VAUCAL between August 2011 and May 2013 were evaluated. A cricoarytenoid suture was tensioned under video observation of the rima glottidis using a 5-mm rigid endoscope. Real-time visualization of arytenoid abduction during suture tensioning, and final arytenoid position were assessed. Requirement for additional intravenous anesthestic, intra- and post-operative complications and short-term outcomes were documented. RESULTS Adequate, real-time visualization of the larynx during tensioning of the cricoarytenoid suture was accomplished in 13/14 dogs. Additional intravenous anesthesia was required in 5/14 dogs to facilitate reintubation. Final arytenoid position was considered inadequate in two dogs on post-operative trans-oral laryngeal examination. Recurrence of clinical signs occurred in one dog three months following initial surgery. Owner outcome was deemed good (n = 8) or excellent (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS VAUCAL is a feasible technique to permit direct real-time visualization of the larynx during tensioning of the cricoarytenoid suture, and enables assessment of final arytenoid position intra-operatively by the operating surgeon. CLINICAL IMPORTANCE VAUCAL allows the operating surgeon to assess arytenoid abduction intra-operatively, at the time of knot placement. This technique may be particularly useful for the novice surgeon or surgeon in training.","Cuddy, Laura C; Case, J Brad; Ellison, Gary W; Covey, Jennifer L",The Veterinary quarterly,648,1

Because eukaryal genomes are liberally interspersed with transcription units specifying long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, there are many opportunities for lncRNA synthesis to negatively affect a neighboring protein-coding gene. Here, I review two eukaryal systems in which lncRNA interference with mRNA expression underlies a regulated biological response to nutrient availability. Budding yeast SER3 is repressed under serine-replete conditions by transcription of an upstream SRG1 lncRNA that traverses the SER3 promoter and elicits occlusive nucleosome rearrangements. SER3 is de-repressed by serine withdrawal, which leads to shut-off of SRG1 synthesis. The fission yeast phosphate homeostasis (PHO) regulon comprises three phosphate acquisition genes - pho1, pho84, and tgp1 - that are repressed under phosphate-replete conditions by 5' flanking lncRNAs prt, prt2, and nc-tgp1, respectively. lncRNA transcription across the PHO mRNA promoters displaces activating transcription factor Pho7. PHO mRNAs are transcribed during phosphate starvation when lncRNA synthesis abates. The PHO regulon is de-repressed in phosphate-replete cells by genetic manipulations that favor 'precocious' lncRNA 3'-processing/termination upstream of the mRNA promoters. PHO lncRNA termination is governed by the Pol2 CTD code and is subject to metabolite control by inositol pyrophosphates.","Shuman, Stewart",Nucleic acids research,648,19

We investigated the effect of IONM on individual surgeon performance by determining the learning curve associated with this tool. METHODS A one-year prospective study was conducted between May 2008 and April 2009 within a team of three experienced endocrine surgeons. The measure of surgical performance was based on the detection of immediate postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy by laryngoscopy. Individual learning curves associated with IONM acquisition were drawn with the cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart. Each surgeon was questioned about possible changes he had experienced in his own surgical technique after the introduction of IONM. RESULTS A total of 475 consecutive patients who underwent thyroid surgery with IONM were included. The pattern of learning curves varied among surgeons and ranged from 35 to 304 procedures required for complete IONM acquisition. The surgeon with the longest learning curve also described a drastic modification of his technique related to nerve dissection. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative nerve monitoring can induce changes in surgical practice. The different learning curve patterns among surgeons may reflect the variable degree to which surgeons will modify their own dissection technique. Such an effect on learning must be considered when assessing the impact of using IONM on patient safety.","Duclos, Antoine; Lifante, Jean-Christophe; Ducarroz, Simon; Soardo, Pietro; Colin, Cyrille; Peix, Jean-Louis",World journal of surgery,648,5

When SILS is performed via the transumbilical route, the resultant abdominal wound is hidden and the cosmetic outcome is better. However, because of the small angle of manipulation and difficulty in liver traction, this technique is not used to perform complex bariatric surgery. In this prospective study, we used our novel technique, which involves the use of a liver-suspension tape and umbilicoplasty of an omega-shaped incision (omega umbilicoplasty), to perform laparoscopic bariatric surgery via the single-incision transumbilical (SITU) approach. We then assessed the safety and effectiveness of our surgical technique. METHODS We started performing and developing this technique from December 2008. Until July 2009, 40 consecutive patients underwent 40 bariatric procedures: two adjustable gastric band placements, six sleeve gastrectomies, and 32 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations, including five cases where concomitant cholecystectomy was performed. RESULTS The mean operation time was 93.4 min and the mean duration of postoperative hospitalization was 1.15 days. No perioperative or postoperative complications or deaths occurred. Most patients were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSION Our technique can be safely and effectively used for SITU laparoscopic bariatric surgery. This technique will soon be used for advanced abdominal surgeries besides bariatric ones.","Huang, Chih-Kun; Tsai, Jui-Chi; Lo, Chi-Hsien; Houng, Jer-Yiing; Chen, Yaw-Sen; Chi, Shu-Ching; Lee, Po-Huang",Obesity surgery,648,1

A short chain with a carboxylic group being required for auxinic properties, a critical point to analyze is whether the recently synthesized proherbicide ε-(2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetyl)-L-Lys (2-4D-L-Lys) maintains some biological activity despite the increase in length of the chain and the substitution of the carboxyl group by an α-amino acid function. No trace of 2,4D could be detected in the pulvinar tissues treated for 1 h with 2,4D-L-Lys. Complementary approaches (electrophysiology, pH measurements, use of plasma membrane vesicles) suggest that it was less efficient than 2,4D to activate the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM-H+-ATPase). However, it modified the various ion-driven reactions of Mimosa pudica and Cassia fasciculata pulvini in a similar way as 2,4D. Additionally, it was much more effective than fusicoccin to inhibit seismonastic movements of M. pudica leaves and, at low concentrations, to promote leaflet opening in dark, indicating that its mode of action is more complex than the only activation of the PM-H+-ATPase. Various substitutions on 2,4D-L-Lys affected its activity in correlation with the molecular descriptor ""halogen ratio"" of these derivatives. Conjugation with D-Lys also led to a decrease of pulvinar reaction, suggesting that 2,4D-Lys maintains the main signaling properties of 2,4D involved in pulvinar movements providing that the terminal zwitterion is in a suitable orientation. Our data guide future investigations on the effect of 2,4D and 2,4D-L-Lys on the vacuolar pump activity of motor cells.","Roblin, Gabriel; Bonnemain, Jean-Louis; Chollet, Jean-François",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,648,29

Since there is a second enzyme that dioxygenates TRP, tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase (TDO), which is mainly located in liver, we decided to study its role in our model of MHV-infection. Results showed that in vivo TDO inhibition by LM10, a derivative of 3-(2-(pyridyl) ethenyl) indole, resulted in a decrease of anti- MHV Ab titers induced by the virus infection. Besides, a reduction of some alarmin release, i.e, uric acid and high-mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1), was observed. Accordingly, since alarmin liberation was related to the expression of autoantibodies (autoAb) to fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), these autoAb also diminished. Moreover, PCR results indicated that TDO inhibition did not abolish viral replication. Furthermore, histological liver examination did not reveal strong pathologies, whereas mouse survival was hundred percent in control as well as in MHV-infected mice treated with LM10. Data presented in this work indicate that in spite of the various TDO actions already described, specific TDO blockage could also restrain some MHV actions, mainly suppressing autoimmune reactions. Such results should prompt further experiments with various viruses to confirm the possible use of a TDO inhibitor such as LM-10 to treat either viral infections or even autoimmune diseases triggered by a viral infection.","Vega, Maite Duhalde; Aparicio, José L; Mandour, Mohamed F; Retegui, Lilia A",Immunology letters,648,16

A kinetic model of the adsorption process was developed, which accounted for protein unfolding and intermolecular interactions in the adsorbed phase. The latter incorporated positive cooperative interactions, resulting from preferred and multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface, as well as negative cooperative interactions attributed to exclusion effects due to size exclusion and repulsion. Cooperative adsorption resulted in negative or positive deviations from the Langmuir model for both single and multicomponent isotherms. The model was used to assess possible contributions of different adsorption mechanisms of proteins and their structurally different forms to the overall adsorption pattern, as well as to simulate chromatographic band profiles under different loading conditions. For proteins with unstable structure, the overall adsorption isotherm was dominated by binding of unfolded species at low surface coverage and by positive cooperative adsorption at high surface coverage. Furthermore, regardless of structural stability, exclusion effects influenced strongly adsorption equilibrium, particularly at low surface coverages. In case of chromatographic elution, i.e. under dynamic conditions, unfolding, negative cooperative adsorption, and kinetic effects governed the retention behavior and determined peak shapes, whereas the effect of positive cooperative adsorption was negligible.","Muca, Renata; Kołodziej, Michał; Piątkowski, Wojciech; Carta, Giorgio; Antos, Dorota",Journal of chromatography.

Although inflammation and its influence on plasticity in multiple neural systems has been extensively studied, its effects on plasticity of neural networks controlling vital life functions, such as breathing, are less understood. In this study, we investigated the signaling mechanisms whereby lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation impairs plasticity within the phrenic motor system-a major spinal respiratory motor pool that drives contractions of the diaphragm muscle. Here, we tested the hypotheses that lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation (1) blocks phrenic motor plasticity by a mechanism that requires cervical spinal okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP) 1/2A activity and (2) prevents phosphorylation/activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK1/2 MAPK)-a key enzyme necessary for the expression of phrenic motor plasticity. METHODS To study phrenic motor plasticity, we utilized a well-characterized model for spinal respiratory plasticity called phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF). pLTF is characterized by a long-lasting, progressive enhancement of inspiratory phrenic nerve motor drive following exposures to moderate acute intermittent hypoxia (mAIH). In anesthetized, vagotomized and mechanically ventilated adult Sprague Dawley rats, we examined the effect of inhibiting cervical spinal serine/threonine PP 1/2A activity on pLTF expression in sham-vehicle and LPS-treated rats. Using immunofluorescence optical density analysis, we compared mAIH-induced phosphorylation/activation of ERK 1/2 MAPK with and without LPS-induced inflammation in identified phrenic motor neurons. RESULTS We confirmed that mAIH-induced pLTF is abolished 24 h following low-dose systemic LPS (100 μg/kg, i.p.). Cervical spinal delivery of the PP 1/2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, restored pLTF in LPS-treated rats. LPS also prevented mAIH-induced enhancement in phrenic motor neuron ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation. Thus, a likely target for the relevant okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases is ERK1/2 MAPK or its upstream activators. CONCLUSIONS This study increases our understanding of fundamental mechanisms whereby inflammation disrupts neuroplasticity in a critical population of motor neurons necessary for breathing, and highlights key roles for serine/threonine protein phosphatases and ERK1/2 MAPK kinase in the plasticity of mammalian spinal respiratory motor circuits.","Tadjalli, Arash; Seven, Yasin B; Perim, Raphael R; Mitchell, Gordon S",Journal of neuroinflammation,648,5

We used an nsp1 mutant, nsp1-CD, lacking the RNA cleavage function, to delineate the mechanism of nsp1-mediated translation inhibition and identify the translation step(s) targeted by nsp1. nsp1 and nsp1-CD had identical inhibitory effects on mRNA templates that are resistant to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage, implying the validity of using nsp1-CD to dissect the translation inhibition function of nsp1. We provide evidence for a novel mode of action of nsp1. nsp1 inhibited the translation initiation step by targeting at least two separate stages: 48S initiation complex formation and the steps involved in the formation of the 80S initiation complex from the 48S complex. nsp1 had a differential, mRNA template-dependent, inhibitory effect on 48S and 80S initiation complex formation. nsp1 inhibited different steps of translation initiation on CrPV and HCV IRES, both of which initiate translation via an IRES-40S binary complex intermediate; nsp1 inhibited binary complex formation on CrPV IRES and 48S complex formation on HCV IRES.

METHODS Between October 2012 and September 2014, eight patients harboring cavernous DAVF underwent percutaneous treatment by direct transorbital puncture of the cavernous sinus at three institutions. All patients presented with ocular symptoms. Standard endovascular approaches, including transvenous and transarterial routes, were primarily attempted without success in all cases. Direct puncture was performed through two different approaches, namely inferolateral and superomedial. The entry point was the inferior and superior eyelid, respectively. Embolization was performed with coils or Onyx (Covidien, Irvine, CA). Immediate and late angiographies were used to evaluate the occlusion of the fistula. RESULTS Of the patients seven had complete occlusion of the cavernous DAVFs noted on the immediate and follow-up angiograms and one patient had residual filling but reduction of the shunt resulted in clinical improvement. None of the patients had worsening of neurological function. One case was complicated by inadvertent internal carotid puncture but without clinical manifestations.

METHODS Using a nationally representative sample of 6,607 middle- and low-income U.S. adults, the authors examined the proportion and correlates of EIP receipt among eligible adults and the associations among planned EIP-financed expenses, challenges with paying expenses, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS Of the sample, 78.8% reported that they received the EIP, and 82.3% of EIP recipients reported that it had a positive impact on their life. Being a veteran (odds ratio [OR]=2.59), being married (OR=1.82), having a history of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (OR=1.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR=1.51), and screening negative for recent suicidal ideation (OR=0.49) were associated with EIP receipt. Planned expenses with the EIP were savings, paying debt, and rent and accounted for 63.4% of the total amount. Screening positive for mental health or drug use problems was positively associated with greater planned expenses for substances and gambling. EIP receipt also was associated with fewer problems paying daily expenses, but participants who screened positive for mental health or alcohol use problems were more likely to report problems paying past-month daily expenses. CONCLUSIONS Unconditional cash transfers such as the EIP may be important for sustaining the living situation of middle- and low-income populations. The management of funds is important to consider, especially among adults experiencing mental health and substance abuse problems, and such cash transfers may represent opportunities for financial literacy and money management interventions.","Tsai, Jack; Huang, Minda; Montgomery, Ann Elizabeth; Elbogen, Eric B",Psychiatric services,648,1

The residents have been affected by an almost complete upheaval of the previous setting of activities, with a near total focus on service during the peak of the emergency. In our Institution, residents in public health were extensively involved in leading activities in the management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS We hereby provide a systematic description of the response actions in which the public health residents' workforce was pivotal, in a large tertiary hospital. RESULT The key role played by residents in the response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic is highlighted by the diversity of contributions provided, from cooperation in the rearrangement of hospital paths for continuity of care, to establishing and running new services to support healthcare professionals. Overall, they constituted a workforce that turned essential in governing efficiently such a complex scenario. CONCLUSION Despite the difficulties posed by the contingency and the sacrifice of many training activities, Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic turned out to be a unique opportunity of learning and measuring one's capabilities and limits in a context of absolute novelty and uncertainty.","Tocco-Tussardi, I; De Mattia, G; Gasabelli, V; Mazzer, M; Vanin, S; Ramaroli, D A; Schiesaro, G; Salandini, G; Varalta, M S; Benoni, R; Zanetel, E; Fagherazzi, J; Tardivo, S",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,648,5

The unabated spread of the disease is due to lack of vaccine and effective therapeutic agents against this novel virus. Hence, the situation demands an immediate need to explore all the plausible therapeutic and prophylactic strategies that can be made available to stem the spread of the disease. Towards this effort, the current review outlines the key aspects of the pathobiology associated with the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, which includes a viral response phase and an exaggerated host response phase. The review also summarizes therapeutic agents that are currently being explored along with those with potential for consideration. The broad groups of therapeutic agents discussed include those that: (i) block viral entry to host cells, (ii) block viral replication and survival in host cells, and (iii) dampen exaggerated host immune response. The various kinds of pharmaceutical prophylactic options that may be followed to prevent COVID-19 have also been discussed.","Shetty, Rohit; Ghosh, Arkasubhra; Honavar, Santosh G; Khamar, Pooja; Sethu, Swaminathan",Indian journal of ophthalmology,648,24

We evaluated intraoperative local oxygen supply-demand balance by monitoring regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and analyzed the correlation between cannula size and fluctuation range of rSO2. Fifty-four patients undergoing MICS surgery using femoral artery cannulation from April 2015 to August 2016 were enrolled. The rSO2 of both the cannulated and uncannulated lower limbs were measured using NIRS. The association between the decline of rSO2 from baseline (delta-rSO2) and the ratio of the cannula diameter to the femoral artery diameter (Cd/FAd) was analyzed. Of the 54 patients, 16 (30%) (Group 1) showed values over 0.65 for Cd/FAd, and the remaining 38 (70%) (Group 2) showed values under 0.65. No patient developed postoperative lower limb ischemia. No patient was treated with an ipsilateral distal perfusion cannula. There were significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 in the decrease of rSO2 at the point of cannulation on the cannulated limb. In the lower limb on the cannulated side, delta-rSO2 showed a significant decrease in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (Group 1 vs Group 2: 19.9 vs 11.0%; p < 0.001). Delta-rSO2 was significantly correlated with body surface aera (BSA), but not with gender or age. Decreasing rSO2 correlates with the Cd/FAd index. Low BSA, Cd/Fad > 0.65 is considered as the risk factor for decline of rSO2 in cannulated limb in MICS.","Toya, Teppei; Fujita, Tomoyuki; Fukushima, Satuki; Shimahara, Yusuke; Kume, Yuta; Yamashita, Kizuku; Matsumoto, Yorihiko; Kawamoto, Naonori; Kobayashi, Junjiro",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,648,1

Social capital and a sense of social cohesion are known to have roles in buffering against the effects of adverse life circumstances. Our study sought to investigate the association of a range of social attitudes and activities - as proxies for social capital - with loneliness while taking into account socio-demographic factors. We undertook a national survey on a stratified random sample of the New Zealand (NZ) adult population aged 18+ in 2017 (n = 1,358), data from which included the requisite variables. The prevalence of loneliness was highest in young adults (18-30), falling with age until a slight rise in older people (76+). Loneliness was associated with socio-demographic factors, being more prevalent in the more disadvantaged groups: the deprived, Māori (the indigenous people of NZ), the non-partnered, and the less educated. Controlling for these socio-demographic factors, pro-social attitudes (that is towards political efficacy, trust in others, not feeling exploited, or being committed to family) and participation in social activities (that is being employed or being involved in recreation groups) - were protective against loneliness. Our study supports asset-based approaches to tackling loneliness - with implications for health and social care - that emphasise mobilising existing social resources, building social capital, and raising social cohesion in our communities. Such intervention on loneliness would help to prevent and ameliorate its detrimental consequences for public health.","Lay-Yee, Roy; Campbell, David; Milne, Barry",Health & social care in the community,648,1

Many variations in wound closure are employed when attempting to minimize a surgical scar's appearance. Barbed sutures are one potential method of achieving improved wound cosmesis and are more common in recent years. To determine if barbed sutures differ from nonbarbed in wound cosmesis, we conducted a single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 18 patients undergoing bilateral reduction mammoplasty or panniculectomy. Patients were their own controls, receiving barbed sutures on one side and standard sutures on the contralateral side. Surgical scars were evaluated postoperatively by patient preference self-assessment and an observer. Ten patients were evaluated at 3 months postoperatively, yielding a mean Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES) rating of 4.4 for barbed suture and 3.5 for regular suture (p = 0.15). At 6 months, 8 patients performed self-assessment to determine their preference; 4 preferred the barbed sutures, 1 preferred the regular sutures, and 3 had no preference. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to determine if barbed sutures convey any advantage over standard sutures in wound healing.

After adjusting for the effect of collinearity, mean temperature, diurnal difference in temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were positively associated with HFMD consultation rates, and explained HFMD consultation rates well with 2 weeks' lag time (R²=0·119, P=0·010). The predicted HFMD consultation rates were also also well matched with the observed rates (Spearman's correlation coefficient=0·276, P=0·000) in 2005-2009. Sensitivity analysis showed that HFMD consultation rates were mostly affected by relative humidity and least affected by wind speed.

The ability to generate true knockout alleles at high saturation provides a sensitive means to study virus-host interactions. To illustrate the power of such haploid genetic screens, we highlight the discovery of the lysosomal proteins NPC1 and LAMP1 as intracellular receptors for Ebola virus and Lassa virus, respectively. From these studies emerges the notion that receptor usage by these viruses is highly dynamic, involving a programmed switch from cell surface receptor to intracellular receptor.

As interest in single-port access laparoscopic surgery (SPA™) continues to grow, the authors present their technique and short-term outcomes for single-port access transaxillary totally endoscopic thyroidectomy in the management of benign thyroid tumors in a series of 4 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Four consecutive patients from a prospectively maintained endoscopic thyroidectomy database were analyzed under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS All the patients were young women with no prior neck surgery. A single-port totally endoscopic thyroidectomy was performed for thyroid adenoma in 2 cases and for nodular goiter in 2 cases. Retraction, exposure, and extraction were possible in all cases. The average operating room time was 92.5 minutes. Postoperative pain scores on postoperative day 1 were all 1/10. No patient experienced complications. The median hospital stay was 1.75 days. The mean specimen size was 2.7 cm × 2.375 cm × 2.625 cm. The patients were uniformly pleased with the cosmetic results of the operation. CONCLUSIONS Single-port access transaxillary totally endoscopic partial thyroidectomy appears to be safe and feasible.

The model can simulate the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of common disease syndromes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Diagnosis and Treatment Program(the sixth edition for trial). Specific steps were as follows. ABALB/c mouse model of cold and dampness syndrome was established, based on which, HCoV-229 E virus was infected; then the experiment was divided into normal control group, infection control group, cold-dampness control group, cold-dampness infection group(the model group), high-dose Chaiyin Particles group(8.8 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)), and low-dose Chaiyin Particles group(4.4 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1)). On the day of infection, Chaiyin Particles was given for three consecutive days. Lung tissues were collected the day after the last dose, and the lung index and inhibition rate were calculated. The nucleic acid of lung tissue was extracted, and the HCoV-229 E virus load was detected by Real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. Blood leukocytes were separated, and the percentage of T and B lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry. Lung tissue protein was extracted, and IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ contents were detected by ELISA. High and low-dose Chaiyin Particles significantly reduced the lung index(P<0.01) of mice of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome, and the inhibition rates were 61.02% and 55.45%, respectively. Compared with the model control group, high and low-dose Chaiyin Particles significantly increased cross blood CD4~+ T lymphocytes, CD8~+T lymphocytes and total B lymphocyte percentage(P<0.05, P<0.01), and reduced IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels in lungs(P<0.01). In vitro results showed that TC_(50), TC_0, IC_(50) and TI of Chaiyin Particles were 4.46 mg·mL~(-1), 3.13 mg·mL~(-1), 1.12 mg·mL~(-1) and 4.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have gained great attention for many diseases, including asthma. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanisms that underlie miR-744 modulating bronchial epithelial cells proliferation in severe asthma in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS Bronchial epithelial cells were isolated from bronchial biopsies of normal controls and asthmatic subjects. miR-744 and transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1) expressions were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), phosphorylation or total of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog3 (Smad3) and production of Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) were measured via Western blot analysis. A link between miR-744 and TGF-ß1 was probed by luciferase activity and RNA immunoprecipitation. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. RESULTS Severe asthma showed a significantly elevated cell proliferation rate and reduced abundance of miR-744, which in turn inhibited cell proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells. In particular, TGF-ß1 might be a candidate target of miR-744, and enrichment of miR-744 lowered the expression of TGF-ß1 at mRNA and protein levels. Indeed, overexpression of miR-744 lowered the proliferation rate of bronchial epithelial cells via driving TGF-ß1. Moreover, addition of miR-744 limited phosphorylation of Smad3 but reversed SARA protein abundance by regulating TGF-ß1. CONCLUSIONS The presence of miR-744 repressed bronchial epithelial cells proliferation through mediating the Smad3 pathway by modulating TGF-ß1, providing a promising therapeutic approach for epithelial function in severe asthma.","Huang, Han; Lu, Hongxia; Liang, Lihong; Zhi, Yueli; Huo, Beibei; Wu, Linlin; Xu, Liping; Shen, Zhaobo",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,648,28

Here, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of balloon angioplasty of the anterior cerebral artery for vasospasm treatment. Patients with vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage who underwent balloon angioplasty at our institution between 2011 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. All ACA angioplasty segments were analyzed for pre- and post-angioplasty radiographic measurements. The degree of vasospasm was categorized as mild (<25%), moderate (25-50%), or severe (>50%), and relative change in caliber was measured following treatment. Clinical outcomes following treatment were also assessed. Among 17 patients, 82 total vessel segments and 35 ACA segments were treated with balloon angioplasty. Following angioplasty, 94% of segments had increased caliber. Neurological improvement was noted in 75% of awake patients. There were no intra-procedural complications, but two patients developed ACA territory infarction, despite angioplasty treatment. We demonstrate that balloon angioplasty of the ACA for vasospasm treatment is safe and effective.

Lipomas of the airway region are exceedingly rare, accounting for less than 1% of airway obstruction tumors. Correlation of radiographic findings from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a rare retropharyngeal lipoma has not been previously reported. CBCT studies acquired for implant and/or other diagnostic purposes may be the first line of detection as an incidental finding. CASE PRESENTATION A 66-year-old female presented for a pre-implant CBCT with no history of other complaints or signs/symptoms. CBCT imaging depicts a large, well-defined, low-attenuation/soft tissue density lesion with an undulating appearance extending from the posterior left pharyngeal wall and occluding two-thirds of the airway from C2 to C4. The lesion extends laterally into the left parapharyngeal space and inferiorly beyond the field of view of the study. Evidence of faint internal septations was noted. The patient was immediately referred for an ENT consult. Laryngoscopy, MRI, and contrast-enhanced MDCT imaging were conducted to determine the full extent and nature of the lesion, as well as to potentially plan for biopsy and/or surgical resection. Removal of the lesion was successful, and histopathologic evaluation confirmed lipoma. Periodic follow-up was recommended to monitor for possible recurrence. DISCUSSION The slower growth pattern of some benign lesions may obscure any symptoms as changes the patient may normally notice take place over an extended period. Furthermore, soft tissue lesions and especially those in the posterior midline, such as in this case, may not be easily visible on routine panoramic imaging or clinical exam, allowing for substantially large growth before detection. While the soft tissue contrast of the CBCT volume is poor, enough information was present to establish an initial differential diagnosis and the need for more advanced imaging modalities. With the growing popularity and adoption of CBCT in maxillofacial imaging, a thorough understanding of the appearance of hard and soft tissue lesions, as well as a strong understanding of the baseline appearance of normal anatomy, is important to ensure no incidental pathoses go undiagnosed.","Ehlers, Scott A; Bozanich, John M; Arashlow, Mehrnaz Tahmasbi; Liang, Hui; Nair, Madhu K",International journal of implant dentistry,648,7

This cohort study observed N=235 incident HIV-1 positive women whose disease biomarkers were measured repeatedly at least four times on each participant. Results From the findings of this study, post-HAART initiation, baseline viral load, and the prevalence of obese nutrition status were found to be major significant factors on the prognosis CD4+ count of HIV-infected patients. Conclusion Effective HAART initiation immediately after HIV exposure is necessary to suppress the increase of viral loads to induce potential ART benefits that accrue over time. The data showed evidence of strong individual-specific effects on the evolution of CD4+ counts. Effective monitoring and modelling of disease biomarkers are essential to help inform methods that can be put in place to suppress viral loads for maximum ART benefits that can be accrued over time at an individual level.","Yirga, Ashenfai A; Melesse, Sileshi F; Mwambi, Henry G; Ayele, Dawit G",African health sciences,648,30

Here, we evaluated gene expression profiles in cells from whole blood elicited in naive subjects receiving the hepatitis B surface antigen formulated with different adjuvants. We identified a core innate gene signature emerging 1 day after the second vaccination and that was shared by the recipients of vaccines formulated with adjuvant systems AS01B, AS01E, or AS03. This core signature associated with the magnitude of the hepatitis B surface-specific antibody response and was characterized by positive regulation of genes associated with interferon-related responses or the innate cell compartment and by negative regulation of natural killer cell-associated genes. Analysis at the individual subject level revealed that the higher immunogenicity of AS01B-adjuvanted vaccine was linked to its ability to induce this signature in most vaccinees even after the first vaccination.

Commonly recommended exercises to optimize the use of respiratory muscles during speech, such as diaphragmatic breathing, are unlikely to be intensive enough to induce respiratory changes and impact vocal function. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of adding a targeted intervention, respiratory muscle strength training, to voice exercises in a sample of patients with presbyphonia. METHODS/DESIGN In this prospective, randomized-controlled trial, 12 participants received either (1) vocal function exercises (VFE), (2) VFE combined with inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST), or (3) VFE combined with expiratory muscle strength training (EMST). Data collected prior to and following 4 weekly intervention sessions included respiratory measures (pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength) and voice measures (videostroboscopy, acoustic, auditory-perceptual, aerodynamic, and self-assessment measures). RESULTS Participants who received IMST improved their voice quality during connected speech (smoothed cepstral peak prominence and ratings of overall voice quality) and their scores on the three self-assessment questionnaires with large to very large within-group effect sizes (|d| = 0.82-1.61). In addition, participants in the IMST group reduced their subglottal pressure with a large effect size (d = -0.92). Participants who received EMST improved their maximum expiratory strength and smoothed cepstral peak prominence with large effect sizes (d = 0.80 and 0.99, respectively) but had limited improvements in other outcomes. Participants who received only VFE decreased their amount of vocal fold bowing, improved their voice quality on a sustained vowel (amplitude perturbation quotient), and improved their Glottal Function Index score with large effect sizes (|d| = 0.74-1.00). CONCLUSION Preliminary data indicate that adding IMST to voice exercises may lead to the greatest benefits in patients with presbyphonia by promoting improved subglottal pressure control as well as increasing air available for phonation, resulting in improved self-assessment outcomes.","Desjardins, Maude; Halstead, Lucinda; Simpson, Annie; Flume, Patrick; Bonilha, Heather Shaw",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,648,1

When employment is available, tasks are often limited, and opportunities for career development are restricted. Policy and funding constraints leave people with disabilities without an opportunity to develop skills due to the additional time and costs for employers. To overcome these barriers, virtual environments have been proposed as a safe and reliable solution for training. An important prerequisite for a wider uptake of training in virtual environments are demonstrations that the training leads to improved performance in the real world. This is particularly true for people with neurodevelopmental disorders, as transferring learnings from one context to another can be challenging. A systematic review was conducted to assess whether training in virtual environments can be used to improve real-world vocational skills in people with neurodevelopmental disorders.

Treatment outcomes from closed reduction are often disappointing and secondary surgical corrections are required in a sizeable subset of patients. In response to the shortcomings of closed fracture manipulation, classic rhinoplasty techniques have been introduced to improve anatomic fracture reduction. Although these techniques improve the accuracy of skeletal reduction, they also weaken the nose, leaving it susceptible to the deformational forces of healing. To provide optimal anatomic fracture reduction and concomitant stabilization of the skeletal framework, we have been using contemporary strategies derived from open structure rhinoplasty and extracorporeal septal reconstruction for initial fracture treatment. Using wide-field exposure with open rhinoplasty, these strategies provide optimal fracture reduction and rigid stabilization of the septal L-strut using suture-based fixation and structural grafting techniques. The result is unsurpassed contour restoration and lasting architectural stability of the nose. When combined with power-driven instruments to cut, shape, mobilize, and create osseous suture holes, open structure stabilization of the disrupted skeletal framework establishes a new benchmark in acute fracture management.","Davis, Richard E; Chu, Eugenia",Facial plastic surgery : FPS,648,19

Firstly, we investigated Cu-toxic effects on metabolomics, the levels of free amino acids, NH4+-N, NO3--N, total nitrogen, total soluble proteins, total phenolics, lignin, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde, and the activities of nitrogen-assimilatory enzymes in 'Shatian' pummelo (Citrus grandis) leaves. Then, a conjoint analysis of metabolomics, physiology and transcriptomics was performed. Herein, 59 upregulated [30 primary metabolites (PMs) and 29 secondary metabolites (SMs)] and 52 downregulated (31 PMs and 21 SMs) metabolites were identified in Cu-toxic leaves. The toxicity of Cu to leaves was related to the Cu-induced accumulation of NH4+ and decrease of nitrogen assimilation. Metabolomics combined with physiology and transcriptomics revealed some adaptive responses of C. grandis leaves to Cu-toxicity, including (a) enhancing tryptophan metabolism and the levels of some amino acids and derivatives (tryptophan, phenylalanine, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, 5-oxoproline and GSH); (b) increasing the accumulation of carbohydrates and alcohols and upregulating tricarboxylic acid cycle and the levels of some organic acids and derivatives (chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, d-tartaric acid and gallic acid o-hexoside); (c) reducing phospholipid (lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine) levels, increasing non-phosphate containing lipid [monoacylglycerol ester (acyl 18:2) isomer 1] levels, and inducing low-phosphate-responsive gene expression; and (d) triggering the biosynthesis of some chelators (total phenolics, lignin, l-trytamine, indole, eriodictyol C-hexoside, quercetin 5-O-malonylhexosyl-hexoside, N-caffeoyl agmatine, N'-p-coumaroyl agmatine, hydroxy-methoxycinnamate and protocatechuic acid o-glucoside) and vitamins and derivatives (nicotinic acid-hexoside, B1 and methyl nicotinate). Cu-induced upregulation of many antioxidants could not protect Cu-toxic leaves from oxidative damage.

Repurposing drugs with beneficial effects on AMD pathophysiology offers a route to new treatments which is faster, cost-effective, and safer for patients. Recent studies indicate a potential role for metformin in delaying AMD development and progression. In this context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to look for beneficial associations between metformin and AMD. METHODS We systematically searched Medline and Embase (via Ovid), Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for clinical studies in humans that examined the associations between metformin treatment and AMD published from inception to February 2021. We calculated pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) considering a random effect model in the meta-analysis. RESULTS Five retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria. There are no prospective studies that have reported the effect of metformin in AMD. The meta-analysis showed that people taking metformin were less likely to have AMD although statistical significance was not met (pooled adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.05, I2 = 98.8%). Subgroup analysis of the association between metformin and early and late AMD could not be performed since the data was not available from the included studies. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of retrospective data suggests a signal that metformin may be associated with decreased risk of any AMD. It should be interpreted with caution because of the failure to meet statistical significance, the small number of studies, and the limitation of routine record data. However prospective studies are warranted in generalizable populations without diabetes, of varied ethnicities, and AMD stages. Clinical trials are needed to determine if metformin has efficacy in treating early and late-stage AMD.","Romdhoniyyah, Dewi Fathin; Harding, Simon P; Cheyne, Christopher P; Beare, Nicholas A V",Ophthalmology and therapy,648,5

Achieving efficacy and durability of aneurysmal occlusion while maintaining parent vessel patency requires innovative treatment strategies, especially in cases in which aneurysmal location or morphology pose substantial morbidity associated with microsurgical treatment. In the last 3 decades, endovascular treatments have had a remarkable evolution and are currently considered safe and effective therapeutic options for cerebral aneurysms. While endovascular techniques are well described in the English literature, the endovascular management of pediatric aneurysms continues to pose a challenge. In this report, the authors describe the case of a 9-month-old infant who presented with a 1-day history of acute-onset left-sided hemiparesis and left facial droop. Imaging revealed a large symptomatic saccular middle cerebral artery aneurysm. Treatment included successful stent-assisted aneurysm coiling. At follow-up, the patient continued to fare well and MR angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the aneurysm dome. This case features the youngest patient in the English literature to harbor an intracranial aneurysm successfully treated with stent-assisted coiling. Based on this experience, endovascular intervention with vascular reconstruction can be safe and effective for the treatment of infants and could further improve prognosis; however, further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.","Savastano, Luis E; Chaudhary, Neeraj; Gemmete, Joseph J; Garton, Hugh J L; Maher, Cormac O; Pandey, Aditya S",Journal of neurosurgery.

Accumulating evidence shows that non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), can affect the drug resistance of tumor cells by forming a ceRNA regulatory network with mRNAs. The efficiency of the competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) network can be affected by the number and integrality of miRNA recognition elements (MREs). Dynamic factors such as RNA editing, alternative splicing, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), RNA-binding proteins and RNA secondary structure can influence the MRE activity, which may in turn be involved in the regulation of chemoresistance-associated ceRNA network by prospective approaches. Besides activities in a single tumor cell, the components of the tumor micoenvironment (TME) also affect the ceRNA network by regulating the expression of non-coding RNA directly or indirectly. The alternation of the ceRNA network often has an impact on the malignant phenotype of tumor including chemoresistance. In this review, we focused on how MRE-associated dynamic factors and components of TME affected the ceRNA network and speculated the potential association of ceRNA network with chemoresistance. We also summarized the ceRNA network of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs which efficiently triggers chemoresistance in the specific types of GTAs and analyzed the role of each RNA as a ""promoter"" or ""suppressor"" of chemoresistance.","Raziq, Khadija; Cai, Mengdi; Dong, Kexian; Wang, Ping; Afrifa, Justice; Fu, Songbin",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,648,29

Randomized controlled trials evaluating needle aspiration, narrow-bore chest tube (<14 F) with or without Heimlich valve insertion, and large-bore chest tube (≥14 F) insertion in spontaneous pneumothorax were included. Network meta-analyses were performed with a Bayesian random-effects model. RESULTS Twelve studies were included in this review (n=781 patients). Analyses of efficacy (n=12 trials) revealed no significant differences between the interventions studied: narrow- versus large-bore chest tubes, odds ratio (OR) 1.05 (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.38 to 2.87); large-bore chest tube versus needle aspiration, OR 1.25 (95% CrI 0.65 to 2.62); and narrow-bore chest tube versus needle aspiration, OR 1.32 (95% CrI 0.54 to 3.42). Analyses of safety (n=10 trials) revealed a significant difference between needle aspiration and large-bore chest tube interventions: OR 0.10 (95% CrI 0.03 to 0.40). No differences were observed in needle aspiration versus narrow-bore chest tube (OR 0.29 [95% CrI 0.05 to 1.82]), and narrow- versus large-bore chest tube comparisons (OR 0.35 [95% CrI 0.07 to 1.67]). Analyses of efficiency were not pursued because of variation in reporting the length of stay (n=12 trials). Narrow-bore chest tube (<14 F) had the highest likelihood of top ranking in terms of immediate success (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=64%).

Investigators have defined aspects of NTM infection that are unique to the CF population, as well as features shared with other conditions at risk. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of NTM infection among pwCF. RECENT FINDINGS The presence of dominant circulating clones of Mycobacterium abscessus within the CF community worldwide continue to be described, as well as pathogen phenotypes that could evoke greater environmental fitness and infectivity. The risk of direct or indirect transmission between pwCF remains an active focus of investigation, with divergent findings and conclusions reached in a site-specific fashion. Derived largely from studies in non-CF populations, new clinical guidelines are now available. A wide variety of agents are in preclinical development or early phase trials with promising findings, and new therapeutic targets have been identified as our understanding of the complex biology of NTM continues to expand.

After a single use, many of these materials are currently treated as waste, underutilizing their inherent chemical and energy value. In this study, energy-rich polyethylene (PE) macromolecules are catalytically transformed into value-added products by hydrogenolysis using well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on SrTiO3 perovskite nanocuboids by atomic layer deposition. Pt/SrTiO3 completely converts PE (M n = 8000-158,000 Da) or a single-use plastic bag (M n = 31,000 Da) into high-quality liquid products, such as lubricants and waxes, characterized by a narrow distribution of oligomeric chains, at 170 psi H2 and 300 °C under solvent-free conditions for reaction durations up to 96 h. The binding of PE onto the catalyst surface contributes to the number averaged molecular weight (M n) and the narrow polydispersity (Đ) of the final liquid product. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of 13C-enriched PE adsorption studies and density functional theory computations suggest that PE adsorption is more favorable on Pt sites than that on the SrTiO3 support.

These may be associated with various types of disease entities, from gangrenous change to diffuse peritonitis with abscess formation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and benefits of the laparoscopic approach for perforated appendicitis, including cases complicated by abscess, compared to open. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1747 patients underwent treatment for appendicitis over a period of 3 years. The diagnosis of perforated appendicitis was made by radiology, operative finding, and pathology. Of our five attending surgeons, three performed open surgery for perforated appendicitis, while two performed laparoscopy. RESULTS There were 474 patients (27%) with perforated appendicitis without abscess (156 underwent laparoscopy, 318 underwent open) and 113 patients (6.4%) with perforated appendicitis and abscess (44 underwent laparoscopy, 69 underwent open). The duration for resumption of diet and hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopy group than in the open group. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications between patients who had no abscess with laparoscopy and those with open: 5 intra-abdominal abscesses and 10 wound infections versus 11 intra-abdominal abscesses and 25 wound infections (P = 0.88, 0.12), and between patients who had abscesses with laparoscopy and those with open: 4 intra-abdominal abscesses and 3 wound infections versus 6 intra-abdominal abscesses and 6 wound infections (P = 0.94, 0.72). CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic approach may be a safe, effective treatment for perforated appendicitis, even in the presence of an abscess.","Park, Hyoung-Chul; Yang, Dae-Hyun; Lee, Bong-Hwa",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Tiotropium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, which is taken once daily, in maintenance therapy, in every stage of the disease progress. The efficacy of tiotropium in regards to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been evaluated in many clinical trials against placebo and several different active comparators.

However, no previous meta-analyses have been conducted to establish the magnitude of these disparities. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported bisexual-specific data on standardized measures of depression or anxiety. Of the 1,074 full-text articles reviewed, 1,023 were ineligible, predominantly because they did not report separate data for bisexual people (n = 562 studies). Ultimately, 52 eligible studies could be pooled in the analysis. Results indicate that across both outcomes, there is a consistent pattern of lowest rates of depression and anxiety among heterosexual people, while bisexual people exhibit higher or equivalent rates in comparison to lesbian/gay people. On the basis of empirical and theoretical literature, we propose three interrelated contributors to these disparities: experiences of sexual orientation-based discrimination, bisexual invisibility/erasure, and lack of bisexual-affirmative support. Implications for interventions to improve the health and well-being of bisexual people are proposed.","Ross, Lori E; Salway, Travis; Tarasoff, Lesley A; MacKay, Jenna M; Hawkins, Blake W; Fehr, Charles P",Journal of sex research,648,1

For the period post-2020, one of the most relevant changes could be the upgrading of the crops diversification, imposing it as an obligation to rotate crops by introducing legumes in the cropping patterns. This paper proposes an assessment of the possible effects of such obligation on the arable crops sector in Italy. The analysis uses a mathematical programming model calibrated and validated by way positive approach and is conducted on data of about 2800 Italian farms of the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Moreover, the analysis is structured by geographical area and altimetric level in order to consider typical specificities of Italian farms according to their localization. Our results show the legume-supported crop rotations reduce the general environmental pressure of agricultural activities and affect a large part of the arable land, against reduced economic impacts. In the majority of farms the lost income per hectare is lower than the national average value of the decoupled payments. Yet, the legume-supported crop rotations determine a reduction in the production of main crops and, especially in some areas, negative economic and social impacts. All this suggests that the legume-supported crop rotations are an opportunity to adopting sustainable agricultural practices and that Member States could implement the agronomic practice differently for areas and use additional instruments to meet the EU's objectives. Especially the decoupled and coupled payments are needed to limit economic losses and incentivize farmers towards virtuous behaviour.","Cortignani, Raffaele; Dono, Gabriele",The Science of the total environment,648,24

Additional goals of the initiative were to improve workflow efficiency by reducing the amount of time spent donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) and to conserve PPE, which could be in short supply in a prolonged pandemic. The QI team developed a ""warm zone model"" that allowed staff members to wear the same mask, eye protection, and gown while moving between the rooms of patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. The risk of self-contamination while doffing PPE is well documented. Staff members were trained to conserve PPE and to properly change gloves and perform hand hygiene between exiting and entering patients' rooms. The warm zone model allowed multidisciplinary team members to reduce the times they donned and doffed PPE per shift while maintaining or increasing the times they entered and exited patients' rooms. Staff members believed that the model improved workflow and teamwork while maintaining staff members' personal safety. Daily gown use decreased on the acute care unit where the model was employed, helping to preserve PPE supplies. Once the model was proven successful in acute care, it was modified and instituted on several critical care COVID-19 cohort units.","Omess, Sarah; Kaplow, Roberta; Green, Alyson; Kingsley-Mota, William; Mota, Sérgio; Paris, Lauren; Wilson, Keisa",The American journal of nursing,648,19

In the anastomosis procedure a purse-string suture may be time consuming to perform. The aim was to replace the purse-string suture, to develop and test a self-locking loop for temporary sealing of the lumen in colon anastomosis. METHODS A new device, a flexible band with a locking mechanism was constructed, the I-Tie®. Small protrusions, designed for increased friction between device and tissue, were added to one side of the flexible band in order to enhance the grip at closure of the loop around tissue. The device was initially tested in vitro on pig intestines. In an in vivo study, the short-term implant was tested in a new suture-free method, CREX, and with traditional circular staplers for colonic anastomosis. Ten female pigs of approximately 50 kg were used in the in vivo test. The self-locking device was used for closure of the lumen around anvils in CREX (n = 5), and around anvil in traditional circular stapler anastomosis (n = 5). Two self-locking devices were used in each animal. RESULTS The self-locking device could close the lumen of colon around the anvil and trocar. Subjectively, the device achieved a tight closure of the colon and did not interfere with the anastomosis techniques. CONCLUSIONS The technology was perceived as potentially timesaving and easy to use. We conclude the device may be an alternative to the traditional purse-string suture for temporary closure of the colon lumen in colon anastomosis.","Höglund, Odd V; Maxon, Oskar; Grönberg, Anders",BMC research notes,648,16

This infection, caused by the novel coronavirus Sars Cov2, primarily affects respiratory system, but there is increasing evidence of neurologic involvement and cerebrovascular accidents. CASE REPORT We present a case of stroke in a 62-year-old COVID-19-positive patient, with multiple vascular risk factors. The patient arrived 1 h after onset of symptoms, was treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) with improvement of neurologic deficits, and later developed right foot arterial ischemia (recanalized by balloon catheter angioplasty) and left arm superficial venous thrombosis. A control computed tomography (CT) scan 7 days after onset showed hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic lesion without mass effect. However, respiratory and neurologic conditions improved so that the patient was discharged to rehabilitation. DISCUSSION Until now, few cases of stroke in COVID-19 have been described, mainly in severe forms. This patient had ischemic injuries in different sites as well as venous thrombosis; hence, we speculate that Sars Cov2 could have a direct role in promoting vascular accidents since its receptor ACE2 is a surface protein also expressed by endothelial cells. This case suggests that COVID-19 can favor strokes and in general vascular complications, even in milder cases, and the presence of preexisting risk factors could play a determinant role.","Saggese, Carlo Emanuele; Del Bianco, Chiara; Di Ruzza, Maria Rita; Magarelli, Maria; Gandini, Roberto; Plocco, Maurizio",Cerebrovascular diseases,648,1

The purpose of this study was to develop three novel advanced suturing tasks with assessment metrics and to collect validity evidence for their measures of suturing skill. METHODS We developed three tasks based on training gaps identified through a previous needs assessment: needle handling (NH), suturing under tension (UT), and continuous suturing (CS). Minimally invasive surgeons (MIS) and senior surgical residents (SR) completed these tasks and a questionnaire regarding their educational value. Performance was assessed by two raters based on time and accuracy. Validity was assessed by comparing performance according to the level of training and self-reported experience. The inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of the tasks were calculated. RESULTS Thirty-one subjects (13 MIS, 18 SR) were enrolled in the study (median age 32; 77% male). Compared to the SR group, the MIS group had significantly greater scores on all tasks. While all MIS surgeons completed the three tasks within the allotted time, six (33%) residents could not complete at least one out of the three tasks. Laparoscopic suturing experience correlated positively with the scores of all tasks (NH 0.51, UT 0.70, CS 0.65. p < 0.01). Inter-rater reliability for all tasks was 0.99, and internal consistency was 0.80. The majority of participants agreed that the tasks were relevant to practice, helped improve technical competence, and adequately measured suturing ability. CONCLUSIONS This study provides validity evidence for three novel advanced laparoscopic suturing tasks. Performance on all tasks correlated significantly with training level and self-reported experience. Integrating these tasks into educational curricula may help improve residents' suturing skills and better prepare residents for the operating room.","Watanabe, Yusuke; McKendy, Katherine M; Bilgic, Elif; Enani, Ghada; Madani, Amin; Munshi, Amani; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,648,1

Our aim was to characterize imaging, lab, and clinical correlates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leukoencephalopathy, which may provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-seven consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who had brain MR imaging following intensive care unit admission were included. Seven (7/27, 26%) developed an unusual pattern of ""leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity"" on diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The remaining patients did not exhibit this pattern. Clinical and laboratory indices, as well as neuroimaging findings, were compared between groups. RESULTS The reduced-diffusivity group had a significantly higher body mass index (36 versus 28 kg/m2, P < .01). Patients with reduced diffusivity trended toward more frequent acute renal failure (7/7, 100% versus 9/20, 45%; P = .06) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate values (49 versus 85 mL/min; P = .06) at the time of MRI. Patients with reduced diffusivity also showed lesser mean values of the lowest hemoglobin levels (8.1 versus 10.2 g/dL, P < .05) and higher serum sodium levels (147 versus 139 mmol/L, P = .04) within 24 hours before MR imaging. The reduced-diffusivity group showed a striking and highly reproducible distribution of confluent, predominantly symmetric, supratentorial, and middle cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight notable correlations between severe COVID-19 leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity and obesity, acute renal failure, mild hypernatremia, anemia, and an unusual brain MR imaging white matter lesion distribution pattern. Together, these observations may shed light on possible SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with leukoencephalopathy, including borderzone ischemic changes, electrolyte transport disturbances, and silent hypoxia in the setting of the known cytokine storm syndrome that accompanies severe COVID-19.","Rapalino, O; Pourvaziri, A; Maher, M; Jaramillo-Cardoso, A; Edlow, B L; Conklin, J; Huang, S; Westover, B; Romero, J M; Halpern, E; Gupta, R; Pomerantz, S; Schaefer, P; Gonzalez, R G; Mukerji, S S; Lev, M H",AJNR.

Small molecules that interfere with binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host ACE2 receptor may be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here we screened 512 pure compounds derived from natural products using a high-throughput RBD/ACE2 binding assay and identified (-)-hopeaphenol, a resveratrol tetramer, in addition to vatalbinoside A and vaticanol B, as potent and selective inhibitors of RBD/ACE2 binding and viral entry. For example, (-)-hopeaphenol disrupted RBD/ACE2 binding with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.11 μM in contrast to an IC50 of 28.3 μM against the unrelated host ligand/receptor binding pair PD-1/PD-L1 (selectivity index = 257.3). When assessed against the USA-WA1/2020 variant, (-)-hopeaphenol also inhibited entry of a VSVΔG-GFP reporter pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike into ACE2-expressing Vero-E6 cells and in vitro replication of infectious virus in cytopathic effect and yield reduction assays (50% effective concentrations (EC50s) = 10.2 - 23.4 μM) without cytotoxicity and approaching the activities of the control antiviral remdesivir (EC50s = 1.0 - 7.3 μM). Notably, (-)-hopeaphenol also inhibited two emerging variants of concern including B.1.1.7/""Alpha"" and B.1.351/""Beta"" in both viral and spike-containing pseudovirus assays with similar or improved activities over the USA-WA1/2020 variant. These results identify (-)-hopeaphenol and related stilbenoid analogues as potent and selective inhibitors of viral entry across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Tietjen, Ian; Cassel, Joel; Register, Emery T; Zhou, Xiang Yang; Messick, Troy E; Keeney, Frederick; Lu, Lily D; Beattie, Karren D; Rali, Topul; Tebas, Pablo; Ertl, Hildegund C J; Salvino, Joseph M; Davis, Rohan A; Montaner, Luis J",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,648,1

This study examined the outcomes of needle aspiration and closed thoracostomy in first episodes of PSP requiring intervention. Methods This study was a randomized, prospective, single-center trial conducted between December 2015 and August 2016. Patients of all ages with a documented first episode of PSP who were unilaterally affected, hemodynamically stable, and had a pneumothorax measuring over 25% in size were included. Patients with underlying lung disease, severe comorbidities, bilateral pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, recurrent pneumothorax, traumatic pneumothorax, and pregnancy were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to the needle aspiration or closed thoracostomy group using a random number table. Results Forty patients with a first episode of PSP were recruited, and 21 and 19 patients were included in the needle aspiration group and the closed thoracostomy group, respectively. The hospital stay of each group was 2.1±1.8 days and 5.4±3.6 days, respectively (p<0.01). However, no significant differences were found in the success rate of initial treatment or the 1-month and 1-year recurrence rates.

We aimed to present preliminary data from a prospective randomized controlled trial of LESS versus conventional laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for localized RCC. METHODS Patients with cT1-2 RCC were randomized to LESS (n = 17) or conventional laparoscopy (n = 18) group. The short-term outcome measures assessed were perioperative morbidity, postoperative pain, and quality of recovery as determined using QoR-40. RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the LESS and conventional laparoscopy groups with respect to operative time (143.5 vs. 126.1 min, p = 0.218), blood loss (143.6 vs. 118.2 ml, p = 0.121), hospital stay (3.8 vs. 3.1 day s, p = 0.170), analgesic requirements (63.2 vs. 60.0 mg, p = 0.956), and complication rates (26.7 vs. 22.2 %, p = 0.767). However, postoperative quality of recovery was better in the LESS group (176.4 vs. 152.6, p = 0.005). Furthermore, quality of recovery, as measured using the QoR-40 dimensions of emotional state (39.9 vs. 34.0, p = 0.003), physical comfort (51.9 vs. 46.7, p = 0.034), psychological support (32.2 vs. 25.8, p = 0.003), and physical independence (20.7 vs. 17.5, p = 0.047), but not pain (31.8 vs. 29.6, p = 0.259), was significantly better in the LESS group. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary results from this prospective trial suggest that LESS could be a safe and effective treatment option for localized RCC with equivalent surgical outcomes and improved postoperative quality of recovery compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Park, Yong Hyun; Kim, Kwang Taek; Ko, Kyungtae; Kim, Hyeon Hoe",World journal of urology,648,9

Here, we developed a real-time monitoring system for airborne influenza H3N2 viruses by integrating electronically addressable silicon nanowire (SiNW) sensor devices, microfluidics and bioaerosol-to-hydrosol air sampling techniques. When airborne influenza H3N2 virus samples were collected and delivered to antibody-modified SiNW devices, discrete nanowire conductance changes were observed within seconds. In contrast, the conductance levels remained relatively unchanged when indoor air or clean air samples were delivered. A 10-fold increase in virus concentration was found to give rise to about 20-30% increase in the sensor response. The selectivity of the sensing device was successfully demonstrated using H1N1 viruses and house dust allergens. From the simulated aerosol release to the detection, we observed a time scale of 1-2 min. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests revealed that higher virus concentrations in the air samples generally corresponded to higher conductance levels in the SiNW devices. In addition, the display of detection data on remote platforms such as cell phone and computer was also successfully demonstrated with a wireless module. The work here is expected to lead to innovative methods for biological aerosol monitoring, and further improvements in each of the integrated elements could extend the system to real world applications.","Shen, Fangxia; Tan, Miaomiao; Wang, Zhenxing; Yao, Maosheng; Xu, Zhenqiang; Wu, Yan; Wang, Jindong; Guo, Xuefeng; Zhu, Tong",Environmental science & technology,648,27

Online and app-based forms of therapy for mental health are burgeoning. It is therefore crucial to identify features that are most effective and engaging for young users. Objectives: This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of digital mental health interventions and their effectiveness in addressing anxiety and depression in young people to determine factors that relate to outcomes, adherence, and engagement with such interventions. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken, including a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials that compared use of a digital intervention for depression in young people to a no-intervention control group, and 6 comparing the intervention to an active control condition. A thematic analysis and narrative synthesis of 41 studies was also performed. Results: The pooled effect size of digital mental health interventions on depression in comparison to a no-intervention control was small (Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55), while the pooled effect size of studies comparing an intervention group to an active control showed no significant differences (Cohen's d = 0.14, 95% CI -.04 to 0.31). Pooled effect sizes were higher when supervision was involved (studies with no-intervention controls: Cohen's d = 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80; studies with active control: Cohen's d = 0.49, 95% CI -0.11, 1.01). Engagement and adherence rates were low. Qualitative analysis revealed that users liked interventions with a game-like feel and relatable, interactive content. Educational materials were perceived as boring, and users were put off by non-appealing interfaces and technical glitches. Conclusions: Digital interventions work better than no intervention to improve depression in young people when results of different studies are pooled together. However, these interventions may only be of clinical significance when use is highly supervised. Digital interventions do not work better than active alternatives regardless of the level of support. Future interventions need to move beyond the use of digital educational materials, considering other ways to attract and engage young people and to ensure relevance and appeal.","Garrido, Sandra; Millington, Chris; Cheers, Daniel; Boydell, Katherine; Schubert, Emery; Meade, Tanya; Nguyen, Quang Vinh",Frontiers in psychiatry,648,1

The MSK health monitoring plays a vital role in maintaining the body mobility and quality of life. Manual approaches for musculoskeletal health monitoring are subjective and require a clinician's intervention. The evolution in motion tracking technology enables us to capture the fine details of body movements. The research community has proposed various approaches to help clinicians in diagnosis and monitor treatment sessions. This paper succinctly reviews the evolution of technology-assisted approaches for musculoskeletal health monitoring, using motion capture sensors. To streamline the search through the literature database, the PICOS framework and PRISMA method have been incorporated. The present study reviews methods to transform motion capture data into kinematics variables and factors that affect the tracking performance of RGB-D sensors. Furthermore, widely utilized time-series filters for skeletal data denoising and smoothing for kinematics analysis, stochastic models for movement modeling, rule-based and template-based approaches for rehabilitation exercises assessment, and telerehabilitation sessions for remote health monitoring are explored. This article analyzes skeletal tracking methods by providing advantages and drawbacks of the state of the art rehabilitation sessions assessment, skeletal joint kinematics analysis, and MSK Telerehabilitation approaches. It also discusses the possible future research avenues to improve musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Our review signifies that RGB-D sensor-based approaches are inexpensive and portable for disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring. It can also be a viable option for clinicians to provide contactless healthcare access to patients in the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mangal, Naveen Kumar; Tiwari, Anil Kumar",Computers in biology and medicine,648,16

Hospitals, nursing homes and employers are adopting infection control strategies based on guidance from leading public health organizations such as the CDC, OSHA, FDA, and other government bodies. Certain hard surface disinfectants are effective against SARS-CoV-2 but are not suitable for use on skin or personal protective equipment (PPE) that comes into contact with skin. Furthermore, near-ubiquitous alcohol-based hand sanitizers are acceptable for use on skin, but they are not suitable for use on PPE. PPE, especially masks, are also commonly being used for longer durations than normal. There is a need for new products and techniques that can effectively disinfect PPE during wear time without having detrimental effects on surrounding skin. Clyraguard spray is a novel copper iodine complex designed to be used on non-critical PPE. Methods: In this study, the Clyraguard copper iodine complex was tested for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Results: These data indicate the product to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers in a time-dependent manner, with the virus being reduced below the detection limits within 30 minutes.

Our primary goal is to understand some of the complex coupled dynamics between factors that ultimately regulate the epidemic case load. As potentially crucial factors, we focus on population mobility and vaccination patters (both related to risk of contracting the SARS-Cov2 virus). These factors may in turn depend on demographic parameters (which are unrelated to the epidemic evolution), but also on the population response to the epidemic outbreak itself. In our work, we use correlation analyses, in conjunction with open source data from US states, to investigate the type and strength (1) of the relationships between demographic measures and epidemic, mobility and vaccination timelines during our established time window; (2) of the bidirectional coupling between these timelines. We showed that the wide between-state differences in epidemic outcome correspond to between-state differences in demographic measures (such as density, income, political affiliation). As a potential underlying mechanism, we found that demographic measures are also predictive of the degree of coupling between epidemic timelines (on one hand) and vaccination and mobility timelines (on the other hand), coupling which can be broadly interpreted as the population's behavioral response to the epidemic. In support of this idea, our analysis shows this response to be tightly correlated with epidemic outcome. This suggests that a state's demographic profile may be invaluable to generating predictions on the epidemic evolution in the respective state, and that this information may be used to understand the weaknesses of a state and how to compensate for them to improve epidemic outcome (e.g., via state centralized incentives, and customized mitigation strategies).","Radulescu, A.; Alonso, T.; Reid, N.; Sanchez, J.",,648,24

In response, YouTube creators participated in the #StayHome #WithMe movement (SHWM) and made myriad videos for people experiencing loneliness or boredom at home. User-shared videos generate parasocial attachment and virtual connectedness. However, there is limited knowledge of how creators contributed videos during disasters to provide social provisions as disaster-relief. Grounded on Weiss's loneliness theory, this work analyzed 1488 SHWM videos to examine video sharing as a pathway to social provisions. Findings suggested that skill and knowledge sharing, entertaining arts, homelife activities, live chatting, and gameplay were the most popular video styles. YouTubers utilized parasocial relationships to form a space for staying away from the disaster. SHWM YouTubers provided friend-like, mentor-like, and family-like provisions through videos in different styles. Family-like provisions led to the highest overall viewer engagement. Based on the findings, design implications for supporting viewers' mental wellbeing in disasters are discussed.","Niu, Shuo; Bartolome, Ava; Mai, Cat; Ha, Nguyen B.",,648,4

The process can be complete once to form a cladded layer or can be carried out numerous times to build complex three-dimensional structures. One major obstacle to the widescale acceptance of DED technology is the tightly coupled relationship between mechanical performance and process parameters. This study investigated the effects of layer orientation on the mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel (SS) parts fabricated via DED process. Quasi-static tensile tests were conducted on DED 316L SS specimens fabricated in orientation increments of 15 degrees with respect to the loading direction. Specimens were tested in their as-built condition without post process heat treatments. Yield, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and maximum elongation measurement were taken, contributing to the ultimate finding that: Young’s Modulus is largely unaffected, yield stress may vary by 73 MPa corresponding to a 30 degree change in layer orientation, ultimate tensile strength does not show a strong statistical outcome based on layer orientation, and ductility shows a strong positive correlation to increases in layer angle with respect to axis of tensile stress.","Kersten, Samuel; Praniewicz, Maxwell; Kurfess, Thomas; Saldana, Christopher",Procedia Manufacturing,648,1

Outdoor workers are being exposed to increasing wildfire-related particulate matter and smoke. Recognizing this emerging risk, Washington adopted an emergency rule and is presently engaged in creating a permanent rule to protect outdoor workers from wildfire smoke exposure. While there are growing bodies of literature on the exposure to and health effects of wildfire smoke in the general public and wildland firefighters, there is a gap in knowledge about wildfire smoke exposure among outdoor workers generally, and construction workers specifically, a large category of outdoor workers in Washington totaling 200,000 people. In this study, we link several data sources including state-collected employment data and national ambient air quality data to gain insight into the risk of wildfire exposure among construction workers in Washington. Our results indicate the number of poor air quality days has increased in August and September in recent years. We also observed that over the last decade these months with the greatest potential for wildfire smoke exposure coincide with an annual peak in construction employment that was typically 9.4 to 42.7% larger across Washington counties (one county was 75.8%). Lastly, we considered different air quality thresholds and retrospectively tallied days in Washington that would have triggered rules protecting workers from wildfire smoke. We found the ""encouraged"" threshold of the Washington emergency rule (20.5 g/m3) would result in 5.5 times more days subject to the wildfire rule on average across all Washington counties compared to its ""required"" threshold (55.5 g/m3), and in 2020 the rule could have created demand for 1.35 million N-95 filtering facepiece respirators among construction workers. These results have important implications for both employers and policy makers as rules are developed. We also discuss the potential economic and policy implications of wildfire smoke exposure, exposure control strategies, and data gaps that would improve our understanding of construction worker exposure to wildfire smoke.","Zuidema, C.; Austin, E.; Cohen, M.

More specifically, the authors draw on Bauman's (1990) “moral impulse” to explore how the interrelated tactics of distancing, effacement of the face and reduction of people to traits tend to weaken moral considerations and negatively influences decisions and actions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a qualitative approach that involves an interpretive textual analysis of the COVID-19 responses of a Big 4 accounting firm. Their study uses two vignettes in which they problematise aspects of the actions and ethico-social contribution of a Big4 firm in the heat of a global pandemic. Findings: The findings reveal examples of effacement of the human face (depersonalization/dehumanization) and reduction of persons to traits, as well as excessive distancing between the “doing” actors and those individuals who bear the consequences of those actions. Revealing an opportunity lost, the authors’ vignettes indicate that the reduction to traits tactics led to dissembling and dehumanizing employees into resources that perform tasks that are “value-add” for the organisation, consonant with neoliberal ideologies. Research limitations/implications: The common limitations of qualitative approach apply to the current study for generalisability. The authors also rely heavily on publicly available information given the time frame they were faced with and their chosen research approach. Social implications: Drawing on accounting delineation debates, the paper calls for societal dialogues for reshaping the “official” accounting of events. Originality/value: The authors elaborate moral impulse through the interrelated tactics of distancing, effacement of the face and reduction to traits, during a crisis. Their study mobilises a moral evaluation through which they uncover documented responses by a Big4 firm during the COVID-19 crisis.

This paper proposes an algorithm to solve the problem of how to choose the most appropriate alternative from numerous alternatives in the limited time from the perspective of management. First of all, we have compared various data structures for keeping the comparison results of alternatives. After comparisons, we adopt the hesitant fuzzy incomplete probabilistic linguistic preference relation matrix to save the information which can keep the first-hand valuable collected data to the maximum extent;then, we can obtain the missing values with the help of the fault tree analysis method, which can consider both subjective evaluation data and objective historical data simultaneously. Meanwhile, the fault tree analysis method can find development laws with the help of similar infectious diseases that have occurred in the past. The definition of consistency index is also introduced which can measure whether there are contradictions and the degree of contradiction in the decision results. Only those data that meet the consistency requirements can be used for decision-making and then a method is proposed to effectively reduce the degree of inconsistency. The information aggregation method will be adopted subsequently, and we can obtain the ranking of alternatives. An instance with specific execution steps is also introduced to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm proposed in this paper;in the end, several types of comparisons with typical algorithms proposed by other scholars are carried out, and all the experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and innovative in some aspects.","Fu, Ming Wang Lifang Zhu Jiaming Zheng Bingyun",Complexity,648,11

Although a wide range of symptoms has been reported in patients confirmed to have COVID-19, fever is the symptom most commonly used for detection in this setting. However, this symptom is common to many other diseases, such as influenza and the common cold. As many studies have suggested, COVID-19 can be detected more accurately if other symptoms are considered. Therefore, the proposed system will concatenate multiple COVID-19-related symptoms for a more accurate classification system. The proposed system will consider the detection of three symptoms: fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. The proposed system will use a Raspberry Pi and connected sensors to detect these symptoms and then, by using artificial intelligence, will classify people as suspected COVID-19 patients or not. The sensors used to detect the symptoms are a thermal camera, a microphone, an infrared-based camera, and a depth-sensing device.

The purpose of this research is to analyze the performance of sharia financing in sharia financing institutions and cooperatives amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The method used is field research using the qualitative paradigm with the phenomenological approach. Primary data were collected from observations and direct interviews, while secondary data were obtained through books, journals, articles related to Islamic financing. Following the data processing, analysis was carried out using data validity techniques and data reduction, thus conclusion could be drawn. The research was conducted in three sites;BMT (Baitul Mal wa Tamwil) Amanah Ummah, BMT Kube Colomadu Sejahtera, and BMT Wanita Mandiri. The results of the study showed that sharia financing activities at those BMTs decreased due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Likewise, the level of customer ability fell due to the physical distancing in some of the customer's residences, reduced income, and increased consumptive costs, which led to default in customers at three different BMT locations.

Novel methods of N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this concern and keep HCWs safe. Methods: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as >6 log10 reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was identified. The treated masks were then assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency (FE). Assessment of PAA off-gassing from a treated mask was also performed. Results: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of N95 respirators in a 2447 cubic feet room with deploy and dwell times of 16 and 32 minutes respectively, and a total cycle time of 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA from the treated masks.

Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants, we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains, including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), A.23.1 and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside of the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies. Importance Therapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), but their effectiveness may be reduced by virus variants with mutations affecting the spike protein. To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants, we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein. We found that the presence of a key substitution in variants with multiple spike substitutions can predict resistance against a variant, but that other substitutions can affect the degree of resistance in unpredictable ways. These finding highlight complex interactions among substitutions in the spike protein affecting virus neutralization and potentially virus entry into cells.","Lusvarghi, Sabrina; Wang, Wei; Herrup, Rachel; Neerukonda, Sabari Nath; Vassell, Russell; Bentley, Lisa; Eakin, Ann E.; Erlandson, Karl J.; Weiss, Carol D.",bioRxiv,648,13

This randomized clinical trial in a hospital setting is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this drug in RT-PCR positive Covid patients. Materials and Methods RT-PCR positive Covid-19 patients, who gave the consent for the trial, were allotted to a control, or case, arm based on block randomization procedure. The control arm received the standard care consisting of paracetamol, ivermectin and other adjuvant therapy. The case arm had indomethacin instead of paracetamol, retaining the other medications. The endpoint was the development of hypoxia/desaturation. Secondary endpoints were time to become afebrile and time to resolution of cough and myalgia. The results of 210 patients were available at this point, with 102 patients in the indomethacin arm and 108 in the paracetamol arm. The complete patient profile along with everyday clinical parameters were monitored. Blood chemistry at the time of admission and discharge were also carried out. Results As no one required high-flow oxygen, desaturation with an SpO2 level of 93 and below was considered an important goal. In the indomethacin group, no one out of the 102 patients developed desaturation. On the other hand, 20 of the 108 patients in the paracetamol arm developed desaturation. Patients who received indomethacin also experienced more rapid symptomatic relief compared to those in the paracetamol arm, with most symptoms disappearing in half the time. A total of 56 patients out of 108 in the paracetamol arm had fever on the seventh day, while no one recorded fever in the indomethacin arm. No adverse event was reported in either arms.

The autoethnographic narrative presented here is a composition of vignettes from my struggle with anxiety in the 4th and 5th tenure track years. Throughout, I attempt to openly present my struggles and conclude by proposing ways in higher education can aid faculty, staff, and students in creating a better structure.

In the meantime, global online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily, most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media platforms such as Twitter. When they refer to COVID-19, there are mainly two ways: using controversial terms like""Chinese Virus""or""Wuhan Virus"", or using non-controversial terms like""Coronavirus"". In this study, we attempt to characterize the Twitter users who use controversial terms and those who use non-controversial terms. We use the Tweepy API to retrieve 17 million related tweets and the information of their authors. We find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users across their demographics, user-level features like the number of followers, political following status, as well as their geo-locations. Moreover, we apply classification models to predict Twitter users who are more likely to use controversial terms. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to characterize users with respect to their usage of controversial terms during a major crisis.","Lyu, Hanjia; Chen, Long; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo",,648,1

In resource-limited countries, healthcare systems with fewer options for intervention are likely to face more economic difficulties. The goal of this review is to summarize and explore the cost and economic effect of COVID-19 on global health systems. The study starts with a crisis synopsis and costs of COVID-19 treatment, then discusses how health has been affected and approaches to alleviating the burden while at the same time limiting an inevitable income loss. Even if it is difficult to project COVID-19 spending because there are many uncertainties about the disease and its future course, various reports have quantified the amounts spent on direct COVID-19 treatment in different countries. The healthcare sector around the world has faced catastrophic financial challenges and experienced the largest global recession in history. Most governments in the world cannot avoid the devastating economic impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare sector, but they can try to avert the worst effects. With the spread of the coronavirus, the healthcare systems are facing a financial crisis as a result of actions that countries have adopted to mitigate the spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to act swiftly and in meaningful ways to minimize the fallout from this shock.","Almalki, Z. S.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International,648,24

This research aimed to uncover how the public perceived the impact of Covid-19 on the agriculture and food sector. The online survey was conducted, and the data from 428 participants were analysed using the SPSS (v.23) program. The third of respondents (30.8%) believed the outbreak would last between six months to one year, during which time food shortages will occur (32.5%). While 27.4% of the respondents reported that they stockpiled food, 44.8% reported that if the outbreak continued, they would stock up on food. Participants were concerned that if planting cannot be done, food shortages will occur (74.6%), basic foodstuffs cannot be produced (67.8%), food imports (69.4%) and exports (74.6%) will be adversely affected by the outbreak.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease without a primary cure that requires lifelong care and is characterized by pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). Wearable devices could provide a way for long-term monitoring of disease progression and early signs of PEx to intervene as early as possible, thereby improving long-term outcomes. Methods. In-hospital feasibility study (n = 26) to 1) assess the ability of Byteflies Sensor Dot to collect relevant cardiorespiratory data in people with CF and its compatibility with clinical workflows, 2) identify candidate digital biomarkers, and 3) collect user feedback from patients and healthcare providers. Results. Collected sample-level biopotential, bioimpedance and actigraphy data were of high quality. Sensor Dot heart rate (HR) correlated with hospital HR, whereas respiratory rate (RR) did not. HR and RR were associated with CF severity, and HR and coughing with PEx. Willingness to use the device was very high with CF patients and study coordinators considered the device easy-to-use. Conclusion. Determining if a wearable is fit-for-purpose is a long and multidisciplinary process that requires involvement from all stakeholders as early as possible in the development process. Our pilot identified interesting correlations between cardiorespiratory parameters as measured by the wearable, and CF severity and PEx. Together with the usability data, this will inform the next steps in the clinical development process.","Vandendriessche, B.; Van den Bergh, B.; Storms, V.; Chmiel, J. F.; Roesch, E. A.",,648,5

To examine long-term complications in women with SUI and/or POP, with and without surgical mesh implants. Design: Longitudinal open cohort study from April 01 2006 to November 30 2018 Setting: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold database, linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) inpatient data, Office for National Statistics mortality data, and Index of Multiple Deprivation socioeconomic status data. Participants: Women aged [≥]18 years with a diagnostic SUI/POP code. Exposure: Mesh surgery coded in HES or CPRD data, compared to no mesh surgery. Main Outcomes measures: Rates of diagnoses of depression, anxiety or self-harm (composite measure) and sexual dysfunction, using Cox proportional hazards regression, and rates of prescriptions for antibiotics and opioids, using negative binomial regression. Results: There were 220,544 women eligible for inclusion; 74% (n=162,687) had SUI, 37% (n=82,123) had POP and 11% (n=24,266) had both. Women undergoing mesh surgery for SUI or POP had higher rates of antibiotic use (SUI: IRR 1.15 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.18; p<0.001); POP: IRR 1.09 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.14; p<0.001)). Women with no previous history of the outcome, who underwent mesh surgery for SUI or POP, had higher rates of depression, anxiety, or self-harm (SUI: HR 2.43 (95% CI 2.19 to 2.70; p<0.001; POP: HR 1.47 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.81; p<0.001)), sexual dysfunction (SUI: HR 1.88 (1.50 to 2.36; p<0.001); POP: HR 1.64 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.63; p=0.04)) and opioid use (SUI: IRR 1.40 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.56, p<0.001); POP: IRR 1.23 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.49; p=0.04)). Women with a history of depression, anxiety and self-harm had lower rates of these outcomes with SUI or POP mesh surgery (SUI: HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.73; p<0.001), POP: HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79; p<0.001). Women with a history of opioid use who had POP mesh surgery had lower rates of prescriptions (IRR 0.91 95% CI (0.86 to 0.96); p=0.001). Conclusions: Mesh surgery was associated with poor mental and sexual health outcomes, alongside increased opioid and antibiotic use, in women with no history of these outcomes and improved mental health, and lower opioid use, in women with a previous history of these outcomes. Careful consideration of the benefits and risk of mesh surgery for women with SUI or POP on an individual basis is required.","McFadden, E.; Lay-Flurrie, S.; Koshiaris, C.; Richards, G.

While the official Software Carpentry curriculum is comprehensive, we found that it contains too much content for a two-day workshop. We also felt that the independent nature of the lessons left learners confused about how to integrate the newly acquired programming skills in their own work. Thus, we developed a new curriculum that aims to teach novices how to implement reproducible research principles in their own data analysis. The curriculum integrates live coding lessons with individual-level and group-based practice exercises, and also serves as a succinct resource that learners can reference both during and after the workshop. Moreover, it lowers the entry barrier for new instructors as they do not have to develop their own teaching materials or sift through extensive content. We developed this curriculum during a two-day sprint, successfully used it to host a two-day virtual workshop with almost 40 participants, and updated the material based on instructor and learner feedback. We hope that our new curriculum will prove useful to future instructors interested in teaching workshops with similar learning objectives.","Lapp, Zena; Sovacool, Kelly L.; Lesniak, Nick; King, Dana; Barnier, Catherine; Flickinger, Matthew; Krüger, Jule; Armour, Courtney R.; Lapp, Maya M.; Tallant, Jason; Diao, Rucheng; Oneka, Morgan; Tomkovich, Sarah; Anderson, Jacqueline Moltzau; Lucas, Sarah K.; Schloss, Patrick D.",bioRxiv,648,1

We present such a scenario, whereby a patient had a delayed presentation of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to fear of breaching COVID-19 lockdown rules. As a result of the patient presenting well outside the optimal treatment window, her STEMI was complicated by a severe ventricular septal defect (VSD).

Since the breakthrough of transfer learning-based methods, BERT models are used in a variety of biomedical and clinical applications. For the available data sets, these models show excellent results – partly exceeding the inter-annotator agreements. However, biomedical named entity recognition applied on COVID-19 preprints shows a performance drop compared to the results on available test data. The question arises how well trained models are able to predict on completely new data, i.e. to generalize. Based on the example of disease named entity recognition, we investigate the robustness of different machine learning-based methods – thereof transfer learning – and show that current state-of-the-art methods work well for a given training and the corresponding test set but experience a significant lack of generalization when applying to new data.

Existing vaccines have limited effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Therefore, novel vaccines to match current mutated viral lineages with long-term protective immunity are urgently in demand. In the current study, we for the first time designed a recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus 5 (rAAV5)-based vaccine named as rAAV-COVID-19 vaccine (Covacinplus) by using RBD-plus of spike protein with both the single-stranded and the self-complementary AAV5 delivering vectors (ssAAV5 and scAAAV5), which provides excellent protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. A single dose vaccination induced the strong immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The induced neutralizing antibodies (NAs) titers were maintained at a high peak level of over 1:1024 even after more than one year of injection and accompanied with functional T-cells responses in mice. Importantly, both ssAAV- and scAAV-based RBD-plus vaccines exhibited high levels of serum NAs against current circulating variants including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge test showed that ssAAV5-RBD-plus vaccine protected both young and old age mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and the lower respiratory tracts. Moreover, whole genome sequencing demonstrated that AAV vector DNA sequences were not found in the genome of the vaccinated mice after one year vaccination, demonstrating excellent safety of the vaccine. Taken together, this study suggests that rAAV5-based vaccine is powerful against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with long-term protective immunity and excellent safety, which has great potential for development into prophylactic vaccination in human to end this global pandemic.","Liao, Guochao; Fan, Xingxing; Lau, Hungyan; Liu, Zhongqiu; Li, Chinyu; Xu, Zeping; Zhang, Yu; Qi, Xiaoxiao; Li, Dan; Zhu, Qing; Chen, Liqing; Zhou, Hua; Zhu, Sisi; Ke, Bixia; Pan, Hudan; Cong, Zhe; Li, Yongchao; Feng, Qian; Lv, Qi; Liu, Jiangning; Liang, Dan; Li, An’an; Hong, Wenshan; Li, Yebo; Bao, Linlin; Zhou, Feng; Gao, Hongbin; Liang, Shi; Huang, Bihong; Wu, Miaoli; Qin, Chuan; Ke, Changwen; Liu, Liang",bioRxiv,648,1

Infection prevention relies on donning and doffing (D&D) personal protective equipment (PPE) safely. Studies have suggested the importance of clear D&D instructions in reducing the risk of self-contamination.1 Guidance on Covid-19 PPE from Public Health England (PHE) was sparse and ambiguous, leaving many operating department (OD) and ICU staff feeling unprotected.2 In view of this, anaesthetic trainees devised D&D checklists to improve staff confidence and safety.A survey was created asking OD and ICU staff to rate their confidence in D&D following PHE’s guidance on a 10-point Likert scale (1 - low;10 - high), if PHE guidance provided sufficient detail, and how it could be improved upon. New D&D checklists were devised based on existing guidelines and scientific evidence. Final checklists were approved and disseminated by Trust management. Same staff completed a post-intervention survey, asking to rate their confidence using new checklists on the same scale, if the new checklists improved upon PHE’s, whether sufficient checklists were displayed, and if not, where else they should be displayed. Data was tested using Wilcoxon matched pairs test.37 staff completed both surveys.

We extracted routine HbA1c data from laboratory systems at 5 UK hospitals from October2017-September2020 (representing 3.3million people;~4.8% of the UK population). From these data(3million tests), we calculated monthly missed monitoring/diagnostic tests from 23 March-30September 2020. We found that HbA1c tests dropped by 82-88% in April and had not reached expected volumes by September(Figure 1). During the 6-month period, in people with DM/at risk of DM, 206,422 monitoring tests were missed. Of these, 23,466 (11.4%) had previous HbA1c values ≥59mmol/mol. The testing delay in this group would, on average, result in a mean increase in HbA1c of 5.7 mmol/mol above that expected if monitoring was according to NICE guidance. There were also an estimated 81,245 missed diagnostic tests. Of these, ~6,105(7.5%) would be expected to be in the pre-DM range(42-47 mmol/mol) and ~3,633(4.5%) within DM range (≥48 mmol/mol), with ~1,333 of these having HbA1c values of ≥76 mmol/mol. Extrapolating to the UK population, this equates to missed monitoring tests in 489,000 people with sub-optimally-controlled DM, ~127,000 missed pre-DM and 76,000 missed DM diagnoses. Our findings illustrate the widespread collateral impact of implementing measures to mitigate COVID-19 impact in people with, or being investigated for DM.","Holland, David Heald Adrian H.; Stedman, Michael Green Lewis A.; Scargill, Jonathan Duff Christopher Hanna Fahmy Wu Pensee Fryer Anthony A.",Diabetes,648,16

As a part of its efforts to control TB, the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted the End TB Strategy in 2014 to reduce TB incidence by 90% between 2015 and 2035, with intermediate targets every five years. We examined TB incidence data from 2000 to 2018 for 40 high burden countries (HBCs) from the WHO published statistics, contextualized and assessed trends over time, and projected incidence to 2035 for each country. Two recurrent patterns accounted for 26 of the 40 HBCs: linear decrease (n = 14) or a peak in the 2000s followed by decline (n = 12). As uncontrolled HIV is the greatest risk factor for TB, we assessed trends in TB in HIV infected people and TB in HIV uninfected people separately in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence. The projections of current trends were compared against the reductions required to meet the WHO End TB targets. Of the 25 countries without a high burden of TB, only 5 are on track to meet the End TB targets: Ethiopia, Laos, Myanmar, Russia, and South Korea. Of the 15 high HIV burden countries, 6 are on track to meet the End TB targets: Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Overall, we predict 62 million excess cases of TB between 2020 and 2035 in the 29 HBCs projected to miss the WHO End TB targets. In high HIV burden countries, new programs aimed directly at TB will be required to maintain momentum. Moreover, our projections are based on data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; the disruption of the pandemic is overwhelmingly likely to interrupt vital TB services and increase TB incidence.

At the molecular level, this process is defined by the cyclical co-expression of both core transcription factors and off-target genes across time. While interactions between these molecular clocks are likely necessary for proper homeostasis, these features remain undefined. Here, we utilize integrative analysis of a baboon diurnal transcriptome atlas to characterize the properties of gene networks under circadian control. We found that 53.4% (8,120) of baboon genes are rhythmically expressed body-wide. In addition, >30% of gene-gene interactions exhibit periodic co-expression patterns, with core circadian genes more cyclically co-expressed than others. Moreover, two basic network modes were observed at the systems level: daytime and nighttime mode. Daytime networks were enriched for genes involved in metabolism, while nighttime networks were enriched for genes associated with growth and cellular signaling. A substantial number of diseases only form significant disease modules at either daytime or nighttime. In addition, we found that 216 of 313 genes encoding products that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are rhythmically expressed throughout the body. Importantly, more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 related genes enriched modules are rhythmically expressed, and have significant network proximities with circadian regulators. Our data suggest that synchronization amongst circadian gene networks is necessary for proper homeostatic functions and circadian regulators have close interactions with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Jie; Nie, Pengxing; Turck, Christoph W.; Wang, Guang-Zhong",bioRxiv,648,16

[Persian],17.427368,4.117719,2020,"Purpose: This paper explores the dissonance between co-production and expectations of impact in a research project on student loneliness over the 2019/2020 academic year. Specific characteristics of the project – the subject matter, interpolation of a global respiratory pandemic, informal systems of care that arose among students and role of the university in providing the context and funding for the research – brought co-production into heightened tension with the instrumentalisation of project outputs. Design/methodology/approach: The project consisted of a series of workshops, research meetings and mixed-methods online journalling between 2019 and 2020. This paper is primarily a critical reflection on that research, based on observations by and conversations between the authors, together with discourse analysis of research data. Findings: The authors argue that co-producing research with students on university contexts elevates existing tensions between co-production and institutional valuations of impact, that co-production with students who had experienced loneliness made necessary space for otherwise absent support and care, that the responsibility to advocate for evidence and co-researchers came into friction with how the university felt the research could be useful and that each of these converging considerations are interconnected symptoms of the ongoing marketisation of HE. Originality/value: This paper provides a novel analysis of co-production, impact and higher education in the context of an original research project with specific challenges and constraints. It is a valuable contribution to methodological literatures on co-production, multidisciplinary research into student loneliness and reflexive work on the difficult uses of evidence in university contexts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cooper, F.; Jones, C.",Qualitative Research Journal,648,5

To date, nearly every U.S. sector has been impacted by COVID-19. To sustain their core missions, highly institutionalized organizations such as universities have had to rethink foundational structures and policies. Using a historical ethnographic approach to investigate records from faculty senate deliberations at ?Rural State University? (RSU), the authors examine the implementation of a temporary grading policy to supplement traditional, qualitative grades spring 2020 during the outbreak. The authors find that RSU implemented a temporary, supplemental grading policy as a provisional institution to momentarily supersede traditional grading as a means to?as soon as possible?return to it. This finding contrasts with the common understanding that provisional institutions operate primarily as a temporary solution to a social problem that leads to more stable and enduring, ostensibly nonprovisional institutions. The temporary grading policy, the authors argue, constitutes a ?late-stage? provisional institution and, with this new lens, subsequently characterize the more commonplace understanding of provisional institutions as ?early-stage.? This contribution has theoretical implications for studies of institutions and empirical implications for research on shared governance and disruption in higher education.","Kinney, Alexander B.; Rowland, Nicholas J.",Sociological Perspectives,648,16

Knowledge about mediating pathways that account for the association between sensory impairment and cognitive impairment is scarce. Mediators of this association could serve as possible future intervention targets. We examined longitudinal associations between sensory impairment and cognitive functioning indirectly through social isolation. Research Design and Methods: Data were taken from a nationally representative panel study, The National Health and Aging Trends Study, an annual survey of Medicare beneficiaries age [≥] 65. Participants (N = 6,286) from Rounds 5, 6, and 7 (2015, 2016, 2017), with complete data on self-reported VI and/or HI status at baseline. Structural equation models were estimated to test longitudinal direct and indirect associations. Results: Adjusting for covariates, cross-sectional results indicated that all sensory impairments (VI, HI, and DSI) were negatively associated with all cognitive functioning measures through social isolation. Longitudinally, only VI was indirectly associated with word-recall scores across 1 and 2 years through social isolation, as well as across 2 years for orientation. Discussion and Implications: As social isolation is both a consequence of sensory impairment and a risk factor for cognitive impairment, it provided a starting point from which to study the process of cognitive decline among those with sensory impairments. Awareness of the association of sensory impairment with social isolation, as well as its longitudinal implications for cognitive health, may enhance our ability to intervene.","Yorgason, J.; Trujillo Tanner, C.

There is limited evidence about SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta and clinical development of HDP after COVID-19 throughout different periods of gestation. Methods: This was a case-control study in women with and without gestational hypertensive disorders (HDP) after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR during pregnancy. Patients were matched by gestational age at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. We performed an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in placenta. Results: A total of 28 women were enrolled. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester and the remaining twelve patients in the others trimesters. Ten placentas (35.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, nine of them (90%) belonged to the HDP group versus one (10%) in control group (p=0.009). Those cases with the highest loads of viral RNA developed severe-preeclampsia. Conclusion: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in placentas of patients with HDP after COVID-19. There seems to be a relationship between high viral load in the placenta and the development of hypertensive disorders. We found SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta after birth in mothers infected at the first half of pregnancy, but with negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at delivery. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy could trigger gestational hypertensive disorders through placenta-related mechanisms.","FABRE, M.; CALVO, P.; RUIZ-MARTINEZ, S.; PERAN, M.; OROS, D.; MEDEL, A.; STRUNK, M.; BENITO, R.; SCHOORLEMMER, J.; PAULES, C.",,648,1

In Argentina, there is a significant absence of data regarding influenza severe respiratory disease and, therefore, a lack of knowledge about the impact of this disease at health institutions. Objectives Analysis of clinical characteristics, image findings and laboratory variables in patients with influenza viruses during 2019. Methods Retrospective, single-centre study, we analyzed all confirmed cases of influenza in a high complexity hospital from Buenos Aires. Results 143 patients with influenza virus were hospitalized in this period of time. The 98.6% were infected by type A influenza, and most of them 61.5% were H1N1 subtype. Median age was 71 years (IQR 60 - 82), 77.6% were older than 70 years, and 88.1% had at least one coexisting illness. 39.1% of the patients required intensive care, 11.1% invasive mechanical ventilation and 4.1% died during hospitalization. Conclusion Mortality and severity were similar to previous series of non-pandemic influenza. Analysis of annual data would be valuable in order to document the severity of influenza hospitalizations by age-group and comorbidities according to the circulating influenza viruses.","Carboni Bisso, I.; Prado, E.; Cantos, J.; Masso, A.; Staneloni, I.; San Roman, E.; Huespe, I.; Las Heras, M.",,648,25

NSAIDs are one of the most commonly prescribed and used pain medications for acute and chronic rheumatic diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA) and osteoarthritis. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the impact of covid-19 pandemic on NSAIDs prescription. Methods: A cross-sectional web survey was disseminated to all Tunisian rheumatologists through a mailing system and social media. The French version was accessible on Google form. It included close-ended questions about the prescription of NSAIDs during covid-19 pandemic. Participation was anonymous. Data collection and analysis was performed between January the first and January 30, 2021. Results: Among one hundred and thirty Tunisian rheumatologists, thirty responded to the online questionnaire. Ninety percent of participants were women. The mean age of rheumatologists was 34 years [25-57]. The duration of practice was inferior to 5 years in 59.3%, between 5 and 10 years in 18.5%, and superior to 10 years in 22.2% of cases. Sixty-three percent of rheumatologists reported that their activity decreased during covid-19 pandemic. NSAIDs prescription was avoided as much as possible in 40.7% of cases. The participants indicated NSAIDs less frequently in 33.3% of cases, and as much as before the pandemic in one-quarter of cases. Rheumatologists believed that NSAIDs worsen the respiratory symptoms (67%), delay recovery (55%), and increase mortality (48%), hospitalization in intensive care (44%), and infectious complications (33%). The participants suggested that the most incriminated NSAIDs were: Ibuprofen (7.4%), indomethacin (7.4%), celecoxib (7.4%), and diclofenac (3.4%). The majority of rheumatologists (74%) believed that all NSAIDs had a similar risk. For patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatologists replaced NSAIDs with paracetamol and corticoids in 78% and 11% of cases, respectively. If mandatory, reducing NSAIDs doses or duration was an option in 22% and 74% of cases. For patients with SpA, half of rheumatologists did not change the treatment. However, the participants limited the use of NSAIDs or discontinued the treatment in patients with comorbidities. More than 60% of rheumatologists didn't know the effect of NSAIDs in the post-covid-19 syndrome. Conclusion: Covid-19 pandemic has affected rheumatologists' practice. Rheumatic disease management during this pandemic may be challenging. More evidence is mandatory to standardize treatment prescription, especially with NSAIDs.","Ferjani, H.; Boussaa, H.; Maatallah, K.; Khalfalli, H.; Kaffel, D.; Hamdi, W.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,648,1

MethodsWe performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19. ResultsA total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c [â¤] 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and lymphopenia < 1,000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. ConclusionHypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors.

Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether fold switchers are naturally pervasive or rare exceptions to the well-established rule. To address this question, we developed a predictive method and applied it to the NusG superfamily of >15,000 transcription factors. We estimate that a substantial population (25%) of the proteins in this family switch folds. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies of 10 sequence-diverse variants confirmed our predictions. Subsequently, we leveraged family-wide predictions to determine both conserved contacts and taxonomic distributions of fold-switching proteins. Our results indicate that fold switching is pervasive in the NusG superfamily and that the one-sequence-one-structure protein folding paradigm significantly biases protein structure prediction strategies.","Porter, Lauren L.; Kim, Allen K.; Looger, Loren L.; Majumdar, Anaya; Starich, Mary",bioRxiv,648,1

The in-depth interviews allowed the team to qualitatively explore and generate themes around how COVID-19 had impacted sex workers in Singapore, and informed the design of the quantitative surveyor-administered survey questionnaire. Qualitative data were analyzed through framework analysis while survey data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, and multivariable Poisson regression models.ResultsCOVID-19 had a substantial impact on sex workers’ income, while the illegality of sex work, stigma, and the lack of work documentation were cited as exclusionary factors for access to alternative jobs or government relief. Sex workers had experienced an increase in food insecurity (57.3%), housing insecurity (32.8%), and sexual violence and compromise (8.2%), as well as a decrease in access to medical services (16.4%). Being transgender female was positively associated with increased food insecurity (aPR=1.23, 95%CI [1.08, 1.41]), housing insecurity (aPR=1.28, 95%CI [1.03, 1.60]) and decreased access to medical services (aPR=1.74, 95%CI [1.23, 2.46]), being a venue-based sex worker was positively associated with increased food insecurity (aPR=1.46, 95%CI [1.00, 2.13]), and being a non-Singaporean citizen or permanent resident was positively associated with increased housing insecurity (aPR=2.59, 95%CI [1.73, 3.85]).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that COVID-19 has led to a loss of income for sex workers, leading to a worsening of social and health conditions for sex workers. A lack of access to government relief among sex workers exacerbated such conditions.","Tan, R.; Ho, V.; Sherqueshaa, S.; Dee, W.; Lim, J.; Lo, J.; Teo, A.; O’Hara, C.; Ong, C.; Ching, A.; Wong, M.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,648,25

In Malawi, there have been two subsequent epidemic waves. We therefore aimed to describe the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi. Methods: We measured the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among randomly selected blood donor sera in Malawi from January 2020 to February 2021. In a subset, we also assesed in vitro neutralisation against the original variant (D614G WT) and the Beta variant. Findings: A total of 3586 samples were selected from the blood donor database, of which 2685 (74.9%) were male and 3132 (87.3%) were aged 20-49 years. Of the total, 469 (13.1%) were seropositive. Seropositivity was highest in October 2020 (15.7%) and February 2021 (49.7%) reflecting the two epidemic waves. Unlike the first wave, both urban and rural areas had high seropositivity by February 2021, Balaka (rural, 37.5%), Blantyre (urban, 54.8%), Lilongwe (urban, 54.5%) and Mzuzu (urban, 57.5%). First wave sera showed potent in vitro neutralisation activity against the original variant (78%[7/9]) but not the Beta variant (22% [2/9]). Second wave sera potently neutralised the Beta variant (73% [8/11]). Interpretation: The findings confirm extensive SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi over two epidemic waves with likely poor cross-protection to reinfection from the first on the second wave. Since prior exposure augments COVID-19 vaccine immunity, prioritising administration of the first dose in high SARS-CoV-2 exposure settings could maximise the benefit of the limited available vaccines in Malawi and the region.","Mandolo, J.; Msefula, J.; Henrion, M.

By performing network analysis of authors, citations, institutions, keywords, and countries, we explore semantic associations by applying visualization techniques. Our study shows lead taken by the United States, China, UK, Italy, India in COVID-19 research may be attributed to the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in those countries witnessing the first outbreak and also due to having access to COVID-19 data, access to labs for experimental trials, immediate funding, and overall support from the govt. agencies. A large number of publications and citations from India are due to co-authored publications with countries like the United States, UK, China, and Saudi Arabia. Findings show health sciences have the highest number of publications and citations, while physical sciences and social sciences and humanities counts were low. A large proportion of publications fall into the open-access category.

However, misleading demonstrations of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag-RDT on social media claimed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen could be detected in municipal water and food products. To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside of manufacturer recommendations. Methods: Using Panbio, various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested, with and without manufacturer buffer. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and tween-20), as well as the impact of temperatures (4{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C , and 45{degrees}C) and humidity (90%) on assay performance. Results: Direct sample testing (without the kit buffer), resulted in false positive signals resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2-positive controls tested under proper conditions. The likely explanation of these artifacts is non-specific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon, and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under conditions promoting artifact formation. Omitting, altering, and reverse engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function. Interestingly, the Panbio assay could tolerate some extremes of temperature and humidity outside of manufacturer claims. Conclusions: Our data support strict adherence to manufacturer instructions to avoid false positive SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT reactions, otherwise resulting in anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and dissemination of misinformation.","Patriquin, G.; Davidson, R.; Hatchette, T.

According to the reports, a novel Covid, SARS-CoV-2 is causing the sickness and it utilizes the ACE2 catalysts that plays a counter-administrative impact on the traditional ACE ward pathway, as a receptor for its entrance inside the cell. An outline of the infection inside the cell is given in this review. It likewise recommends that analogues of ADAM-17 may be utilized as medicines for this infection and further exploration must be led to know the mechanism of the RAS framework. Studies propose that the human receptor for COVID-19 could likewise be angiotensin-changing over compound 2 (ACE2) receptor practically like that of SARS CoV. In this audit we will attempt to investigate the study of disease transmission, morphology, indications, transmission & conclusion. Moreover we attempt to give a review about this life threatening infection.","Sarkar, D.",International Journal of Pharma and Bio Sciences,648,5

Animal experiments have shown that non-human primates, cats, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits and bats can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in felids, mink and dogs in the field. Here, we describe an in-depth investigation of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and humans living or working on these farms, using whole genome sequencing. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. At the moment, despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, there is ongoing transmission between mink farms with three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission.

In this chapter, we focus on the case of COVID-19, its effects on children and the public debate around the reopening of schools. The aim is to better understand the relationship between policy interventions in the face of an uncertain and rapidly changing knowledge landscape and the subsequent use of scientific information in public debates related to the policy interventions. Our approach is to combine scientific information from journal articles and preprints with their appearance in the popular media, including social media. First, we provide a picture of the different scientific areas and approaches, by which the effects of COVID-19 on children are being studied. Second, we identify news media and social media attention around the COVID-19 scientific output related to children and schools. We focus on policies and media responses in three countries: Spain, South Africa and the Netherlands. These countries have followed very different policy actions with regard to the reopening of schools and represent very different policy approaches to the same problem. We analyse the activity in (social) media around the debate between COVID-19, children and school closures by focusing on the use of references to scientific information in the debate. Finally, we analyse the dominant topics that emerge in the news outlets and the online debates. We draw attention to illustrative cases of miscommunication related to scientific output and conclude the chapter by discussing how information from scientific publication, the media and policy actions shape the public discussion in the context of a global health pandemic.","Nane, Gabriela F.; Schalkwyk, Franccois van; Dudek, Jonathan; Torres-Salinas, Daniel; Costas, Rodrigo; Robinson-Garcia, Nicolas",,648,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS The retrospective study included 221 patients (mean age: 61.7 years) with 356 malignant hepatic lesions. Ninety-four patients with 133 lesions underwent LF-MWA between September 2008 and February 2011, while 127 patients with 223 lesions were treated with HF-MWA between March 2011 and July 2013. MRI was performed after 24 h from each procedure and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post-ablation. Both groups were compared with the Fisher's exact test. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier test. RESULTS The mean initial ablation volume of LF-MWA was nearly half of HF-MWA (19.1 mL vs. 39.9 mL). The difference in volume between both systems was significant (p < .0001). With LF-MWA, 39/133 lesions (29.32%) progressed at follow-up while the number of lesions which progressed with HF-MWA was 10/223 (4.5%). The mean time to progression was 5.03 and 5.31 months for the lesions treated with LF-MWA and HF-MWA, respectively. The difference between both systems was significant (p = .00059). The 1-, 2- and 4-year overall survival rates for curative indication were 98.9%, 95.7% and 82.9% for LF-MWA, respectively, and were 100%, 97.6% and 92.9% for HF-MWA, respectively. The difference in survival rates was not significant (p > .05). CONCLUSION Both LF- and HF-MWA systems are effective treatment options for oligonodular liver malignant lesions, but significantly higher ablation volumes, longer time to progression and lower progression rates were observed in HF-MWA.","Vogl, Thomas J; Hagar, Ahmad; Nour-Eldin, Nour-Eldin A; Gruber-Rouh, Tatjana; Eichler, Katrin; Ackermann, Hanns; Bechstein, Wolf O; Naguib, Nagy N N","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",648,16

Additionally, RSV is responsible for 10,000 deaths annually among the elderly across the United States, and accounts for nearly as many hospitalizations as influenza. Currently, several RSV vaccine candidates are under development to target different age groups. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of age-specific vaccination strategies in averting RSV incidence, we developed a transmission model that integrates data on daily infectious viral load and changes of behavior associated with RSV symptoms. Calibrating to RSV weekly incidence rates in Texas, California, Colorado, and Pennsylvania, we show that in all states considered, an infected child under 5 y of age is more than twice as likely as a person over 50 y of age to transmit the virus. Geographic variability in the effectiveness of a vaccination program across states arises from interplay between seasonality patterns, population demography, vaccination uptake, and vaccine mechanism of action. Regardless of these variabilities, our analysis showed that allocating vaccine to children under 5 y of age would be the most efficient strategy per dose to avert RSV in both children and adults. Furthermore, due to substantial indirect protection, the targeting of children is even predicted to reduce RSV in the elderly more than directly vaccinating the elderly themselves. Our results can help inform ongoing clinical trials and future recommendations on RSV vaccination.","Yamin, Dan; Jones, Forrest K; DeVincenzo, John P; Gertler, Shai; Kobiler, Oren; Townsend, Jeffrey P; Galvani, Alison P",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,648,1

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a recently dynamic nomogram, established in the Chinese population and based on age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count, might apply to a different context. We collected data from 299 patients (243 with COVID-19 and 56 with FLU) at Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome. The nomogram included age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count to differentiate COVID-19 from FLU. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for all associations. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patients with COVID-19 had higher age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count than patients with FLU. Although univariate analysis confirmed that age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count were associated with COVID-19, only at multivariate analysis was monocyte count statistically significant as a predictive factor of COVID-19. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we found that a monocyte count >0.35x1000/mL showed an AUC of 0.680 (sensitivity 0.992, specificity 0.368). A dynamic nomogram including age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count cannot be applied to our context, probably due to differences in demographic characteristics between Italian and Chinese populations. However, our data showed that monocyte absolute count is highly predictive of COVID-19, suggesting its potential role above all in settings where prompt PCR nasopharyngeal testing is lacking.","Curtolo, Ambrogio; Oliva, Alessandra; Volpicelli, Lorenzo; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; D'Ettorre, Gabriella; Borrazzo, Cristian; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Venditti, Mario",Le infezioni in medicina,648,30

They have been the subject of considerable attention, with varying conclusions from systematic reviews as to their efficacy. Transforaminal injections have been associated with rare but major complications. Further, the use of transforaminal injections has increased since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Finally, with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been heightened concern regarding the risk associated with steroid injections. OBJECTIVES To evaluate and update the effectiveness of transforaminal injections for 4 indications: radicular pain; from spinal stenosis; from failed back surgery syndrome; and for axial low back pain; and to evaluate the safety of the procedure. STUDY DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of transforaminal injections. METHODS The available literature on transforaminal injections was reviewed and the quality assessed. The level of evidence was classified on a 5-point scale based on the quality of evidence developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and modified by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP). Data sources included relevant literature from 1966 to April 2020, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Pain relief and functional improvement were the primary outcome measures. A minimum of 6 months pain relief follow-up was required. RESULTS For this systematic review, 66 studies were identified. Eighteen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. No observational studies were included. Eleven randomized controlled trials dealt with various aspects of transforaminal injections for radicular pain owing to disc herniation. Based on these studies, there is Level 1 evidence supporting the use of transforaminal injections for radicular pain owing to disc herniation. A meta-analysis showed that at both 3 and 6 months, there was highly statistically significant improvement in both pain and function with both particulate and nonparticulate steroids. For radicular pain from central stenosis there is one moderate quality study, with Level IV evidence. For radicular pain caused by failed back surgery syndrome there is one moderate quality study, with Level IV evidence. For radicular pain from foraminal stenosis and for axial pain there is Level V evidence, opinion-based/consensus, supporting the use of transforaminal injections. Transforaminal injections are generally safe. However, they have been associated with major neurologic complications related to cord infarct. Causes other than intraluminal injection of particulates appear to be at play. The use of an infraneural approach and of blunt needles appear to offer the greatest patient safety. Because of concern over the role of particulate steroids, multiple other injectates have been evaluated, including nonparticulate steroids, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors, and local anesthetics without steroids. No injectate has been proven superior. If there is concern about immunosuppression because of risk of COVID-19 infection, either the lowest possible dose of steroid or no steroid should be used. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by the paucity of literature for some indications. CONCLUSIONS There is Level I evidence for the use of transforaminal injections for radicular pain from disc herniations.","Helm Ii, Standiford; Harmon, Preston C; Noe, Carl; Calodney, Aaron K; Abd-Elsayed, Alaa; Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Racz, Gabor B",Pain physician,648,1

This was a prospective, experimental design employing an established porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhage. The minimum number of animals (n = 11 per group) was used to obtain a statistically valid result. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05) indicating that the groups were equivalent on the following parameters: activating clotting time, the subject weights, core body temperatures, amount of 1 minute hemorrhage, arterial blood pressures, and the amount and percentage of total blood volume. There were significant differences in the amount of hemorrhage (p = 0.018) and the number of movements (p = 0.000) between the QCG and control. QCG is statistically and clinically superior at controlling hemorrhage compared to the standard pressure dressing control group. Furthermore, it produces a more robust clot that can withstand significant movement. In conclusion, QCG is an effective hemostatic agent for use in civilian and military trauma management.","Gegel, Brian; Burgert, James; Gasko, John; Campbell, Christian; Martens, Mark; Keck, Joseph; Reynolds, Harmony; Loughren, Michael; Johnson, Don",Military medicine,648,29

Furthermore, few studies in sub-Saharan Africa include the infertility experiences of men. This article seeks to fill this gap by qualitatively describing the ways in which infertility in Zambia is socially and culturally loaded for both men and women. Demonstrating fertility is necessary to be considered a full adult, a real man or woman, and to leave a legacy after death. People in Zambia, including medical professionals, currently lack the necessary information and access to (or ability to provide) care to effectively resolve fertility issues. Infertile people manage their experience through a variety of social, emotional, spiritual, and medical strategies. However, no solution is considered adequate unless the intervention results in childbirth. In this way, infertility is about producing babies and the social meaning of that process, rather than the raising of children.","Howe, S; Zulu, J M; Boivin, J; Gerrits, T","Facts, views & vision in ObGyn",648,16

A linear relationship between the amount of template and time of positivity value over a range of 2 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(2) copies was obtained. The feasibility of CHIKV RT-LAMP for clinical diagnosis was validated with patient serum samples from an ongoing epidemic in Southern India. Optimal assay conditions with zero background were established for the detection of low levels of CHIKV in acute-phase patient serum samples. The comparative evaluation of the RT-LAMP assay with acute-phase patient serum samples demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity by correctly identifying 21 additional positive borderline cases that were missed by conventional RT-PCR (P < 0.0001) with a detection limit of 20 copies. The quantification of virus load in patient serum samples was also determined from the standard curve based on their time of positivity and was found to be in the range of 2 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(1) copies. In addition, the field applicability of the RT-LAMP assay was also demonstrated by standardizing SYBR Green I-based RT-LAMP wherein the amplification was carried out in a water bath at 63 degrees C for 60 min, which was followed by monitoring gene amplification with the naked eye through color changes. These findings demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection as well as quantification of CHIKV in acute-phase serum samples without requiring any sophisticated equipment and has potential usefulness for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of CHIKV in developing countries.","Parida, M M; Santhosh, S R; Dash, P K; Tripathi, N K; Lakshmi, V; Mamidi, N; Shrivastva, A; Gupta, N; Saxena, P; Babu, J Pradeep; Rao, P V Lakshmana; Morita, Kouichi",Journal of clinical microbiology,648,1

METHODS Nucleocapsid gene was obtained by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction from a SARS patient and inserted into the vector pFastBacHTa expressing baculovirus. Insect Sf9 cells were transfected with the recombinant baculovirus expressing SARS nucleocapsid antigen and then cultured, fixed by acetone so as to make SARS-specific antigen. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) technique and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) were used to detect 7 samples of sera of 4 newly diagnosed SARS patients collected in different days, 48 samples of convalescent sera of SARS patients, 24 serum samples of healthy person undergoing physical examination, and 40 serum samples from non-SARS patients with fever by double blind test. RESULTS The recombinant SARS-specific antigen reacted only with SARS positive sera but not with normal sera. Double blind test showed that 45 of the 46 PRNT positive sera were IFA positive with an accordance rate of 97.8%. 7 samples of sera from 4 SARS patients in acute progressive stage in Guangdong province were all IFA positive. SARS antibody could be detected since the sixth day after onset, and the titer increased from 1:40 to 1:600 on the ninth day.

Scheduled surgeries were suspended, operating rooms were closed, and anesthesiologists redistributed among the various intensive care units. At the Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga the number of patients admitted to the emergency department decreased to approximately 8.000 during the period of lockdown which ranged from 18th March to 1st June 2020. The aim of this study was to compare the number of patients presenting with hip fractures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with the equivalent period in 2019 and to analyze postoperative outcomes. METHODS An observational retrospective study was conducted in two different periods. Patients over the age of 50 years admitted with hip fracture were included for analysis. The data was collected from the hospital database. A general descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS There was an overall reduction in the number of admissions due to hip fractures in Period 2020 compared with homologous Period in 2019 (68 patients and 94 patients, respectively). No statistically significant differences could be found regarding age, gender, ASA grade and pre-admission residence among patients admitted during these both periods. Nursing home patients in Period 2020 had a longer hospital stay (p=0.03), independently of the functional status (p=0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in the time it took the patient to go to the emergency department after the fall, place where the fracture had occurred, waiting time to perform the surgery, type of treatment performed, post-surgical complications and mortality. There was no relationship between mortality and the time it took the patient to access the emergency department (p=0,487), or mortality and the mean length of stay in the hospital (p=0,151). All the patients admitted to the emergency department in Period 2020 were negative to PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION The measures taken by the hospital during the pandemic had no impact in the healthcare provided to the admitted patients. This should be taken into account in order to optimize the efficiency of the health care system in future outbreaks.","Mazeda, Carolina; Santos, Pedro Bernardo; Vilas-Boas, Paulo; Antão, Joana; Barcelos, Anabela",Acta reumatologica portuguesa,648,20

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to have a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of older COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from December 2019 to May 3rd, 2020. Observational studies including older adults (age &#8805; 60 years) with COVID-19 infection and reporting clinical characteristics or outcome were included. Primary outcome was assessing weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of severity and outcomes. Secondary outcomes were clinical features including comorbidities and need of respiratory support. RESULT: Forty-six studies with 13,624 older patients were included. Severe infection was seen in 51% (95% CI- 36-65%, I2-95%) patients while 22% (95% CI- 16-28%, I2-88%) were critically ill. Overall, 11% (95% CI- 5-21%, I2-98%) patients died. The common comorbidities were hypertension (48, 95% CI- 36-60% I2-92%), diabetes mellitus (22, 95% CI- 13-32%, I2-86%) and cardiovascular disease (19, 95% CI - 11-28%, I2-85%). Common symptoms were fever (83, 95% CI- 66-97%, I2-91%), cough (60, 95% CI- 50-70%, I2-71%) and dyspnoea (42, 95% CI- 19-67%, I2-94%). Overall, 84% (95% CI- 60-100%, I2-81%) required oxygen support and 21% (95% CI- 0-49%, I2-91%) required mechanical ventilation. Majority of studies had medium to high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of older patients with COVID-19 have severe infection, one in five are critically ill and one in ten die. More high-quality evidence is needed to study outcomes in this vulnerable patient population and factors affecting these outcomes.","Singhal, Sunny; Kumar, Pramod; Singh, Sumitabh; Saha, Srishti; Dey, Aparajit Ballav",BMC Geriatr,648,20

Controls can have well-known counterintuitive effects on endemic infections, including the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected, but also large outbreaks during control resulting from accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are poorly understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without control, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, counting from the time that control started, than without any control-the divorce effect. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in a variety of models when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches, and in the context of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at COVID-19.","Hollingsworth, Brandon; Okamoto, Kenichi W; Lloyd, Alun L",PLoS Comput Biol,648,29

The continuous rise in worldwide cases of COVID-19, transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 including re-infections and enormous case-fatality rates emphasizes the urgent need of potential preventive and therapeutic measures. The development of effective therapeutic and preventive measures relies on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanism of replication exhibited by SARS-CoV-2. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is ranging from 90-120 nm that comprises surface viral proteins including spike, envelope, membrane which are attached in host lipid bilayer containing the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA. Spike (S) glycoprotein initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 with a widely expressed cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and subsequent S glycoprotein priming via serine protease TMPRSS2. Prominently, comprehensive analysis of structural insights into the crucial SARS-CoV-2 proteins may lead us to design effective therapeutics molecules.

Intensive research is going on for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of COVID 19 using varied approach. Hence, this review will focus on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and recent progress of different detection tool for the detection of COVID-19. This review will also stimulate academics and researcher to update their current technology. Additionally, we also state about the future revolving around the detection of the novel coronavirus.

The emergence of this new coronavirus increases the importance of understanding SADS-CoV as well as antivirals. Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases (PLP), are attractive antiviral targets because of their essential roles in polyprotein processing and thus viral maturation. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural identification of recombinant SADS papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nsp3. The SADS-CoV PLP2 was shown to cleave nsp1 proteins and also peptides mimicking the nsp2|nsp3 cleavage site and also had deubiquitinating and deISGynating activity by in vitro assays. The crystal structure adopts an architecture resembling that of PLPs from other coronaviruses. We characterize both conserved and unique structural features likely directing the interaction of PLP2 with the substrates, including the tentative mapping of active site and other essential residues. These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLPs' catalytic mechanism and for the screening and design of therapeutics to combat infection by SADS coronavirus.","Wang, Lu; Hu, Weihua; Fan, Chengpeng",Protein Sci,648,27

This illness emerged as an epidemic in China and later spread to almost all countries over the globe except Antarctica. This is caused by a beta Corona virus, which is genetically similar to SARS virus. The predominant mode of transmission is via droplet spread, when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks the virus is released in the respiratory secretions. As there are only a few cases of COVID 19 in neonates, there is no convincing evidence to support the possibility of vertical transmission. Clinical presentation in neonates is nonspecific, commonly observed are temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific. Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters.

In this field, the target sensitivity analysis focuses primarily on capturing the influence of the inputs on the occurrence of such a critical event. This paper proposes new target sensitivity indices, based on the Shapley values and called “target Shapley effects”, allowing for interpretable sensitivity measures under dependent inputs. Two algorithms (one based on Monte Carlo sampling, and a given-data algorithm based on a nearest-neighbors procedure) are proposed for the estimation of these target Shapley effects based on the ℓ2 norm. Additionally, the behavior of these target Shapley effects are theoretically and empirically studied through various toy-cases. Finally, the application of these new indices in two real-world use-cases (a river flood model and a COVID-19 epidemiological model) is discussed.","Idrissi, Marouane Il Chabridon Vincent Iooss Bertrand",Environmental Modelling &amp; Software,648,16

In this manuscript, we studied the coronavirus epidemic model with a true data of India by using Predictor-Corrector scheme. For the proposed model of Covid-19, the numerical and graphical simulations are performed in a framework of the new generalised Caputo sense non-integer order derivative. We analysed the existence and uniqueness of solution of the given fractional model by the definition of Chebyshev norm, Banach space, Schauder's second fixed point theorem, Arzel's-Ascoli theorem, uniform boundedness, equicontinuity and Weissinger's fixed point theorem. A new analysis of the given model with the true data is given to analyse the dynamics of the model in fractional sense. Graphical simulations show the structure of the given classes of the non-linear model with respect to the time variable. We investigated that the mentioned method is copiously strong and smooth to implement on the systems of non-linear fractional differential equation systems. The stability results for the projected algorithm is also performed with the applications of some important lemmas. The present study gives the applicability of this new generalised version of Caputo type non-integer operator in mathematical epidemiology.

More specifically, the authors want to address the following research questions. How can the overall approach to internal crisis communication during the pandemic be interpreted, and what view of internal crisis communication does this approach reflect? What has been characteristic of the leadership communication during the pandemic? What do coworkers think of their communication role and how well does the internal communication support that role? Design/methodology/approach This article is based on a case study of an authority with 1,000 employees. The empirical material consists of both documents and interviews. The analyzed documents include steering documents, e-mails to managers from the support function and newsletters from the top manager. The 17 interviews comprise managers, coworkers and communication managers. All interviews were recorded and the authors have conducted verbatim transcriptions. Findings The pandemic is an example of a wicked problem that involves a lot of ambiguity. Often organizations try to handle wicked problems by trying to control it through traditional management skills and practices. A pandemic demands a leadership, culture and communicative approach that highlights the importance of coworkers. In the studied organization the authors found knowledge and rhetoric about the value of coworkers and communicative coworkership. However, top management does not encourage, support and award practices that are in line with the espoused culture. The key to success is top managers that walk the talk and act as role models. Practical implications Crisis managers and crisis communicators need to focus more on improvisation, flexibility, listening and how to approach and make sense of the uncertain. In general, there is a tendency to rely too much on simple tools and to oversimplify complexity. Complex crises such as the pandemic raise new demands on leadership. Effective crisis leadership in a complex crisis seems to be much more democratic and collaborative than often assumed. If coworkers are expected to act as ambassadors or organizational representatives, they also need to be given better support for that role. Originality/value This article highlights the importance of closing the gap between espoused and enacted culture in order to change from a managerialistic internal crisis communication to a process internal crisis communication approach.","Heide, M.; Simonsson, C.",Journal of Communication Management,648,28

Presented intermediate results evaluate the first infection period until the end of September 2020. METHODS: The study ""COVID-19: Hotspot hospital?- Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hospital employees in a secondary care hospital network in Germany "" is a prospective, single centre observational cohort study conducted at the St. Vincenz Hospital Datteln with 316 beds. The presented data include one other hospital: St. Laurentius Stift Waltrop, Germany with 172 beds. RESULTS: Between June 2020 and September 2020 we analyzed serum samples of 907 employees which represents 62.1% of all employees. Thirteen employees (1.4%), respectively 13/696 healthcare workers (HCWs) (1.9%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Among them, 4 (30.8%) were aware of COVID-19 exposure, and 5 (38.5%) reported clinical symptoms. HCWs working in high-risk areas had a seroprevalence rate of 1.6% (1/64), HCWs working in intermediate-risk area 1.7% (11/632) and 0.5% employees (1/211) in low-risk areas with no contact to patients were seropositive. CONCLUSION: Even if we treated COVID-19 positive patients, we found no clear evidence that infection was transmitted to HCWs in contact to these patients. As knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission evolves, the concept of infection prevention must be continuously reviewed and adapted as needed to keep hospitals a safe place.","Hildebrandt, Anke; Hökelekli, Oktay; Uflacker, Lutz; Rudolf, Henrik; Gatermann, Sören G",Int J Hyg Environ Health,648,16

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a situation with a high amount of stress exposure, which in turn may be associated with negative emotional outcome like depressive symptoms. The current study investigated if resilience moderated the effect of stress on symptoms of depression and if anxiety symptoms mediated this association. An adult sample of community controls completed the Perceived stress scale 14 (PSS-14), the Resilience scale for adults (RSA), the Patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7). Independent samples t-test, correlation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. The results showed that resilience moderated the relations between stress and anxiety symptoms (ß = -0.131, p < 0.001) as well as between stress and depressive symptoms (ß = -0.068, p < 0.05). In support of a moderated mediation model, resilience moderated the indirect effect of stress on depressive symptom, as confirmed by the index of moderated mediation (IMM = -0.036, p < 0.001; [95% BCa: -0.055, -0.020]). The high resilience subgroup was less affected than the low resilience subgroup by the effect of stress exposure symptoms of depression, mediated by anxiety. The study shows that stress exposure is associated with symptoms of depression, and anxiety mediates this association. Level of resilience differentiates the direct and indirect effect of stress on depression. Knowledge about the effect of stress in response to a pandemic is important for developing treatment and prevention strategies for stress, depression and health-related anxiety.","Havnen, Audun; Anyan, Frederick; Hjemdal, Odin; Solem, Stian; Gurigard Riksfjord, Maja; Hagen, Kristen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,21

The crude drugs derived from animals investigated in this study were Cervi Parvum Cornu and Trogopterorum feces, which are derived from a mix of different animal species, two chopped cicada sloughs, and two commercial Kampo drugs. The mitochondrial 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene regions were amplified and sequenced using MiSeq. The ratios of haplotype to total number of sequences reads were calculated after sequence extraction and trimming. Haplotypes that exceeded the threshold were defined as positive haplotypes, which were compared with all available sequences using BLAST. In the Cervi Parvum Cornu and Trogopterorum feces samples, the haplotype ratios corresponded roughly to the mixture ratios, although there was a slight difference from mixture ratios depending on the gene examined. This method could also roughly estimate the compositions of chopped cicada sloughs and Kampo drugs. This analysis, whereby the sequences of several genes are elucidated, is better for identifying the included animal species. This method should be useful for quality control of crude drugs and Kampo drugs.","Nakanishi, Hiroaki; Yoneyama, Katsumi; Hara, Masaaki; Takada, Aya; Saito, Kazuyuki",Sci Rep,648,16

Often however, effective vaccinations are carried out insufficiently. In March 2020, the German measles protection law was introduced to raise the level of population (herd) immunity to over 95 %. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted among the population on the Measles Protection Act with self-declarations on measles vaccination/illness of participants and their children and evaluation of various sanctions. RESULTS: 1,594 adults participated. 19.3 % were affected by the law. Of these, only 77.5 % were immune to measles, 14.0 % wanted to be fully vaccinated when the law came into force, which would lead to 91.5 % immunity. Assuming that participants with unclear vaccination status or measles disease are immune, an immunity of>95 % can be achieved. 86.4 % of the children (aged 2 to 17 years) had developed immunity. Parents' willingness to have their children vaccinated because of the sanctions provided for in the Measles Protection Act was only 0.8 %. CONCLUSION: The level of immunity to measles in adults and children was under 95 % in our study. The sanctions of the Measles Protection Act are a greater incentive for adults to undergo measles vaccination than for parents. Strategies to increase immunity with the target group of parents should continue to be pursued.","Neugebauer, Michael; Ebert, Matthias; Vogelmann, Roger","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen (Online)",648,6

The objective of this study was to investigate how these factors were affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and impacted metabolic control in children with T1D. MATERIALS AND METHOD: One hundred children with T1D were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric measurements, snack and meal frequency, carbohydrate consumption, HbA1c levels, and exercise patterns were recorded and compared before and after the lockdown. Subjects were divided into two subgroups-patients with decreased and patients with increased HbA1c levels after the lockdown-and comparisons of the same parameters were also made between these two subgroups. RESULTS: In the overall group, the mean HbA1c level was significantly higher after the lockdown compared to before (p=0.035). Meal schedules changed due to delayed sleep and waking times, and total daily carbohydrate consumption increased in the subgroup with increased HbA1c while it decreased in the subgroup with decreased HbA1c (p<0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that blood sugar management in children with T1D worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is not possible to explain this with any one factor, some behavioral changes observed in our study, such as inactivity, irregular meal frequency and timing, and irregular sleep and waking patterns appeared to be associated with blood sugar management.","Turan, Hande; Günes Kaya, Didem; Tarçin, Gürkan; Evliyaoglu, Saadet Olcay",Endocrinol. diabetes nutr.

METHODS: This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019-July 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (-0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI -2.47 to 1.58, Pâ=â0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (-4.1, 95% CI: -8.25 to -0.01, Pâ<â0.05).

In recent decades, teleradiology has expanded considerably, and many radiology practices now engage in intraorganizational or extraorganizational teleradiology. In this era of patient primacy, optimizing patient care and care delivery is paramount. This article provides an update on recent changes, current challenges, and future opportunities centered around the ability of teleradiology to improve temporal and geographic imaging access. We review licensing and regulations and discuss teleradiology in providing services to rural areas and assisting with disaster response, including the response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION. Teleradiology can help increase imaging efficiency and mitigate both geographic and temporal discrepancies in imaging care. Technologic limitations and regulatory hurdles hinder the optimal practice of teleradiology, and future attention to these issues may help ensure broader patient access to high-quality imaging across the United States.","Hanna, Tarek N; Steenburg, Scott D; Rosenkrantz, Andrew B; Pyatt, Robert S; Duszak, Richard; Friedberg, Eric B",AJR Am J Roentgenol,648,26

Past experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and current reports suggest that making these decisions carries a heavy emotional toll for physicians around the world. We sought to explore Canadian physicians' preparedness and attitudes regarding resource allocation decisions. METHODS: From April 3 to April 13, 2020, we conducted an 8-question online survey of physicians practicing in the region of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, organized around 4 themes: physician preparedness for resource rationing, physician preparedness to offer palliative care, attitudes towards resource allocation policy, and approaches to resource allocation decision-making. RESULTS: We collected 219 responses, of which 165 were used for analysis. The majority (78%) of respondents felt ""somewhat"" or ""a little prepared"" to make resource allocation decisions, and 13% felt ""not at all prepared."" A majority of respondents (63%) expected the provision of palliative care to be ""very"" or ""somewhat difficult."" Most respondents (83%) either strongly or somewhat agreed that there should be policy to guide resource allocation. Physicians overwhelmingly agreed on certain factors that would be important in resource allocation, including whether patients were likely to survive, and whether they had dementia and other significant comorbidities. Respondents generally did not feel confident that they would have the social support they needed at the time of making resource allocation decisions. INTERPRETATION: This rapidly implemented survey suggests that a sample of Canadian physicians feel underprepared to make resource allocation decisions, and desire both more emotional support and clear, transparent, evidence-based policy.","Dewar, Brian; Anderson, Joanna E; Kwok, Edmund S H; Ramsay, Tim; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Fahed, Robert; Dyason, Claire; Shamy, Michel",PLoS One,648,20

Such evaluations have largely halted during the COVID-19 crisis, with questionable psychometrics of usable measures and clinicians largely unprepared to administer them. Remote, online psychoeducational evaluations have the potential to decrease this access problem by allowing for evaluations to continue during the crisis, as well as redistributing (geographically and potentially socioeconomically) evaluators to populations disproportionately without access. The present study evaluated the equivalence of a remote, online administration procedure for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) with traditional, in-person administration. Results revealed no significant differences-and, therefore, method effects-between the full-scale IQ and index scores between the administration procedures. One subtest did reveal a significant method effect, with children performing more poorly on the remote, online version of the test.

Small studies suggest that CCM could be used to assess patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). AIM: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic utility of CCM for sub-clinical DPN (DPN- ) and established DPN (DPN+ ). DATA SOURCES: Databases (PubMed, Embase, Central, ProQuest) were searched for studies using CCM in patients with diabetes up to April 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they reported on at least one CCM parameter in patients with diabetes. DATA EXTRACTION: Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) and inferior whorl length (IWL) were compared between patients with diabetes with and without DPN and controls. Meta-analysis was undertaken using RevMan V.5.3. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-eight studies including ~4000 participants were included in this meta-analysis. There were significant reductions in CNFD, CNBD, CNFL and IWL in DPN- vs. controls (P<0.00001), DPN+ vs. controls (P<0.00001) and DPN+ vs. DPN- (P<0.00001). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that CCM detects small nerve fibre loss in subclinical and clinical DPN and concludes that CCM has good diagnostic utility in DPN.","Gad, Hoda; Petropoulos, Ioannis N; Khan, Adnan; Ponirakis, Georgios; MacDonald, Ross; Alam, Uazman; Malik, Rayaz A",J. diabetes investig.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the association between admission and peak troponin levels and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This was an observational multi-ethnic multi-centre study in a UK cohort of 434 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London, UK during the second half of March 2020. RESULTS: Myocardial injury, defined as positive troponin during admission was observed in 288 (66.4%) patients. Age (OR: 1.68 [1.49-1.88], p < .001), hypertension (OR: 1.81 [1.10-2.99], p = .020) and moderate chronic kidney disease (OR: 9.12 [95% CI: 4.24-19.64], p < .001) independently predicted myocardial injury. After adjustment, patients with positive peak troponin were more likely to need non-invasive and mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.27-4.56], p = .007, and OR: 6.81 [95% CI: 3.40-13.62], p < .001, respectively) and urgent renal replacement therapy (OR: 4.14 [95% CI: 1.34-12.78], p = .013). With regards to events, and after adjustment, positive peak troponin levels were independently associated with acute kidney injury (OR: 6.76 [95% CI: 3.40-13.47], p < .001), venous thromboembolism (OR: 11.99 [95% CI: 3.20-44.88], p < .001), development of atrial fibrillation (OR: 10.66 [95% CI: 1.33-85.32], p = .026) and death during admission (OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.34-4.29], p = .003). Similar associations were observed for admission troponin. In addition, median length of stay in days was shorter for patients with negative troponin levels: 8 (5-13) negative, 14 (7-23) low-positive levels and 16 (10-23) high-positive (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission and peak troponin appear to be predictors for cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular events and outcomes in COVID-19 patients, and their utilisation may have an impact on patient management.","Papageorgiou, Nikolaos; Sohrabi, Catrin; Prieto Merino, David; Tyrlis, Angelos; Atieh, Abed Elfattah; Saberwal, Bunny; Lim, Wei-Yao; Creta, Antonio; Khanji, Mohammed; Rusinova, Reni; Chooneea, Bashistraj; Khiani, Raj; Wijesuriya, Nadeev; Chow, Anna; Butt, Haroun; Browne, Stefan; Joshi, Nikhil; Kay, Jamie; Ahsan, Syed; Providencia, Rui",Acta Cardiol,648,33

The recent emergence of several genetically distinct descendants known as variants of concern (VOCs) is further challenging public health disease management, due to increased rates of virus transmission and potential constraints on vaccine effectiveness. We report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs imported into Australia belonging to the B.1.351 lineage, first described in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), and the B.1.1.7 lineage originally reported in the United Kingdom, and directly compare the replication kinetics of these two VOCs in Vero E6 cells. In this analysis, we also investigated a B.1.1.7 VOC (QLD1516/2021) carrying a 7-nucleotide deletion in the open reading frame 7a (ORF7a) gene, likely truncating and rendering the ORF7a protein of this virus defective. We demonstrate that the replication of the B.1.351 VOC (QLD1520/2020) in Vero E6 cells can be detected earlier than the B.1.1.7 VOCs (QLD1516/2021 and QLD1517/2021), before peaking at 48 h post infection (p.i.), with significantly higher levels of virus progeny. Whilst replication of the ORF7a defective isolate QLD1516/2021 was delayed longer than the other viruses, slightly more viral progeny was produced by the mutant compared to the unmutated isolate QLD1517/2021 at 72 h p.i. Collectively, these findings contribute to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication and evolutionary dynamics, which have important implications in the development of future vaccination, antiviral therapies, and epidemiological control strategies for COVID-19.","Pyke, Alyssa T; Nair, Neelima; van den Hurk, Andrew F; Burtonclay, Peter; Nguyen, Son; Barcelon, Jean; Kistler, Carol; Schlebusch, Sanmarié; McMahon, Jamie; Moore, Frederick",Viruses,648,16

Although there has so far been no evidence of transmission through transfusion, pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) have been applied to CCP to mitigate risk of infectious disease. This study aims to assess the impact of methylene blue (MB) plus visible light PRT on the virus-neutralising activity of the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to MB plus visible light PRT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD S1 epitope IgGs antibodies were quantified by ELISA. Titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (NtAbs) were measured before and after the PRT process. A Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationship between antibody neutralisation ability and SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA ratio. Pre- and post-inactivation neutralising antibody titres were evaluated using a Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The plasma pathogen reduction procedure did not diminish NtAbS titres and so did not cause a change in the viral neutralisation capacity of CCP. There was a strong correlation between pre-and post-PRT NtAbs and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs titres. DISCUSSION: Our results showed PRT with MB did not impair the CCP passive immunity preserving its potential therapeutic potency.

Platelets and the coagulation cascade are effectively targeted by antithrombotic approaches, which carry an inherent risk of bleeding. Moreover, antithrombotics cannot completely prevent thrombotic events, implicating a therapeutic gap due to a third, not yet adequately addressed mechanism, namely inflammation. In this Review, we discuss how the synergy between inflammation and thrombosis drives thrombotic diseases. We focus on the huge potential of anti-inflammatory strategies to target cardiovascular pathologies. Findings in the past decade have uncovered a sophisticated connection between innate immunity, platelet activation and coagulation, termed immunothrombosis. Immunothrombosis is an important host defence mechanism to limit systemic spreading of pathogens through the bloodstream. However, the aberrant activation of immunothrombosis in cardiovascular diseases causes myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thromboembolism. The clinical relevance of aberrant immunothrombosis, referred to as thromboinflammation, is supported by the increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with inflammatory diseases but also during infections, including in COVID-19. Clinical trials in the past 4 years have confirmed the anti-ischaemic effects of anti-inflammatory strategies, backing the concept of a prothrombotic function of inflammation. Targeting inflammation to prevent thrombosis leaves haemostasis mainly unaffected, circumventing the risk of bleeding associated with current approaches. Considering the growing number of anti-inflammatory therapies, it is crucial to appreciate their potential in covering therapeutic gaps in cardiovascular diseases.","Stark, Konstantin; Massberg, Steffen","Nat. rev.,Cardiol.

Towards this goal, many public transport operators have modified their service routes by avoiding to serve stops with high passenger demand at specific times of the day. Given the urgent need to develop decision support tools that can prevent the overcrowding of vehicles, this study introduces a dynamic integer nonlinear program that proposes service patterns to individual vehicles that are ready to be dispatched. In addition to the objective of satisfying the imposed vehicle capacity due to COVID-19, the proposed service pattern model caters for the waiting time of passengers.

However, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients and provide evidence-based medical support for clinical treatment. METHODS: We will search 6 medical databases to identify eligible studies published from the establishment of the database to the present. The quality of the included literature will be evaluated using the bias risk assessment tool in Cochrane 5.1.0, and a meta-analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0.

This paper examines the current responses in New South Wales prisons to the threat of COVID-19 to prisoner health, by contrasting contemporary activities with actions and policy developed during two historical epidemics: the influenza epidemic of 1860 and pandemic of 1919. Method: Epidemiological information relating to cases of disease in NSW prisons during the 1860 and 1919 influenza epidemics was obtained from the Comptroller-General's reports for the specific outbreak years and for the preceding and succeeding five-year periods. Additional archival sources such as digitised newspaper reports and articles available through the National Library of Australia were analysed for closer detail. The management of these outbreaks was compared to current strategies to mitigate against risk from the COVID-19 pandemic in the NSW prison system. Results: Interesting similarities were discovered in relation to the management of the historic influenza outbreaks in NSW prisons and in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. An outbreak of influenza in mid-1860 impacted seven penal institutions in Sydney and Parramatta. Infection rates at these institutions were between 3.1% and 100%; the mean rate was 41.8%. The public health measures employed at the time included allowing 'air circulation freely night and day', and treatments that were 'tonical and stimulatory'. Discussion: While the past 100 or more years have brought huge progress in scientific knowledge, public health approaches remain the mainstay of outbreak management in prisons; and, as in 1919, the opportunity for Australia to observe the rest of the world and plan for action has not been wasted. Prisons pose a potential risk for pandemic spread but they also present a unique opportunity for reducing disease risk by ironic virtue of the 'separate system' that was recognised even 100 years ago as characteristic of these institutions.","Hampton, Stephen; Weston, Kathryn M; McCarthy, Louella; Mackinnon, Tobias",,648,17

This perception has attracted attention in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to their fragile health systems and economies. The objective of this study was to understand how residents in Malawi perceived COVID-19, to determine the factors related to KAP. METHODS: A semi-structured questionnaire was used for the data collection. A field-based survey was conducted among adult residents in Lilongwe, Malawi. Descriptive statistic, linear regression, the Chi-square test, and Pearson's correlation statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 580 questionnaires were involved. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores were 10 (SD = +/-3, range: 3-19), 16 (SD = +/-4, range: 5-25), and 2 (SD = +/-1, range: 0-5), respectively. Lack of money and resources (39%) was the biggest challenge for people who practice prevention measures. Among the participants, the radio (70%) and friends/family (56%) were the main sources of information. A higher economic status was associated with better KAP. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of KAP was detected among the population. The people faced challenges regarding a lack of necessary preventive resources and formal information channels. The situation was worse considering vulnerable population who had low economic status. Further all-round health education is urgently needed along with providing adequate health supplies and ensuring proper information management.","Li, Y.; Liu, G.; Egolet, R.

Retinal findings include microhemorrhages and flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, dilated veins, and tortuous vessels.Conclusion: Considering the COVID-19 cases have reached pandemic dimensions and are surging, yet again, it is of utmost importance to determine its ophthalmic manifestations and prevent their vision threatening complications. Further studies are warranted to establish whether the retinal findings appear due to the COVID-19 or are an incidental finding in patients with a preexisting diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy.","Jevnikar, Kristina; Jaki Mekjavic, Polona; Vidovic Valentincic, Natasa; Petrovski, Goran; Globocnik Petrovic, Mojca",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,648,1

The regional health councils' need for information regardind the cases, has generated a variety of formats and procedures, used to report this information. Consecuently, this data has not always been communicated in a comparable maner to the Ministry of Health. The compilation of mortality statistics is complex. Central and autonomous public administrations are involved, and not in the same way. The medical death certificate (DC) is the main source of information that allows to specify place of occurrence and causes of death. The on-line registration of the DC in the computerized civil registry and/or digital medical records, would allow to establish a statistical processing circuit, and to obtain a death count more quickly according to causes of death in the event of a health emergency. This requires a multi-level institutional agreement for a total telematics statistic process of death causes in Spain.","Cirera, Lluís; Segura, Andreu; Hernández, Ildefonso","Gac. sanit.

This paper aimed to examine the effect of n3-PUFA supplementation on inflammatory and biochemical markers in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 128 critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 who were randomly assigned to the intervention (fortified formula with n3-PUFA) (n = 42) and control (n = 86) groups. Data on 1 month survival rate, blood glucose, sodium (Na), potassium (K), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), albumin, hematocrit (HCT), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), mean arterial pressure (MAP), O2 saturation (O2sat), arterial pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess (Be), white blood cells (WBCs), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (Plt), and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were collected at baseline and after 14 days of the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly higher 1-month survival rate and higher levels of arterial pH, HCO3, and Be and lower levels of BUN, Cr, and K compared with the control group after intervention (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between blood glucose, Na, HCT, Ca, P, MAP, O2sat, PO2, PCO2, WBCs, GCS, Hb, Plt, PTT, and albumin between two groups. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 supplementation improved the levels of several parameters of respiratory and renal function in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are warranted.

An epidemiologic analysis of the nationwide COVID register, therefore, is necessary to outline and describe the impact in such population. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of the characteristics of a cohort of 5062 patients <18 years of age, until June 16, 2020, reported at the National Institute of Health-INS (https://www.ins.gov.co/News./Pages/Coronavirus.aspx), through the national public access database, with all subjects confirmed with COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2. RESULTS: Reviewed on June 16, 2020, a total of 54,971 confirmed cases were reported nationwide for COVID-19, of which 5062 (9.2%) are cases in patients under 18 years of age. There was a statistically significant difference between groups; age was statistically significantly higher in the asymptomatic, compared with: deceased, severe and moderate cases; moreover, age was statistically significantly higher in the mild, compared with: deceased, severe and moderate. Statistically significant difference determined with one-way ANOVA was found between groups (F = 16.08, P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis reveals significant differences between groups, the age of patients at home (9.39 years) and those recovered (9.3 years) being significantly higher than those in intensive care unit (4.9 years), in hospital (6.1 years), or than the deceased (2.9 years). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that, at the nationwide level, patients in more severe states (deceased, severe and moderate), are significantly younger than those in the milder state (asymptomatic and mild).","Bolaños-Almeida, Carlos Ernesto; Espitia Segura, Oscar Mauricio",Pediatr Infect Dis J,648,2

DESIGN: Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020). SETTINGS: All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator-to-bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities. RESULTS: The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase). This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline). An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators. CONCLUSIONS: The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.","Litton, Edward; Bucci, Tamara; Chavan, Shaila; Ho, Yvonne Y; Holley, Anthony; Howard, Gretta; Huckson, Sue; Kwong, Philomena; Millar, Johnny; Nguyen, Nhi; Secombe, Paul; Ziegenfuss, Marc; Pilcher, David",Med J Aust,648,25

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but mice are resistant to the infection because their ACE2 is incompatible with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein . METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was passaged in BALB/c mice to obtain mouse-adapted virus strain. Complete genome deep sequencing of different generations of viruses was performed to characterize the dynamics of the adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis and Biolayer interferometry experiments determined the binding affinity of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 WBP-1 RBD to mouse ACE2 and human ACE2. Finally, we tested whether TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod (R848) could also inhibit the replication of WBP-1 in the mouse model. FINDINGS: The mouse-adapted strain WBP-1 showed increased infectivity in BALB/c mice and led to severe interstitial pneumonia. We characterized the dynamics of the adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated that Q493K and Q498H in RBD significantly increased its binding affinity towards mouse ACE2. Additionally, the study tentatively found that the TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod was able to protect mice against WBP-1 challenge. Therefore, this mouse-adapted strain is a useful tool to investigate COVID-19 and develop new therapies. INTERPRETATION: We found for the first time that the Q493K and Q498H mutations in the RBD of WBP-1 enhanced its interactive affinities with mACE2. The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 provides a valuable tool for the evaluation of novel antiviral and vaccine strategies. This study also tentatively verified the antiviral activity of TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo.

233931,233931,233931,Triduum for Covid-19,17.479189,4.248588,2020,"On-device localization and tracking are increasingly crucial for various applications. Along with a rapidly growing amount of location data, machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely adopted. A key reason is that ML inference is significantly more energy-efficient than GPS query at comparable accuracy, and GPS signals can become extremely unreliable for specific scenarios. To this end, several techniques such as deep neural networks have been proposed. However, during training, almost none of them incorporate the known structural information such as floor plan, which can be especially useful in indoor or other structured environments. In this paper, we argue that the state-of-the-art-systems are significantly worse in terms of accuracy because they are incapable of utilizing these essential structural information. The problem is incredibly hard because the structural properties are not explicitly available, making most structural learning approaches inapplicable. Given that both input and output space potentially contain rich structures, we study our method through the intuitions from manifold-projection. Whereas existing manifold based learning methods actively utilized neighborhood information, such as Euclidean distances, our approach performs Neighbor Oblivious Learning (NObLe). We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on two orthogonal applications, including WiFi-based fingerprint localization and inertial measurement unit(IMU) based device tracking, and show that it gives significant improvement over state-of-art prediction accuracy.","Liu, Zichang; Chou, Li; Shrivastava, Anshumali",,648,26

The three monocyte subpopulations are thought to play an important role in this inflammatory state because they are endowed with numerous pattern recognition receptors, such as CD14, that have been associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury. By contrast, an exaggerated antiinflammatory response has also been described following cardiac arrest, which may be mediated by downregulation of antigen presentation receptor HLA-DR. We report the composition of monocyte subpopulations and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR following cardiac arrest. Blood specimens were collected from 32 patients at three timepoints in the first 48 h after cardiac arrest. Monocyte subset composition was determined by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR. Monocyte subset composition and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR were correlated with patient outcomes. The results were compared to 19 patients with coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest patients showed a significant decline in the percentage of nonclassical monocytes. Monocyte CD14 expression was upregulated after 24 h and correlated with the time to return of spontaneous circulation. Downregulation of HLA-DR expression was observed mainly among classical monocytes and significantly correlated with the dose of norepinephrine used to treat shock. Downregulation of HLA-DR among nonclassical and intermediate monocytes was significantly associated with disease severity. Our data demonstrate the disturbance of monocyte subset composition with a significant decline in nonclassical monocytes at an early stage following cardiac arrest. Our findings suggest the simultaneous presence of hyperinflammation, as evidenced by upregulation of CD14, and monocyte deactivation, characterized by downregulation of HLA-DR. The extent of monocyte deactivation was significantly correlated with disease severity.","Asmussen, Alexander; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Helbing, Thomas; Bemtgen, Xavier; Smolka, Christian; Bode, Christoph; Fink, Katrin; Grundmann, Sebastian",Sci Rep,648,26

The purpose of this study was to describe outcomes and risk factors of applying VA-ECMO in the surgical pediatric population. We retrospectively analyzed 85 consecutive pediatric patients (aged <18 years) who received postcardiotomy VA-ECMO from January 2010 to December 2018. Median (IQR) age at ECMO implantation in this cohort was 12.7 (6.4, 43.2) months, median weight was 8.5 (6.0, 12.8) kg, mean ECMO duration was 143.2 ± 81.6 hours and mean hospital length of stay was 48.4 ± 32.4 days. Seventy-five patients (88.2%) were indicated for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. The successful ECMO weaning rate was 70.6% and in-hospital mortality was 52.9%. The most common diagnosis was transposition of great arteries (n = 18, 21.2%), while acute kidney injury occurred most often (n = 64, 75.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and nosocomial infection were positively correlated with in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis presented that thrombocytopenia significantly increased the 180-day mortality in patients with successful weaning. Therefore, multiple factors had adverse effects on prognosis. Patient selection and procedures from ECMO implantation to weaning need to be closely monitored and performed in a timely manner to improve outcome.","Jin, Yu; Feng, Zhengyi; Zhao, Ju; Hu, Jinxiao; Tong, Yuanyuan; Guo, Shengwen; Zhang, Peiyao; Bai, Liting; Li, Yixuan; Liu, Jinping",Artif. organs,648,13

Confucius Institute is a non-profit educational organization jointly established by China and other countries. Each of the 22 Confucius Institutes and classrooms in Russia present its distinctive feature and work hard in helping the Russian people learn Chinese, understand Chinese culture and enhance the humanist exchange between China and Russia. Chinese education is the most important task of the institutes. Using Confucius Institute of Novosibirsk State University as an example, this paper introduces works done by the institute from three aspects. Firstly, it contributes to Chinese education in the university. Secondly, it meets local residents’ needs to learn Chinese. Thirdly, it broadens the scope of regional cooperation and trains local Chinese teachers. With the support of Xinjiang University in China, the Confucius Institute at Novosibirsk State University has cooperated with many higher and secondary education institutions in Russia to expand international cooperation in Chinese education. The effective work of Confucius Institute at Novosibirsk State University has proved that it has played an active role in Chinese education. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, all Confucius Institutes and classrooms in Russia have continued operating by taking advantage of online teaching and learning and explored the route of development characterized with “Internet + Chinese”. The authors believe that Confucius Institutes will keep on contributing to the Chinese education in Russia with the joint efforts of both parties. © 2021 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

The neurocutaneous flap depends on the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) and its retrograde-flow has been studied via cadaveric dissection. The aim of this study is to prove the vascularity of the lateral antebrachial neurocutaneous (LABN) flap. METHODS: The distally based LABN flap was created in 18 upper limbs (12 cadavers). The skin flap was dissected at the proximal half of the forearm and then diluted methylene blue was injected through the brachial artery. The pedicle of the flap on the distal half of the forearm was dissected along the LACN for the anatomical study of the perforating branches, paraneural vessels, and flap territory. RESULTS: The mean age of cadavers was 74.1 years (nine males). The mean distance of most distal and proximal perforating branches from the radial styloid process were 2.32 ± 0.59 and 11.17 ± 1.72 cm, respectively. The mean total number of perforating branches was 7.4, which abundantly appeared approximately 4 to 5 cm from the radial styloid process. The mean flap territory was 8.64 ± 0.82 cm in width and 10.50 ± 1.90 cm in length. The mean forearm circumference was 24.84 ± 1.52 cm, and mean forearm length was 24.74 ± 1.8 cm. CONCLUSION: This study ensured that retrograde-flow via the neurocutaneous artery could be provided through the vascularity of the LABN flap, which suggests that the pivot point of the flap should not extend beyond 5 cm proximal to the radial styloid process. The LABN flap is a useful alternative method for performing soft tissue reconstruction in hand and wrist defects without sacrificing the major vessels.","Kanchanathepsak, Thepparat; Rojpitipongsakorn, Chanakarn; Tawonsawatruk, Tulyapruek; Suppaphol, Sorasak; Watcharananan, Ittirat; Tuntiyatorn, Panithan",J. reconstr. microsurg,648,24

This work was carried out in Indonesia, but the benefits are beyond a state boundary. The study examines how university students in developing countries have faced obstacles, and yet despite this, they are still trying their hardest to stay focused on achieving their personal goals during the pandemic. This research employed a qualitative phenomenological approach, involving eighty students that were studying at the Faculty of Education at a state university in Jakarta, Indonesia. As data collection techniques, students were asked to write learning log diaries and reflective essays and to participate in an online focus group discussion. The results showed that the students' motivation to remain learning during the COVID-19 pandemic fell into three key themes, each with associated sub-themes. The three themes and sub-themes described were: (a) personal, with sub-themes of challenge, curiosity, self-determination, satisfaction and religious commitment; (b) social, with sub-themes of relationships, inspiration, and well-being of self and others; and (c) environmental, with sub-themes of facilities and conditioning. The themes and sub-themes indicate the source of motivation for these university students to learn during the pandemic. This study concluded that these emerging adults were both intrinsically and extrinsically autonomously motivated and committed to their studies. Most of these students were motivated by their consequential aspirations, not by a controlled motivation, nor were they motivated by a reward, a penalty, or a rule that propelled them. By defining how the students managed to empower themselves, this study recommends the importance of preparing students to be more resilient and to enable them to cultivate the ability to remain optimistic and motivated to succeed and overcome any of life's adversities.","Rahiem, Maila D H",Child Youth Serv Rev,648,1

Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor activated in response to virus infection and is largely responsible for establishing an antiviral state in the infected host. Studies in Irf3-/- mice have demonstrated the absence of IRF3 imparts a high degree of susceptibility to a wide range of viral infections. Virus infection causes the activation of IRF3 to transcribe type-I interferon (e.g., IFNß), which is responsible for inducing the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act at specific stages to limit virus replication. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 is also activated to trigger apoptosis of virus-infected cells, as a mechanism to restrict virus spread within the host, in a pathway called RIG-I-like receptor-induced IRF3 mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA). These dual functions of IRF3 work in concert to mediate protective immunity against virus infection. These two pathways are activated differentially by the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of IRF3. Moreover, PTMs regulate not only IRF3 activation and function, but also protein stability. Consequently, many viruses utilize viral proteins or hijack cellular enzymes to inhibit IRF3 functions. This review will describe the PTMs that regulate IRF3's RIPA and transcriptional activities and use coronavirus as a model virus capable of antagonizing IRF3-mediated innate immune responses. A thorough understanding of the cellular control of IRF3 and the mechanisms that viruses use to subvert this system is critical for developing novel therapies for virus-induced pathologies.","Glanz, Anna; Chakravarty, Sukanya; Varghese, Merina; Kottapalli, Anita; Fan, Shumin; Chakravarti, Ritu; Chattopadhyay, Saurabh",Viruses,648,12

METHODS: Using multi-stage sampling, a survey of public health workers involved in the prevention and control of COVID-19 was conducted from 18 February to 1 March 2020 through a self-administered questionnaire. These public health workers were from the primary health care center (defined as ""primary-urban"" and ""primary-rural"" for those in urban and rural areas, respectively) and the center for disease control and prevention (defined as ""non-primary"") in five provinces including Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Gansu, China. RESULTS: A total of 9,475 public health workers were surveyed, of which 40.0 %, 27.0 % and 33.0 % were from the primary-rural, primary-urban and non-primary, respectively. The resources shortage were reported by 27.9 % participants, with the primary-rural being the worst affected (OR = 1.201, 95 %CI: 1.073-1.345). The difficulties in data processing were reported by 31.5 % participants, with no significant differences among institutions. The difficulties in communication and coordination were reported by 29.8 % participants, with the non-primary being the most serious (primary-rural: OR = 0.520, 95 %CI: 0.446-0.606; primary-urban: OR = 0.533, 95 %CI: 0.454-0.625). The difficulties with target audiences were reported by 20.2 % participants, with the primary-urban being the worst (OR = 1.368, 95 %CI: 1.199-1.560). The psychological distress were reported by 48.8 % participants, with no significant differences among institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress is the most serious problem in the prevention and control of COVID-19. Resources shortage in primary-rural, difficulties in communication and coordination in non-primary, and difficulties with target audiences in the primary-urban deserve attention.

Although it is important to urgently perform public health measures in order to reduce the risk of spread, it could end up stigmatizing entire groups of people rather than offering control measures based on sound scientific principles. This ""us"" versus ""them"" dynamic is common in stigmatization, in general, and indicates a way in which disease stigma can be viewed as a proxy for other types of fears, especially xenophobia and general fear of outsiders. The pandemic risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection led us to consider, among other related issues, how stigma and discrimination remain serious barriers to care for people suspected of being infected, even more if they are assisting professions, such as health workers, employed in emergency response. The purpose of this review is to evaluate and promote the importance of psychological aspects of the stigma and social discrimination (SAD) in pandemic realities and, more specifically, nowadays, in the context of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Just as it happened with HIV, HCV, tuberculosis, and Zika, stigma and discrimination undermine the social fabric compromising the ethics and principles of civilization to which each individual in entitled. Recognizing disease stigma history can give us insight into how, exactly, stigmatizing attitudes are formed, and how they are disbanded. Instead of simply blaming the ignorance of people espousing stigmatizing attitudes about certain diseases, we should try to understand precisely how these attitudes are formed so that we can intervene in their dissemination. We should also look at history to see what sorts of interventions against stigma may have worked in the past. Ongoing research into stigma should evaluate what has worked in the past, as above-mentioned, providing us with some clues as to what might work in the current pandemic emergency, to reduce devastating discrimination that keeps people from getting the care they need. We propose a systematic and historical review, in order to create a scientific and solid base for the following SAD analysis. The aim is to propose a coping strategy to face stigma and discrimination (SAD) related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, borrowing coping strategy tools and solutions from other common contagious diseases.

Many clinical studies were conducted to assess the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who use ACEi/ARBs following the arguments claiming to discontinue these drugs as a precautionary measure. Although several studies mainly analyzed the outcomes of the disease, this review aimed to compare specific blood markers in both groups of COVID-19 patients to gain better insight into the interaction of ACEi/ARBs with different body functions during the infection. Several databases were searched using a combination of keywords followed by screening and data extraction. Only 28 studies met our inclusion criteria, the majority of which showed no significant difference between the inflammation markers of COVID-19 patients who used or did not use ACEi/ARBs. Interestingly, 6 studies reported lower inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients who used ACEi/ARBs, and 6 studies reported better outcomes among the same group. We therefore concluded that the use of ACEi/ARBs may not lead to worse prognosis of COVID-19 and may even play a protective role against the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19.","Naveed, Hiba; Elshafeey, Abdallah; Al-Ali, Dana; Janjua, Emmad; Nauman, Areej; Kawas, Hussam; Kaul, Ridhima; Saed Aldien, Arwa; Elshazly, Mohamed B; Zakaria, Dalia",J. clin. pharmacol,648,1

The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCov), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients. One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets. Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCov or not is through rRT-PCR (qPCR) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome. The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the man power almost in every country. Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed. In this review article, we sort out some state-of-the-art novel approaches that might be applied for a fast, sensitive and precise detection of SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCov not only to help the routine laboratory testing but also to improve effective quarantine.","Yang, De-Ming; Chang, Tai-Jay; Wang, Mong-Lien; Tsai, Ping-Hsing; Lin, Ta-Hsien; Wang, Chin-Tien; Liang, Kung-Hao",J Chin Med Assoc,648,16

The main goal of the paper is to study the social organization of knowledge about COVID-19 within the Wikipedia community of practice. Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach taken in this study was based on the application of Moscovici's theory of social representations to Wikipedia's knowledge organization system (KOS). Internal links in the Wikipedia article about COVID-19 were considered anchors in its social representations. Each link in the introductory part of the article was considered an indicator of the semantic relationship between COVID-19 and other concepts from Wikipedia's knowledge base. The subject of this study was links extracted from all revisions of the COVID-19 article between February and September 2020. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on these conceptual structures using both synchronic and diachronic approaches. Findings It was found that the evolution of anchors in the Wikipedia article on COVID-19 was in line with the mechanism of symbolic coping related to infectious disease. It went through stages of divergence, convergence and normalization. It shows that this mechanism governs the social organization of knowledge related to COVID-19 on Wikipedia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective review analyzed 23 patients with COVID-19, including 13 males and 10 females aged 27-70 years, with an average age of 48 years. Patients were divided into two groups: group A with 11 critical-severe patients, and group B with 12 common-mild patients. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ decreased, while NEU (%), CRP, and CT scores increased in all patients, WBC in group A increased. In group A, on day 10-12 after disease onset, CT scores and CRP reached the highest point, and day 13-15 LYM, LYM (%) reached the lowest but NEU (%) and WBC reached the highest, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ were at the lowest on day 10-15. In group B, on day 7-9, CT scores, NEU (%) and CRP reached the peak, but LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ reached the lowest.

We obtained COVID-19 data from Our World in Data database. We analyzed the association of COVID-19 cases and deaths with the burden of dementia using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Globally, we found significant positive (p < .001) correlations between life expectancy (r = 0.60), HALE (r = 0.58), and dementia DALYs (r = 0.46) with COVID-19 caseloads. Likewise, we found similar correlations between life expectancy (r = 0.60), HALE (r = 0.58) and dementia DALYs (r = 0.54) with COVID-19 mortality.

Palliative care organizations have responded to the growing demand for the rapid dissemination of research, clinical guidance, and instructions for care to clinicians, patients with COVID-19, and their caregivers by creating COVID-19 resource Web pages. Here, end users can access resources that can be updated in real time. These Web pages, however, can be variable in what resources they offer and for whom they are designed for (clinicians, patients, caregivers). Therefore, this project was conducted to consolidate these resources via summary tables of specific contents available through each Web page grouped by palliative care domains (eg, care discussion and planning, communication, symptom management, care access) and to identify the target audience. This environmental scan was conducted by compiling a comprehensive list of COVID-19 resource Web pages of palliative care organizations generated by reviewing previously published research studies and consulting with palliative care research experts. Snowballing techniques were used to identify resource Web pages not captured in the initial scan. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible Web pages for content via a form developed for the study, and Cohen &#954; statistic was calculated to ensure interrater reliability. The final &#954; statistic was 0.76. Of the 24 websites screened, 15 websites met our eligibility criteria. Among the eligible resource Web pages, most (n = 12, 80%) had specific target audiences and care settings, whereas the rest presented information targeted to all audiences. Although 11 Web pages offered resources that addressed all 4 domains, only 1 Web page conveyed all 12 subdomains.

In this work, we study how individuals adapted their daily movements and person-to-person contact patterns over time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the NPIs. We leverage longitudinal GPS mobility data of hundreds of thousands of anonymous individuals in four US states and empirically show the dramatic disruption in people's life. We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines and reducing person-to-person contact activities. Moreover, we show that the stringency of interventions alone does explain the number and duration of visits to venues: individual patterns of visits seem to be influenced by the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions.","Lucchini, Lorenzo; Centellegher, Simone; Pappalardo, Luca; Gallotti, Riccardo; Privitera, Filippo; Lepri, Bruno; Nadai, Marco De",,648,22

Major simulation exercises in OECD countries predicted accurately how a crisis like Covid-19 could unfold, but they were not acted on, or not sufficiently, judging by what has happened’. Heyman et al. (Lancet 385:1884–1901, 2015 [2]) argue that, “the world is ill-prepared” to handle any “sustained and threatening public-health emergency”. The complex threat and risk landscape that shapes our security and safety experience is characterized by Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) conditions. For example the recent COVID 19 pandemic reflects how unexpected events often audit our resilience (Weick and Sutcliffe in Managing the unexpected: resilient performance in an age of uncertainty. Wiley, San Francisco, 2007 [3]). Such surprising events often reflect an organization’s inability to recognize evidence of new vulnerabilities, sense weak signals or the existence of ineffective countermeasures (Woods in Resilience engineering. Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, 2006 [4]). Public health emergencies stemming from infectious disease outbreaks are creating a serious threat to global health security and have significant National Security implications. Viewed as a black swan or an elephant in the room, this pandemic point to the requirement to be sensitive to the extremes: to those events that lie outside of what we consider predictable (Masys in Homeland security cultures: enhancing values while fostering resilience. Rowman & Littlefield International, London/Lanham, 2018 [5];Masys in Disaster forensics: understanding root cause and complex causality. Springer Publishing, 2016 [6];Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Penguin Books Ltd., London, 2007 [7]). Weick [8] refers to sensemaking in terms of ‘… how we structure the unknown so as to be able to act in it. Sensemaking involves coming up with a plausible understanding—a map—of a shifting world;testing this map with others through data collection, action, and conversation;and then refining, or abandoning, the map depending on how credible it is’ (Ancona in Handbook of teaching leadership. Sage, Thousand Oaks, pp. 3–20, 2011 [9]).

Many of the recommended prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, are not feasible for a population living in shelters characterised by physical proximity and a high population density. The objective of the study was to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters in Brussels (Belgium), and to identify risk factors and infection control practices associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. METHODS: A total of 1994 adults were tested by quantitative PCR tests in 52 shelters in Brussels (Belgium) between April and June, 2020, in collaboration with Doctors of the World. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is here described site by site, and we identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also investigate associations between seropositivity and reported symptoms. RESULTS: We found an overall prevalence of 4.6% for the period, and a cluster of high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (20-30% in two shelters). Among homeless people, being under 40 years of age (OR (CI95%) 2.3 (1.2-4.4), p = 0.02), having access to urgent medical care (AMU) (OR(CI95%): 2.4 (1.4-4.4)], p = 0.02), and sharing a room with someone who tested positive (OR(CI95%): 5.3 (2.9-9.9), p<0.0001) were factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. 93% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This study shows high rates of SARS-COV-2 infection positive tests in some shelters, with a high proportion of asymptomatic cases. The survey reveals how important testing and isolation measures are, together with actions taken by medical and social workers during the outbreak.","Roland, Michel; Ben Abdelhafidh, Louisa; Déom, Victoria; Vanbiervliet, Frank; Coppieters, Yves; Racapé, Judith",PLoS One,648,20

As the virus has spread, critical questions arose about how to best deliver health care in emergency situations where material and personnel resources become scarce. Clinicians who excel at caring for the individual patient at the bedside are now being reoriented into a system where they are being asked to see the collective public as their responsibility. As such, the clinical ethics that clinicians are accustomed to practicing are being modified by a framework of public health ethics defined by the presence of a global pandemic. There are many unknowns about Coronavirus disease 2019, which makes it difficult to provide consistent recommendations and guidelines that uniformly apply to all situations. This lack of consensus leads to the clinicians' confusion and distress. Real-life dilemmas about how to allocate resources and provide care in hotspot cities make explicit the need for careful ethical analysis, but the need runs far deeper than that; even when not trading some lives against others, the responsibilities of both individual clinicians and the broader healthcare system are changing in the face of this crisis.","Dunham, Alexandra M; Rieder, Travis N; Humbyrd, Casey J",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,648,2

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported around the world; indeed, this infection has been declared a pandemic. Consequently, the scientific community is working hard to gain useful information about the history of this virus, its transmission, diagnosis, clinical features, radiological findings, research and development of candidate therapeutics as well as vaccines. This review aims to analyze the diagnostic techniques used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection, critically reviewing positive points and criticism for forensic implications, obviously including autopsy. Finally, this review proposes a practical workflow to be applied in the management of corpses during this outbreak of the COVID-19 infection, which could be useful in cases of future infectious disease emergencies. Analyzing the diagnostic methods, to date, virus nucleic acid RT-PCR represents the standard method used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection in living subjects and corpses, even if this technique has several criticisms: mainly, the staff should be highly specialized, working in high-throughput settings, able to handle high workloads and aware of health risks and the importance of the results. Thus, IgG/IgM serological tests have been developed, overcoming RT-qPCR duration, costs, and management, not requiring highly trained personnel. Nevertheless, serological tests present problems; the WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. Furthermore, nothing has yet been published regarding the possibility of applying these methods during post-mortem investigations. In light of this scenario, in this review, we suggest a flow chart for the pathologist called on to ascertain the cause of death of a subject with historical and clinical findings of COVID-19 status or without any anamnestic, diagnostic, or exposure information. Indeed, the literature data confirmed the analytical vulnerabilities of the kits used for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly during postmortem examinations. For these reasons, autopsy remains the gold standard method to ascertain the exact cause of death (from or with COVID-19 infection, or other causes), to consequently provide real data for statistical evaluations and to take necessary measures to contain the risks of the infection. Moreover, performing autopsies could provide information on the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 infection with obvious therapeutic implications.","Sessa, Francesco; Bertozzi, Giuseppe; Cipolloni, Luigi; Baldari, Benedetta; Cantatore, Santina; D’errico, Stefano; Di Mizio, Giulio; Asmundo, Alessio; Castorina, Sergio; Salerno, Monica; Pomara, Cristoforo",J.

Methods: Retrospective reviews and case series were examined to provide an overview of the management of viral infections in the burn patient. Results: The most common viral pathogens in these patients are the herpesviruses, which include herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. Established viral infections that may complicate patient management include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, and, more recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Herpesvirus infections can occur as primary or nosocomial pathogens but clinical manifestations most commonly are re-activation of latent viral infection. Because of the paucity of data in the burn population, much of the evidence for specific treatments is extrapolated from patients with severe immunosuppression or critical illness. Antiviral therapy is employed for the burn patient with herpesvirus infections. This is an area of active study, and further research is needed to better understand the risks, clinical manifestations, and attributable morbidity and mortality of viral infections. Conclusions: Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients.

We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, LILACS and CINAHL for eligible studies published from 1 January 2020 to 17 April 2020. We included patients of all ages, in all settings. The main outcome was the proportion of patients with a bacterial, fungal or viral co-infection. . RESULTS: Thirty studies including 3834 patients were included. Overall, 7% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a bacterial co-infection (95% CI 3-12%, n=2183, I2=92·2%). A higher proportion of ICU patients had bacterial co-infections than patients in mixed ward/ICU settings (14%, 95% CI 5-26, I2=74·7% versus 4%, 95% CI 1-9, I2= 91·7%). The commonest bacteria were Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. The pooled proportion with a viral co-infection was 3% (95% CI 1-6, n=1014, I2=62·3%), with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and influenza A the commonest. Three studies reported fungal co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: A low proportion of COVID-19 patients have a bacterial co-infection; less than in previous influenza pandemics.

To raise awareness of this potential problem, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported OHCA in the pandemic period, comparing COVID-19 suspected or diagnosed patients vs. COVID-19 not suspected or diagnosed group. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge (SHD). Secondary outcomes were the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission or survival with favorable neurological outcomes. Data including 4210 patients included in five studies were analyzed. SHD in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively (odds ratio, OR = 0.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.12, 0.53; p < 0.001). Bystander CPR rate was comparable in the COVID-19 vs. not COVID-19 group (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.22; p = 0.43). Shockable rhythms were observed in 5.7% in COVID-19 patients compared with 37.4% in the non-COVID-19 group (OR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.96; p = 0.04; I2 = 95%). ROSC in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were 13.3% vs. 26.5%, respectively (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.81; p < 0.001). SHD with favorable neurological outcome was observed in 0% in COVID-19 vs. 3.1% in non-COVID-19 patients (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.07, 26.19; p = 0.84). Our meta-analysis suggests that suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 reduces the SHD rate after OHCA, which seems to be due to the lower rate of shockable rhythms in COVID-19 patients, but not due to reluctance to bystander CPR. Future trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results and determine the optimal procedures to increase survival after OHCA in COVID-19 patients.","Borkowska, Magdalena J; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Koda, Mariusz; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Szarpak, Agnieszka; Gilis-Malinowska, Natasza; Safiejko, Kamil; Szarpak, Lukasz; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Smereka, Jacek",,648,16

However, the evidence on its actual effects remains disperse and difficult to apply in clinical settings. This systematic review and metanalysis summarizes the available evidence to date on the beneficial and adverse effect of AZM in patients with Covid-19. MethodsThe PRISMA 2020 statement criteria were followed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing clinical outcomes of patients treated, and not treated, with AZM, indexed until the 5th of July 2021, were searched in PubMed, Embase, The Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and MedRXivs. We used Random-effects models to estimate pooled effect size from aggregate data. ResultsThe initial search produced 4950 results. Finally, 16 studies, five RCTs and 11 with an observational design, with a total of 22984 patients, were included. The metanalysis showed no difference in mortality for those treated, or not, with AZM, OR: 0.95 (0.79-1.13). There was also no significant difference for those treated, and not, with AZM in need for hospital admission or time to admission from ambulatory settings, clinical severity, need for intensive care, or adverse effects. ConclusionsThese results presented in this review do not support the use of AZM in the management of Covid-19. They also show that any harm caused to the patient who received it is unlikely. Future research on treatment for patients with Covid-19 may need to focus on other drugs.","Ayerbe, Luis; Forgnone, Ivo; Risco-Risco, Carlos; Perez-Pinar, Maria; Ayis, Salma",,648,24

However, as peer support specialists are part of a fast-growing mental health and substance use workforce in innovative integrated care settings, they encounter various challenges in their new roles and tasks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore peer support specialists' experiences regarding employment challenges in integrated mental health and substance use workplace settings in New Hampshire, USA. METHODS: Using experience-based co-design, nonpeer academic researchers co-designed this study with peer support specialists. We conducted a series of focus groups with peer support specialists (N=15) from 3 different integrated mental health and substance use agencies. Audio recordings were transcribed. Data analysis included content analysis and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 90 final codes relating to 6 themes: (1) work role and boundaries, (2) hiring, (3) work-life balance, (4) work support, (5) challenges, and (6) identified training needs. CONCLUSIONS: The shared values of experience-based co-design and peer support specialists eased facilitation between peer support specialists and nonpeer academic researchers, and indicated that this methodology is feasible for nonpeer academic researchers and peer support specialists alike. Participants expressed challenges with agency restrictions, achieving work-life balance, stigma, and low compensation. We present actionable items to address these challenges in integrated mental health and substance use systems to potentially offset workforce dissatisfaction and high turnover rates.","Almeida, Margaret; Day, Annie; Smith, Bret; Bianco, Cynthia; Fortuna, Karen",J Particip Med,648,1

SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs causing a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild dyspnea to severe shortness of breath requiring intubation. Elevation of liver transaminases in the patients' sera has been described in up to 53% of the COVID-19 positive patients. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the virus on the liver cells are unclear and only few hypotheses are currently available. Data on COVID-19 in pregnant women are lacking and the management of COVID-19 pregnant women is challenging. An elevation of the transaminases during pregnancies infected by SARS-CoV-2 has never been described before. METHODS: Here we presented the case of a 29 years-old patient at 38 weeks of gestation COVID-19 positive with elevated transaminases. RESULTS: The patient showed a progressive decrease of transaminases after the delivery of the fetus. We provided details about the daily transaminases trend, the therapy used and the maternal/neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that in our case the delivery of the fetus contributed to the normalization of the liver enzymes. In patients affected by COVID-19, at term of gestation, with elevated transaminases, delivery of the fetus is an appealing option. If confirmed by larger studies, our proposed management might be incorporated in the obstetrical management guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients.","Nkeih, Claudia; Sisti, Giovanni; Schiattarella, Antonio",Acta Biomed,648,4

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty volunteers were randomized in three groups [running (RG; n = 10), cycling (CG; n = 10) and control (CON; n = 10)] and were evaluated at baseline, post 24, 48 and 72 h of knee extensors' muscle damage protocol. CON performed passive recovery, while RG and CG performed active recovery immediately after the protocol, as well as 24 h and 48 h afterwards. MAIN OUTCOMES: (i) maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC); (ii) delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS); (iii) plasma creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. RESULTS: No group-by-time interaction was found in any outcome evaluated (p > 0.05). All groups presented decreases in MVIC and increases in DOMS (p < 0.001), without differences in CK and LDH. Compared with CON, exercise groups presented likely beneficial effects for LDH, while only CG had a likely beneficial effect for DOMS. Lastly, CG presented likely/very likely beneficial effects for MVIC and DOMS compared to RG. CONCLUSION: Although the null hypothesis analysis did not find differences, the magnitude-based inference analysis suggested that moderate intensity cycling have likely beneficial effects on knee extensor muscle recovery after eccentric exercise protocol.","de Azevedo Franke, Rodrigo; Rodrigues, Rodrigo; Geremia, Jeam Marcel; Teixeira, Bruno Costa; Boeno, Francesco; Rabello, Rodrigo; Baroni, Bruno Manfredini; Lima, Cláudia Silveira",Phys Ther Sport,648,11

Mathematical modelling and computational simulations are effective tools that help global efforts to estimate key transmission parameters. The model equations often require computational tools and dynamical analysis that play an important role in controlling the disease. This work reviews some models for coronavirus first, that can address important questions about the global health care and suggest important notes. Then, we model the disease as a system of differential equations. We develop previous models for the coronavirus, some key computational simulations and sensitivity analysis are added. Accordingly, the local sensitivities for each model state with respect to the model parameters are computed using three different techniques: non-normalizations, half normalizations and full normalizations. Results based on sensitivity analysis show that almost all model parameters may have role on spreading this virus among susceptible, exposed and quarantined susceptible people. More specifically, communicate rate person–to–person, quarantined exposed rate and transition rate of exposed individuals have an effective role in spreading this disease. One possible solution suggests that healthcare programs should pay more attention to intervention strategies, and people need to self-quarantine that can effectively reduce the disease.","Khoshnaw, Sarbaz H.A.; Salih, Rizgar H.; Sulaimany, Sadegh",Math.

In South Carolina, the spatial and temporal patterns were different, initially concentrating in small towns within metro counties, then diffusing to centralized urban areas and rural areas. When mitigation restrictions were relaxed, hotspots reappeared in the major cities. This paper examines the county-scale spatial and temporal patterns of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for South Carolina from March 1st-September 5th, 2020. We first describe the initial diffusion of the new confirmed cases per week across the state, which remained under 2,000 cases until Memorial Day weekend (epi week 23) then dramatically increased, peaking in mid-July (epi week 29), and slowly declining thereafter. Second, we found significant differences in cases and deaths between urban and rural counties, partially related to the timing of the number of confirmed cases and deaths and the implementation of state and local mitigations. Third, we found that the case rates and mortality rates positively correlated with pre-existing social vulnerability. There was also a negative correlation between mortality rates and county resilience patterns, as expected, suggesting that counties with higher levels of inherent resilience had fewer deaths per 100,000 population.","Huang, Qian; Jackson, Sarah; Derakhshan, Sahar; Lee, Logan; Pham, Erika; Jackson, Amber; Cutter, Susan L",PLoS One,648,27

In the present study, red-clawed crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus was employed as a model organism. Animals were divided into four temperature groups (25, 20, 15 and 9 °C) and treated for 4 weeks, with the 25 °C group serving as a control. The total lipid content in the hepatopancreas as well as the triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid levels in the hemolymph were determined. Lipids stored in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph decreased with decreasing temperature, with changes in the 9 °C group most pronounced, indicating that lipids are the main energy source for crayfish at low temperatures. Furthermore, enzyme activity of lipase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and lipoprotein esterase, and gene expression analysis of fatty acid synthase gene, acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene and carnitine palmitoyltransferase gene showed that the digestion, synthesis and oxidation of lipids in the hepatopancreas were inhibited under low temperature stress, but expression of sphingolipid delta-4 desaturase (DEGS) was increased, indicating an increase in the demand for highly unsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures. Analysis of the expression of genes related to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway revealed that the adiponectin receptor gene was rapidly upregulated at low temperatures, which may in turn activate the expression of the downstream AMPK&#945; gene, thereby inhibiting lipid anabolism.","Wu, Donglei; Liu, Zhiquan; Yu, Ping; Huang, Youhui; Cai, Mingqi; Zhang, Meng; Zhao, Yunlong",J Therm Biol,648,18

This fits into a burgeoning ecological paradigm suggesting that for both predator-prey and parasite-host interactions, non-consumptive effects (avoidance) can be orders of magnitude stronger than consumptive effects (sickness and death). Just as avoidance of predators and parasites imposes substantial costs on prey and hosts, altered behaviour to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 has impacted human fitness and wellbeing. But the effects of infectious disease avoidance do not stop there; non-consumptive effects of predators and parasites often trigger cascading indirect effects in natural systems. Similarly, shifts in human behaviour due to COVID-19 have triggered myriad indirect effects on species and the environment, which can be positive, negative or neutral. We urge researchers to recognize that the environmental impacts associated with lockdowns are indirect effects of the virus. In short, the global response to COVID-19 suggests that the non-consumptive effects of a pathogen, and resulting indirect effects, can be profound.","Buck, Julia C; Weinstein, Sara B",Biol Lett,648,1

We characterized pre-pandemic and pandemic rates of donor infectious disease marker (IDM) reactivity which reflect the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) undetectable by current testing. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis of allogeneic blood donor presentations and successful donations in a large national US blood collector identifies changes in self-reported behavioral risk factors and IDM reactivity. Data on allogeneic blood donor presentations and successful donations from March 1 through August 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019 were retrieved from the blood center's computer system. Donor demographics and deferrals for reported behavioral risk factors and confirmed-positive IDMs were compared in pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. RESULTS: With increasing mobile blood drive cancellations, pandemic donors were more likely than 2019 donors to be female, over age 30, non-Hispanic Whites, and have a post-secondary degree. First-time donations (at highest risk for confirmed-positive IDMs) did not substantially increase. Pandemic donors reported fewer behavioral risks and IDMs declined among these donors. Mid-pandemic introduction of screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not affect IDM rates. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike disasters, which tend to bring out more first-time donors with increased IDM reactivity and TTI residual risk, COVID-19 donors had lower IDM rates which were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Already-low TTI residual risk is likely to have declined as a result.","Vassallo, Ralph R; Bravo, Marjorie D; Kamel, Hany",Transfusion,648,29

We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d⩽20μm) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100μm), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d⩽20μm) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, ’exposure time’ to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional ’safety distance’ thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.","Vuorinen, Ville; Aarnio, Mia; Alava, Mikko; Alopaeus, Ville; Atanasova, Nina; Auvinen, Mikko; Balasubramanian, Nallannan; Bordbar, Hadi; Erästö, Panu; Grande, Rafael; Hayward, Nick; Hellsten, Antti; Hostikka, Simo; Hokkanen, Jyrki; Kaario, Ossi; Karvinen, Aku; Kivistö, Ilkka; Korhonen, Marko; Kosonen, Risto; Kuusela, Janne; Lestinen, Sami; Laurila, Erkki; Nieminen, Heikki J.; Peltonen, Petteri; Pokki, Juho; Puisto, Antti; Råback, Peter; Salmenjoki, Henri; Sironen, Tarja; Österberg, Monika",Saf.

These alterations result from a combination of virus-specific factors, genetically encoded mechanisms, and the status of host defences and range from loss or upregulation of HLA-I molecules to selective increases of HLA-I alleles. In this review, I will first analyse characteristic features of altered HLA-I expression found in SARS-CoV-2. I will then discuss the potential factors underlying these defects, focussing on HLA-E and class-I-related (like) molecules and their receptors, the most documented HLA-I alterations. I will also draw attention to potential differences between cells transfected to express viral proteins and those presented as part of authentic infection.

Therefore, we assessed stressors, coping behaviors, and resources needed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 162 perinatal (125 pregnant and 37 postpartum) women in the United States. METHODS: A mixed-methods study captured quantitative responses regarding stressors and coping, along with qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding stress and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze differences between pregnant and postpartum participants, as well as differences across key demographic variables. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. RESULTS: During the COVID-pandemic, food scarcity and shelter-in-place restrictions made it difficult for pregnant women to find healthy foods. Participants also reported missing prenatal appointments, though many reported using telemedicine to obtain these services. Financial issues were prevalent in our sample and participants had difficulty obtaining childcare. After controlling for demographic variables, pregnant women were less likely to engage in healthy stress-coping behaviors than postpartum women. Lastly, we were able to detect signals of increased stressors induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and less social support, in perinatal women of racial and ethnic minority, and lower-income status. Qualitative results support our survey findings as participants expressed concerns about their baby contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital, significant others missing the delivery or key obstetric appointments, and wanting support from friends, family, and birthing classes. Financial resources, COVID-19 information and research as it relates to maternal-infant health outcomes, access to safe healthcare, and access to baby supplies (formula, diapers, etc.) emerged as the primary resources needed by participants. CONCLUSIONS: To better support perinatal women's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should engage in conversations regarding access to resources needed to care for newborns, refer patients to counseling services (which can be delivered online/via telephone) and virtual support groups, and consistently screen pregnant women for stressors.","Barbosa-Leiker, Celestina; Smith, Crystal Lederhos; Crespi, Erica J; Brooks, Olivia; Burduli, Ekaterina; Ranjo, Samantha; Carty, Cara L; Hebert, Luciana E; Waters, Sara F; Gartstein, Maria A",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,648,20

Although different types of anti-viral targets are applicable for SARS-CoV-2 drug screenings, the more promising targets can be considered as 3C-like main protease (3Cl protease) and RNA polymerase. The remdesivir could be considered the closest bifunctional drug to the provisional clinical administration for SARS-CoV-2. The known molecular targets of the SARS-CoV-2 include fourteen targets, while four molecules of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cathepsin L, 3Cl protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are suggested as more promising potential targets. Accordingly, dual-acting drugs as an encouraging solution in drug discovery are suggested.

METHODS: In total, 1,386 participants who underwent abdominal US as part of health examinations between December 2008 and May 2014 were included in this retrospective study. We classified pancreatic echogenicity on a 4-point scale, and compared it using two distinct criteria: fatty pancreas (FP) 1 criterion (normal vs. &#8805;mild HP) and FP2 criterion (normal/mild HP vs. &#8805;moderate HP). According to the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), participants were subdivided into four groups: non-NAFLD and non-HP, isolated NAFLD, isolated HP, and HP with NAFLD. Glycemic progression was defined as progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes or diabetes or progression from prediabetes to diabetes. RESULTS: During the follow-up (median, 5.9 years), 262 of the 1,386 participants developed glycemic progression. Using FP2, the probability of glycemic progression across the four subgroups showed cumulative aggravation for NAFLD and HP (all P<0.05). Isolated HP showed a higher probability of glycemic progression than isolated NAFLD according to FP2 (P<0.001). The highest probability of glycemic progression was observed in patients with both NAFLD and HP (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for glycemic progression increased with the severity of HP. CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of HP on US was found to be significantly correlated with glycemic progression. Moreover, isolated HP of moderate or greater severity predicted glycemic progression independent of NAFLD.","Oh, Jiyun; Park, Hyun Jeong; Lee, Eun Sun; Park, Sung Bin; Choi, Byung Ihn; Ahn, Soohyun",,648,32

Reopening schools requires balancing the risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection to students and staff members against the benefits of in-person learning (2). During December 3, 2020-January 31, 2021, CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 20 elementary schools (kindergarten through grade 6) that had reopened in Salt Lake County, Utah. The 7-day cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases in Salt Lake County during this time ranged from 290 to 670 cases per 100,000 persons. Susceptible§ school contacts¶ (students and staff members exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in school) of 51 index patients** (40 students and 11 staff members) were offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Among 1,041 susceptible school contacts, 735 (70.6%) were tested, and five of 12 cases identified were classified as school-associated; the secondary attack rate among tested susceptible school contacts was 0.7%. Mask use among students was high (86%), and the median distance between students' seats in classrooms was 3 ft. Despite high community incidence and an inability to maintain &#8805;6 ft of distance between students at all times, SARS-CoV-2 transmission was low in these elementary schools. The results from this investigation add to the increasing evidence that in-person learning can be achieved with minimal SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk when multiple measures to prevent transmission are implemented (3,4).","Hershow, Rebecca B; Wu, Karen; Lewis, Nathaniel M; Milne, Alison T; Currie, Dustin; Smith, Amanda R; Lloyd, Spencer; Orleans, Brian; Young, Erin L; Freeman, Brandi; Schwartz, Noah; Bryant, Bobbi; Espinosa, Catherine; Nakazawa, Yoshinori; Garza, Elizabeth; Almendares, Olivia; Abara, Winston E; Ehlman, Daniel C; Waters, Keith; Hill, Mary; Risk, Ilene; Oakeson, Kelly; Tate, Jacqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L; Dunn, Angela; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha; Hersh, Adam L; Chu, Victoria T",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,648,24

The purpose of this study was to compare downstream medical utilization-based outcomes (costs, visits, recurrent episodes) after an initial diagnosis of patellofemoral pain based on pre-injury utilization of opioids. METHOD: A total of 85,7880 consecutive patients were followed for a full 12 months before and 24 months after an initial diagnosis of patellofemoral pain (January 2009 to December 2013). Data were sourced from the Military Health System Data Repository, a single-payer closed government system. Opioid prescription fills were identified, and medical visits and costs were calculated for all knee-related medical care, to include recurrence rates in the 2-year surveillance period. RESULTS: A relatively small number of individuals filled an opioid prescription in the year prior (n = 1746; 2.0%); however, these individuals had almost twice the mean costs of knee-related medical care ($1557 versus %802) and medical visits (8.4 versus 4.0). Patients with prior opioid use were more likely to have at least 1 recurrent episode of knee pain (relative risk 1.58, 95% CI 1.51, 1.65) with a higher mean number of episodes of knee pain (1.5 vs 1.8). The use of opioids with higher risk of misuse or dependency (Schedule II or III) resulted in greater medical costs (for any reason) and recurrent episodes of knee pain compared to the use of opioids in a lower risk category (Schedule IV). CONCLUSIONS: Prior opioid utilization was associated with a greater number of recurrent episodes of knee pain and higher downstream medical costs compared with individuals without prior opioid use. For individuals with prior opioid utilization, opioids with higher risk of misuse or dependency (Schedule II or III) resulted in greater medical costs (for any reason) and recurrent episodes compared to the use of lower-risk opioids (Schedule IV). Key Points â¢ Patients with prior opioid use had much greater knee-related medical costs compared to patients without prior opioid use. â¢ Patients with prior opioid use were more likely to have additional episodes of knee pain in the following 2 years compared to patients without prior opioid use. â¢ Prior opioid use has predicted higher costs and poor outcomes after surgery, but this is the first study to confirm similar findings in non-surgical patients.","Rhon, Daniel I; Cook, Chad E; Cleland, Joshua A; Snodgrass, Suzanne J",Clin. rheumatol,648,15

However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model. METHODS: From April 11th to May 1st, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: The United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the health belief model, including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3,070 from the United States, 3,946 from Mexico, 1,201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the U.S. adhered to the most social distancing practices (chi-squared test = 2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (chi-squared test = 309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (OR [95% CI]; U.S. = 1.58 [1.21-2.07]; Mexico = 1.54 [1.21-1.96]; Hong Kong = 2.48 [1.80-3.44]; Taiwan = 2.30 [2.21-2.39]) and social distancing practices (U.S. = 1.77 [1.24-2.49]; Mexico = 1.77 [1.40-2.25]; Hong Kong = 3.25 [2.32-4.62]; Taiwan = 2.58 [2.47-2.68]) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the U.S., Mexico, and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing. Policies that address relevant health beliefs can facilitate adoption of necessary actions for preventing COVID-19. Our findings may be explained by the timing of government policies, the number of cases reported in each country, individual beliefs, and cultural context.","Hsing, Julianna C; Ma, Jasmin; Barrero-Castillero, Alejandra; Jani, Shilpa G; Pulendran, Uma Palam; Lin, Bea-Jane; Thomas-Uribe, Monika; Wang, C Jason",J. med. internet res,648,16

Following an extensive literature search, we identified 24 eligible studies, including a total of 624 pediatric cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, which report data on 27 different biomarkers. We then performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates (PPE) for these laboratory abnormalities in mild COVID-19. As data was too limited for children with severe COVID-19 to allow pooling, results were presented descriptively in a summary of findings table. Our data show an inconsistent pattern of change in the leukocyte index of mild and severe cases of COVID-19 in children. Specifically, changes in leukocyte counts were only observed in 32% of the mild pediatric cases (PPE: 13% increase, 19% decrease). In mild disease, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was frequently elevated, with a PPE of 33%. In severe disease, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were frequently elevated. Based on data obtained from early COVID-19 studies, leukocyte indices in children appear inconsistent, differing from those reported in adults that highlight specific leukocyte trends. This brings into question the utility and reliability of such parameters in monitoring disease severity in the pediatric population. Instead, we suggest physicians to serially monitor CRP, PCT, and LDH to track the course of illness in hospitalized children. Finally, elevated CK-MB in mild pediatric COVID-19 cases is indicative of possible cardiac injury. This highlights the importance of monitoring cardiac biomarkers in hospitalized patients and the need for further investigation of markers such as cardiac troponin in future studies.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Hsieh, Wan Chin; Benoit, Justin; Ballout, Rami A; Plebani, Mario; Lippi, Giuseppe",Clin Biochem,648,16

Lung volume, lesion volume, nonlesion lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume - lesion volume), and fraction of nonlesion lung volume (%NLLV) (nonlesion lung volume / lung volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for lesions volume and NLLV, respectively. To investigate the validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we built random forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe, and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors using the root-mean-square error. RESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (nâ¯=â¯25), severe (nâ¯=â¯47) and critical (nâ¯=â¯27), according to the clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25) moderate, 6 (6/47) severe, and 25 critical (25/27), respectively, were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0, and 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28 days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum NAT-positive 8, 9, and 13 days, in three severity groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (nâ¯=â¯3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (nâ¯=â¯80), prolonged recovery (nâ¯=â¯15), and death (nâ¯=â¯1). The %NLLV in three severity groups were 92.18 ± 9.89%, 82.94 ± 16.49%, and 66.19 ± 24.15% with p value <0.05 among each two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers using hybrid models were 0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severeâ¯+â¯critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were significantly higher than either radiomics models or clinical models (p < 0.05). The root-mean-square errors of RF regressors were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization (mean: 2.60 ± 1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen inhalation (mean: 2.44 ± 1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59 ± 0.98 weeks), and 0.69 weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32 ± 0.67 weeks), respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and 0.960, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT quantification and machine-learning models show great potentials for assisting decision-making in the management of COVID-19 patients by assessing disease severity and predicting clinical outcomes.","Cai, Wenli; Liu, Tianyu; Xue, Xing; Luo, Guibo; Wang, Xiaoli; Shen, Yihong; Fang, Qiang; Sheng, Jifang; Chen, Feng; Liang, Tingbo",Acad Radiol,648,1

Different countries have tried to control its spread by applying the basic principles of social distancing and testing. Healthcare professionals have been the frontline workers globally with different opinions regarding the preparation and management of this pandemic. We aim to get the opinion of healthcare professionals in United Kingdom regarding their perceptions of preparedness in their workplace and general views of current pandemic management strategy. METHOD: A questionnaire survey, drafted using Google Forms, was distributed among healthcare professionals working in the National Health Service (NHS) across the United Kingdom. The study was kept open for the first 2 weeks of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1007 responses were obtained with majority of the responses from England (n = 850, 84.40%). There were 670 (66.53%) responses from doctors and 204 (20.26%) from nurses. Most of the respondents (95.23%) had direct patient contact in day to day activity. Only one third of the respondents agreed that they felt supported at their trust and half of the respondents reported that adequate training was provided to the frontline staff. Two-thirds of the respondents were of the view that there was not enough Personal Protective Equipment available while 80% thought that this pandemic has improved their hand washing practice. Most of the respondents were in the favour of an earlier lockdown (90%) and testing all the NHS frontline staff (94%). CONCLUSION: Despite current efforts, it would seem this is not translating to a sense of security amongst the UK NHS workforce in terms of how they feel trained and protected. It is vital that healthcare professionals have adequate support and protection at their workplace and that these aspects be actively monitored.","Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Chaudhuri, Arindam",Int J Surg,648,16

The cause of this cytokine rampage is yet not known. Based on recent epidemiological evidence, we hypothesized that CD80/86 signaling is essential for this hyperinflammation, and that blocking this proinflammatory axis could be an effective therapeutic approach to protect against severe COVID-19. Here we provide exploratory evidence that abatacept, a drug that blocks CD80/86 co-stimulation, produces changes at the systemic level that are highly antagonistic of the proinflammatory processes elicited by COVID-19. Using RNA-seq from blood samples from a longitudinal cohort of n = 38 rheumatic patients treated with abatacept, we determined the immunological processes that are significantly regulated by this treatment. We then analyzed available blood RNA-seq from two COVID19 patient cohorts, a very early cohort from the epicenter of the pandemic in China (n = 3 COVID-19 cases and n = 3 controls), and a recent and larger cohort from the USA (n = 49 severe and n = 51 mild COVD-19 patients). We found a highly significant antagonism between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity with the systemic response to abatacept. Analysis of previous single-cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mild and severe COVID-19 patients and controls, reinforce the implication of the CD80/86 proinflammatory axis. Our functional results further support abatacept as a candidate therapeutic approach to prevent severe COVID-19.","Julià, Antonio; Bonafonte-Pardàs, Irene; Gómez, Antonio; López-Lasanta, María; López-Corbeto, Mireia; Martínez-Mateu, Sergio H; Lladós, Jordi; Rodríguez-Nunez, Iván; Myers, Richard M; Marsal, Sara",Sci Rep,648,29

The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-&#945;), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression to zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation. This replicon system would be helpful for performing antiviral screening and dissecting virus-host interactions.","Zhang, Yang; Song, Wuhui; Chen, Shuiye; Yuan, Zhenghong; Yi, Zhigang",Antiviral Res,648,14

The aim is to investigate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on medical staff in different working posts in China, and to explore the correlation between psychological disorder and the exposure to COVID-19. METHODS: A multicenter WeChat-based online survey was conducted among medical staff in China between 26 February and 3 March 2020. Medical staff deployed to Hubei province from other provinces and medical staffs in different posts outside Hubei were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of COVID-19. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, stress and resilience were evaluated using scales including GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, PSS-14, and CD-RISC-10. Latent class analysis was performed to identify potential staff requiring psychological support. RESULTS: A total of 274 respondents were included, who serving at 4 posts as follows, staff backing Hubei province, isolation wards outside Hubei, fever clinic and infectious disease department, and other departments outside Hubei. The total scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and stress were statistically different among groups, meanwhile an increasing tendency of anxiety, depression and sleep quality scores with increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19 was found (p < 0.05). Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated that the staff backing Hubei had higher scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and perceived stress (adjusted p < 0.05). The combined prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia of staff backing Hubei reached as high as 38%. Four-class latent class analysis showed 3 categories of population (69.4%) may need psychological support.

Amid this public health emergency, the urgent need for palliative care integration throughout critical care settings has never been more crucial. OBJECTIVE: To promote palliative care engagement in critical care; share palliative care resources to support critical care nurses in alleviating suffering during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and make recommendations to strengthen nursing capacity to deliver high-quality, person-centered critical care. Methods Palliative and critical care literature and practice guidelines were reviewed, synthesized, and translated into recommendations for critical care nursing practice. RESULTS: Nurses are ideally positioned to drive full integration of palliative care into the critical care delivery for all patients, including those with coronavirus disease 2019, given their relationship-based approach to care, as well as their leadership and advocacy roles. Recommendations include the promotion of healthy work environments and prioritizing nurse self-care in alignment with critical care nursing standards. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses should focus on a strategic integration of palliative care, critical care, and ethically based care during times of normalcy and of crisis. Primary palliative care should be provided for each patient and family, and specialist services sought, as appropriate. Nurse educators are encouraged to use these recommendations and resources in their curricula and training. Palliative care is critical care.

A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: From February 25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total views=332). User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD 14.4) users per day in this period as compared to the previous weeks (mean 26.4, SD 9.8; P<.001). In addition, session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period (P<.001). In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the app. On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus-related information seemed to be an effective and time-saving communication channel within our institution during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice.

Furthermore, the ROX index (ie, the ratio of SpO2 /FIO2 to breathing frequency) has been validated to predict high-flow nasal cannula failure in subjects under spontaneous breathing. However, these indices have not been tested in subjects with COVID-19 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. This study aims to verify the correlation between both the ROX index and SpO2 /FIO2 with PaO2 /FIO2 and the ratio of PaO2 /FIO2 to breathing frequency, and to determine the accuracy of the indices that use SpO2 for the prediction of extubation failure in subjects with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020, with subjects with COVID-19 on invasive mechanical ventilation. Indices using SpO2 in the formula were compared to those using PaO2 . Additionally, the performance of the indices in predicting extubation failure was evaluated. RESULTS: This study included 69 subjects age 64.8 ± 14.6 y. There were no differences between the median values of the indices, including between the ROX index and PaO2 /FIO2 to breathing frequency (P = .40) or between PaO2 /FIO2 and SpO2 /FIO2 (P = .83). When comparing the ROX index with the PaO2 /FIO2 index to breathing frequency, they were found to be strongly correlated (R2 = 0.75 [95% CI 0.6763-0.8152], P < .001). The comparison of PaO2 /FIO2 with SpO2 /FIO2 revealed R2 = 0.70 (95% CI 0.563-0.749, P < .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the ROX index to determine extubation failure was 0.74 (P = .01), whereas for SpO2 /FIO2 it was 0.78 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The indices presented a good correlation in subjects with COVID-19 on invasive mechanical ventilation, and both the ROX index and SpO2 /FIO2 can discriminate extubation failure in this population.","de Andrade Filho, Pedro H; de Assis Brasil, Eduardo S; Costa, Ladyer G; M Sousa, Daniel Escóssia; Pereira, Talison S; Silva, João Manoel",Respir. care,648,22

We examined the availability and geographic accessibility of pharmacies across neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic composition in the thirty most populous US cities. In all cities examined, we found persistently fewer pharmacies located in Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than White or diverse neighborhoods throughout 2007-15. In 2015 there were disproportionately more pharmacy deserts in Black or Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than in White or diverse neighborhoods, including those that are not federally designated Medically Underserved Areas. These disparities were most pronounced in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. We also found that Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods were more likely to experience pharmacy closures compared with other neighborhoods. Our findings suggest that efforts to increase access to medications and essential health care services, including in response to COVID-19, should consider policies that ensure equitable pharmacy accessibility across neighborhoods in US cities. Such efforts could include policies that encourage pharmacies to locate in pharmacy deserts, including increases to Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates for pharmacies most at risk for closure.","Guadamuz, Jenny S; Wilder, Jocelyn R; Mouslim, Morgane C; Zenk, Shannon N; Alexander, G Caleb; Qato, Dima Mazen",Health Aff (Millwood),648,1

On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020, showed that the general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). CONCLUSION: Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers, and patients with mental disorders. Community mental health service systems, online mental health services, telemedicine, and other measures for patients with mental disorders may play a vital role during the pandemic.","Wang, Sanwang; Wen, Xin; Dong, Yingying; Liu, Bin; Cui, Minghu",Psychosomatics,648,23

ET-1 acts on endothelin receptors on vascular endothelial cells, sensitizes release of ATP, which then acts on P2X3 receptors on nociceptors and results in mechanical hyperalgesia. Both endothelin receptors and P2X3 receptors are present in primary sensory neuron, where it remains unclear whether there is an interaction between them. Herein, we reported that ET-1 potentiated the electrophysiological activity of P2X3 receptors in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. ET-1 concentration-dependently increased &#945;,ß-methylene-ATP (&#945;,ß-meATP)-evoked inward currents, which were mediated by P2X3 receptors. ET-1 shifted the &#945;,ß-meATP concentration-response curve upwards, with an increase of 34.38â¯±â¯4.72% in the maximal current response to &#945;,ß-meATP in the presence of ET-1. ET-1 potentiation of &#945;,ß-meATP-evoked currents was voltage-independent. ET-1 potentiated P2X3 receptor-mediated currents through endothelin-A receptors (ETAR), but not endothelin-B receptors (ETBR). ET-1 potentiation was supressed by blockade of intracellular G-protein or protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Moreover, there is a synergistic effect on mechanical allodynia induced by intraplantar injection of ET-1 and &#945;,ß-meATP in rats. Pharmacological blockade of P2X3 receptors also alleviated ET-1-induced mechanical allodynia. These results suggested that ET-1 sensitized P2X3 receptors in primary sensory neurons via an ETAR and PKC signaling pathway. Our data provide evidence that cutaneous ET-1 induced mechanical allodynia not only by increasing the release of ATP from vascular endothelial cells, but also by sensitizing P2X3 receptors on nociceptive DRG neurons.","Jin, Ying; Qiu, Chun-Yu; Wei, Shuang; Han, Lu; Liu, Ting-Ting; Hu, Wang-Ping",Neuropharmacology,648,29

The purpose of this commentary is to describe the delivery of integrative oncology clinical services and conduct of research at The Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical services transitioned from an array of in-person appointment-based services, such as acupuncture and massage, and group programs, such as yoga and nutrition seminars to a combination of live-streamed and on-demand virtual group programs and one-on-one virtual appointments for services such as acupressure and self-care massage. Group program volume grew from 2189 in-person program patient visits in the 6 months prior to onset of the COVID pandemic to 16,366 virtual (e.g., live-streamed or on-demand) patient visits in the first 6 months of the pandemic. From a research perspective, two integrative oncology studies, focused on yoga and music therapy, respectively, were transitioned from in-person delivery to a virtual format. Participant accrual to these studies increased after the transition to virtual consent and intervention delivery. Overall, our clinical and research observations at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggest that the delivery of virtual integrative oncology treatments is feasible and appealing to patients.

Deep learning methods especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in COVID-19 diagnosis in recent works. But they are efficient when the depth of network is high enough. However, the use of a deep network requires a sufficiently large training set, which is not available in practice. From the other hand, the use of a shallow CNN may not provide superior results because it is not able to rich feature extraction due to lacking enough convolutional layers. To deal with this difficulty, the contextual features reduced by convolutional filters (CFRCF) is proposed in this work. CFRCF extracts shape and textural features as contextual feature maps from the chest X-ray radiographs and abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. Morphological operators, Gabor filter banks and attribute filters are used for contextual feature extraction. Then, two convolutional filters are applied to the contextual feature cube to extract the nonlinear sub-features and hidden relationships among the contextual features. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to produce a reduced feature vector which is fed to a classifier. Support vector machine and random forest are used as classifier. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method from the recognition accuracy and running time point of view using limited training samples. More than 76% and 94% overall classification accuracy is obtained by the proposed method in CT scan and X-ray images datasets, respectively.","Imani, Maryam",Biomed Signal Process Control,648,27

METHODS: This study included 20 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad (Pakistan). Patients were categorised into the survival group and the death group according to the outcome. We retrieved demographics, clinical manifestations and signs, laboratory indicators, treatment measures and clinical outcomes from the medical record, and summarised the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 70 ± 12 years, of which 40% were male. They were admitted to the ICU 11 days after the onset of symptoms. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (19 cases, 95%), fatigue or myalgia (18 cases, 90%), fever (17 cases, 85%) and dyspnoea (16 cases, 80%). Eleven (55%) patients had underlying diseases, of which hypertension was the most common (11 cases, 55%), followed by cardiovascular disease (4 cases, 20%) and diabetes (3 cases, 15%). Six patients (30%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy and eventually died. Acute heart injury was the most common complication (19 cases, 95%). Ten (50%) patients died between 2 and 19 days after admission to the ICU. Compared with dead patients, the average body weight of surviving patients was lower (61.70 ± 2.36 vs 68.60 ± 7.15, P = .01), Glasgow Coma Scale score was higher (14.69 ± 0.70 vs 12.70 ± 2.45, P = .03), with fewer concurrent shocks (2 vs 10, P = .001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2 vs 10, P = .001). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate is high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Lower Glasgow Coma Scale, higher body weight and decreased lymphocyte count appear to be potential risk factors for the death of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU.","Gul, Noor; Usman, Umer; Ahmed, Umair; Ali, Majid; Shaukat, Aamir; Imran, Mehar Muhammad",Int J Clin Pract,648,1

We sought to assess the mental health and quality of life (QoL) of Indian HCPs, the fourth highest-burden country for COVID-19. METHOD: Using snowball sampling, we conducted an online survey in May 2020 among HCPs. Data were collected on demographics, depression, and anxiety using validated tools, quality of life, and perceived stressors. Multivariable logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to assess risk factors associated with mental health symptoms. FINDINGS: Of 197 HCPs assessed, 157 (80%) were from Maharashtra, 130 (66%) from public hospitals, 47 (24%) nurses, 66 (34%) physicians, 101 (52%) females, and 81 (41%) &#8804;30 years. Eighty-seven percent provided direct COVID-19 care with 43% caring for >10 patients/day. A large proportion reported symptoms of depression (92, 47%), anxiety (98, 50%), and low QoL (89, 45%). Odds of combined depression and anxiety were 2.37 times higher among single HCPs compared to married (95% CI: 1.03-4.96). Work environment stressors were associated with 46% increased risk of combined depression and anxiety (95% CI: 1.15-1.85). Moderate to severe depression and anxiety were independently associated with increased risk of low QoL [OR: 3.19 (95% CI: 1.30-7.84), OR: 2.84 (95% CI: 1.29-6.29)]. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of symptoms of depression and anxiety and low QoL among Indian HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prevent and treat mental health symptoms among frontline HCPs.","Suryavanshi, Nishi; Kadam, Abhay; Dhumal, Gauri; Nimkar, Smita; Mave, Vidya; Gupta, Amita; Cox, Samyra R; Gupte, Nikhil",Brain Behav,648,20

In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the ""entry receptor"" for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the ""time delay"" given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the ""exposure time"" to the ""interaction time"" (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. BACKGROUND: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the ß-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. METHODS: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. RESULTS: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","Sohail, Ayesha; Nutini, Alessandro",Prog Biophys Mol Biol,648,16

Among several strategies, drug repurposing will help to react immediately to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we have chosen two clinical trial drugs against HIV-1 protease namely, TMB607 and TMC310911 to use as the inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) enzyme. To make use of these two inhibitors as the repurposed drugs for COVID-19, it is essential to know the molecular basis of the binding mechanism of these two molecules with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. To understand the binding mechanism, we have performed molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking results indicate that both molecules form intermolecular interactions with the active site amino acids of Mpro enzyme. However, during the MD simulations, TMB607 forms strong interaction with the key amino acids of Mpro, and remains intact. The RMSD and RMSF values of both complexes were stable throughout the MD simulations. The MM-GBSA binding free energy values of both complexes are -43.7 and -34.9 kcal/mol, respectively. This in silico study proves that the TMB607 molecule binds strongly with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme and it may be suitable for the drug repurposing of COVID-19 and further drug designing.

We aim to build a stable system with highly reproducible radiomics features, which can make diagnostic performance independent of datasets bias and segmentation methods. METHOD: We applied a dataset of 267 patients including 136 malignant and 131 benign tumors from two MRI manufacturers, where 211 cases from a Philips system and 55 cases from a GE system. First, manual annotations, 3D-Unet and 2D-Unet were applied as different segmentation methods. Second, we designed and extracted 3172 features from six modalities of DCE-MRI based on BI-RADS. Third, the feature selection was conducted. Between-class distance was utilized to eliminate the effect of dataset bias caused by two machines. Concordance correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient and deviation were employed to evaluate the influence of three segmentation methods. We further eliminated features redundancy using genetic algorithm. Finally, three classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), the bagged trees and K-Nearest Neighbor were evaluated by their performance for diagnosing malignant and benign tumors. RESULTS: A total of 246 features were preserved to have high stability and reproducibility. The final feature set showed the robust performance under these factors and achieved the area under curve of 0.88, the accuracy of 0.824, the sensitivity of 0.844, the specificity of 0.807 in differentiating benign and malignant tumors with the SVM classifier using manually segmentation results. CONCLUSION: The final selected 246 features are reproducible and show little dependence on segmentation methods and data perturbation. The high stability and effectiveness of diagnosis across these factors illustrate that the preserved features can be used for prognostic analysis and help radiologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer.","Qiao, Mengyun; Li, Chengkang; Suo, Shiteng; Cheng, Fang; Hua, Jia; Xue, Dan; Guo, Yi; Xu, Jianrong; Wang, Yuanyuan",,648,16

To improve the noise robustness, we try to integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies, and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet). During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data noises. The experimental results show that WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency information, is the main advantages of our approach. The code of our DWT/IDWT layer and different WaveCNets are available at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/WaveCNet.","Li, Qiufu; Shen, Linlin; Guo, Sheng; Lai, Zhihui",IEEE Trans Image Process,648,13

For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for 'shielding', remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commission's previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed. We also discuss the limits and when a virtual assessment is not considered ethical. As the pandemic moves from a state of emergency into a 'new normal' in psychiatric services during second, or subsequent, waves, the use and place (if any) of remote assessments for detention needs to be considered.","Schölin, Lisa; Connolly, Moira; Morgan, Graham; Dunlop, Laura; Deshpande, Mayura; Chopra, Arun",J. med. ethics,648,5

Agnihotra/Yagya/ homa is a part of Indian rituals, and one of the ancient therapy of healing recommended by Ayurveda. An agnihotra is a simple form of homa. Various materials are used in this therapy like cow dung cake, rice, ghee and medicinal plants either as a firewood or Samidha, which are helpful for purification of the atmosphere resulting in prevention and control of various communicable diseases. In Ayurveda epidemic or pandemic has been described as Janapadodhwansa Rogas. And causative factors mentioned that vitiation of Vayu (air), Jala (water), Desh (area), and Kala (season). Abhishyangaja (effects of pathogens, evil forces and unhygienic condition) is also one of the causes of epidemic/ pandemic. For this reason, Ayurveda advocated sterilization of water, air, soil and atmosphere with the help of Agnihotra, i.e. Homa, Yagya, Dhupana. As Agnihotra is applied in Ayurveda for therapeutic purpose is also known as Homa therapy. Many studies showed the antimicrobial activity of smoke raises from Agnihotra.

We evaluated 3 commonly used SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays (Abbott, DiaSorin, and EUROIMMUN) for clinical sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with neutralizing antibodies, and then compared antibody kinetics during the acute phase of infection. METHODS: Three panels of samples were tested on every assay. Sensitivity was assessed using a panel of 35 specimens serially collected from 7 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Specificity was determined using 100 sera samples collected in 2018 from healthy individuals prior to the outbreak. Analytical specificity was determined using a panel of 37 samples from individuals with respiratory illnesses other than COVID-19. RESULTS: Clinical sensitivity was 91.43% (95% CI 76.94-98.20%) for Abbott, and 88.57% (95% CI 73.26-96.80%) for both DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN. Clinical specificity was 99.00% (95% CI 94.55-99.97%) for Abbott and DiaSorin and 94.00% (95% CI 87.40-97.77%) for EUROIMMUN. The IgG assays demonstrated good qualitative agreement (minimum of 94%) and good correlation between the quantitative result for each combination of assays (r2 &gt;= 0.90). The neutralizing antibody response did not necessarily follow the same temporal kinetics as the IgG response and did not necessarily correlate with IgG values. CONCLUSION: The 3 IgG antibody assays demonstrated comparable performance characteristics. Importantly, a qualitative positive IgG result obtained with any of the assays was associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies;however, neutralizing antibody concentrations did not correlate well with signal to cutoff ratios.","Rychert, J.; Couturier, M.

SAMHSA charges TTCs with building the capacity of the behavioral health workforce to provide evidence-based interventions via locally and culturally responsive training and TA. This commentary describes how, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, TTCs rapidly adapted to ensure that the behavioral health workforce had continuous access to remote training and technical assistance. TTCs use a conceptual framework that differentiates among three types of technical assistance: basic, targeted, and intensive. We define each of these types of TA and provide case examples to describe novel strategies that the TTCs used to shift an entire continuum of capacity building activities to remote platforms.

We, therefore, designed a nationwide survey to determine the main features of BC recipients and obtain a picture of the clinical use of BC for the first time in Italy, in order to understand BC demands better and identify specific fields in which to apply Patient Blood Management (PBM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide survey of all Italian Blood Establishments working as Hospital Blood Banks (HBB) was performed. Data were collected through an online report form recording information on the number and geographic area of the responding HBB, year of birth and sex of the BC recipients, and clinical indications for every unit of RBC, platelets and plasma transfused in a 24-hour period. RESULTS: On the survey date, 153/237 (64.5%) of the HBB returned 4,356 forms, reporting 7,523 transfusions. The median and mean ages of the recipients were 73 (range, 0-106) and 67.5 years, respectively; 33.0% were >80 years old and 64.9% >65 years old, with no relevant differences between males and females. Overall, 6,309 RBC units were transfused to 3,850 recipients, 66.7% of them for a medical indication and 32.4% for a surgical indication. The commonest medical indication was acquired, non-cancer-related anaemia and more than 30% of the transfusions occurred in the Emergency Department. Five hundred and sixty platelet transfusions were given to 520 recipients, 62.7% of them for prophylaxis and 28.6% for bleeding before or during an invasive procedure or surgery or for thrombocytopenia. One hundred and ninety-four patients received 654 units of plasma, 71.1% of which were for therapeutic purposes in bleeding patients. DISCUSSION: We collected a picture of blood transfusion epidemiology in Italy. The data suggest that future PBM plans should be focused on medical anaemia especially in the setting of Emergency Departments.","Facco, Giuseppina; Bennardello, Francesco; Fiorin, Francesco; Galassi, Claudia; Monagheddu, Chiara; Berti, Pierluigi; Laricchia, Raffaele; Scipioni, Cinzia; Gianotto, Giorgio; Guaschino, Roberto; Pollis, Francesca; Riganello, Gianluca; Lorusso, Luciano; Zadi, Roberto; Canzian, Antonio; Scuvera, Ilvana T; Marletto, Fabio; Misso, Saverio; Raineri, Antonino; Scelsi, Michele; Ostuni, Angelo; Visceglie, Domenico; Sodano, Maria; Peres, Eugenio; Sardella, Corrado; Pipolo, Giuseppe; Casaburi, Emilio; Capelli, Stefano; Randi, Vanda; Capponi, Matteo; Verenini, Marina; Bernardoni, Patrizia; Venturoli, Nicola; Cenacchi, Annarita; Roverini, Veronica; Vecchiato, Cinzia; Camisasca, Giovanni; De Martino, Daniel; Gaiga, Giampaolo; Pani, Mario; Tronci, Maria B; Platania, Salvatore; Vanzelli, Mauro; Tassinari, Cristina; Filomia, Domenico; Raimondi, Sonia A; Amato, Pasquale; Sessa, Francesco; Pignalosa, Orlando","Blood transfus.

We systematically reviewed evidence on the impact of the Great Recession on individuals' dietary intake globally and whether disadvantaged individuals were disproportionately affected. METHODS: We searched seven databases and relevant grey literature through June 2020. Longitudinal quantitative studies with the 2008 recession as the exposure and any measure of dietary intake (energy intake, dietary quality, and food/macronutrient consumption) as the outcome were eligible for inclusion. Eligibility was independently assessed by two reviewers. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used for quality and risk of bias assessment. We undertook a random effects meta-analysis for changes in energy intake. Harvest plots were used to display and summarise study results for other outcomes. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019135864). RESULTS: Forty-one studies including 2.6 million people met our inclusion criteria and were heterogenous in both methods and results. Ten studies reported energy intake, 11 dietary quality, 34 food intake, and 13 macronutrient consumption. The Great Recession was associated with a mean reduction of 103.0 cal per adult equivalent per day (95% Confidence Interval: - 132.1, - 73.9) in high-income countries (5 studies) and an increase of 105.5 cal per adult per day (95% Confidence Interval: 72.8, 138.2) in middle-income countries (2 studies) following random effects meta-analysis. We found reductions in fruit and vegetable intake. We also found reductions in intake of fast food, sugary products, and soft drinks. Impacts on macronutrients and dietary quality were inconclusive, though suggestive of a decrease in dietary quality. The Great Recession had greater impacts on dietary intake for disadvantaged individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The 2008 recession was associated with diverse impacts on diets. Calorie intake decreased in high income countries but increased in middle income countries. Fruit and vegetable consumption reduced, especially for more disadvantaged individuals, which may negatively affect health. Fast food, sugary products, and soft drink consumption also decreased which may confer health benefits. Implementing effective policies to mitigate adverse nutritional changes and encourage positive changes during the COVID-19 pandemic and other major economic shocks should be prioritised.","Jenkins, R.

The effect of reducing anthropogenic activities including transportation had an impact on the urban environment in terms of air quality which is shown to have improved for a number of pollutants, such as Nitrogen Dioxides (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO), based on monitoring data on the ground and from a satellite. In addition to primary pollutants CO and NOx emitted from mobile sources, PM2.5 (primary and secondary) and secondary Ozone (O3) during the lockdown period will also be analyzed using both statistical methods on air quality data and the modelling method with emission and meteorological data input to an air quality model. By estimating the decrease in traffic volume in the Sydney region, the corresponding decrease in emission input to the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System (WRF-CMAQ) air quality model is then used to estimate the effect of lockdown on the air quality especially CO, NO2, O3, and PM2.5 in the Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) of Sydney. The results from both statistical and modelling methods show that NO2, CO, and PM2.5 levels decreased during the lockdown, but O3 instead increased. However, the change in the concentration levels are small considering the large reduction of ~30% in traffic volume.","Duc, Hiep; Salter, David; Azzi, Merched; Jiang, Ningbo; Warren, Loredana; Watt, Sean; Riley, Matthew; White, Stephen; Trieu, Toan; Tzu-Chi Chang, Lisa; Barthelemy, Xavier; Fuchs, David; Nguyen, Huynh",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,12

Thirty hours postoperatively, he developed respiratory failure with altered mental status and needed admission in the intensive care unit. The chest radiography and later chest tomography raised the suspicion of a COVID-19 disease, even if our first suspicion was FES. After being carefully investigated in a dedicated COVID-19 ward and three negative RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, he returned to continue supportive treatment in the orthopedic intensive care ward. His evolution was favorable with discharge at ten days, without sequelae. In the context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, differential diagnosis has become an increasingly challenging process.

290731,290731,290731,Foreword: Research in times of pandemic COVID-19,17.530886,4.1574283,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has broader geographic spread and potentially longer lasting effects than those of previous disasters. Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 has resulted in delays for in-person health care services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) in health care at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for such delays. METHODS: As part of an internet-based survey that was distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US-based convenience sample of 2570 participants about delays in their health care resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of health care delays. In addition to all delays, we focused on the following three main types of delays, which were the primary outcomes in this study: dental, preventive, and diagnostic care delays. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to determine which factors were associated with health care delays. RESULTS: The top reported barrier to receiving health care was the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection (126/374, 33.6%). Almost half (1227/2570, 47.7%) of the participants reported experiencing health care delays. Among those who experienced health care delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced (921/1227, 75.1%), the top three reported types of care that were affected by delays included dental (351/921, 38.1%), preventive (269/921, 29.2%), and diagnostic (151/921, 16.4%) care. The logistic regression models showed that age (P<.001), gender identity (P<.001), education (P=.007), and self-reported worry about general health (P<.001) were significantly associated with experiencing health care delays. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care. However, this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing based on the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, and although there was trend between race and delays (people of color experienced fewer delays than White participants), it was not significant (P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: The lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This study addresses the demand side of health care delays by exploring the determinants of such delays. More research on health care delays during the pandemic is needed, including research on their short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, mental health, people's quality of life, and the experience of pain.","Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Rice, Dylan R; Ghoneima, Hana; McKowen, Anna Laura W; Anderson, Nicholas; Wootton, Angie R; Veldhuis, Cindy",J Med Internet Res,648,24

STUDY DESIGN: The study design is an observational study of consecutive COVID-19 cases that were treated in Mexican healthcare units and hospitals between February 27 and April 27, 2020. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical and sociodemographic data were analysed from outpatients and hospitalised patients. Cox regression models were used to analyse the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: In total, 15,529 patients with COVID-19 were characterised; 62.6% of patients were aged older than 40 years, 57.8% were men and 1.4% were of indigenous ethnicity. A high proportion had a history of diabetes (18.4%), hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (20.9%). Among hospitalised patients, 11.2% received health care in the intensive care unit. Advanced age, male sex, indigenous ethnicity and having a history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, were significantly associated with a high risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diabetes and obesity were the comorbidities most highly associated with death through the models used in this study. Moreover, living in Mexico City and Mexico State (where there is easy access to medical services) and walking (rather than driving or getting public transport) were negatively associated with mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, hypertension and obesity combined with older age, male sex and indigenous ethnicity increase the risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mexican population. It is recommended that the incidence of COVID-19 is monitored in indigenous communities, and access to health services is increased nationwide.","Prado-Galbarro, F-J; Sanchez-Piedra, C; Gamiño-Arroyo, A E; Cruz-Cruz, C",Public Health,648,20

In recent years, a method for visualizing diagnostic grounds called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) has been proposed in the area of diagnostic images using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). As far as we have investigated, there are no reports of visualization of the diagnostic basis in bone scintigraphy. Our aim is to visualize the area of interest of DCNN, in addition to developing an algorithm to classify and diagnose whether RI accumulation on the ribs is bone metastasis or trauma using only anterior bone scan view of thorax. Material and Methods: For this retrospective study, we used 838 patients who underwent bone scintigraphy to search for bone metastases at our institution. A frontal chest image of bone scintigraphy was used to create the algorithm. We used 437 cases with bone metastases on the ribs and 401 cases with abnormal RI accumulation due to trauma.

FRIL can neutralize 11 representative human and avian influenza strains at low nanomolar concentrations, and intranasal administration of FRIL is protective against lethal H1N1 infection in mice. FRIL binds preferentially to complex-type N-glycans and neutralizes viruses that possess complex-type N-glycans on their envelopes. As a homotetramer, FRIL is capable of aggregating influenza particles through multivalent binding and trapping influenza virions in cytoplasmic late endosomes, preventing their nuclear entry. Remarkably, FRIL also effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, preventing viral protein production and cytopathic effect in host cells.

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib disease burden in Japan. METHODS: Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model (susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster doses. RESULTS: While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the next 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden.","Kitano, Taito; Aoki, Hirosato",Vaccine,648,1

This applies to many domains, including airplane boarding and seat assignments. As airlines are considering their passengers' safety during the pandemic, boarding methods should be evaluated both in terms of social distancing norms and the resulting efficiency for the airlines. The present paper analyzes the impact of a series of restrictions that have been imposed or mooted worldwide on the boarding methods used by the airlines, featuring the use of jet-bridges and one-door boarding. To compare the efficacy of classical airplane boarding methods with respect to new social distancing norms, five metrics were used to evaluate their performance. One metric is the time to complete the boarding of the airplane. The other four metrics concern passenger health and reflect the potential exposure to the virus from other passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g., headrests and luggage) touched by passengers. We use the simulation platform in NetLogo to test six common boarding methods under various conditions. The back-to-front by row boarding method results in the longest time to complete boarding but has the advantage of providing the lowest health risk for two metrics. Those two metrics are based on passengers potentially infecting those passengers previously seated in the rows they traverse. Interestingly, those two risks are reduced for most boarding methods when the social distance between adjacent passengers advancing down the aisle is increased, thus indicating an unanticipated benefit stemming from this form of social distancing. The modified reverse pyramid by half zone method provides the shortest time to the completing boarding of the airplane and-along with theWilMA boarding method-provides the lowest health risk stemming from potential infection resulting from seat interferences. Airlines have the difficult task of making tradeoffs between economic productivity and the resulting impact on various health risks.","Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian; Delcea, Camelia; Milne, R.

We sought to characterize the changes in testing accessibility at UCCs between March and August 2020 on the basis of testing availability (including rapid antigen testing), wait time for test results, cost of visits, and cost of tests. METHODS: Data were collected using a secret shopper methodology. Researchers contacted 250 UCCs in 10 states. Investigators used a standardized script to survey centers on their COVID-19 testing availability and policies. UCCs were initially contacted in March and re-called in August. T-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to identify differences between March and August data and differences by center classification. RESULTS: Our results indicate that both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect COVID-19 genetic material and rapid antigen COVID-19 tests have increased in availability. However, wait times for PCR test results have significantly increased to an average of 5.79 days. Additionally, a high proportion of UCCs continue to charge for tests and visits and no significant decrease was found in the proportion of UCCs that charge for COVID-19 testing from March to August. Further, no state reported a majority of UCCs with rapid testing available, indicating an overall lack of rapid testing. CONCLUSIONS: From March to August, COVID-19 testing availability gradually improved. However, many barriers lie in access to COVID-19 testing, including testing costs, visit costs, and overall lack of availability of rapid testing in the majority of UCCs. Despite the passage of the CARES Act, these results suggest that there is room for additional policy to improve accessibility to testing, specifically rapid testing.","Yousman, Laurie C; Khunte, Akshay; Hsiang, Walter; Jain, Siddharth; Forman, Howard; Wiznia, Daniel",BMC Health Serv Res,648,16

There is limited data describing the course of liver injury occurrence in patients with different disease severity, and the causes and risk factors are unknown. We aim to investigate the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals (Zhejiang, China). From January 19, 2020 to February 20, 2020, patients confirmed with COVID-19 (≥18 years) and without liver injury were enrolled and divided into non-critically ill and critically ill groups. The incidence and characteristics of liver injury were compared between the two groups. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and treatment outcomes between patients with or without liver injury were compared within each group. The multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors for liver injury. Results: The mean age of 131 enrolled patients was 51.2 years (standard deviation [SD]: 16.1 years), and 70 (53.4%) patients were male. A total of 76 patients developed liver injury (mild, 40.5%; moderate, 15.3%; severe, 2.3%) with a median occurrence time of 10.0 days. Critically ill patients had higher and earlier occurrence (81.5 vs. 51.9%, 12.0 vs. 5.0 days; p &lt; 0.001), greater injury severity (p &lt; 0.001), and slower recovery (50.0 vs. 61.1%) of liver function than non-critically ill patients. Multivariable regression showed that the number of concomitant medications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.21) and the combination treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.44–9.52) were risk factors for liver injury in non-critically ill patients. The metabolism of arbidol can be significantly inhibited by lopinavir/ritonavir in vitro (p &lt; 0.005), which may be the underlying cause of drug-related liver injury. Liver injury was related to increased length of hospital stay (mean difference [MD]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3–5.2) and viral shedding duration (MD: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0–4.9). Conclusions: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffered earlier occurrence, greater injury severity, and slower recovery from liver injury than non-critically ill patients. Drug factors were related to liver injury in non-critically ill patients. Liver injury was related to prolonged hospital stay and viral shedding duration in patients with COVID-19.

Methods: From March 2019 to October 2019, 40 patients were randomly divided into two groups: dexmedetomidine group (group D) and control group (group C). Except recording the general condition of the patients in both groups preoperatively and intraoperatively, the oxygenation index (OI) and alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference (A-aDO2) were monitored at admission (T0), immediately after one-lung ventilation (T1), 0.5 h after one-lung ventilation (T2), and 15 minutes after inhaling air before leaving the room (T3). The content of IL-8 in arterial blood was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at T0 and T2, and the expression of AQP1 protein in isolated lung tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) was used as the index of lung injury. Results: There was no significant difference in the general condition before and during operation between the two groups. There was no significant difference in arterial blood IL-8 content between the two groups at the T0 time point, but the arterial blood IL-8 content at the T2 time point was significantly higher than that at the T0 time point, especially in group C. The results of immunohistochemistry and Western blot showed that the expression level of AQP1 protein in the isolated lung tissue of group D was significantly higher than that of group C (P < 0 05). At T3, the OI of group D was significantly higher than that of group C, and the A-aDO2 of group D was significantly lower than that of group C (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative PPCs between the two groups. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine can reduce the level of plasma IL-8 and upregulate the expression of AQP1 in the lung tissue of patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery under one-lung ventilation, but it has no significant effect on the incidence of postoperative PPCs. Dexmedetomidine can be safely used in thoracoscopic surgery and has a certain protective effect on lung injury.","Meng, Jun; Lv, Qin; Yao, Jiaxiang; Wang, Siyu; Yang, Kun",Biomed Res Int,648,16

Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response. METHODS: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed using luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A subset of samples was tested both with and without heat inactivation. RESULTS: At >14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike protein antibodies appearing between days 8 and 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, compared with immunocompetent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Burbelo, Peter D; Riedo, Francis X; Morishima, Chihiro; Rawlings, Stephen; Smith, Davey; Das, Sanchita; Strich, Jeffrey R; Chertow, Daniel S; Davey, Richard T; Cohen, Jeffrey I",J Infect Dis,648,6

However, intense focus and resources have been diverted to COVID-19 patients, leaving patients with diseases other than COVID-19 somehow neglected due to limited access to routine health care. And whether routine thoracic surgery service is safe in low risk areas of COVID-19 infection is still unknown. We hereby retrospectively analyzed the quantity and quality of thoracic surgeries performed by a single team from Shanghai Chest Hospital between January and May 2020, compared with the corresponding period last year. Results suggested that comparable qualities of diagnosis and surgical treatment as well as perioperative outcomes were safely and successfully achieved. Total number of surgical procedures gradually increased and surpassed the corresponding period last year when the situation of COVID-19 has been in good control in Shanghai by April. Importantly, neither medical staffs nor patients were diagnosed of COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, although COVID-19 has made significant impact on elective surgery for thoracic diseases, it is safe and feasible to carry out routine thoracic surgery services in low risk areas, provided that careful screening of COVID and thorough protection of medical staffs and patients are taken.

The criterion of the Legal Education Board in ranking (i.e., those that consistently have more than 63 bar examination takers in the last four years) was used in determining the subject law schools. The authors obtained, on a rolling basis, copies of the academic policies released by law schools during the lockdown. While big law schools addressed a variety of challenges as a result of the pandemic, three main themes emerged from thematic analysis of the said academic policies, namely: (a) the problem of continuing instruction;(b) the problem of evaluating student learning;and (c) the problem of accommodating changes within the existing academic calendar. In the first theme, the response is to shift to online distance learning (ODL), particularly the asynchronous mode. In addition, most law schools require, at the minimum, the sending of a suggested study outline in case the faculty cannot conduct either mode of distance learning. In the second theme, law schools introduced ways to maintain the integrity of onsite examinations, and revamped their existing grading systems. Four dominant grading systems were identified. The problem in the third theme was resolved when the Philippine Supreme Court decided to postpone the bar examination on November 2021.

There have been social historical inquiries investigating the organic relationship between medicine and society, and there has been a study overcoming the traditional nationalistic dichotomous approach. A social historical perspective has been used to analyze the issues of knowledge and politics; the time period of its application was clustered around the colonial period. The condition of colonialism is both important and convenient for analyzing how and to what extent medicine, which is usually deemed neutral, contains a will of authority. Building on existing research, an attempt to understand a subject based on a combination of various elements or from various angles is needed. Accumulating empirical data is important to further advance related research. It is necessary to verify the accuracy of basic facts and build up verified facts. Sometimes theories are applied to research on the history of medicine. However, they are merely a passive application of existing theories and fail to lead to modification and fortification of the theories based on the case of Korea, let alone the establishment of an independent theory. Accumulating empirical studies would help create a unique theory for the Korean case. To establish a new theory, characteristics of the Korean case need to be identified, which have been formed by the Korean tradition. An understanding of the modern situation inevitably leads to an interest in the tradition. Another necessary effort is to expand territories, and one of them would be to develop interests in patients and consumers.","Park, Yunjae",Uisahak,648,24

To characterize the dynamics of their growth or spread, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ has received considerable attention. In the context of infectious diseases, it is usually defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by an infectious case in a completely susceptible population. Typically $R_0>1$ indicates that an outbreak is expected to continue and to grow exponentially, while $R_0<1$ usually indicates that an outbreak is expected to terminate after some time. In this work, we show that fluctuations of the dynamics in time can lead to a continuation of outbreaks even when the expected number of secondary cases from a single case is below $1$. Such fluctuations are usually neglected in modelling of infectious diseases by a set of ordinary differential equations, such as the classic SIR model.

The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 µg. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model. This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens.","Li, Entao; Yan, Feihu; Huang, Pei; Chi, Hang; Xu, Shengnan; Li, Guohua; Liu, Chuanyu; Feng, Na; Wang, Hualei; Zhao, Yongkun; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu",Viruses,648,16

The aim of this study to investigate the prognostic value of right ventricular (RV) strain in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients admitted to the emergency room for COVID-19 between 1 and 30 April were included in this study. ECG was performed on hospital admission and was evaluated as blind. RV strain was defined as in the presence of one or more of the following ECG findings: complete or incomplete right ventricular branch block (RBBB), negative T wave in V1-V4 and presence of S1Q3T3. The main outcome measure was death during hospitalization. The relationship of variables to the main outcome was evaluated by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 324 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study; majority of patients were male (187, 58%) and mean age was 64.2 ± 14.1. Ninety-five patients (29%) had right ventricular strain according to ECG and 66 patients (20%) had died. After a multivariable survival analysis, presence of RV strain on ECG (OR: 4.385, 95%CI: 2.226-8.638, p < 0.001), high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), d-dimer and age were independent predictors of mortality.

It was initially reported that, in patients with serious progression of COVID-19, there was an increased mortality in those that had a history of suffering arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. A proportion of these patients also had in common that they used ACE-I, which alerted the medical community on the potential risk in coexisting with COVID-19. However, in more recent case-control studies, they found that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE-I, does not increase the risk of COVID-19 or require hospital admission due to this cause. Several scientific journals have provided access to preliminary reports, leaving the use of such information at the discretion of the medical and scientific community for promoting the development of studies that might confirm these preclinical and epidemiological findings experimentally. These may finally have an impact on the clinical practice decisions, in order to benefit patients with COVID-19. In this literature review, the different effects mediated by ACE-I that could be related to the immune response during the infection and transmission of COVID-19 are examined, gathering available evidence that evaluates whether, in reality, they represent a risk or if on the other hand, they confer a protector effect.","Vallejo Ardila, Dora Lucía; Tamayo Cáceres, Yenny Rocío; Munive, Abraham Alí",Rev.

This study aims to examine the severity of this problem by evaluating deep learning (DL) classification models trained to identify COVID-19-positive patients on 3D computed tomography (CT) datasets from different countries. We collected one dataset at UT Southwestern (UTSW), and three external datasets from different countries: CC-CCII Dataset (China), COVID-CTset (Iran), and MosMedData (Russia). We divided the data into 2 classes: COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. We trained nine identical DL-based classification models by using combinations of the datasets with a 72% train, 8% validation, and 20% test data split. The models trained on a single dataset achieved accuracy/area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values of 0.87/0.826 (UTSW), 0.97/0.988 (CC-CCCI), and 0.86/0.873 (COVID-CTset) when evaluated on their own dataset.

However, the performance dropped close to an AUC of 0.5 (random guess) for all models when evaluated on a different dataset outside of its training datasets. Including the MosMedData, which only contained positive labels, into the training did not necessarily help the performance on the other datasets.

METHODS: Israel declared COVID-19 a national emergency on 19 March 2020. This study examined daily hospital admissions to our three general paediatric wards during the COVID-19 lockdown period from 20 March to 18 April 2020. These 258 admissions were compared with the 4217 admissions from the period immediately before this, 1 February to 19 March 2020, plus 1 February to 18 April in 2018 and 2019. We also compared why patients were admitted during the study period, and any pre-existing conditions, with 638 children hospitalised during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The mean number of daily hospitalisations during the COVID-19 lockdown period was 8.6, which was 59% lower than the 20.9 recorded during the other three periods before COVID-19. There was a significant decrease in the number of patients admitted with infectious (74%) and non-infectious (44%) aetiologies from 2019 to 2020, and these occurred among patients with (58%), and without (55%), pre-existing medical conditions. CONCLUSION: The Israeli COVID-19 lockdown had a dramatic effect on admissions to the paediatric wards of a tertiary hospital.","Gavish, Rachel; Levinsky, Yoel; Dizitzer, Yotam; Bilavsky, Efraim; Livni, Gilat; Pirogovsky, Avinoam; Scheuerman, Oded; Krause, Irit",Acta paediatr. scand,648,16

The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as it's initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor. The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients. This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients. This review has been organized to put forward the positive aruments and implications in support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy as a necessary approach for treating COVID-19 patients.,"Rajarshi, Keshav; Chatterjee, Aroni; Ray, Shashikant",Biotechnol Rep (Amst),648,16

For the present moment humankind must cope with important changes and regulation which have massively impacted our daily lives. Social distancing measures taken in many schools and universities for limiting exposure and transmission coronavirus run counter how the education process is operating usually. The question that this context rises is: how people in general and especially young people are coping with this lack of physical activity and physical education changes? Material and Methods In this study were involved 176 male university students, 19.3 +/- 0.67 years of age, divided in two equal groups: the first one measured in 2018, with regular physical activity in face-to-face mode and the second one measured in the end of 2020, after almost one year of remote learning. Results In between the two measurements the BMI increased with 1.8 kg/m(2), primarily because weight gain. It results that in just two years the percentage of young men with weight issues had a significant increase from 19.3% to 33%. Applying Bonferroni correction for two tests and p &lt; 0.05 it turns out that the two data samples are different with a statistical confidence &gt;95%. Conclusions: Under the pandemic circumstances the energy balance between food consumption and physical activity was seriously disturbed, resulting in an increased BMI.

We previously showed that androgen receptor overexpression inhibited fear memory in male mice and increased expression of the histone variant H2A.Z, a novel epigenetic regulator of memory. Here, we used conditional-inducible H2A.Z knockout mice to investigate how H2A.Z deletion influences androgenic regulation of fear memory. We showed that conditional inducible H2A.Z deletion blocked memory-enhancing effects of androgen depletion (induced by gonadectomy), and of pharmacological inhibition of the androgen receptor with flutamide. Similarly, H2A.Z deletion blocked the memory-reducing effects of DHT, and DHT treatment in cultured hippocampal neurons altered H2A.Z binding, suggesting that AR is an H2A.Z regulator in neurons. Overall, these data show that fear memory formation is regulated by interactions between sex hormones and epigenetic factors, which has implications for sex differences in fear-related disorders.","Ramzan, Firyal; Baumbach, Jennet; Monks, Ashley D; Zovkic, Iva B",Neurobiol Learn Mem,648,3

It is essential to also understand generational differences in psychosocial impacts to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviors, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of COVID-related concerns during Wave 1 of COVID-19 in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 2 Canadian population-based data sets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N = 4,627; March 29 to April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health (N = 45,989; April 24 to May 11, 2020). MEASURES: We categorized generational age group. Participants self-reported changes in behaviors and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: There are generational differences in behavioral responses to the pandemic. Adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were comparable across groups, while changes in maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger age groups, particularly Millennials (15 to 34 years old). COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X (35 to 54 years old) exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behavior. Results also revealed that the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety is among Millennials (36.0%; severe anxiety = 15.7%), and the younger generations have the highest rates of COVID-related concerns.

METHODS: This is the prospective study of 2403 patients hospitalised at 13 hospitals within the COVID-19 epicentres of the Iran. These patients were treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, favipiravir and remdesivir alone or in combination with azithromycin. The primary outcome of the study was incidence of critical QTc prolongation, and secondary outcomes were incidences of TdP and death. RESULTS: Of the 2403 patients, 2365 met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome of QTc &#8805; 500 ms and &#8710;QTc &#8805; 60 ms was observed in 11.2% and 17.6% of the patients, respectively. The secondary outcomes of TdP and death were reported in 0.38% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively. The risk of critical QT prolongation increased in the presence of female gender, history of heart failure, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin combination therapy, simultaneous furosemide or beta-blocker therapy and acute renal or hepatic dysfunction. However, the risk of TdP was predicted by treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, simultaneous amiodarone or furosemide administration and hypokalaemia during treatment. CONCLUSION: This cohort showed significant QTc prolongation with all COVID-19 medications studied, however, life-threatening arrhythmia of TdP occurred rarely. Among the repurposed drugs studied, hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir alone or in combination with azithromycin clearly demonstrated to increase the risk of critical QT prolongation and/or TdP.","Haghjoo, Majid; Golipra, Reza; Kheirkhah, Jalal; Golabchi, Allahyar; Shahabi, Javad; Oni-Heris, Saeed; Sami, Ramin; Tajmirriahi, Marzieh; Saravi, Mehrdad; Khatami, Mozhdeh; Varnasseri, Mehran; Kiarsi, Mohammadreza; Hejazi, Seyed Fakhreddin; Yousefzadeh Rahaghi, Mojtaba; Taherkhani, Maryam; Ashraf, Haleh; Keshmiri, Mohammad Sadegh; Akbarzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Bozorgi, Ali; Mottaghizadeh, Fateme; Hedayat, Behnam; Heidarali, Mona; Hajhossein Talasaz, Azita",Int J Clin Pract,648,24

Stroke leadership identified select recipients of Alteplase to have care safely de-escalated from ICU to stepdown status earlier than the traditional protocol allowed. Per previous protocol, all stroke patients recovered in ICU for 24 hours post- Alteplase with 36 neurological and vital sign assessments completed. Acting upon the need to ensure patient safety and create inpatient ICU bed availability, the multidisciplinary stroke leadership team created the Fast Track Alteplase Protocol. Goals: Project goals included decreasing ICU utilization and minimizing nursing encounters at the patient bedside to decrease potential COVID-19 exposures. Methods: Protocol qualifications include both pre-Alteplase NIH Stroke Scale scores less than 10 and no large vessel occlusions or flow limiting stenosis present on imaging. Once in the protocol, to qualify for transfer out of ICU, an NIH Stroke Scale score less than 10 throughout ICU stay, noncontrast head CT or MRI to evaluate infarct burden, not require continuous anti-hypertensive medications to maintain systolic blood pressure cap, and not demonstrate hemodynamic or respiratory concerns must be achieved and completed. We developed education for nurses and physicians in ED, ICU, and stepdown patient care areas and tip sheets to guide nursing care and documentation associated with the new protocol. Electronic orders were quickly developed and integrated as a new subphase specific to the Fast Track Alteplase Protocol within an existing stroke order set. Results: The protocol decreased the number of encounters between nursing and patients from 36 to 12 interactions (66.7%) and planned time in the ICU from 24 to 12 hours (50%). The median time comparison of ICU length of stay for Fast Track vs. traditional protocol was 12 hours and 26 min vs35 hours and 15 minutes respectively. Conclusion: The protocol achieved both goals of decreasing the amount of time stroke patients arein the ICU and number of nursing encounters reducing the possibility of patient and staff exposure toCOVID-19.","Cook, S.

As a result, in North America and elsewhere, older adults have been strongly advised to shelter in place. Older adults also represent the fastest growing segment of licensed drivers. OBJECTIVE: We examined the change in injuries and fatalities sustained by younger and older drivers and pedestrians during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that adults ages 80 years and over would have a proportionally larger reduction than the other drivers and pedestrians. METHODS: Using a cohort design, we compared the proportion of drivers and pedestrians involved in injuries and fatalities attributable to individuals aged 80 years and over, as recorded in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (Canada) database, between the 30 days prior to shelter-in-place related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 30 days. By way of comparison, we conducted a similar comparison for younger age cohorts (16-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65-79 years). RESULTS: Drivers aged 80 years and over represented 21 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days prior to March 17, 2020 (95 % CI: 15-29), and 8 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days beginning on that date (95 % CI: 2-20), a 64.7 % reduction (exp (ß) post 0.353, 95 % CI 0.105-0.892). Drivers in the 35-54 year age range underwent a significant but smaller reduction of 22.9 %; no significant changes were seen for drivers in other age groups, or for pedestrians of any age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The physical distancing measures that aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a marked reduction in driver injuries and fatalities in the oldest old, illustrating the impact of physical distancing recommendations in this population. The excess mortality burden faced by the oldest adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, by direct exposure to the virus, may be indirectly mitigated by the reduction in road-related deaths in this cohort.","Rapoport, Mark J; Chee, Justin N; Aljenabi, Nadia; Byrne, Patrick A; Naglie, Gary; Ilari, Frances; Elzohairy, Yoassry; Vingilis, Evelyn; Mulsant, Benoit H",Accid Anal Prev,648,23

In particular, human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) and endothelial-differentiated hGMSCs (e-hGMSCs) exposed to LPS-G showed upregulation of p300 and downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), proteins associated with DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The co-treatment of AA and LPS-G showed a physiological expression of p300 and DNMT1 in hGMSCs and e-hGMSCs. Moreover, the inflammatory process triggered by LPS-G was demonstrated by evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their intracellular localization. AA exposure re-established the physiological ROS levels. Despite the limitations of in vitro study, these findings collectively expand our knowledge regarding the molecular pathways involved in periodontal disease, and suggest the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the development of periodontitis.","Pizzicannella, Jacopo; Marconi, Guya Diletta; Guarnieri, Simone; Fonticoli, Luigia; Della Rocca, Ylenia; Konstantinidou, Fani; Rajan, Thangavelu Soundara; Gatta, Valentina; Trubiani, Oriana; Diomede, Francesca",Histochem. cell biol,648,20

METHODS: The clinical records of 198 patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders hospitalized in the Dr. Rafael Serrano Psychiatric Hospital in Puebla during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico were analyzed for psychiatric or neurologic diagnosis, gender, age, medical diagnosis, and COVID-19 prevalence. For patients with COVID-19, the effects of gender, and medical diagnosis were explored. RESULTS: There was an increased COVID-19 prevalence in the studied population (43.94%), compared to the national Mexican (~0.21-0.63%) and worldwide average in the general population (~0.13-4.28%). However, the mortality rate (5.75%) was lower than the reported in Mexico (11.28-13.55%), which was higher than the worldwide average (2.95-4.98%). We detected increased COVID-19 prevalence in patients with comorbidities (OR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-1, P = 0.0447). Moreover, patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have a decreased predisposition to COVID-19 (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8; P = 0.0250), as opposed to patients with intellectual disability which are predisposed to COVID-19 (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8; P = 0.0434), in comparison with the rest of the hospital population. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with psychiatric disorders is increased compared to the general population, however, a lower mortality rate was detected. Also, an increased risk of COVID-19 was detected in patients with comorbidities. Interestingly, the observed variation in COVID-19 prevalence in patients with schizophrenia and intellectual disability was not associated with age or other specific medical diagnoses.","Rivas-Ramírez, Ángel Roberto; Tendilla-Beltrán, Hiram; Gómez-Mendoza, Laura Eréndira; Loaiza, Guillermo; Flores, Gonzalo",Int J Clin Pract,648,20

Methods Complete postmortem examination was performed according to standard procedures in a regular autopsy suite using personal protective equipment including N95 masks, goggles and disposable gowns. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs. Results A 47-year-old man with a medical history of well controlled hypertension and dyslipidaemia died after long hours of transportation for medical care in a hospital in Lagos. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on ante- and postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs. Autopsy revealed pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and hypovolaemic shock. Conclusions Autopsy can be performed on decedents who died from or with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low resource environment such as ours. A standard autopsy room was used while deploying recommended infection prevention control and regular decontamination. The clinical details, autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation were consistent with a COVID-19 related pathology. While the decedent had ‘controlled’ co-morbidity, he succumbed to multi-organ failure occasioned by shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.","Olalekan Keshinro, Samuel Awodele Awolola Nicholas Adedotun Adebayo Luqman Bamidele Mutiu Wasiu Akeem Saka Babatunde Adeshina Abdus-Salam Ismail",Human Pathology: Case Reports,648,11

In essense, every study proposes a different mechanism. Here, an in situ spectroelectrochemical methodology is used to unambiguously demonstrate that reversible proton-coupled MnO2 -to-Mn2+ conversion is the main charge storage mechanism occurring at MnO2 cathodes for a range of slightly acidic Al3+ -based aqueous electrolytes, with the Al3+ hexaaquo complex playing the key role of proton donor. In Zn/MnO2 assemblies, this mechanism is associated with high gravimetric capacities and discharge potentials, up to 560 mAh g-1 and 1.65 V respectively, attractive efficiencies (CE > 99.5% and EE > 82%) and excellent cyclability (almost 100% capacity retention over 1 400 cycles at 2 A g-1 ). Finally, a critical analysis of the data previously published on MnOx cathodes in Al3+ -based aqueous electrolytes is conducted to conclude on a universal charge storage mechanism, i.e., the reversible electrodissolution/electrodeposition of MnO2 .","Balland, Véronique; Mateos, Mickaël; Singh, Arvinder; Harris, Kenneth D; Laberty-Robert, Christel; Limoges, Benoît",Small,648,1

The aim of this study is to minimize the number of deceased keeping a minimal cost of mask advertising and screening. The model is proved to be well-posed and to have an invariant region. Also, a thorough study of the dynamics is effected and the basic reproduction number is used to study the stability of the steady states of the model. As for the optimal control analysis, the existence of an optimal control was checked. Then its characterization was carried out using Pontryagin's minimum principle. Numerical simulations are conducted after that with different values of maximal screening for comparison. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations both reveal that the optimal pair of strategies contribute enormously in lowering the number of infected and dead individuals. Although zero infection is not achieved in the population, this study implies that carrying an optimal approach constitutes a major step in controlling the spread of the disease to the barest minimum that can buy time for middle and low-income countries to carry on with their vaccination strategies.","Bouhali, Amira; Aribi, Walid Ben; Miled, Slimane Ben; Kebir, Amira",,648,5

Hemodialysis patients are an especially vulnerable subgroup of the general population. However, there are only a few reports on the course of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis patients. CASE REPORT: We describe in depth the clinical, analytical, and radiological details of 9 hemodialysis patients from a single center in Madrid (Spain) diagnosed with COVID-19. Furthermore, we describe and discuss the therapeutic aspects and the patients' outcomes. DISCUSSION: We present one of the first case series of chronic hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Between March 14 and April 8, 2020, out of 76 prevalent patients in our hemodialysis unit, 9 (11.8%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever (77.8%), asthenia (77.8%), cough (55.6%), and dyspnea (33.3%). A total of 3 patients developed severe pneumonia, whereas 4 patients developed mild pneumonia. In 2 patients, no pathologic changes were found on chest radiography. All patients presented lymphopenia. While 6 (66.7%) patients required hospitalization, none of them was admitted to intensive care unit. The most common treatments used were azithromycin (100%), hydroxychloroquine (66.7%), lopinavir/ritonavir (55.6%) and ß-interferon (22.2%). In general, we observed a mild to moderate severity of disease in our case series. One patient died, however due to a cause not related to COVID-19.","de la Flor Merino, José Carlos; Valga Amado, Francisco; Marschall, Alexander; Linares Grávalos, Tania; Canepa-Escaro, Fabrizio; Ruiz Cícero, Elisa; Albarracín Sierra, Cristina; Gallegos Bayas, Gioconda; Rodeles Del Pozo, Miguel",Clin. nephrol,648,15

In this work, we aim at informing interventions to limit the spread of the contagion and prepare against any future outbreaks by developing a behavioral framework to interpret and prescribe both the individual and large-scale uptake of non-pharmaceutical measures. First, we analyze the barriers and facilitators to adherence to protective behaviors according to a three-term contingency by exploring potential gaps in terms of setting stimuli, motivating operations, delayed consequences, and positive or negative consequences. We explore their roles in the likelihood of individual compliance to protective behaviors, taking physical distancing as an example of functional analysis. Second, we interpret contagion control as the cumulative effect of large-scale adherence to protective behaviors. We explore the interrelations between societal problems caused or amplified by similar behaviors presented by many individuals and the coordination of agents or agencies aiming at promoting large-scale behavioral change. Then, we highlight the potential of developing a behavioral vaccine, and practical steps for applying it to promote sustainable cultural change that may protect against health, social, and economic losses in future outbreaks.","Couto, Kalliu Carvalho; Moura Lorenzo, Flora; Tagliabue, Marco; Henriques, Marcelo Borges; Freitas Lemos, Roberta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,13

In this paper, we examine the factors contributing to the cross-cultural variation in vaccine attitudes, measured by levels of 1) general vaccine hesitancy, 2) trust in vaccines, and 3) COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. MethodsWe examined the relative effect of conspiracy mentality, belief in COVID-19 conspiracies, and belief in science on the above-mentioned vaccine attitudes in the UK (n= 1533), US (n= 1550), and Turkey (n= 1567) through a quota-sampled online survey to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, and education level. ResultsWe found that belief in COVID-19 conspiracies and conspiracy mentality were the strongest predictors of general vaccine hesitancy across all three countries. Belief in science had the largest positive effect on general vaccine trust and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Although participants in Turkey demonstrated the lowest level of vaccine trust, their belief in science score was significantly higher than participants in the US, suggesting that belief in science cannot explain the cross-cultural variation in vaccine trust. The mean levels of conspiracy mentality and agreement with COVID-19 conspiracies were consistent with the country-level differences in general and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Demographic variables did not predict vaccine attitudes as much as belief in conspiracies and science. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that cross-cultural variation in vaccine hesitancy, vaccine trust, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates are mainly driven by differences in the prevalence of conspiratorial thinking across countries.","Salali, Gul Deniz; Uysal, Mete Sefa",,648,15

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused surgeons the world over to re-evaluate their approach to surgical procedures given concerns over the risk of aerosolization of viral particles and exposure of operating room staff to infection. International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case. A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large. Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.","Chadi, Sami A; Guidolin, Keegan; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Sharkawy, Abdu; Spinelli, Antonino; Quereshy, Fayez A; Okrainec, Allan",Ann Surg,648,1

RESULTS: Of 193 patients who had gynecologic cancer and COVID-19, 67 (34.7%) were Black, and 126 (65.3%) were non-Black. Black patients were more likely to require hospitalization compared with non-Black patients (71.6% [48 of 67] vs 46.0% [58 of 126]; P = .001). Of 34 (17.6%) patients who died from COVID-19, 14 (41.2%) were Black. Among those who were hospitalized, compared with non-Black patients, Black patients were more likely to: have &#8805;3 comorbidities (81.1% [30 of 37] vs 59.2% [29 of 49]; P = .05), to reside in Brooklyn (81.0% [17 of 21] vs 44.4% [12 of 27]; P = .02), to live with family (69.4% [25 of 36] vs 41.6% [37 of 89]; P = .009), and to have public insurance (79.6% [39 of 49] vs 53.4% [39 of 73]; P = .006). In multivariable analysis, among patients aged <65 years, Black patients were more likely to require hospitalization compared with non-Black patients (odds ratio, 4.87; 95% CI, 1.82-12.99; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Although Black patients represented only one-third of patients with gynecologic cancer, they accounted for disproportionate rates of hospitalization (>45%) and death (>40%) because of COVID-19 infection; younger Black patients had a nearly 5-fold greater risk of hospitalization. Efforts to understand and improve these disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among Black patients are critical.","Lara, Olivia D; Smith, Maria J; Wang, Yuyan; O039,; Cearbhaill, Roisin; Blank, Stephanie V; Kolev, Valentin; Carr, Caitlin; Knisely, Anne; McEachron, Jennifer; Gabor, Lisa; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Jee, Justin; Fehniger, Julia; Lee, Yi-Chun; Isani, Sara; Liu, Mengling; Wright, Jason D; Pothuri, Bhavana",Cancer,648,20

Several adverse reactions have been reported with vaccination against COVID-19. It is unknown whether adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are severe in individuals with allergies. We administered the COVID-19 vaccine to the medical staff at Yamagata University Hospital from March to August 2021. Subsequently, we conducted an online questionnaire-based survey to investigate the presence of allergy and adverse reactions after vaccination and examined the association between allergy and adverse reactions after immunization. Responses were collected from 1586 subjects after the first vaccination and 1306 subjects after the second administration of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse reactions included injection site pain, injection site swelling, fever, fatigue or malaise, headache, chills, nausea, muscle pain outside the injection site, and arthralgia. The frequency and severity of most adverse reactions were higher after the second vaccination compared to the first. The frequency of some adverse reactions and their severity were higher, and the duration of symptoms was longer in subjects with allergies than in subjects without allergies. Although several participants visited the emergency room for treatment after the first and second vaccinations, nobody was diagnosed with anaphylaxis. Given the serious consequence of COVID-19 and the reported high efficacy of this vaccine against this disease, we conclude that vaccination of allergic individuals is generally recommended.","Inoue, Sumito; Igarashi, Akira; Morikane, Keita; Hachiya, Osamu; Watanabe, Masafumi; Kakehata, Seiji; Sato, Shinya; Ueno, Yoshiyuki",,648,21

However, the relationship between specific antibody responses and severity of COVID-19 is less well understood. METHODS: To address this question and identify gaps in knowledge, we utilized the methodology of a scoping review to interrogate risk of infection and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with iatrogenic and inborn humoral immunodeficiency states based on existing literature. RESULTS: Among patients with iatrogenic B-cell depletion, particularly with agents targeting CD20, our analysis found increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death across a range of underlying disease states. Among patients with humoral inborn errors of immunity with COVID-19, our synthesis found that patients with dysregulated humoral immunity, predominantly common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than patients with humoral immunodeficiency states due to X-linked agammaglobulinemia and other miscellaneous forms of humoral immunodeficiency. There were insufficient data to appraise the risk of COVID-19 infection in both populations of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our work identifies potentially significant predictors of COVID-19 severity in patients with humoral immunodeficiency states and highlights the need for larger studies to control for clinical and biologic confounders of disease severity.","Jones, J.

This dramatically decreased case volumes for orthopaedic sports medicine fellows at academic institutions. Purpose: To describe how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of the sports medicine fellowship class of 2020 as well as the subsequent effects on their career plans and psychological well-being. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A 33-item survey was distributed via email to all American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) 2020 fellow members on April 22, 2020. Frequencies are presented as raw totals and percentages of respondents. The Fisher exact test was used to determine statistical significance between nominal variables, with significance set at P &lt;.05. Results: Of 210 registered fellows, 101 (48.1%) responded. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the typical case volume per week for most fellows (47.5%) was 11 to 15 cases. From the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation policies to the date of survey completion, 90.1% of fellows had performed fewer than 20 cases. A total of 32 fellows were presented with redeployment options by their fellowship program, with 10 redeployed mandatorily to other hospital departments. Fellows reported that web-based didactics (n = 100) and web-based journal clubs (n = 72) were utilized as alternative supplements in the absence of clinical education. There were 8 respondents who had either their prior contract or job offer rescinded, while 1 had a signed contract voided. As a result, 6 fellows now plan to matriculate into a previously unplanned fellowship. Also, 10 respondents’ intended practice start date was being delayed by their employer. Respondents whose postfellowship plans were affected were statistically more likely to experience doubts about readiness for practice (58.8% vs 20.3%, respectively; P =.005), anxiety about future career plans (94.4% vs 63.8%, respectively; P =.01), anxiety about their financial situation (86.7% vs 50.8%, respectively; P =.018), stress in personal relationships (58.8% vs 29.9%, respectively; P =.045), and signs or symptoms of depression (41.2% vs 11.1%, respectively; P =.007) compared with those whose plans were not affected. Conclusion: This survey illustrates that during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent suspension of elective surgery, there have been downstream effects to this group’s education, careers, board certification timeline, and potentially their social and/or emotional well-being.","Perrone, Michael A.; Youssefzadeh, Keon; Serrano, Brian; Limpisvasti, Orr; Banffy, Michael",Orthop.

This study explored students' experiences of engaging with recorded lectures and the extent to which such engagement contributes to enhanced learning. The research involved the deployment of a questionnaire to undergraduate and postgraduate students (n = 660) who had access to lecture recordings at a research intensive public university in New Zealand. Key findings revealed that students who accessed lecture recordings reported an enhanced learning experience. They stated that the availability of lecture recordings created an inclusive learning environment for students with learning disabilities and fostered flexible learning for those who would otherwise be unable to attend lectures either due to sickness or work commitments. Data also suggest that students utilised lecture recordings as supplementary learning resources rather than a substitute for regular lecture attendance. Our findings substantiated previous research studies and additionally demonstrated the various ways in which students engage with lecture recordings. Moreover, the use of sentiment analysis shows how multiple data can be triangulated to confirm or contest research findings.

This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent. These blood biochemical indicators should be considered in the clinical management of the disease.","Deng, Xiaoling; Liu, Beibei; Li, Jiahuan; Zhang, Junli; Zhao, Yajuan; Xu, Keshu",Clin Chem Lab Med,648,24

The 2018 International Consensus Meeting suggested that a variation trend toward normalization in serum markers was useful for determining the proper timing of reimplantation. However, the opposite results were found by previous studies, and the normalization of serum markers was reported to fail to predict infection control. We investigated whether value changes and percent changes in four common serum markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and fibrinogen) can predict persistent infection. METHODS: A retrospective review of 141 patients treated with the two-stage revision from 2014 to 2018 was conducted. The variation trend in serum indicators was evaluated by the percent changes (using values of serum markers pre-reimplantation divided by values pre-resection) and value changes (using values of serum markers pre-resection minus values pre-reimplantation). Treatment success was defined according to the Delphi-based consensus criteria with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, and the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) was used to examine the usefulness of changes in serum markers. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (15.60%) were persistently infected. No significant difference was found in either the value change or percent change in serum markers between reinfection and non-reinfection patients. When predicting persistent infection, the area under the curves (AUC) demonstrated that both percent changes and value changes in serum markers were poor indicators. The AUC of value changes was 0.533 for the CRP, 0.504 for the IL-6, 0.508 for the ESR, and 0.586 for fibrinogen when predicted persistent PJI. In addition, the AUC indicated that percent changes in the CRP (0.464), the IL-6 (0.534), the ESR (0.527), and fibrinogen (0.586) were all poor markers. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that both value changes and percent changes in serum markers were not sufficiently rigorous to aid in persistent infection diagnosis. The proper timing of reimplantation must, therefore, take into account various clinical tests rather than the downward trend of serum markers only.","Jiang, Qiao; Fu, Jun; Chai, Wei; Hao, Li-Bo; Zhou, Yong-Gang; Xu, Chi; Chen, Ji-Ying",J Orthop Surg Res,648,21

There are more than 110 Million infected cases on the globe, sofar. Due to its promptness and effective results computed tomography (CT)-scan image is preferred to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Early detection and isolation of the patient is the only possible way of controlling the spread of the disease. Automated analysis of CT-Scans can provide enormous support in this process. In this article, We propose a novel approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CT-scan images. Our method is based on a very intuitive and natural idea of analyzing shapes, an attempt to mimic a professional medic. We mainly trace SARS-CoV-2 features by quantifying their topological properties. We primarily use a tool called persistent homology, from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), to compute these topological properties. We train and test our model on the""SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset""\citep{soares2020sars}, an open-source dataset, containing 2,481 CT-scans of normal and COVID-19 patients. Our model yielded an overall benchmark F1 score of $99.42\% $, accuracy $99.416\%$, precision $99.41\%$, and recall $99.42\%$. The TDA techniques have great potential that can be utilized for efficient and prompt detection of COVID-19. The immense potential of TDA may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally, in particular in the low and middle-income countries where RT-PCR labs and/or kits are in a serious crisis.","Iqbal, Sohail; Ahmed, H.

Regardless of this measure, the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Objective: We developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by airline routes and provide estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreak to different cities. Methods: Using the Kermack and McKendrick model complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes and edges, we made an analysis of COVID-19 dispersion to other cities by air travel. Results: The estimation was accurate in that it was possible to predict in the middle of February 2020 the arrival of the first outbreak in Mexico, which eventually occurred between March 20 and 30. This estimation was robust with respect to small changes in epidemiological parameters at the other nodes. Conclusions: The estimation of the time of arrival of the outbreak from its epicenter, allows for a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources.

The COVID-19 pandemic has appeared to disproportionately affect communities affected by deprivation and discrimination, who also appear to be at greater risk of severe disease. Our aim was to investigate the evolution of the socioeconomic groups affected by COVID-19 over the course of the first wave of the pandemic by examining patients presenting to an acute NHS trust. Study design: and methods: A retrospective study using the postcodes of patients presenting to the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust who tested PCR-positive for COVID-19 were used to determine average house price and index of multiple deprivation. These were used as markers of affluence to examine the trend in the socioeconomic status of affected patients from February to May 2020. Results: 384 cases were included. The postcodes of those individuals who were initially infected had higher average house prices and index of multiple deprivation, both of which followed downward trends as the outbreak progressed. Conclusion: Our data shows that the outbreak spread from higher to lower affluence groups through the course of the pandemic. We hypothesise that this was due to wealthier individuals initially transmitting the virus from abroad. Therefore, an earlier and more effective quarantine could have reduced spread to members of the community at greater risk of infection and harm. We suggest that hospitals systematically record the socioeconomic status of affected individuals in order to monitor trends, identify those who may be at risk of severe disease, and to push for more equitable public health policy.","Sturrock, B R H; Chevassut, E I; Shahvisi, A; Chevassut, T J T",Public Health Pract (Oxf),648,29

METHODS: A systematic literature search using the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were performed from inception of databases up until 3 March 2021. We included studies that fulfill all of the following criteria: 1) observational studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that report COVID-19 patients, 2) reporting colchicine use, and 3) mortality within 30 days. There was no restriction on the age, inpatients or outpatients setting, and severity of diseases. The intervention was colchicine administration during treatment for COVID-19. The control was receiving placebo or standard of care. The outcome was mortality and the pooled effect estimate was reported as odds ratio (OR). Random-effects restricted maximum likelihood meta-regression was performed to evaluate factors affecting the pooled effect estimate. RESULTS: Eight studies comprising of 5530 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. There were three RCTs and five observational studies. Pooled analysis showed that colchicine was associated with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.47 [0.31, 0.72], p = 0.001; I2: 30.9, p = 0.181). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between colchicine and mortality was reduced by increasing age (OR 0.92 [0.85, 1.00], p = 0.05), but not gender (reference: male, p = 0.999), diabetes (p = 0.376), hypertension (p = 0.133), and CAD (p = 0.354).

METHODS: Electronic patient records of 852 patients in 2020 and 1818 patients in 2019, attending the EED at a tertiary eye centre (University Hospitals of Leicester, UK) were analysed. Data was extracted over a 31-day period during: (study period 1 (SP1)) COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in UK (24th March 2020-23rd April 2020) and (study period 2 (SP2)) the equivalent 2019 period (24th March 2019-23rd April 2019). RESULTS: A 53% reduction in EED attendance was noted during lockdown. The top three pathologies accounting for >30% of the caseload were trauma-related, keratitis and uveitis in SP1 in comparison to conjunctivitis, trauma-related and blepharitis in SP2. The overall number of retinal tears and retinal detachments (RD) were lower in SP1, the proportion of macula-off RD's (84.6%) was significantly (p = 0.0099) higher in SP1 (vs 42.9% in SP2). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown has had a significant impact on the range of presenting conditions to the EED. Measures to stop spread of COVID-19 such as awareness of hand hygiene practices, social distancing measures and school closures could have an indirect role in reducing spread of infective conjunctivitis. The higher proportion of macula-off RD and lower number of retinal tears raises possibility of delayed presentation in these cases. Going forward, we anticipate additional pressures on EED and other subspecialty services due to complications and associated morbidity from delayed presentations.","Poyser, Alicia; Deol, Sundeep S; Osman, Lina; Kuht, Helen J; Sivagnanasithiyar, Tharsica; Manrique, Roslyn; Okafor, Linda O; DeSilva, Ian; Sharpe, David; Savant, Vijay; Sarodia, Usman; Sarvananthan, Nagini; Chaudhuri, Ray; Banerjee, Somnath; Burns, Joyce; Thomas, Mervyn G",Eur J Ophthalmol,648,1

METHODS: ""Innovation activity"" was defined as the number of drugs for which R&D activities have been reported within the last three years. Such activities were measured by collecting the data on drug developments and classifying them by developer company, phase of development, therapeutic use, and the country in which the development conducted. Subsequently, we examined and compared the correlations between the global innovation activities of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies and the disease burden measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by income level and region. In addition, this study analyzed the association between country-specific innovations and DALYs in the corresponding countries. RESULTS: At a global level, the innovation activities were not associated with global DALYs. However, when analyzed by income level, the innovation activities were associated with DALYs in high income and upper middle income countries while it was not associated with DALYs in low middle income and low income countries. In terms of region, correlations were found between the innovation activities and DALYs in the European region, the Americas, and the Western Pacific region whereas such correlations were not found in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asian regions. Similar to the analyses by income level and region, correlations between country-specific innovations and DALYs were only found in high income or high GDP countries. In addition, an empirical analysis of several cases including Canada, Germany, South Korea, and the United Kingdom revealed that pharmaceutical innovation is more closely related to market size than disease burden. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that discrepancies between pharmaceutical innovation and public health needs, i.e., disease burden values, have persisted until recently. To alleviate this imbalance, both public and private sectors should not only fulfill their respective roles and responsibilities regarding these issues, but also make strategic and collaborative efforts such as Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) directed toward public health improvement.","Jung, Ye Lim; Hwang, JeeNa; Yoo, Hyoung Sun",Global Health,648,12

We base our study on a sample of 295 prefecture (and above) cities in 31 provinces in China. A distribution dynamics approach is employed to reveal the trend and movement of disposable income per capita in each city before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the period when the COVID-19 was under the control. The findings reveal significant negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and show that most cities will converge to a level of disposable income which is much less than the Pre-COVID level if the COVID pandemic persists. Regional income inequality has intensified in the cities that have a longer duration of stringent social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and disappeared in the cities with policies of short duration. Disposable income per capita for urban residents recovered quickly when the transmission of coronavirus was effectively contained; and yet the impact of the pandemic on rural residents remains unresolved, if not intensified. This study demonstrates a significant divergence of the trend of disposable income across cities with different durations of social distancing policies and between urban and rural residents. It also highlights the importance of stringent social distancing policies in containing the spread of virus in a short time and calls for special policy attention for rural regions in the recovery from the COVID-19.","Shen, Jianfu; Shum, Wai Yan; Cheong, Tsun Se; Wang, Lafang",Front Public Health,648,16

Workers have become vulnerable parties in this case because they do not have enough assurance. Article 164 (1) Act No. 3 of 2003 concerning Manpower indeed regulates the Termination of Employment regulation because of force majeure, however this law seems to be slightly unsuitably applied for this outbreak COVID-19 situation. Therefore, this study is aimed to do legal discoursing in which can both assure those workers and maintain the operation of business in this tight condition.

Moreover, other out-ofhospital spaces have been transformed into hospitalization units to absorb the large number of patients that had to be treated and isolated. To guarantee the distribution of medicines and the quality of the pharmaceutical care, drug distribution systems, such as unit dose and automated dispensing systems, have undergone transformations. Standard stocks were assigned for COVID units, and different dispensing circuits to avoid the risk of cross-contamination between COVID and non-COVID units were created, as well as disinfection protocols for medication transport systems and medication return protocols. All this without forgetting COVID treatment protocol's changes that were affected by the availability of the drugs. The increase in the number of beds in out-of-hospital spaces, such as field hospitals, hotels, socio-medical centers and nursing homes, has challenged Pharmacy Services, since new medication dispensing and conciliation circuits have been created forcing the increase of pharmacy staff's presence and modifying work shifts, to afford all the new tasks successfully. Development of contingency plans for the different Pharmacy Service activities and providing fluent communication channels are key elements for crisis situations or health emergencies such as the current pandemic.","Cabañas, Maria Josep; Queralt Gorgas, Maria",Farm Hosp,648,20

Anxiety and depression can have negative effects on pregnant women and result in poor neonatal outcomes. Therefore, we analyzed stress, anxiety and depression in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cohort study of pregnant women during COVID-19 compared to pregnant women before COVID-19. Pregnant women were recruited through social media platforms from 21 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. Pregnant women &#8805; 18 years of age, who master the Dutch language were included. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were analyzed. Demographic features were summarized using descriptive statistics. Possible differences in demographic variables between groups were compared using Mann Whitney U test and Chi-squared test. Significant demographic differences between groups were controlled for using logistical regression analysis or an independent one-way analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Thousand hundred and two pregnant women completed the questionnaires during COVID-19, and 364 pregnant women before COVID-19. We found no differences in clinically high levels of anxiety (HADS-A &#8805; 8) and depression (HADS-D &#8805; 8) in women during COVID-19 (19.5% and 13.2%, respectively) and women before COVID-19 (23.1% and 15.7%, respectively). A question was implemented whether participants related their stress level to COVID-19. Women who related their stress to the COVID-19 pandemic reported significantly higher overall stress levels on the PSS-10 compared to women with stress unrelated to COVID-19 (mean, 15.62; standard deviation [SD], 6.44 vs. mean, 10.28; SD, 5.48; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous studies, COVID-19 did not increase anxiety and depression levels in Dutch pregnant women. Women who related their perceived stress to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced higher stress levels than women who did not relate their stress to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that interventions that specifically aim to reduce COVID-19 stress, may help to reduce overall stress levels in pregnant women during the pandemic.","Zilver, S J M; Broekman, B F P; Hendrix, Y M G A; de Leeuw, R A; Mentzel, S V; van Pampus, M G; de Groot, C J M",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,648,24

Osteosarcoma (OS) metastasizes almost exclusively to the lung, an organ where Fas ligand (FasL) is constitutively expressed. This chapter focuses on our studies dedicated to the interaction of OS cells with the lung microenvironment. We will summarize our studies conducted over the past 20 years showing the importance of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway to the establishment and progression of OS metastases in the lung. We demonstrated that the FasL+ lung microenvironment eliminates Fas-positive (Fas+) OS cells that metastasize to the lungs, through apoptosis induced by Fas signaling following interaction of Fas on the tumor cell surface with FasL on the lung epithelial cells. Expression of the Fas receptor on OS cells inversely correlated with the ability of OS cells to form lung metastases. Blocking this pathway interferes with this process, allowing Fas+ cells to grow in the lung. By contrast, upregulation of Fas on Fas- OS cells inhibited their ability to metastasize to the lung. We demonstrated how the FasL+ lung microenvironment can be leveraged for therapeutic intent through the upregulation of Fas expression. To this end, we demonstrated that the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat upregulated Fas expression on OS cells, reduced their ability to form lung metastases, and induced regression of established micrometastases. Fas expression in OS cells is regulated epigenetically by the microRNA miR-20a. We showed that expressions of Fas and miR-20a are inversely correlated, and that delivery of anti-miR-20a in vivo to mice with established osteosarcoma lung metastases resulted in upregulation of Fas and tumor regression. Therefore, targeting the Fas signaling pathway may present therapeutic opportunities, which target the lung microenvironment for elimination of OS lung metastases. We have also shown that in addition to being critically involved in the metastatic potential, the Fas signaling pathway may also contribute to the efficacy of chemotherapy. We demonstrated that the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (GCB) increased Fas expression in both human and mouse OS cells in vitro. In vivo, aerosol GCB therapy induced upregulation of Fas expression and the regression of established osteosarcoma lung metastases. The therapeutic efficacy of GCB was contingent upon a FasL+ lung microenvironment as aerosol GCB had no effect in FasL-deficient mice. Manipulation of Fas expression and the Fas pathway should be considered, as this concept may provide additional novel therapeutic approaches for treating patients with OS lung metastases.","Koshkina, Nadya; Yang, Yuanzheng; Kleinerman, Eugenie S",Adv Exp Med Biol,648,1

Howerver, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been reported in Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19 at the George Washington University Hospital (GWUH) to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms and their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 401 adults admitted to GWUH with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from February 24 to May 21, 2020, ultimately including 382 inpatients. RESULTS: 87% of our cohort was African American or Latinx. 59% of patients reported at least one GI symptom, with diarrhea being the most common (29%). Patients with GI symptoms were slightly younger (58 +/- 15.8 vs. 65 +/- 16.9, pâ¯=â¯0.0005), have higher body mass index (31.5 +/- Standard Deviation of 8.7 vs. 28 +/- 8.2, pâ¯=â¯0.0001), and more likely to be Latinx (34 vs. 27, pâ¯=â¯0.01).

Most of those studies rely on parameter calibration using the published number of confirmed cases. Unfortunately, this number is usually incomplete and biased due to the lack of testing capacities, and varying testing protocols. An essential requirement for better monitoring is the evaluation of the number of undiagnosed infected individuals. This number is crucial for the determination of transmission prevention strategies and it provides statistics on the epidemic dynamics. To estimate the number of undiagnosed infected individuals, we studied the relation between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We simulated multiple models currently used to study the COVID-19 pandemic and computed the relation between these two fractions in all those models. Across most models currently used and for most realistic model parameters, the relation between the two fractions is consistently linear and model independent. This relation can be used to estimate the number of undiagnosed infected, with no explicit epidemiological model. We apply this method to measure the number of undiagnosed infected in Israel. Since the fraction of confirmed cases with a known source can be obtained from epidemiological investigations in any country, one can estimate the total number of infected individuals in the same country.","Melka, Akiva B; Louzoun, Yoram",,648,20

Why are forecasts or predictions made by so-called experts often grossly wrong, concerning the numbers of people who get infected or die? The purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature of an epidemic disease, and answer the above questions. Much of the work on infectious diseases has been based on""SIR deterministic models,""(Kermack and McKendrick:1927.) We will explore stochastic models that can capture the essence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease. A stochastic model, in its formulation, takes into account the random nature of an infectious disease. The stochastic model we study here is based on the""birth-and-death process with immigration""(BDI for short), which was proposed in the study of population growth or extinction of some biological species. The BDI process model ,however, has not been investigated by the epidemiology community. The BDI process is one of a few birth-and-death processes, which we can solve analytically. Its time-dependent probability distribution function is a""negative binomial distribution""with its parameter $r$ less than $1$. The""coefficient of variation""of the process is larger than $\sqrt{1/r}>1$. Furthermore, it has a long tail like the zeta distribution. These properties explain why infection patterns exhibit enormously large variations. The number of infected predicted by a deterministic model is much greater than the median of the distribution. This explains why any forecast based on a deterministic model will fail more often than not.","Kobayashi, Hisashi",,648,26

ACE2 is also the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on the claim that RAS inhibitors (RASIs) cause ACE2 overexpression in some animal experiments, concerns have arisen that RASIs may aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease-2019 severity in RASI-treated patients. To achieve a comprehensive review, a systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted regarding the effects of RASIs on tissue ACE2 mRNA/protein expression in healthy animals and animal models of human diseases. We identified 88 eligible articles involving 168 experiments in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Three of 38 experiments involving healthy animals showed ACE2 expression greater than twice that of the control (overexpression). Among 102 disease models (130 experiments), baseline ACE2 was overexpressed in 16 models (18 experiments) and less than half the control level (repression) in 28 models (40 experiments). In 72 experiments, RASIs did not change ACE2 levels from the baseline levels of disease models. RASIs caused ACE2 overexpression compared to control levels in seven experiments, some of which were unsupported by other experiments under similar conditions. In 36 experiments, RASIs reversed or prevented disease-induced ACE2 repression, yielding no or marginal changes. Therefore, ACE2 overexpression appears to be a rare rather than common consequence of RASI treatment in healthy animals and disease models. Future studies should clarify the pathophysiological significance of RASI-induced reversal or prevention of ACE2 repression in disease models.","Kai, Hisashi; Kai, Mamiko; Niiyama, Hiroshi; Okina, Norihito; Sasaki, Motoki; Maeda, Takanobu; Katoh, Atsushi",Hypertens. res,648,24

These are all covered by the same health system and, in the post-lockdown phase we focus on, all subject to the same social distancing regulations. We find that municipalities with a higher number of cases at the beginning of the period analyzed have a lower rate of diffusion, which cannot be imputed to herd immunity. In particular, there is a robust and strongly significant negative correlation between the estimated basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the initial outbreak size, in contrast with the role of $R_0$ as a \emph{predictor} of outbreak size. We explore different possible explanations for this phenomenon and conclude that a higher number of cases causes changes of behavior, such as a more strict adoption of social distancing measures among the population, that reduce the spread. This result calls for a transparent, real-time distribution of detailed epidemiological data, as such data affects the behavior of populations in areas affected by the outbreak.","Battiston, Pietro; Gamba, Simona",,648,20

This means more than 253 million people globally will be at higher risk of affecting by the COVID-19. The current pandemic, followed by a nationwide emergency lockdown to slow the unprecedented spread of the virus, will have a serious impact on people living with visual disabilities and even endangers their lives in the long run. Many restrictive and control measures, including the adoption of new behavioural changes (for example, social distance during outdoor movement, limiting touch or tactile contact) recommended by the government will pose immense challenges to individuals with a visual loss. This serious impact, including challenges in healthcare access, can be minimized through inclusive service approaches, involving persons with visual disabilities, caregivers, family members, and healthcare providers, along with the community to a large extent, and finally, support to improve the overall outcomes. The government, along with profit or non-profit private sectors, should consider initiating such inclusive approaches while planning responses to the pandemic. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for health care planners and decision-makers of various organizations across India for a reformation of disabilities care. Impacts due to the pandemic and lockdown can be reduced substantially if planning and policy are in place before any emergency happened in the future.","Senjam, Suraj S",Indian J Ophthalmol,648,20

Enteral nutrition (EN) should be initiated early after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) using a standard isosmolar polymeric formula, starting at trophic doses and advancing as tolerated, while monitoring for gastrointestinal intolerance, hemodynamic instability, and metabolic derangements. Intragastric EN may be provided safely, even with use of prone-positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Clinicians should have a lower threshold for switching to parenteral nutrition in cases of intolerance, high risk of aspiration, or escalating vasopressor support.

The results showed associations between the coronavirus pandemic and increased psychosomatic symptoms and negative emotions. We further found higher risks of increased health complaints in younger people and women. It is also possible that there is higher risk of increased health complaints for respondents with secondary school education, students, and highly spiritual people, but this relationship has to be further investigated. In contrast, respondents with their highest achieved education level being secondary school graduation had a lower risk of increased frequency of stomach-ache. We also found that more negative emotions could increase the frequency of health complaints.

Dwindling supplies, such as face masks, gowns and goggles, and inadequate production to meet increasing demand have placed health care workers and patients at risk. The momentum of the #GetMePPE Twitter hashtag resulted in the creation of a petition to urge public officials to address the PPE shortage through increased funding and production. Simultaneously, the GetUsPPE.org website was launched through the collaboration of physicians and software engineers to develop a digital platform for the donation, request, and distribution of multi-modal sources of PPE. GetUsPPE.org and #GetMePPE were merged in an attempt to combine public engagement and advocacy on social media with the coordination of PPE donation and distribution. Within 10 days, over 1800 hospitals and PPE suppliers were registered in a database that enabled the rapid coordination and distribution of scarce and in-demand materials. One month after its launch, the organization had distributed hundreds of thousands of PPE items and had built a database of over 6000 PPE requesters. The call for action on social media and the rapid development of this digital tool created a productive channel for the public to contribute to the health care response to COVID-19 in meaningful ways. #GetMePPE and GetUsPPE.org were able to mobilize individuals and organizations outside of the health care system to address the unmet needs of the medical community. The success of GetUsPPE.org demonstrates the potential of digital tools as a platform for larger health care institutions to rapidly address urgent issues in health care. In this paper, we outline this process and discuss key factors determining success.","He, Shuhan; Ojo, Ayotomiwa; Beckman, Adam L; Gondi, Suhas; Betz, Marian; Faust, Jeremy S; Choo, Esther; Kass, Dara; Raja, Ali S",J Med Internet Res,648,1

As a result of full or partial lock-down and stay-at-home orders, the well-being and productivity of individuals were severely affected. Since basic science research requires laboratory experiments, the work-from-home strategy hurt their productivity. In addition, the combination of decreased productivity and staying at home is likely to compromise their well-being by causing stress and anxiety. In this case study, a strategy was developed to engage researchers through listening and learning, motivation, and empowerment, using regular virtual sessions. Through these virtual sessions, research work was prioritized and coordinated, from idea conception to writing research papers and grant proposals. Perceived stress scores (PSS) and COVID-19-related stress (COVID-SS) scores were measured to evaluate general and COVID-19-induced stress, respectively, every month from March to July 2020 during the COVID-19 era. The result showed a significant improvement in both the PSS and the COVID-SS scores of the intervention group compared to the control group. In addition, while there was no/minimal change in PSS and COVID-SS scores from March to subsequent months until July for the control group, the intervention groups showed significant and consistent improvement in both scores in the intervention group. Overall, the intervention strategy showed improved well-being for basic science researchers, which was also consistent with their improved productivity during the COVID-19 era.","Kumar, Santosh; Kodidela, Sunitha; Kumar, Asit; Gerth, Kelli; Zhi, Kaining",Front Psychol,648,16

Virtual care at U.S. healthcare systems beyond the COVID-19 pandemic,17.58359,4.220773,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Recent reports suggest that sudden smell loss might be a symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an outpatient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom ""sudden smell loss"" for screening procedures. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients' main symptoms, time course, and an additional self-assessment of the patients' current smell, taste function, and nasal breathing compared to the level before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 12 out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom ""sudden smell loss"" in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom ""sudden smell loss"" can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 97% for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease and should be tested for on a regular basis. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19-associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","Haehner, Antje; Draf, Julia; Dräger, Sarah; de With, Katja; Hummel, Thomas",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,648,16

However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-cell selenoproteins remains elusive. The present study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on expression of selenoprotein mRNAs in Vero cells. SARS-CoV-2 triggered an inflammatory response as evidenced by increased IL-6 expression. Of the 25 selenoproteins, SARS-CoV-2 significantly suppressed mRNA expression of ferroptosis-associated GPX4, DNA synthesis-related TXNRD3 and endoplasmic reticulum-resident SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOM and SELENOS. Computational analysis has predicted an antisense interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TXNRD3 mRNA, which is translated with high efficiency in the lung. Here, we confirmed the predicted SARS-CoV-2/TXNRD3 antisense interaction in vitro using DNA oligonucleotides, providing a plausible mechanism for the observed mRNA knockdown. Inhibition of TXNRD decreases DNA synthesis which is thereby likely to increase the ribonucleotide pool for RNA synthesis and, accordingly, RNA virus production. The present findings provide evidence for a direct inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 replication on the expression of a specific set of selenoprotein mRNAs, which merits further investigation in the light of established evidence for correlations between dietary selenium status and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Yijun; Huang, Jinbao; Sun, Yong; Stubbs, David; He, Jun; Li, Weiwei; Wang, Fuming; Liu, Zhirong; Ruzicka, Jan A; Taylor, Ethan Will; Rayman, Margaret P; Wan, Xiaochun; Zhang, Jinsong",Food Chem Toxicol,648,1

The persons arrive one by one to the department and the balking and the retention of reneged person approaches are considered. There exists one server presents the service to these persons according to first-come, first-served (FCFS) discipline. An efficient and novel algorithm is presented to get the exact value of the probability of n persons in the department at any time interval. This algorithm depends on the Laplace transform to solve a probabilistic dynamical system of differential equations. By considering the exponential detection function and if the probability of the infected person in the department is equal to the probability of each one, then this algorithm is useful to obtain the detection probability of the infected one. Under steady state, the detection probability of the infected person is described. The usefulness of this model is illustrated for different capacities by using a numerical example to describe the behavior of probabilities of the persons in the department, the detection probabilities of the infected person as functions in time, and the mean time to detection.","El-Hadidy, Mohamed Abd Allah",,648,20

Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. Results: Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation +/- 5.3;range 12-45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2-81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2-53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5-60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety.

New materials are synthesized to effectively disseminate the active substance without affecting the healthy cells. Thus far, a number of polymers have been applied to build novel drug delivery systems. One of interesting polymers for this purpose is povidone, pVP. Contrary to other polymeric materials, the synthesis of povidone nanoparticles can take place under various condition, due to good solubility of this polymer in several organic and inorganic solvents. Moreover, povidone is known as nontoxic, non-carcinogenic, and temperature-insensitive substance. Its flexible design and the presence of various functional groups allow connection with the hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. It is worth noting, that pVP is regarded as an ecofriendly substance. Despite wide application of pVP in medicine, it was not often selected for the production of drug carriers.

This vision paper discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19 and evidence for these modifications and suggests future directions for anesthesiology education.Learning management systems provide structure to online learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations, the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs. Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed curricular options.The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational knowledge prior to teaching sessions with a focus on application during structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate focused pre-class work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions interactive.Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients. Multidisciplinary, in-situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost. With the increasing dependency on multimedia and technology support for teaching and learning, one important focus of educational research is on the development and evaluation of strategies that reduce extraneous processing and manage essential and generative processing in virtual learning environments. Collaboration to identify and implement best practices has the potential to improve education for all learners.","Martinelli, Susan M; Chen, Fei; Isaak, Robert S; Huffmyer, Julie L; Neves, Sara E; Mitchell, John D",,648,16

In this study, we report a novel variant carrying the L452R mutation that emerged from a local B.1.362 lineage, B.1.362+L452R. The L452R mutation is associated with the Delta and Epsilon variants and was shown to cause increased infection and reduction in neutralization in pseudoviruses. Indeed, the B.1.362+L452R variant demonstrated a X4-fold reduction in neutralization capacity of sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals compared to a wild-type strain. The variant infected 270 individuals in Israel between December 2020 and March 2021, until diminishing due to the gain in dominance of the Alpha variant in February 2021. This study demonstrates an independent, local emergence of a variant carrying a critical mutation, L452R, which may have the potential of becoming a variant of concern and emphasizes the importance of routine surveillance and detection of novel variants among efforts undertaken to prevent further disease spread.","Mor, Orna; Mandelboim, Michal; Fleishon, Shay; Bucris, Efrat; Bar-Ilan, Dana; Linial, Michal; Lustig, Yaniv; Mendelson, Ella; Zuckerman, Neta S",,648,9

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: 18 people living with long COVID (9 men, 9 women; aged between 18-74 years; 10 white British, 3 white Other, 3 Asian, 1 black, 1 mixed ethnicity) recruited via a UK-based research interest database for people with long COVID. SETTING: Telephone interviews with 17 participants living in the UK and 1 participant living in the USA. RESULTS: Four themes were generated. Theme 1 describes how participants struggled with drastically reduced physical function, compounded by the cognitive and psychological effects of long COVID. Theme 2 highlights challenges associated with finding and interpreting advice about physical activity that was appropriately tailored. Theme 3 describes individual approaches to managing symptoms including fatigue and 'brain fog' while trying to resume and maintain activities of daily living and other forms of exercise. Theme 4 illustrates the battle with self-concept to accept reduced function (even temporarily) and the fear of permanent reduction in physical and cognitive ability.

In this case, we describe a patient that developed acute eosinophilic pneumonia secondary to COVID19 infection. Case Presentation: A 65-year-old Hispanic female with history of osteoporosis, fibromyalgia and depression presented to the ER with dyspnea and non-productive cough for two days. She was hypoxic at 91% on room air. Chest X-ray showed bilateral reticular infiltrates. COVID 19 PCR was positive. Lactate dehydrogenase, Ferritin, C-reactive protein were elevated. Initial treatment consisted of supplemental oxygen, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, therapeutic anticoagulation, tocilizumab and methylprednisolone, and convalescent plasma. However, she had worsening hypoxia despite maximizing noninvasive ventilation leading to Endo-Tracheal Intubation. She also developed septic shock requiring empiric coverage with meropenem, vancomycin and micafungin. Blood cultures grew MRSA. Urine culture grew E. coli. 2D Echo and Transesophageal Echo were negative for endocarditis. Gallium scan, and CT abdomen and pelvis were negative for other sources of infection. As her hypoxia worsened, CT thorax was done which revealed diffuse ground glass appearance, interstitial lung disease, fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Complete blood count with differential demonstrated new peripheral eosinophilia (2630/mm3). Serum antigens, sputum, and stool cultures for fungal agents, parasites, and Giemsa staining returned negative. Other triggers of peripheral eosinophilia such as smoking, parasitic infections, allergies, allergic interstitial nephritis, medications were ruled out. Broncho alveolar lavage, although planned, was not performed due to hemodynamic instability and severe hypoxemia. Based on acutely worsening respiratory status and significant peripheral eosinophilia, we considered the diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia and started her on high dose methylprednisolone. She had significant improvement in oxygen requirement, chest X-ray and subsequent thoracic CT scans. She then had a tracheostomy and was discharged to acute care facility. Discussion: The SARS-COV2 infection is thought to be a TH1 type response with IL-2 activation. However, in this case, TH2 mediated responses with IL-13/IL-5 activation and eosinophil release, which are the predominant mechanisms behind acute eosinophilic pneumonia, must be explored. There have been at least 2 reported cases of eosinophilic pneumonia in COVID19 infected patients. It is important to further our understanding of the pathophysiology behind SARS-COV2 related eosinophilic pneumonia to plan for efficacious treatment, and reduce excessive work up in search for other causes. It is also relevant to understand the role of high dose steroids in its treatment.","Narvaneni, S.; Samuel, A.; Nanavati, S.

While much has been described in the literature about lung infiltrates and respiratory failure associated with infection of coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), pneumothorax is reported as a rare (a rate of 1%) but a life-threatening complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. Late bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax has been described in few cases. The aim of the report is to consider pneumothorax as a possible complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, which is also one of the causes of respiratory deterioration and potentially fatal outcome in these patients. Case outline This article describes the clinical course of the patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens and who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by bilateral, spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. He had no underlying lung disease nor risk factors for pneumothorax, except administered non-invasive ventilation/continuous positive airway pressure during first hospitalization. The patient was successfully treated with surgical (chest drainage, thoracoscopy and pleural abrasion) and non-surgical methods (by application of drugs and other supportive therapies). Conclusion This review demonstrates that the possibility of a late pneumothorax should be kept in mind in patients with, or recovering from, COVID-19 disease with progressive dyspnea. The timely diagnosis and management of pneumothorax will reduce COVID-19 associated mortality.","Kuhajda, I.; Kasikovic-Lecic, S.; Ergelasev, I.; Kuhajda, D.; Dokic, J.",Srpski Arhiv Za Celokupno Lekarstvo,648,5

METHODS: The survey was conducted in two phases using a clustered sampling scheme. The first phase spanned May 1-3 and involved 709 participants. The second phase spanned June 11-14, 2020, and involved 646 participants. RESULTS: During the first phase, RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal swabs was positive at 0.14%. The serological tests were positive in 1.27% of the patients during the first phase and 2.79% during the second phase. People living in households with more than five members had a prevalence of 10.83% (95%CI: 1.58-74.27) higher than those living alone or with someone other. Considering the proportion of the positive serological test results with sex and age adjustments, approximately 2.37% (95%CI: 1.32-3.42) of the population had been cumulatively infected by mid-June 2020, which is equivalent to 16,670 people (95%CI: 9,267-24,074). Considering that 68 deaths from the disease in the residents of the city had been confirmed as at the date of the second phase of the survey, the infection fatality rate was estimated to be 0.41% (95%CI: 0.28-0.73). Our results suggest that approximately 88% of the cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the survey were not reported to the local epidemiological surveillance service.

The rapid increase in social welfare expenditure in the last decade has become a concern to the Hong Kong SAR Government. The overall social welfare expenditure has accounted for nearly 15.6% of government expenditure in 2018, with the total amount increasing from $58 billion to $90 billion (an increase of 72.4%) for the period 2014-2018. However, the amount spent on CSSA only increased from $20.7 billion to $22.3 billion with an increase of 7.7% only for the same period. The much slower magnitude of increase is related to the reduction in the number of CSSA recipients, which decreased from 237,501 to 185,528 over the period. A decomposition method was used to assess the changes in the number of people in the CSSA system. It showed that the rate of arriving into the system has been decreasing due to a robust economy with a very low unemployment rate; whereas moving out of the system has also been decreasing in the past 5 years. This phenomenon can be partly attributed to the widening of the income gap in the community in the period. Despite the increase in population size, as long as employment conditions remain strong and the momentum of leaving the system can be maintained, the number of CSSA recipients will continue to decrease. However, the results also suggested that a certain proportion of CSSA recipients will not be able to move out of the system and have been trapped. Some innovative methods to help them out of CSSA are discussed. In view of the poor economic outlook arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important for the Government to have effective measures to keep people in their jobs. If the unemployment rate will does not substantially increase and then increase of in CSSA recipients can be contained.","Yip, Paul; Chan, Milton; So, B K; Wat, K P; Lam, Kwok Fai",China Popul Dev Stud,648,15

While the final cost on human lives and world economy remains unpredictable, the timely identification of a suitable treatment and the development of an effective vaccine remain a significant challenge and will still require time. The aim of this study is to show that the global collective effort to control the coronavirus pandemic (Covid 19) should also consider alternative therapeutic methods, and national health systems should quickly endorse the validity of proven homeopathic treatments in this war against coronavirus disease. Subject and methods: With the help of mathematics, we will show that the fundamental therapeutic law on which homeopathy is founded can be proved. Results: The mathematical proof of the law of similarity justifies perfectly the use of ultra - high diluted succussed solution products as major tools in the daily practices of homeopathy.

While poorly defined, this hyperinflammatory response results in diffuse alveolar damage. The low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (LMWF5A), a novel biologic in development for osteoarthritis, demonstrates beneficial in vitro immunomodulatory effects complimentary to addressing inflammation, thus, we hypothesize that LMWF5A could improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 by attenuating hyperinflammation and the potential development of a cytokine storm. Presentation of the hypothesis: A variety of human in vitro immune models indicate that LMWF5A reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures. Testing the hypothesis: A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Implications of hypothesis: If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit. Conclusions: In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.","Thomas, Gregory; Frederick, Elizabeth; Hausburg, Melissa; Goldberg, Laura; Hoke, Marshall; Roshon, Michael; Mains, Charles; Bar-Or, David",Patient Saf.

The transition required changes in teaching practices to accommodate for an online learning environment. However, there are no studies characterizing physical educators' and school health experts' perspectives on physical education via distance learning or identifying best practices and their implications for student health. METHODS: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 physical education teachers and school health experts across 21 California school districts on best practices for physical education via distance learning. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged: (1) participants felt high quality physical education via distance learning was both critical and possible; (2) strategies for creating a successful distance learning environment included personalization, creativity, and inclusiveness; (3) resources necessary for success included professional development, administrative support, and equipment; and (4) lessons for the long-term. CONCLUSIONS: Participants identified effective strategies, challenges, and recommendations for the future. Participants felt optimistic about their ability to provide quality physical education via distance learning, given the necessary supports, and perceived that they played a critical role in supporting student health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vilchez, Jocelyn A; Kruse, John; Puffer, Maryjane; Dudovitz, Rebecca N",J. sch. health,648,16

Diagnosis of these pathologies is a manual, time-consuming process that has inter and intra-observer variability, delaying diagnosis and treatment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need of developing systems to automatize the diagnosis of pneumonia, whilst Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) have proved to be an excellent option for the automatic classification of medical images. However, given the need of providing a confidence classification in this context it is crucial to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions. In this work, we propose a multi-level ensemble classification system based on a Bayesian Deep Learning approach in order to maximize performance while quantifying the uncertainty of each classification decision. This tool combines the information extracted from different architectures by weighting their results according to the uncertainty of their predictions. Performance of the Bayesian network is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously differentiating between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 pneumonia. A three-level decision tree is employed to divide the 4-class classification into three binary classifications, yielding an accuracy of 98.06% and overcoming the results obtained by recent literature. The reduced preprocessing needed for obtaining this high performance, in addition to the information provided about the reliability of the predictions evidence the applicability of the system to be used as an aid for clinicians.","Arco, Juan E.; Ortiz, A.; J.Ramirez,; Martinez-Murcia, F.

This is mainly due to the improved thermophysical properties relative to the base fluid (BF). The addition of nanoparticles (NPs) to BF, to obtain NFs, increases the thermal conductivity, hence better heat transfer properties and thermal performance. The properties of NFs can be considered somehow intermediate between those of the BF and the added solid NPs. The improved heat transfer using NFs results in increased energy conversion efficiency, which results in reduced energy consumption for heating or cooling applications. BF and their environmental impacts (EIs) have been widely discussed within the scope of their applications as a HTF, with most of the attention given to the improved energy efficiency. The IEs of NPs and their toxicity and other characteristics have been extensively studied due to the widespread applications on newly engineered NPs. However, with the evolution of expanding the applications of NFs, the different EIs were not well addressed. The discussion should consider both the base fluid and NPs added in combination as the NF constitutes. The current work presents a brief discussion on the EIs of NFs. The discussion presented in this work considers the NPs as the primary contributor to the EIs of different NFs. It was found that the EIs of NFs depend significantly on the type of NP used, followed by the BF, and finally, the loading of NPs in BF. The use of non-toxic and naturally occurring NPs at lower NPs loading in water as NF promises a much lower EIs in terms of toxicity energy requirements for production, and other EIs, while still maintaining high thermal performance. The production methods of both NPs, i.e., synthesis route, and NF, i.e., one-step or two-step, were found to have a significant effect on the associated EIs of the produced NF. The simpler NP synthesis route and NF production will result in much lower chemicals and energy requirements, which in turn reduce the EIs.","Elsaid, Khaled; Olabi, A G; Wilberforce, Tabbi; Abdelkareem, Mohammad Ali; Sayed, Enas Taha",Sci Total Environ,648,24

These services largely breakdowns due to restrictions on border movements, confined travel and transportation services, a decline in international tourists' visitation, nationwide lockdowns, and maintaining social distancing in the population. Although these measures are highly needed to contain coronavirus, it decreases economic and financial activities in a country, which requires smart solutions to globally subsidize the services sector. The study used different COVID-19 measures, and its resulting impact on the services industry by using world aggregated data from 1975 through 2020. The study benefited from the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand that remains provided a solution to minimize economic shocks through stringent or liberalizing economic policies. The COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the financial shocks of 2018 that affected almost all sectors of the globalized world, particularly the services sector, which has been severally affected by COVID-19; it is a high time to revisit economic policies to control pandemic recession. The study used quantiles regression and innovation accounting matrix to obtain ex-ante and ex-post analysis. The quantile regression estimates show that causes of death by communicable diseases, including COVID-19, mainly decline the share of services value added to the global GDP at different quantiles distribution. In contrast, word-of-mouth helps to prevent it from the transmission channel of coronavirus plague through information sharing among the general masses. The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector's value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon. The study used the number of proxies to the COVID-19 measures on the service sector that can be continued with real-time variables to obtain more inferences.","Yu, Donglei; Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Peng, Michael Yao-Ping; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A; Askar, Sameh E; Zaman, Khalid; Abdul Aziz, Abdul Rashid; Qazi Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin; Jabor, Mohd Khata",,648,21

We used fixed-effects and random-effects models to compute the risk ratio of death in the group receiving glucocorticoids treatment and the control group for COVID-19 and SARS, respectively. RESULTS: Ten trials and 71 observational studies, with a total of 45,935 patients, were identified. Glucocorticoids treatment, was associated with decreased all-cause mortality both in COVID-19 (risk ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 0.94; I2â=â26%) and SARS (0.48; 0.29 to 0.79; 10%), based on high quality evidence, as well as decreased all-cause mortality-including composite outcome of COVID-19 (0.89; 0.82 to 0.98; 0%). In subgroup analyses, all-cause mortality was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients being accompanied by severe ARDS but not mild ARDS, taking low-dose or pulse glucocorticoids, being critically severe but not only severe, being of critical severity and old but not young, being of critical severity and men but not women, non-early taking glucocorticoids, taking dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, and with the increased inflammatory state; but for SARS, lower mortality was observed among those who were taking medium-high dose glucocorticoids, being severe or critically severe, early taking glucocorticoids, and taking methylprednisolone or prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoids treatment reduced mortality in COVID-19 and SARS patients of critical severity; however, different curative effects existed between the two diseases among subpopulations, mainly regarding sex- and age-specific effects, optimal doses and use timing of glucocorticoids.","Li, Jianbo; Liao, Xuelian; Zhou, Yue; Wang, Luping; Yang, Hang; Zhang, Wei; Zhang, Zhongwei; Kang, Yan",Shock (Augusta Ga.),648,10

While there are presently a few case reports/series on COVID-19 amongst solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, there is no official guideline for the management of SOT patients. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the pharmacotherapeutic management of SOT patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and provide their expert perspectives. EXPERT OPINION: Prophylactic reduction of immunosuppression because of fear of COVID-19 is not suggested in SOT patients. With maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, corticosteroids can be continued during COVID-19. Continuing other immunosuppressive drugs with lowest effective dose/blood concentration is suggested for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Discontinuation of antimetabolites and perhaps inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is suggested in moderate to severe COVID-19. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may be continued or substituted for mTOR inhibitors with lowest therapeutic concentrations in moderate to severe COVID-19. If continued in patients with COVID-19, therapeutic drug monitoring of CNIs/mTOR inhibitors and appropriate dose reduction is recommended in co-administration with protease inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, or interleukin (IL)-1/IL-6 receptor antagonists. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended in patients who continue taking antimetabolites or mTOR inhibitors. Dose modification/avoidance should be considered for chloroquine, atazanavir, oseltamivir, ribavirin, anakinra, and Janus associated kinase inhibitors in patients with organ function impairment.","Dashti-Khavidaki, Simin; Mohammadi, Keyhan; Khalili, Hossein; Abdollahi, Azin",Expert Opin Pharmacother,648,6

As reported, the body mass index (BMI) may play an important role in COVID-19; however, this still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between BMI and COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase and Web of science were systematically searched until August 2020. Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results. Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect of covariates were analyzed using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 16 observational studies involving 109,881 patients with COVID-19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that patients with a BMI&#8805;30kg/m2 had a 2.35-fold risk(OR = 2.35, 95%CI = 1.64 - 3.38, P < 0.001) for critical COVID-19 and a 2.68-fold risk for COVID-19 mortality (OR = 2.68, 95%CI = 1.65 -4.37, P < 0.001 ) compared with patients with a BMI <30kg/m2. Subgroup analysis results showed that patients with obesity and age > 60 years was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19(OR = 3.11, 95%CI = 1.73 - 5.61, P < 0.001) and COVID-19 mortality(OR = 3.93, 95%CI = 2.18 - 7.09, P < 0.001). Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age had a significant influence on the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality(Coef.=0.036, p=0.048). Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis showed a linear association between BMI and both critical COVID-19(Pnon-linearity = 0.242) and mortality (Pnon-linearity = 0.116). The risk of critical COVID-19 and mortality increased by 9%(OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.04 -1.14, P < 0.001) and 6%(OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.02 -1.10, P = 0.002) for each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that a linear dose-response association between BMI and both COVID-19 severity and mortality. Further, obesity(BMI&#8805;30kg/m2) was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.","Du, Yanbin; Lv, Yuan; Zha, Wenting; Zhou, Nan; Hong, Xiuqin",Metabolism,648,24

METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alhuwail, Dari; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair",J Med Internet Res,648,1

It is therefore important to evaluate associated cognitive factors. We aimed to obtain first endorsement rate estimates of coronavirus-related conspiracy beliefs in a German-speaking general population sample and investigate whether delusion-related reasoning biases and paranoid ideation are associated with such beliefs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional non-probability online study, quota-sampled for age and gender, with 1684 adults from Germany and German-speaking Switzerland. We assessed general and specific coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, reasoning biases [jumping-to-conclusions bias (JTC), liberal acceptance bias (LA), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), possibility of being mistaken (PM)], and paranoid ideation, using established experimental paradigms and self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Around 10% of our sample endorsed coronavirus-related CT beliefs at least strongly, and another 20% to some degree. Overall endorsement was similar to levels observed in a UK-based study (Freeman et al., 2020b). Higher levels of conspiracy belief endorsement were associated with greater JTC, greater LA, greater BADE, higher PM, and greater paranoid ideation. Associations were mostly small to moderate and best described by non-linear relationships. CONCLUSIONS: A noticeable proportion of our sample recruited in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland endorsed coronavirus conspiracy beliefs strongly or to some degree. These beliefs are associated with reasoning biases studied in delusion research. The non-probability sampling approach limits the generalizability of findings. Future longitudinal and experimental studies investigating conspiracy beliefs along the lines of reasoning are encouraged to validate reasoning aberrations as risk factors.","Kuhn, Sarah Anne Kezia; Lieb, Roselind; Freeman, Daniel; Andreou, Christina; Zander-Schellenberg, Thea",Psychol Med,648,16

The aim of this research was to investigate the pro-environmental behaviour of young tourists in hotels versus at home and the main influencing factors of behavioural intention to reuse towels in hotels. The primary data were collected using a survey that was applied to Romanian young people. Eight hypotheses were formulated and tested through paired samples t-tests, a correlation analysis and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Our results showed the higher pro-environmental conduct of young guests at home than in hotels, both through their general behaviour regarding the reduction of resource consumption and through their specific behaviour of reusing towels. Our empirical findings also highlighted that tourists’ behavioural intention to reuse towels was positively influenced by an eco-friendly attitude, pro-environmental past experiences and habits to reuse towels at home. In order to achieve sustainable tourism, hotel management should convince guests to bring their ecological habits with them, and educational institutions should use specific methods of raising awareness among young people about an environmentally friendly attitude.","Maria-Ana, Georgescu Herman Emilia",Sustainability,648,1

The empirical evidence is generally positive but mixed, and almost exclusively focuses on U.S. data. Using several distinct commodity indexes over the period 1993–2019, we investigate the case of an investor in Canada, a commodity-currency country where equities are already exposed to commodity beta. We use spanning tests and several out-of-sample performance measures for both risk-averse and disappointment-averse investors. Overall, we find that while the diversification potential of commodities was limited in Canada before and during financialization, the post-financialization period offers new opportunities. The evidence suggests that portfolio performance is significantly improved using some, but not all, commodity indexes. Thus, the choice of a relevant commodity index matters as a vehicle for diversification. Finally, compounding an international component to the sectorial diversification of the portfolio can significantly improve its performance.","Gagnon, Marie-Hélène; Manseau, Guillaume; Power, Gabriel J.",Int.

Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal. Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19. The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting.

This can affect the pulmonary health and the gastrointestinal system. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to discuss the impact of probiotics/ prebiotics and supplements on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, especially emerging pathogens. METHODS: The data were searched were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google Patents, and The Lens-Patent using keywords of probiotics and viral respiratory infections in the title, abstract, and keywords. RESULT: Probiotics consumption could decrease the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, such as COVID-19 and simultaneously enhance vaccine efficiency in infectious disease prevention through the immune system enhancement. Probiotics improve the gut microbiota and the immune system via regulating the innate system response and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, treatment with probiotics contributes to the intestinal homeostasis restitution under antibiotic pressure and decreasing the risk of secondary infections due to viral respiratory infections. Probiotics present varied performances in different conditions; thus, promoting their efficacy through combining with supplements (prebiotics, postbiotics, nutraceuticals, berberine, curcumin, lactoferrin, minerals, and vitamins) is important. Several supplements reported to enhance the probiotics' efficacy and their mechanisms as well as probiotics related patents are summarized in this review. Using nanotechnology and microencapsulation techniques can also improve probiotics efficiency. CONCLUSION: Given the global challenge of COVID-19, probiotic/prebiotic and following nutritional guidelines should be regarded seriously.

Unfortunately, due to insufficient resources and awareness in underdeveloped countries, proper and timely PD detection is highly challenged. Besides, all PD patients' symptoms are neither the same nor they all become pronounced at the same stage of the illness. Therefore, this work aims to combine more than one symptom (rest tremor and voice degradation) by collecting data remotely using smartphones and detect PD with the help of a cloud-based machine learning system for telemonitoring the PD patients in the developing countries. METHOD: This proposed system receives rest tremor and vowel phonation data acquired by smartphones with built-in accelerometer and voice recorder sensors. The data are primarily collected from diagnosed PD patients and healthy people for building and optimizing machine learning models that exhibit higher performance. After that, data from newly suspected PD patients are collected, and the trained algorithms are evaluated to detect PD. Based on the majority-vote from those algorithms, PD-detected patients are connected with a nearby neurologist for consultation. Upon receiving patients' feedback after being diagnosed by the neurologist, the system may update the model by retraining using the latest data. Also, the system requests the detected patients periodically to upload new data to track their disease progress. RESULT: The highest accuracy in PD detection using offline data was [Formula: see text] from voice data and [Formula: see text] from tremor data when used separately. In both cases, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) gave the highest accuracy over support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB). The application of maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) feature selection method showed that by selecting different feature sets based on the patient's gender, we could improve the detection accuracy. This study's novelty is the application of ensemble averaging on the combined decisions generated from the analysis of voice and tremor data. The average accuracy of PD detection becomes [Formula: see text] when ensemble averaging was performed on majority-vote from kNN, SVM, and NB. CONCLUSION: The proposed system can detect PD using a cloud-based system for computation, data preserving, and regular monitoring of voice and tremor samples captured by smartphones. Thus, this system can be a solution for healthcare authorities to ensure the older population's accessibility to a better medical diagnosis system in the developing countries, especially in the pandemic situation like COVID-19, when in-person monitoring is minimal.","Sajal, Md Sakibur Rahman; Ehsan, Md Tanvir; Vaidyanathan, Ravi; Wang, Shouyan; Aziz, Tipu; Mamun, Khondaker Abdullah Al",Brain Inform,648,1

We aimed to investigate the effect (if any) of timing of intubation on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. ""Early"" was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while ""late"" as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147). RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p = 0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD - 0.58 days, 95% CI - 3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65). In a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of early/late intubation, intubation without versus with a prior trial of high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was still not associated with a statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality (1128 deaths; 48.9% versus 42.5%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.25, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The synthesized evidence suggests that timing of intubation may have no effect on mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19. These results might justify a wait-and-see approach, which may lead to fewer intubations. Relevant guidelines may therefore need to be updated.","Papoutsi, Eleni; Giannakoulis, Vassilis G; Xourgia, Eleni; Routsi, Christina; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Siempos, Ilias I",Crit Care,648,1

Chromosome 12q24.13, which encodes the 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family of proteins that sense viral genomic RNAs and trigger an antiviral response, is identified as one of the genomic regions that contains SNPs associated with COVID-19 severity. A high-risk SNP identified at the splice acceptor site of OAS1 exon 6 is known to change the proportions of the various splicing isoforms and the activity of the enzyme. MethodsWe employed in-silico motif search and RNA pull-down assay to define a factor responsible for the OAS1 splicing. Next, we rationally selected a candidate for slicing modulator to modulate this splicing. ResultsWe found that inhibition of CDC-like kinase with a small chemical compound induces switching of OAS1 splice isoforms in human lung cells. In this condition, increased resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, enhanced RNA degradation, and transcriptional activation of interferon {beta}1, were also observed. ConclusionsThe results indicate the possibility of using chemical splicing modifiers aided by genome-based precision medicine to boost the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Iida, Kei; Ajiro, Masahiko; Muramoto, Yukiko; Takenaga, Toru; Denawa, Masatsugu; Kurosawa, Ryo; Noda, Takeshi; Hagiwara, Masatoshi",,648,20

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on survival. DESIGN: In a multicenter cohort study of 3239 critically ill adults with COVID-19, the incidence of VTE and major bleeding within 14 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission was evaluated. A target trial emulation in which patients were categorized according to receipt or no receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation in the first 2 days of ICU admission was done to examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on survival. A Cox model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding was used. SETTING: 67 hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID-19 admitted to a participating ICU. MEASUREMENTS: Time to death, censored at hospital discharge, or date of last follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 3239 patients included, the median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 53 to 71 years), and 2088 (64.5%) were men. A total of 204 patients (6.3%) developed VTE, and 90 patients (2.8%) developed a major bleeding event. Independent predictors of VTE were male sex and higher D-dimer level on ICU admission. Among the 2809 patients included in the target trial emulation, 384 (11.9%) received early therapeutic anticoagulation. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 days, patients who received early therapeutic anticoagulation had a similar risk for death as those who did not (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.35]). LIMITATION: Observational design. CONCLUSION: Among critically ill adults with COVID-19, early therapeutic anticoagulation did not affect survival in the target trial emulation.

Sick leave can be seen as an indicator of health in a working age population, and the present study aimed to investigate sick-leave patterns after Covid-19, and potential factors predicting longer sick leave in hospitalised and non-hospitalised people with Covid-19. METHODS: The present study is a comprehensive national registry-based study in Sweden with a 4-month follow-up. All people who started to receive sickness benefits for Covid-19 during March 1 to August 31, 2020, were included. Predictors of sick leave &#8805;1 month and long Covid (&#8805;12 weeks) were analysed with logistic regression in the total population and in separate models depending on inpatient care due to Covid-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,955 people started sick leave for Covid-19 within the inclusion period. The median sick leave was 35 days, 13.3% were on sick leave for long Covid, and 9.0% remained on sick leave for the whole follow-up period. There were 2960 people who received inpatient care due to Covid-19, which was the strongest predictor of longer sick leave. Sick leave the year prior to Covid-19 and older age also predicted longer sick leave. No clear pattern of socioeconomic factors was noted. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of people are on sick leave due to Covid-19. Sick leave may be protracted, and sick leave for long Covid is quite common. The severity of Covid-19 (needing inpatient care), prior sick leave, and age all seem to predict the likelihood of longer sick leave. However, no socioeconomic factor could clearly predict longer sick leave, indicating the complexity of this condition. The group needing long sick leave after Covid-19 seems to be heterogeneous, indicating a knowledge gap.","Westerlind, Emma; Palstam, Annie; Sunnerhagen, Katharina S; Persson, Hanna C",BMC Public Health,648,21

We focus on a SEIR model including a overexposure mechanism and consider awareness as a time-dependent variable whose dynamics is not assigned a priori. Exploting the potential of awareness to produce social distancing and self-isolation among susceptibles, we use it as an indirect control on the class of infective individuals and apply the Z-control approach to detect what trend must awareness display over time in order to eradicate the disease. To this aim, we generalize the Z-control procedure to appropriately treat an uncontrolled model with more than two governing equations. Analytical and numerical investigations on the resulting Z-controlled system show its capability in controlling some representative dynamics within both the backward and the forward scenarios. The awareness variable is qualitatively compared to Google Trends data on Covid-19 that are discussed in the perspective of the Z-control approach, inferring qualitative indications in view of the disease control. The cases of Italy and New Zealand in the first phase of the pandemic are analyzed in detail. The theoretical framework of the Z-control approach can hence offer the chance to reflect on the use of Google Trends as a possible indicator of good management of the epidemic.","Lacitignola, Deborah; Diele, Fasma",Chaos Solitons Fractals,648,26

This has necessitated urgent reconfiguration within inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) services to ensure safety of patients and staff and seamless continuity of care provision. AIM: To describe the adaptations made by a large inflammatory bowel disease service, caring for over 3,500 IBD patients, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A diary record of responses to the pandemic were logged, and meeting minutes were reviewed. Data were recorded from IBD advice lines, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting minutes, infusion unit attendances, and electronic referral systems for the 8-week period from 9 March 2020 until 2 May 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: The IBD service at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (IBD Hull) instituted rapid structural and functional changes to the service. Outpatient services were suspended and substituted by virtual consultations, and inpatient services were reduced and moved to ambulatory care where possible. The delivery of biologic and immunomodulatory therapies was significantly modified to ensure patient and staff safety. There was a substantial increase in IBD advice line calls. CONCLUSION: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic required a prompt response, regular reassessment and planning, and continues to do so. We share our experience in of the successful adaptations made to our IBD service.","Gonzalez, Haidee A; Myers, Sally; Whitehead, Emma; Pattinson, Alisson; Stamp, Katie; Turnbull, Jack; Fory, Rebecca; Featherstone, Bethia; Wilkinson, Amy; Lisle, Jessica; Haire, Greg; Henderson, Eileen; Sebastian, Shaji",,648,1

With more than 33 million confirmed cases and over a million deaths, global health organizations are still a long way from fully containing the pandemic. This pandemic has raised serious questions about the emergency preparedness of health agencies, not only in terms of treatment of an unseen disease, but also in identifying its early symptoms. In the particular case of COVID-19, several studies have indicated that chest radiography images of the infected patients show characteristic abnormalities. However, at the onset of a given pandemic, such as COVID-19, there may not be sufficient data for the affected cases to train models for their robust detection. Hence, supervised classification is ill-posed for this problem because the time spent in collecting large amounts of infected peoples' data could lead to the loss of human lives and delays in preventive interventions. Therefore, we formulate this problem within a one-class classification framework, in which the data for healthy patients is abundantly available, whereas no training data is present for the class of interest (COVID-19 in our case). To solve this problem, we present COVIDomaly, a convolutional autoencoder framework to detect unseen COVID-19 cases from the chest radiographs. We tested two settings on a publicly available dataset (COVIDx) by training the model on chest X-rays from (i) only healthy adults, and (ii) healthy and other non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and detected COVID-19 as an anomaly. After performing 3-fold cross validation, we obtain a pooled ROC-AUC of 0.7652 and 0.6902 in the two settings respectively. These results are very encouraging and pave the way towards research for ensuring emergency preparedness in future pandemics, especially the ones that could be detected from chest X-rays.","Khoshbakhtian, Faraz; Ashraf, Ahmed Bilal; Khan, Shehroz S.",,648,24

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of hospitalised patients diagnosed with COVID-19. SETTING: Data from all hospitals across Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 522 167 hospitalised patients in Brazil by 14 December 2020 with severe acute respiratory illness, and a confirmed diagnosis for COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of symptoms and comorbidities was compared by clinical outcomes and intensive care unit (ICU) admission status. Survival was assessed using Kaplan Meier survival estimates. Risk factors associated with in-hospital death were evaluated with multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Of the 522 167 patients included in this study, 56.7% were discharged, 0.002% died of other causes, 30.7% died of causes associated with COVID-19 and 10.2% remained hospitalised. The median age of patients was 61 years (IQR, 47-73), and of non-survivors 71 years (IQR, 60-80); 292 570 patients (56.0%) were men.

Oxygen delivery by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a feasible option that enables a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and may theoretically reduce the need for intubation compared to HFNC but direct comparative evidence is lacking. METHODS: We plan to perform an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomised trial at an intermediate-level COVID-19 cohort ward in Helsingborg Hospital, southern Sweden. We have estimated a required sample size of 120 patients randomised 1:1 to HFNC or Helmet CPAP to achieve 90% power to detect superiority at a 0.05 significance level regarding the primary outcome of ventilator free days (VFD) within 28 days using a Mann-Whitney U test. Patient recruitment is planned to being June 2020 and be completed in the first half of 2021. DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that the use of Helmet CPAP will reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to the use of HFNC without having a negative effect on survival.

Understanding the mechanisms for transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to preventing further spread, but there is confusion over the meaning of 'airborne' whenever transmission is discussed. Scientific ambivalence originates from evidence published many years ago which has generated mythological beliefs that obscure current thinking. This article collates and explores some of the most commonly held dogmas on airborne transmission in order to stimulate revision of the science in the light of current evidence. Six 'myths' are presented, explained and ultimately refuted on the basis of recently published papers and expert opinion from previous work related to similar viruses. There is little doubt that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via a range of airborne particle sizes subject to all the usual ventilation parameters and human behaviour. Experts from specialties encompassing aerosol studies, ventilation, engineering, physics, virology and clinical medicine have joined together to produce this review to consolidate the evidence for airborne transmission mechanisms, and offer justification for modern strategies for prevention and control of COVID-19 in health care and the community.","Tang, J W; Bahnfleth, W P; Bluyssen, P M; Buonanno, G; Jimenez, J L; Kurnitski, J; Li, Y; Miller, S; Sekhar, C; Morawska, L; Marr, L C; Melikov, A K; Nazaroff, W W; Nielsen, P V; Tellier, R; Wargocki, P; Dancer, S J",J Hosp Infect,648,13

The condition of an obese female critical COVID-19 sufferer progressively worsened in the initial period after admission. According to her symptoms and examination reports, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were timely conducted and meanwhile high-dose sedatives and analgesics were administrated. In the later therapeutic phase, however, sedative and analgesic dosages were gradually reduced, and psychological and rehabilitative therapies were conducted, concomitantly with enhancement of airway care to facilitate sputum expectoration. Eventually, the endotracheal tube was feasibly removed after intubation for 18 days and subsequently replaced with noninvasive ventilation and a high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Intensive airway care alongside psychological and rehabilitative therapies can shorten the mechanical ventilation time and improve the prognosis of COVID-19 sufferers.","Jiang, Yichun; Chen, Jun; Cen, Fulan; Li, Xu; Song, Zhi; Peng, Mian; Liu, Xueyan",Am J Emerg Med,648,26

We aimed to develop and evaluate an emergency system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients stay in their homes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patient's condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW® environment that can provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation (SpO2), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and 12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented reduced SpO2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%) presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored patients presented events of desaturation (SpO2<92%). The experimental results were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidence that the proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserving hospital resources for those most in need while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.","Motta, Leonardo Pereira; Silva, Pedro Paulo Ferreira da; Borguezan, Bruno Max; Amaral, Jorge Luis Machado do; Milagres, Lucimar Gonçalves; Bóia, Márcio Neves; Ferraz, Marcos Rochedo; Mogami, Roberto; Nunes, Rodolfo Acatauassú; Melo, Pedro Lopes de",PLoS One,648,29

Given the potential complexity of COVID-19 illnesses, a multifactorial causation is likely, but several studies have focused on infection-induced coagulopathy. Procoagulant states are commonly found in association with the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies. The correlation of the latter with thrombosis and/or clinical severity remains controversial. Although measures of antiphospholipid antibodies most commonly include assessments for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-ß2-glycoprotein-I antibodies, lesser common antibodies have been detected, and there remains speculation that other yet undiscovered autoimmune thrombotic events may yet be found. The recent discovery of post-vaccination thromboses associated with platelet factor 4 antibody has created another level of concern. The pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibodies and their role in COVID-19-related thrombosis deserves further attention. The multifactorial nature of thrombosis associated with both infection and vaccination should continue to be studied as new events unfold.

The study objective is to develop and validate individualized mortality risk scores based on the anonymized clinical and laboratory data at admission and determine the probability of Deaths at 7 and 28 days. Data of 1393 admitted patients (Expired-8.54%) was collected from six Apollo Hospital centers (from April to July 2020) using a standardized template and electronic medical records. 63 Clinical and Laboratory parameters were studied based on the patient's initial clinical state at admission and laboratory parameters within the first 24 h. The Machine Learning (ML) modelling was performed using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Algorithm. 'Time to event' using Cox Proportional Hazard Model was used and combined with XGB Algorithm. The prospective validation cohort was selected of 977 patients (Expired-8.3%) from six centers from July to October 2020. The Clinical API for the Algorithm is http://20.44.39.47/covid19v2/page1.php being used prospectively.

Previously published studies paid little attention to Arab countries, which has a population of over 440 million. In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects.Methods: An online survey in Arabic was conducted from 14-Jan-2021 to 29-Jan-2021. It consisted of 17 questions capturing demographic data, acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes towards the need for COVID-19 vaccination and associated health policies, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy. R software- v.4.0.2 was used for data analysis and visualization.Results: The survey recruited 36,220 eligible participants (61.1% males, 38.9% females, mean age 32.6±10.8 years) from all the 23 Arab countries and territories (83.4%) and 122 other countries (16.6%). Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness. Interactive representation of our results is posted on our project website at https://mainapp.shinyapps.io/CVHAA.Conclusion: Our results show higher vaccine hesitancy and refusal among Arab subjects, related mainly to distrust and concerns about side effects. Health authorities and Arab scientific community have to transparently address these concerns to improve vaccine acceptance.Funding: This study received no funding.","Qunaibi, Eyad A; Helmy, Mohamed; Basheti, Iman; Sultan, Iyad",eLife (Cambridge),648,22

It aims to increase knowledge and awareness about the moral relevance of the outbreak, especially as regards the balance of equity and dignity in clinical practice and patient's care. METHOD: According to the argument-based review framework, we started our research from the following two questions: what are the ethical principles adopted by the ethical guidelines produced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak related to resource allocation? And what are the practical consequences in terms of 'priority' of access, access criteria, management of the decision-making process and patient care? RESULTS: Twenty-two ethical guidelines met our inclusion criteria and the results of our analysis are organized into 4 ethical concepts and related arguments: the equity principle and emerging ethical theories; triage criteria; respecting patient's dignity, and decision making and quality of care. CONCLUSION: Further studies can investigate the practical consequences of the application of the guidelines described, in terms of quality of care and health care professionals' moral distress.","Perin, Marta; De Panfilis, Ludovica",BMC Med Ethics,648,16

METHODS: In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the Revinax® Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. RESULTS: In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. DISCUSSION: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic.

Both virus and host-derived microRNA (miRNA) play essential roles in the pathology of virus infection. This study aims to uncover the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity from the perspective of miRNA. We scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNA genes and miRNA targets and conducted in vivo experiments to validate the virus-encoded miRNAs and their regulatory role on the putative targets. One of such virus-encoded miRNAs, MR147-3p, was overexpressed that resulted in significantly decreased transcript levels of all of the predicted targets in human, i.e., EXOC7, RAD9A, and TFE3 in the virus-infected cells. The analysis showed that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Additionally, the genomic mutation of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the changed miRNA repository and targets, suggesting a possible role of miRNAs in the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 during its evolution. This study provided a comprehensive view of the miRNA-involved regulatory system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating possible antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 through intervening miRNA regulation.","Liu, Zhi; Wang, Jianwei; Ge, Yiyue; Xu, Yuyu; Guo, Mengchen; Mi, Kai; Xu, Rui; Pei, Yang; Zhang, Qiankun; Luan, Xiaoting; Hu, Zhibin; Chi, Ying; Liu, Xingyin",J Biomed Res,648,16

Serology testing allows for the detection of asymptomatic infections and 19-COVID cases once the virus has been cleared. We analyzed the usefulness of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test of Autobio and tried to correlate its pattern with the severity of COVID19 infection. METHODS: We analyzed the accuracy and clinical usefulness of a point-of-care IgM and/or IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 in 35 COVID-19 patients [12 (34.3%) mild-moderate and 23 (65.7%) severe-critical] admitted to a field hospital in Madrid, as well as in 5 controls. RESULTS: The mean time from the first day of symptoms to the antibody test was 28 days (SD: 8.7), similar according to the severity of the disease. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ showed the corresponding IgG positivity, while these results were negative in all control individuals. A total of 26 (74%) cases also presented with positive IgM, 19 (83%) were severe-critical cases and 7 (58%) were mild-moderate cases. The IgM response lasted longer in the severe critical cases (mean: 29.7 days; SD: 8.4) compared to the moderate cases (mean: 21.2 days; SD: 2.0).. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid serology tests are useful for the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 (mainly IgG detection) and may also be correlated with the severity of the infection (based on IgM detection).","Candel, F J; Viñuela-Prieto, J M; González Del Castillo, J; Barreiro García, P; Fragiel Saavedra, M; Hernández Píriz, A; Jiménez Virumbrales, D; Canora Lebrato, J; García de Casasola, G; Gil Prieto, R; San-Román Montero, J; Ortega Anselmi, J; Barba Martín, R; Prados Roa, F; Marco Martínez, J; Zapatero Gaviria, A",Rev. esp. quimioter,648,20

Thus, analysis of various hematological and immunological parameters may be helpful for COVID-19 infection evaluation for risks involved and effectiveness in management. Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the role of various hematological and immunological parameters in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was performed on 300 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis. All participants of the study were divided into – (a) Group I: patients with mild symptoms and normal chest radiographic findings;(b) patients with moderate disease presenting with fever and cough along with other respiratory symptoms, and (c) patients suffering from severe disease. Data collection was done from all patients at the time of hospital admission for hematological and immunological parameters – (a) total leukocyte count, (b) lymphocyte count, (c) lymphocytic subset count, (d) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, (e) D-dimer, (f) C-reactive protein (CRP), and (g) ferritin levels. SPSS 22.0 software was used for determining P values by independent t-test and Chi-square test. Results: The median age was 65 years (interquartile range –57–71 years). While comparing white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, extremely significant P values were obtained. D-dimers and ferritin levels demonstrated extremely significant P values while both LDH and CRPs showed statistical significance. Correlation of lymphocytic subsets showed extreme significance in total lymphocyte counts in mild-to-moderate as compared to severely infected patients while both CD4+ and CD8+ counts demonstrated statistical significance in mild-moderate infected cases. Statistical significance was noted in D-dimer, CRP, and LDH levels also.

Wearable devices often carry sensitive information from users which are exposed to security and privacy risks. Moreover, users have always had the concern of being counterfeited between the fabrication process and vendors' storage. Hence, not only securing personal data is becoming a crucial obligation, but also device verification is another challenge. To address biometrics authentication and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) need to be put in place to mitigate the security and privacy of the users. Among biometrics modalities, Electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric has become popular as it can authenticate patients and monitor the patient's vital signs. However, researchers have recently started to study the vulnerabilities of the ECG biometric systems and tried to address the issues of spoofing. Moreover, most of the wearable is enabled with CPU and memories. Thus, volatile memory-based (NVM) PUF can be easily placed in the device to avoid counterfeit. However, many research challenged the unclonability characteristics of PUFs. Thus, a careful study on these attacks should be sufficient to address the need.

ISARIC-compliant SARI reporting was successfully implemented by leveraging the existing PRICE infrastructure in all 49 member intensive care units (ICUs), enabling clinicians, operational leads, and established stakeholders with responsibilities for coordinating the pandemic response to access real-time information on suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases (N=592 as of May 2020) via secure registry portals. ICU occupancy rates, use of ICU resources, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and ICU outcomes were reported through registry dashboards. This information has facilitated coordination of critical care resources, health care worker training, and discussions on treatment strategies. The PRICE network is now being recruited to international multicenter clinical trials regarding COVID-19 management, leveraging the registry platform. Systematic and standardized reporting of SARI is feasible in LMICs. Existing registry platforms can be adapted for pandemic research, surveillance, and resource planning.","Hashmi, Madiha; Beane, Abi; Murthy, Srinivas; Dondorp, Arjen M; Haniffa, Rashan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,648,16

However, in the early 2000s, the effectiveness of LIT was questioned. Recently, meta-analyses have observed the effectiveness and safety of LIT in treating couples with RM. Some studies evaluated the use of LIT in recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in in vitro fertilization cycles. METHODS: This systematic and narrative review evaluated the data available in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of the use of LIT. Searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted, using the following keywords: ""recurrent miscarriage,"" ""lymphocyte immunotherapy,"" and ""recurrent implantation failure"". RESULTS: This review describes the historical aspects of LIT and discusses its protocols, mechanisms of action, side effects, complications, and current evidence of the effectiveness in cases of reproductive failure. It also discusses the use of LIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and new immunological therapies. CONCLUSION: In the vast majority of studies, the use of LIT for RM couples has shown an improvement in pregnancy outcomes. The most of the current studies that support the evidence are quasi-experimental, with few randomized, double-blind studies (Level of evidence III). However, the current evidence are not convincing for the use of LIT in RIF patients.","Cavalcante, Marcelo Borges; Sarno, Manoel; Barini, Ricardo",Am J Reprod Immunol,648,16

The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = -0.0100, 95% CI: -0.0125, -0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Shi, Peng; Dong, Yinqiao; Yan, Huanchang; Zhao, Chenkai; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Wei; He, Miao; Tang, Shixing; Xi, Shuhua",Sci Total Environ,648,16

However, little is known about seasonality of sCoVs on a global scale. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of data on seasonality of sCoVs. We compared seasonality of sCoVs with influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We modeled monthly activity of sCoVs using site-specific weather data. RESULTS: We included sCoV seasonality data in 40 sites from 21 countries. sCoVs were prevalent in winter months in most temperate sites except for China, whereas sCoVs tended to be less seasonal in China and in tropical sites. In temperate sites excluding China, 53.1% of annual sCoV cases (interquartile range [IQR], 34.6%-61.9%) occurred during influenza season and 49.6% (IQR, 30.2%-60.2%) of sCoV cases occurred during respiratory syncytial virus season. Low temperature combined with high relative humidity was associated with higher sCoV activity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that provides an overview of the global seasonality of sCoVs. Our findings offer clues to the possible postpandemic circulating season of SARS-CoV-2 and add to the knowledge pool necessary for postpandemic preparedness for SARS-CoV-2.","Li, You; Wang, Xin; Nair, Harish",J Infect Dis,648,20

On the face of ongoing death and destruction, the urgent need for the discovery of a vaccine against the virus is paramount. This study resorted to the emerging discipline of immunoinformatics in order to design a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Various immunoinformatics tools were utilized to predict T and B lymphocyte epitopes. The epitopes were channeled through a filtering pipeline comprised of antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cytokine inducibility evaluation with the goal of selecting epitopes capable of generating both T and B cell-mediated immune responses. Molecular docking simulation between the epitopes and their corresponding MHC molecules was carried out. 13 epitopes, a highly immunogenic adjuvant, elements for proper sub-cellular trafficking, a secretion booster, and appropriate linkers were combined for constructing the vaccine. The vaccine was found to be antigenic, almost neutral at physiological pH, non-toxic, non-allergenic, capable of generating a robust immune response and had a decent worldwide population coverage. Based on these parameters, this design can be considered a promising choice for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Ahammad, Ishtiaque; Lira, Samia Sultana",Int J Biol Macromol,648,1

A common approach in the literature is to solve an approximate model, and to use a simulation to evaluate the true objective value of one or more solutions. We propose a new approach -- Branch-and-Simulate -- for integrating simulation into the optimization model itself. Branch-and-Simulate is a variant of logic-based Benders decomposition where we run a simulation at each incumbent solution to the master problem. The simulation data is then used to guide the trajectory of the optimization model itself, via Benders cuts. We test the approach on a class of stochastic resource allocation problems with monotonic performance measures, and derive strong Benders cuts which are valid for all problems of this form. We consider two concrete examples: an airport check-in counter allocation problem, and a nursing home shift scheduling problem. Whereas previously these problems could only be solved approximately, we solve challenging instances to optimality within a reasonable amount of time. In the appendix, we will also use Branch-and-Simulate to approximately solve an ambulance location problem.","Forbes, Michael; Harris, Mitchell; Jansen, Marijn; Schoot, Femke van der; Taimre, Thomas",,648,16

In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created several new challenges-particularly for frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assessed the sleep quality (SQ) among HCWs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an English-language online survey. The participants were invited via a web link sent using social network platforms. It included sociodemographic- and profession-related characteristics. COVID-19-associated risks were assessed (e.g., being on the front line, doing swabs, satisfaction about protective equipment, and management protocols). Assessment of SQ was done using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and various medical errors were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 217 HCWs completed the survey with mean (±standard deviation) age of 35.8 (±7.3) years; 56.2% were male, 18.43% had comorbidities, and 61.75% experienced sleep difficulties before the COVID-19 crisis. This work reports a 78.8% prevalence of poor SQ, with the mean (standard deviation) global PSQI score of 9.36 (±4.4). HCWs with poor sleep experienced more positive comorbid profile (23.64% versus 6.52%, p=0.01). Working on the front lines of COVID-19 was associated with poor sleep (69.59% versus 47.83%, p=0.006). Among the participants, 77.42% performed medical errors, particularly not checking for drug allergies (17.97%), dispensing medication with incomplete instructions (20.74%), providing incorrect doses or overdosing (14.75%), incorrectly explaining the use of medication (9.22%), and prescribing a drug to the wrong patient (10.14%). CONCLUSION: This nationwide survey reported high prevalence of poor SQ among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being an HCW on the front lines of COVID-19 and doing swabs with a positive comorbidity was associated with poor sleep.","Abbas, Ahmad; Al-Otaibi, Torki; Gheith, Osama Ashry; Nagib, Ayman Maher; Farid, Mahmoud M; Walaa, Mohammad",Turk Thorac J,648,17

The sample included 566 volunteers from Spain (73.5% women; M = 40.2 years, SD = 12.8). An ad hoc questionnaire was applied to request socioeconomic data and dispositional optimism (LOT-R). Resilience and psychological well-being were, respectively, evaluated by the Ryff scale and the Wagnild and Young scale. The results show that older and people with higher educational levels are more optimistic and have better psychological well-being. Well-being is also greater in married, divorced and widowed people and in those who have lived in outdoor spaces. However, those with spaced housing were more optimistic. Finally, it was found that the most optimistic people have better psychological well-being and that this is increased by the mediation process exercised by the ability to overcome adversity, provided age and educational level are controlled. It can be concluded that the design of preventive programs focused on improving strengths, positive emotions and skills in the population would be convenient to protect mental health.","Zayas, Antonio; Merchán-Clavellino, Ana; López-Sánchez, José Antonio; Guil, Rocío",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,1

Standard treatment involves immediate excision of all necrotic tissue, aggressive antibiotic coverage, and supportive medical care. Still, the infection is commonly fatal or disfiguring. Wound treatment with disinfected blowfly larvae (maggot debridement therapy or MDT) has been shown to be highly effective, with multiple studies demonstrating effective debridement, disinfection, and promotion of granulation tissue. MDT also has been associated with preservation of viable tissue and minimised blood loss. This report describes a prospective clinical study of MDT for Fournier's gangrene aimed to test the hypothesis that early use of maggots could decrease the number of surgical treatments required to treat Fournier's gangrene. Subjects were provided with one initial surgical excision, followed by debridement using only medical grade Lucilia sericata larvae. Only two subjects were enrolled, both diabetic men. Intensive care and culture-directed antimicrobial coverage were administered as usual. Maggot debridement was associated with the disappearance of necrotic tissue, control of infection and granulation tissue growth. In both subjects, wounds healed without requiring further surgical resection or anatomical reconstruction. Maggot therapy decreased the number of surgical procedures that otherwise would have been necessary, and led to favourable outcomes.","Fonseca-Muñoz, Alicia; Sarmiento-Jiménez, Hugo E; Pérez-Pacheco, Rafael; Thyssen, Patricia J; Sherman, Ronald A",Int. wound j,648,20

A better understanding of household food wasting during the pandemic is needed to improve the management of waste and develop best practices for municipal waste management programs under crisis circumstances. A waste composition study was undertaken with 100 single-family households across the city of London, Ontario, Canada to determine the quantity and composition of household food waste disposed in June 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines how household demographic, socioeconomic, and neighbourhood food environment characteristics influence household food wasting. On average, each household sent 2.81 kg of food waste to landfill per week, of which 52% was classified as avoidable food waste and 48% unavoidable food waste. The quantity and composition of household food waste was found to be strongly influenced by the number of people and children in a household, and somewhat influenced by socioeconomic factors and neighbourhood food environment characteristics, including the availability, density, and proximity of retail food outlets.","Everitt, Haley van der Werf Paul Seabrook Jamie A.; Wray, Alexander Gilliland Jason A.",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,648,16

Design Survey that included a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). The survey design was informed using policy documents, social media analysis and with input from remote think aloud interviews with members of the public (n=23). Setting Nation-wide survey across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Representative sample in terms of age and sex for each of the nations recruited using an online panel between 29th October and 12th December 2020. Participants Individuals who are over 18 years old. A total of 4120 adults completed the survey (1112 in England, 848 in Northern Ireland, 1143 in Scotland and 1098 in Wales). Primary outcome measure Adult preferences for, and trade-offs between, type of lockdown restrictions, length of lockdown, postponement of routine healthcare, excess deaths, impact on ability to buy things and unemployment. Results In all four countries, one out of five respondents were willing to reduce excess deaths at all costs. The majority of adults are willing to accept higher excess deaths if this means lockdowns that are less strict, shorter and do not postpone routine healthcare. On average, respondents in England were willing to accept a higher increase in excess deaths to have less strict lockdown restrictions introduced compared to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, respectively. Conclusions The majority of the UK population is willing to accept the increase in excess deaths associated with introducing less strict lockdown restrictions. The acceptability of different restriction scenarios varies according to the features of the lockdown and across countries. Authorities can use information about trade-off preferences to inform the introduction of different lockdown restriction levels, and design compensation policies that maximise societal welfare.","Loria-Rebolledo, Luis Enrique; Ryan, Mandy; Watson, Verity; Genie, Mesfin G; Sakowsky, Ruben Andreas; Powell, Daniel; Paranjothy, Shantini",,648,24

The two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved from lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest (VOI). On the other hand, epidemiologically relevant B.1.1.33 deriving lineages have not been described so far. Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021.

This cross-sectional investigation aimed to evaluate associations between religious/spiritual factors and mental health symptoms among community residents in a southern US state. In particular, we focused on perceptions of God's distance, a salient aspect of religious/spiritual struggle that has received little scrutiny in health research. METHODS: Participants included 551 respondents assessed during a period of gradual reopening but rising infection rates. Mental health outcomes were assessed using standardized measures of generalized anxiety, depression, and trauma symptoms. Perceptions of an affirming relationship with God, anger at God, and disappointment at God's distance were evaluated using an adapted version of the Attitudes-Toward-God Scale-9. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses that accounted for pandemic-related and demographic factors, positive relationships with God were related to diminished symptoms on all three mental heatlh indices (all p's &#8804;.003), whereas disappointment with God's distance was associated with more pronounced difficulties (all p's &#8804;.014). LIMTATIONS: The cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that perceived relationships with God are tied to clinically relevant mental health outcomes during periods of major upheaval. Disappointment with God's distance may be an important, understudied dimension of religious/spiritual struggle meriting further investigation.","Sherman, Allen C; Park, Crystal L; Salsman, John M; Williams, Mark L; Amick, Benjamin C; Hudson, Teresa J; Messias, Erick L; Simonton-Atchley, Stephanie",J Affect Disord,648,16

COVID 19 tends to have poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Additionally, we have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area. CASE REPORT: A 47-year old female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.Management and outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment despite active COVID 19 medication. DISCUSSION: To best of our knowledge, this is the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about 'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature. There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19. We consider that our case might contribute to the literature in terms of management of cancer patients on targeted therapy during COVID 19 antiviral treatment.

We investigated and verified the accuracy of 12 relatively low-cost sensor models that retail for less than $45 and are advertised as infection control measures on a major e-commerce site. Our results indicate that 25% of the tested sensors can be used to identify trends in CO2 concentration, if correctly calibrated. However, 67% of sensors did not respond to the presence of CO2, which suggests that a type of pseudo-technique is used to display the CO2 concentration. We recommend that these sensors are not suitable for infection prevention purposes. We also found that all 67% of the sensors that did not respond to CO2 responded strongly to alcohol. Owing to the widespread use of alcohol in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, sensors that react to alcohol can display inaccurate values, resulting in inappropriate ventilation behavior. Therefore, we strongly recommended that these sensors not be used. Based on our results, we offer practical recommendations to the average consumer, who does not have special measuring equipment, on how to identify inaccurate CO2 sensors.","Ishigaki, Yo; Enoki, Koji; Yokogawa, Shinji",,648,29

Although the implementation of legislation, policies, and a package of integrated programmes and projects to cater to the needs of older persons had helped them to uplift their status, more has to be done to stem the increase of the reach of laws in a more fruitful manner. AIM: To develop a colloquial structured Healthcare Policies & Programmes Awareness Questionnaire and assess the awareness about the government healthcare provisions and benefits available for senior citizens among health professionals, older patients, and their caregivers. METHODS: This study was conducted in two phases, the development of the questionnaire consisting of relevant healthcare national policies and programmes followed by a cross sectional pilot study on 335 participants. RESULTS: The level of awareness was only 45.6% among health professionals followed by 26.4% & 22.2% of awareness among the caregivers and the older adults respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a huge gap between the healthcare providers and healthcare takers knowledge due to which the preventive and promotive care of older adults is poor in our country. There is a need to strengthen institutions and mechanism that can more systematically promote interaction between researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders who can influence the uptake of the research findings in a synergistic manner.","Dey, A B; Bajpai, S; Pandey, M; Singh, P; Chaterjee, P; Sati, H C; Pandey, R M",J. healthc. qual. res,648,16

As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. leprae-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection have yet to be fully investigated. The goal of the present viewpoint is to describe some of the similarities that may be found between COVID-19 and leprosy disease in the context of neutrophilic biology.","Schmitz, Veronica; Dos Santos, Jéssica Brandão",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,648,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who signed informed consent to participate in the study. The erythrocyte membrane -adrenoreactivity index (-ARM) was determined in venous blood samples upon admission to the intensive care unit, one day after admission, 6 and 12 months after the index MI was transferred using the BETA-ARM-AGAT reagent kit (Agat-Med, Russia). RESULTS: According to the results of dynamics assessment of -APM during the first day, patients included in the study were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (n=14) included patients who had an increase in -APM in the first day, and group 2 (n=21) included patients in whom -ARM either did not change or decreased. At the time of admission to the hospital in the formed groups, there were no differences in the -APM index and clinical and anamnestic characteristics. A day after hospitalization, the value of -APM in group 1 significantly exceeded the same indicator in group 2 (p=0.02). At the periods of 6 and 12 months, the -APM indices in the groups did not differ. In the 2nd group of patients, the progression of chronic heart failure to one or more functional classes (NYHA) was significantly more often compared with the 1st group. CONCLUSION: The study showed that on the first day in patients with AMI, both an increase and a decrease in the activity of the sympathoadrenal system are possible with a further leveling of these differences over the next year. For a group of patients with decreased activity of sympathoadrenal system on the first day, a more unfavorable course of heart failure in the post-infarction period is characteristic.","Rebrova, T Y; Muslimova, E F; Alexandrenko, V A; Afanasiev, S A; Garganeeva, A A; Maksimov, I V",Ter Arkh,648,1

Data on the relationship between public health restrictions, mobility, and pandemic growth has so far been conflicting. Objective : We assessed the relationship between public health restriction tiers, mobility, and COVID-19 spread in five contiguous public health units (PHUs) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Ontario, Canada. Methods : Weekly effective reproduction number (R (t) ) was calculated based on daily cases in each of the five GTA public health units between March 1, 2020, and March 19, 2021. A global mobility index (GMI) for each PHU was calculated using Google Mobility data. Segmented regressions were used to assess changes in the behaviour of R (t) over time. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between GMI and R (t) for each PHU and mobility regression coefficients for each mobility variable, accounting for time lag of 0, 7, and 14 days. Results : In all PHUs except Toronto, the most rapid decline in R (t) occurred in the first two weeks of the first province-wide lockdown, and this was followed by a slight trend to increased R (t) as restrictions decreased. This trend reversed in all PHUs between September 6 (th) and October 10 (th) after which R (t) decreased slightly over time without respect to public health restriction tier. GMI began to increase in the first wave even before restrictions were decreased. This secular trend to increased mobility continued into the summer, driven by increased mobility to recreational spaces. The decline in GMI as restrictions were reintroduced coincides with decreasing mobility to parks after September. During the first wave, the correlation coefficients between global mobility and R (t) were significant (p&lt;0.01) in all PHUs 14 days after lockdown, indicating moderate to high correlation between decreased mobility and decreased viral reproduction rates, and reflecting that the incubation period brings in a time-lag effect of human mobility on R (t) . In the second wave, this relationship was attenuated, and was only significant in Toronto and Durham at 14 days after lockdown. Conclusions : The association between mobility and COVID-19 spread was stronger in the first wave than the second wave. Public health restriction tiers did not alter the existing secular trend toward decreasing R (t) over time.","Dainton, C.; Hay, A.",,648,1

Pakistan is one of these countries. A government mandated lockdown can have mitigating psychological effects on young adults, out of which a large fraction is made up of students. This study aims to investigate the correlations between changes in sleep pattern, perception of time, and digital media usage. Furthermore, it explores the impact of these changes on the mental health of students of different educational levels. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire, from March 24 to April 26, 2020. The survey was targeted at students and 251 responses were obtained. It was a 5-section long questionnaire. The first section inquired about demographics of participants. Each of the other 4 section were devoted to changes in sleep pattern, perception of time flow, digital media usage and mental health status of students. Close ended questions with multiple choice responses, dichotomous, interval and 4-point Likert scales were used in the construction of the survey questionnaire. Chi square, T-tests multinomial and binary logistic regression were used as primary statistical tests. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Out of 251 adolescents that participated in our study, the majority (70.2%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 19.40+/- 1.62 years. Two-thirds of the respondents did not have much trouble falling asleep (66.5%). The analysis found no significant association between longer sleep periods and procrastination level (p = 0.054). Nearly three-fourths (72.9%) of our participants felt that getting through quarantine would have been more difficult if they did not have any electronic gadgets. Of these, a majority (85.8%) had a general feeling of tiredness and lacked motivation (p = 0.023). Additionally, a large number of students (69.7%) had reported that time is seemingly moving faster. A significant relationship between increased usage of electronic items and longer sleep periods was also noted (p = 0.005). With respect to the level of education statistically significant values were noted for alarm use both before and after quarantine began (p = 0.021 and p = 0.004, respectively). Further analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the median difference of time spent on social media before the outbreak (3.0+/-32.46) and time spent on social media after the outbreak (6.0+/-3.52) in a single day (p=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Our research has revealed that due to the lockdown imposed by the government in response to COVID-19, the sleeping patterns of the students was affected the most. Our findings show that the increase in use of social media applications led to a widespread increase in the length of sleep, worsening of sleep habits (people sleeping at much later hours than usual), and a general feeling of tiredness. A general lack of recollection regarding what day of the week it was, as well as a change in the perceived flow of time were also notable. All these findings indicate the decline in mental health of students due to the lockdown. Promoting better sleep routines, minimizing the use of digital media, and encouragement of students to take up more hobbies could collectively improve the health and mood of students in self quarantine.","Ali, Abraish; Siddiqui, Asad Ali; Arshad, Muhammad Sameer; Iqbal, Fizza; Arif, Taha Bin",Ann. med.-psychol,648,3

There have been extensive researches on how the ß-CoVs nsp1 regulates viral virulence by inhibiting host protein synthesis, but the regulatory mechanism of the &#945;-CoVs nsp1 is still unclear. Here, we report the 2.1-Å full-length crystal structure of nsp1 in emerging porcine SADS-CoV and the 1.8-Å full-length crystal structure of nsp1 in the highly lethal cat FIPV. Although they belong to different subtypes of &#945;-CoVs, these viruses all have a bucket-shaped fold composed of six ß-sheets, similar to the crystal structure of PEDV and TGEV nsp1. Comparing the above four structures, we found that the structure of &#945;-CoVs nsp1 in the same subtype was more conserved. We then selected mammalian cells that were treated with SADS-CoV and FIPV nsp1 for RNA sequencing analysis and found that nsp1 had a specific inhibitory effect on interferon (IFN) and cell cycle genes. Using the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) assay and Western blotting, we confirmed that seven representative &#945;-CoVs nsp1s could significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT1-S727 and interfere with the effect of IFN-I. Moreover, the cell cycle experiment confirmed that &#945;-CoVs nsp1 could encourage host cells to stay in the G0/G1 phase. Based on these findings, we not only greatly improved the crystal structure data on &#945;-CoVs nsp1, but we also speculated that &#945;-CoVs nsp1 regulated host proliferation and immune evasion-related biological functions by inhibiting the synthesis of host proteins, thus creating an environment conducive to the virus.","Shen, Zhou; Yang, Yiling; Yang, Siqi; Zhang, Guangxu; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F; Peng, Guiqing",Viruses,648,20

395843,395843,395843,Design of Fear and Anxiety of COVID-19 Assessment Tool in Spanish Adult Population,17.674034,4.307611,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound global impact on governments, health care systems, economies, and populations around the world. Within the East Asia and Pacific region, some countries have mitigated the spread of the novel coronavirus effectively and largely avoided severe negative consequences, while others still struggle with containment. As the second wave reaches East Asia and the Pacific, it becomes more evident that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed to track recent shifts, rates of increase, and persistence associated with the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk, persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and those countries who are managing the pandemic successfully. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed. We provide novel indicators to measure disease transmission. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 330 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in East Asia and the Pacific as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: The standard surveillance metrics for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar were concerning as they had the largest new caseloads at 4301, 2588, and 1387, respectively. When looking at the acceleration of new COVID-19 infections, we found that French Polynesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines had rates at 3.17, 0.22, and 0.06 per 100,000. These three countries also ranked highest in terms of jerk at 15.45, 0.10, and 0.04, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Two of the most populous countries in East Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia and the Philippines, have alarming surveillance metrics. These two countries rank highest in new infections in the region. The highest rates of speed, acceleration, and positive upwards jerk belong to French Polynesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and may result in explosive growth. While all countries in East Asia and the Pacific need to be cautious about reopening their countries since outbreaks are likely to occur in the second wave of COVID-19, the country of greatest concern is the Philippines. Based on standard and enhanced surveillance, the Philippines has not gained control of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is particularly troubling because the country ranks 4th in population in the region. Without extreme and rigid social distancing, quarantines, hygiene, and masking to reverse trends, the Philippines will remain on the global top 5 list of worst COVID-19 outbreaks resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The second wave will only exacerbate existing conditions and increase COVID-19 transmissions.","Post, Lori Ann; Lin, Jasmine S; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",J Med Internet Res,648,32

In this study, we focus on the main protease enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro, which is critical for viral replication. We employ explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of about 150 compounds docked into 3CLpro's binding site and that had emerged as good main protease ligands from our previous in silico screening of over 1.2 million compounds. By incoporating protein dynamics and applying a range of structural descriptors, such as the ability to form specific contacts with the catalytic dyad residues of 3CLpro and the structural fluctuations of the ligands in the binding site, we are able to further refine our compound selection. Fourteen compounds including estradiol shown to be the most promising based on our calculations were procured and screened against recombinant 3CLpro in a fluorescence assay. Eight of these compounds have significant activity in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Among these are corilagin, a gallotannin, and lurasidone, an antipsychotic drug, which emerged as the most promising natural product and drug, respectively, and might thus be candidates for drug repurposing for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, we also tested the inhibitory activity of testosterone, and our results reveal testosterone as possessing moderate inhibitory potency against the 3CLpro enzyme, which may thus provide an explanation why older men are more severely affected by COVID-19.","Loschwitz, Jennifer; Jäckering, Anna; Keutmann, Monika; Olagunju, Maryam; Eberle, Raphael J; Coronado, Monika Aparecida; Olubiyi, Olujide O; Strodel, Birgit",Bioorg Chem,648,0

Report of a case,17.50745,4.155325,2020,"BACKGROUND: The health profession is a burnout producer due to the continuous contact with pain and suffering. In addition, excessive workloads can generate stress and psychological distress. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the degree of burnout and its main triggers in health professionals in Spain at the most critical period of the COVID-19 emergency. METHOD: A quantitative research was developed through a simple random sampling in different Spanish hospitals through the period of greatest impact of the pandemic (N = 157). Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire from Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) containing 22 items, which measures three subscales: emotional burnout, depersonalization, and self-fulfillment. RESULTS: depersonalization values reached 38.9%. A total of 90.4% of the health professionals considered that psychological care should be provided from the work centers. Furthermore, 43.3% of the health professionals estimated that they might need psychological treatment in the future. Finally, 85.4% stated that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) generated an increase in stress and anxiety. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the need to consider specific mental health care services and training in crises to avoid possible psychological disorders. The information obtained is also valuable for the development of future prevention protocols and training of health personnel to face pandemics of these characteristics or emergency scenarios. Having the necessary physical means for their protection, as well to updated regular and accurate information, is essential to avoid feelings of fear and uncertainty. This would promote the health of these professionals.","Martínez-López, José Ángel; Lázaro-Pérez, Cristina; Gómez-Galán, José; Fernández-Martínez, María Del Mar",,648,20

As the major types of programmed cell death, autophagy and apoptosis have been observed in response to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress and have been demonstrated to be responsible for porcine GC death. To date, however, the cellular reactions linking autophagy to the apoptosis of porcine GC under oxidative stress are still poorly understood. Porcine GC were treated with H2O2, and autophagic flux was examined by western blotting. Cell viability and cell death assays were performed after cotreatment of porcine GC with autophagy activator (rapamycin) or inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) together with H2O2. We revealed that short exposure (1-3 h) of porcine GC to H2O2 dramatically increased autophagic flux (1.8- to 2.5-fold over that in the control), whereas 6-12 h prolonged treatment decreased autophagy but elevated the caspase-3 activity and GC apoptotic rate. Furthermore, we showed that pretreatment with rapamycin exacerbated H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation but that 3-MA or siRNAs specific for Beclin 1 and Atg7 genes ameliorated H2O2-mediated GC apoptosis. Together, our results indicate that autophagy plays a pivotal role in H2O2-mediated porcine GC apoptosis. Importantly, we show that the early induction of autophagic flux contributes to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in porcine GC. The results also suggest that regulating the autophagy response in porcine GC under oxidative stress might be a new strategy for abnormal follicular atresia.","Zhang, Jia-Qing; Ren, Qiao-Ling; Chen, Jun-Feng; Gao, Bin-Wen; Wang, Xian-Wei; Zhang, Zi-Jing; Wang, Jing; Xu, Ze-Jun; Xing, Bao-Song",Reprod. sci,648,14

The public's knowledge and practices play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards COVID-19 during its rapid rise. A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among a sample of the Mosul-Iraq population between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. The results showed a knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91±1.67) and (21.56± 2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards COVID-19. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 except for respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards COVID-19 should be targeted towards this group.","Saeed, Balsam Qubais; Al-Shahrabi, Rula; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi",PLoS One,648,16

Methods: A mathematical modeling study using an age structured deterministic model for Victoria, was simulated for 123 days between 1 June 2020 and 1 October 2020, incorporating lockdown, contact tracing, and case findings with and without mask use in varied scenarios. The model tested the impact of differing scenarios of the universal use of face masks in Victoria, by timing, varying mask effectiveness, and uptake. Results: A six-week lockdown with standard control measures, but no masks, would have resulted in a large resurgence by September, following the lifting of restrictions. Mask use can substantially reduce the epidemic size, with a greater impact if at least 50% of people wear a mask which has an effectiveness of at least 40%. Early mask use averts more cases than mask usage that is only implemented closer to the peak. No mask use, with a 6-week lockdown, results in 67,636 cases and 120 deaths by 1 October 2020 if no further lockdowns are used. If mask use at 70% uptake commences on 23 July 2020, this is reduced to 7,961 cases and 42 deaths. We estimated community mask effectiveness to be 11%. Conclusion(s): Lockdown and standard control measures may not have controlled the epidemic in Victoria. Mask use can substantially improve epidemic control if its uptake is higher than 50% and if moderately effective masks are used. Early mask use should be considered in other states if community transmission is present, as this has a greater effect than later mask wearing mandates.","Costantino, Valentina; Raina MacIntyre, Chandini",Front Public Health,648,29

Of interest to the dental community is the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of the affected patients that can potentially cause transmission of COVID-19 via droplets. The highly infectious nature of the pathogen has created a sense of urgency and a need for extra caution to prevent the spread of the disease and the potential infection of patients and the entire dental team. Spatter consists of droplets up to 50 µm in size that are effectively stopped by barriers such as gloves, masks, and gowns. Aerosols are defined as droplet particles smaller than 5 µm that can remain airborne for extended periods and that have been reported to be significant in viral respiratory infections. In this study, aerosol represented by particulate matter with a size of 2.5 µm (PM2.5) was measured. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eight dry-field isolation methods were tested in a setup that included a realistic dental manikin and a high-speed handpiece that generated air-water spray. Environmental noise generated by the suction devices, suction flow rate of each setup, and the amount of environmental spatter and aerosols, were measured. RESULTS: The experimental setups showed significant variability in the suction flow rate, but this was not correlated to the level of sound generated. Some experimental setups caused a short-term level of noise that exceeded the NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) guidelines and were close to the OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) recommended thresholds. It is also worth noting that the variability in the flow rate is not reflected in the efficacy of the experimental setups to mitigate spatter. All experimental setups, except the IsoVac system, provided statistically significantly better spatter mitigation compared to the control. All experimental setups also were efficient in mitigating aerosols compared with the positive control (P < .0001) and most systems yielded results similar to the negative control ambient PM (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that spatter reduction was significantly better amongst the setups in which an additional high-volume evacuator (HVE) line was used. All setups were efficient at mitigating PM2.5 aerosols in comparison to the control. The conclusions of this study should be interpreted with caution, and additional mitigation techniques consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations must be implemented in dental practices.","Ravenel, Theodore D; Kessler, Raymond; Comisi, John C; Kelly, Abigail; Renne, Walter G; Teich, Sorin T",Quintessence Int,648,10

The PbO–MoO3–Li2O–B2O3 glass system (coded as investigated glasses) was fabricated using the melt quenching mechanism. The optical packing density (OPD) increases from 75.563 to 84.366, and oxygen molar volume (OMV) decreases from 13.234 to 11.853 cm3/mol when increasing the PbO concentration. The values of elastic moduli decreased from 47.06 to 39.67 GPa for Young, from 33.51 to 32.41 GPa for bulk, from 19.82 to 16.29 GPa for shear and from 59.94 to 54.14 GPa for longitudinal moduli as the PbO is increased. The radiation attenuation characteristics were reported at the photon energies used in diagnostic radiology. The mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) was evaluated using the three photoatomic data libraries EPICS2017, EPDL97, and XCOM, available in the EpiXS and Phy-X programs. The MAC for the five investigated glasses at 20 keV was much higher than the MAC at 40, 60 and 80 keV. The MAC for investigated glasses increased with the addition of PbO, with Pb-S1 demonstrating the lowest MAC, and Pb-S5 demonstrating the highest MAC. Additionally, the rate of the increment of MAC at 20 keV as the concentration of PbO increased was higher than that at 40, 60 and 80 keV. The effective atomic number (EAN) was determined using Phy-X program. The EAN follows the trend: Pb-S5 &gt; Pb-S4 &gt; Pb-S3 &gt; Pb-S2 &gt; Pb-S1. The EAN results proved that the glass with low amounts of B2O3 and higher amounts of PbO had good attenuation features. The EAN had the maximum values of 73.55–76.67 at 20 keV, whereas the lowest values occurred at 80 keV and varied between 53.63 and 63.39. The half-value layer (HVL) results showed that the Pb-S1 glass had the greatest HVL, while Pb-S5 had the least. There is a higher discrepancy between the tenth-value layer values at 80 keV than at 20 keV. At 20 keV, the difference between the highest and lowest TVL values (Pb-S1 and Pb-S5) was only 0.004 cm, while the difference at 80 keV was 0.152 cm. Pb-S5 is the most space-efficient radiation shield.","Almuqrin, Aljawhara H.; Sayyed, M. I.; Albarzan, Badriah Abigaile Mia V. Javier-Hila Alwadai Norah Kumar Ashok",Applied Sciences,648,16

Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality. As such, excess mortality has received considerable interest during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends, correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, and the autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be misinterpreted as excess mortality. We present a blend of classical epidemiological approaches to estimating excess mortality during extraordinary events with an established demographic approach in mortality forecasting, namely a Lee-Carter type model, which covers the named limitations and draws a more realistic picture of the excess mortality. We illustrate our approach using weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our proposed model provides a general framework that can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor excess mortality from specific causes of deaths.","Vanella, Patrizio; Basellini, Ugofilippo; Lange, Berit",,648,1

Recent studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 experience relevant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the GI symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted via electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar, from inception until 20 March 2020. Data were extracted from relevant studies. A systematic review of GI symptoms and a meta-analysis comparing symptoms in severe and non-severe patients was performed using RevMan V.5.3. RESULTS: Pooled data from 2477 patients with a reverse transcription-PCR-positive COVID-19 infection across 17 studies were analysed. Our study revealed that diarrhoea (7.8%) followed by nausea and/or vomiting (5.5 %) were the most common GI symptoms. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the odds of having GI symptoms in severe versus non-severe COVID-19-positive patients. 4 studies for nausea and/or vomiting, 5 studies for diarrhoea and 3 studies for abdominal pain were used for the analyses. There was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhoea (OR=1.32, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.18, Z=1.07, p=0.28, I2=17%) or nausea and/or vomiting (OR=0.96, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.19, Z=0.10, p=0.92, I2=55%) between either group. However, there was seven times higher odds of having abdominal pain in patients with severe illness when compared with non-severe patients (OR=7.17, 95% CI 1.95 to 26.34, Z=2.97, p=0.003, I2=0%). CONCLUSION: Our study has reiterated that GI symptoms are an important clinical feature of COVID-19. Patients with severe disease are more likely to have abdominal pain as compared with patients with non-severe disease.","Suresh Kumar, Vishnu Charan; Mukherjee, Samiran; Harne, Prateek Suresh; Subedi, Abinash; Ganapathy, Muthu Kuzhali; Patthipati, Venkata Suresh; Sapkota, Bishnu",,648,31

Understanding these patterns can help address barriers to care. Objective: To evaluate how prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic among both new and existing patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, use of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder from March 18 to September 1, 2020, was projected using a national database of retail prescriptions from January 1, 2018, to March 3, 2020. Actual prescribing was compared with projected levels for all, existing, and new patients. Exposures: The data include prescriptions to patients independent of insurance status or type and cover 90% of retail prescriptions, 70% of mail-order prescriptions, and 70% of nursing home prescriptions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Outcomes included total number of prescriptions, total morphine milligram equivalents, mean morphine milligram equivalents per prescription, mean dispensed units per prescription, and number of patients filling prescriptions. Results: A total of 452â¯691â¯261 prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder were analyzed for 90â¯420â¯353 patients (50â¯921â¯535 female patients [56%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [20] years). From March 18 to May 19, 2020, 1877 million total morphine milligram equivalents of opioid analgesics were prescribed weekly vs 1843 million projected, a ratio of 102% (95% prediction interval [PI], 94%-111%; P = .71). The weekly number of opioid-naive patients receiving opioids was 370â¯051 vs 564â¯929 projected, or 66% of projected (95% PI, 63%-68%; P < .001). Prescribing of buprenorphine was as projected for existing patients, while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 9865 vs 12â¯008 projected, or 82% (95% PI, 76%-88%; P < .001). From May 20 to September 1, 2020, opioid prescribing for new patients returned to 100% of projected (95% PI, 96%-104%; P = .95), while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 10â¯436 vs 11â¯613 projected, or 90% (95% PI, 83%-97%; P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, existing patients receiving opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder generally maintained access to these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid prescriptions for opioid-naive patients decreased briefly and then rebounded, while initiation of buprenorphine remained at a low rate through August 2020. Reductions in treatment entry may be associated with increased overdose deaths.","Currie, Janet M; Schnell, Molly K; Schwandt, Hannes; Zhang, Jonathan",JAMA Netw Open,648,16

The first is to provide an assessment of Parker’s unique contribution to the field of Critical Psychology. Parker’s critique of the psy-sciences is shown to offer a key challenge not only to mainstream psychology but also to those who envision themselves working in the field of Critical Psychology: how not to relapse in the traps of mainstream psychology and psychologisation? The second objective is to scrutinize Parker’s idiosyncratic use of the methodology of auto-ethnography. Here it is argued, again, that Parker’s appropriation of this method not only is ideally positioned to question the problematic field of mainstream psychology, but also opens up a different perspective on subjectivity and sociality that should challenge Critical Psychology. The third objective is to apply these insights to the Covid crisis: if Parker enjoins us to step outside the psy-complex and “find many other ways to live together without it,” the entry of mainstream psychology into the Covid-debate, claiming expert knowledge on how we should live apart/together, should be confronted head-on. To achieve these three objectives, the author also uses a moderate dose of auto-ethnography.

Here, we performed a meta-analysis on existing lung cancer gene expression results to identify Meta-signature genes without noise. In this study, functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction network, the DAVID, String, TfactS, and transcription factor binding were performed based on the gene expression profiles of lung adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer deposited in the GEO database. As a result, a total of 574 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affecting the pathogenesis of lung cancer were identified (207 up-regulated expression and 367 down-regulated expression in lung cancer tissues). A total of 5,093 interactions existed among the 507 (88.3%) proteins, and 10 Meta-signatures were identified: AURKA, CCNB1, KIF11, CCNA2, TOP2A, CENPF, KIF2C, TPX2, HMMR, and MAD2L1. The potential biological functions of Meta-signature DEGs were revealed. In summary, this study identified key genes involved in the process of lung cancer.

Various material specifications of DC are available in herbal markets, and DC is ingested by different edible methods. However, whether these specifications and edible methods are suitable or not remains unknown. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the suitability of four material specifications (fresh stem, dried stem, fengdou and powder) and three edible methods (making tea, soup and medicinal liquor) based on holistic polysaccharide marker (HPM), the major polysaccharide components in DC. First, the HPMs were extracted from the four specifications of DC by the three edible methods in different conditions. Second, qualitative and quantitative characterization of the extracted HPMs was performed using high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Third, immunomodulatory activities of the extracted HPMs were evaluated in vivo. Results: The results showed that the HPMs were found to be quantitatively different from various specification of DC and edible methods. In vivo analysis indicated that the HPMs exerted positive effects on innate immune responses by increment in proliferation of splenocytes, secretion of IL-2 and cytotoxicity activity of NK cells. Moreover, the dosage amount of HPM should be defined as a certain range, but not the larger the better, for exerting strong immunological activities. Conclusion: According to the both chemical and biological results, fengdou by boiling with water for 4 h is the most recommended specification and edible method for DC.","Cao, Zi-Jun; Yip, Ka-Man; Jiang, Yi-Guo; Ji, Shi-Liang; Ruan, Jian-Qing; Wang, Cheng; Chen, Hu-Biao",Chin.

The participants experienced relatively high levels of loneliness and low social well-being during the time period characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from positive associations with phone call use times, smartphone communication app use was associated with social well-being and loneliness only when considering the age of participants. Younger participants with higher use times tended to report less social well-being and higher loneliness, while the opposite association was found for older adults. Thus, the informative value of smartphone communication use time was rather small and became evident only in consideration of age. The results highlight the need for further investigations and the need to address several limitations in order to draw conclusions at the population level.","Wetzel, Britta; Pryss, Rüdiger; Baumeister, Harald; Edler, Johanna-Sophie; Gonçalves, Ana Sofia Oliveira; Cohrdes, Caroline",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,16

In our institution, CTCA availability was increased in January 2020, and subsequently, expanded further to replace all exercise testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to assess the impact of increased utilisation of CTCA on length of stay in patients presenting with chest pain in the prepandemic era and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Study design was retrospective. Patients referred for cardiology review between October 2019 and May 2020 with chest pain and/or dyspnoea were broken into three cohorts: a baseline cohort, a cohort with increased CTCA availability and a cohort with increased CTCA availability, but after the national lockdown due to COVID-19. Coronary angiography and revascularisation, length of stay and 30-day adverse outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: 513 patients (35.3% female) presented over cohorts 1 (n=179), 2 (n=182), and 3 (n=153). CTCA use increased from 7.8% overall in cohort 1% to 20.4% in cohort 3. Overall length of stay for the patients undergoing CTCA decreased from a median of 4.2 days in cohort 1 to 2.5 days in cohort 3, with no increase in 30 days adverse outcomes. Invasive coronary angiogram rates were 45.8%, 39% and 34.2% across the cohorts. 29.6% underwent revascularisation in cohort 1, 15.9% in cohort 2 and to 16.4% in cohort 3. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CTCA availability was associated with a significantly reduced length of stay both pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 lockdown, without any increase in 30-day adverse outcomes.","Cronin, Michael; Wheen, Peter; Armstrong, Richard; Kumar, Rajesh; McMahon, Alannah; White, Max; Sheehy, Niall; McMahon, Geraldine; Murphy, Ross T; Daly, Caroline",,648,30

In response to this, parents of students were obliged to care for their children during the daytime when they were usually at school. Does the increase in burden of childcare influence parents mental health? Based on short panel data from mid-March to mid-April 2020, we explored how school closures influenced the mental health of parents with school-aged children. Using the fixed effects model, we found that school closures lead to students mothers suffering from worse mental health than other females, while the fathers mental health did not differ from other males. This tendency was only observed for less educated mothers who had children attending primary school, but not those attending junior high school. The contribution of this paper is to show that school closures increased the inequality of mental health between genders and the educational background of parents.","Yamamura, Eiji; Tsutsui, Yoshiro",,648,20

So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID-19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.","Yousefi, Bahman; Valizadeh, Saeid; Ghaffari, Hadi; Vahedi, Azadeh; Karbalaei, Mohsen; Eslami, Majid",J Cell Physiol,648,20

There is a natural succession between the two courses. At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly swept the world. During this unusual period, to ensure that medical students would understand and master basic medical knowledge and to lay a solid foundation for future medical bridge courses and professional courses, a web-based medical morphology teaching team, mainly including teachers of courses in Histology and Embryology and Pathology, was established. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore a new teaching mode of Histology and Embryology and Pathology courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate its feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: From March to July 2020, our team selected clinical medicine undergraduate students who started their studies in 2018 and 2019 as recipients of web-based teaching. Meanwhile, nursing undergraduate students who started their studies in 2019 and 2020 were selected for traditional offline teaching as the control group. For the web-based teaching, our team used the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to realize a new ""seven-in-one"" teaching method (ie, videos, materials, chapter tests, interactions, homework, live broadcasts, and case analysis/discussion). This new teaching mode involved diverse web-based teaching methods and contents, including flipped classroom, screen-to-screen experimental teaching, a drawing competition, and a writing activity on the theme of ""What I Know About COVID-19."" When the teaching was about to end, a questionnaire was administered to obtain feedback regarding the teaching performance. In the meantime, the final written pathology examination results of the web-based teaching and traditional offline teaching groups were compared to examine the mastery of knowledge of the students. RESULTS: Using the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to conduct ""seven-in-one"" teaching is feasible and acceptable. With regard to the teaching performance of this new web-based teaching mode, students demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, and the questionnaire showed that 71.3% or more of the students in different groups reported a greater degree of satisfaction or being very satisfied. In fact, more students achieved high scores (90-100) in the web-based learning group than in the offline learning control group (P=.02). Especially, the number of students with objective scores >60 in the web-based learning group was greater than that in the offline learning control group (P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the web-based teaching mode was not inferior to the traditional offline teaching mode for medical morphology courses, proving the feasibility and acceptability of web-based teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings lay a solid theoretical foundation for follow-up studies of medical students.","Liu, Qinlai; Sun, Wenping; Du, Changqing; Yang, Leiying; Yuan, Na; Cui, Haiqing; Song, Wengang; Ge, Li",JMIR Med Inform,648,24

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the surgical resident training experience, assess possible sources of stress or anxiety among surgery residents, and examine how patterns of anxiety vary by resident rank. DESIGN: We developed and disseminated a survey, which included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), to all general and integrated plastic surgery residents in their clinical years of training at the University of California, San Francisco. Statistical analysis of the survey responses was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Post-hoc analysis was performed using the Bonferroni-corrected Dunn test. Survey data were combined with aggregated duty hour information and operative case numbers from select hospitals for March and April of 2019 (historical baseline) and 2020. RESULTS: The overall survey response rate was 73.7% (nâ¯=â¯73). With an estimated operative volume reduction of 63.3% for general surgery cases, over 90% of residents expressed concern about the decline in operative exposure. While the senior residents tended to work more shifts, they were not more likely to have higher risk perception scores for contracting COVID-19 nor higher anxiety levels about the possibility of contracting COVID-19. They were, however, significantly more likely to have high GAD-7 scores (&#8805; 10) when compared to interns (zâ¯=â¯-2.82, p-adjâ¯=â¯0.014). Overall, residents were more concerned about the general health of loved ones than about their own risk of contracting COVID-19 (Uâ¯=â¯3897.5, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: While the work-related experiences of residents varied across a number of factors during the pandemic, residents tended to report similar sources of anxiety. Moving forward, surgical residency training programs will need to develop ways to optimize available surgical experiences and address the unique resident anxieties that an infectious pandemic presents.","Collins, Caitlin; Mahuron, Kelly; Bongiovanni, Tasce; Lancaster, Elizabeth; Sosa, Julie Ann; Wick, Elizabeth",J. surg. educ,648,14

Findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a major role in regulating brain functions through the gut-brain axis. A unique bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and maintenance of brain health could play a pivotal role in regulating incidences of neurodegenerative diseases. Contrarily, the present life style with changing food habits and disturbed circadian rhythm may contribute to gut homeostatic imbalance and dysbiosis leading to progression of several neurological disorders. Therefore, dysbiosis, as a primary factor behind intestinal disorders, may also augment inflammation, intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review primarily focuses on the gut-brain axis functions, specific gut microbial population, metabolites produced by gut microbiota, their role in regulating various metabolic processes and role of gut microbiota towards development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several studies have reported a decrease in abundance of a specific gut microbial population and a corresponding increase in other microbial family, with few findings revealing some contradictions. Reports also showed that colonization of gut microbiota isolated from patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease leads to the development of enhance pathological outcomes in animal models. Hence, a systematic understanding of the dominant role of specific gut microbiome towards development of different neurodegenerative diseases could possibly provide novel insight into the use of probiotics and microbial transplantation as a substitute approach for treating/preventing such health maladies.","Banerjee, Ankita; Pradhan, Lilesh Kumar; Sahoo, Pradyumna Kumar; Jena, Kautilya Kumar; Chauhan, Nishant Ranjan; Chauhan, Santosh; Das, Saroj Kumar",Arch. microbiol,648,1

The M2 protein of influenza A is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel, which is essential for influenza replication and an established antiviral target. However, all currently circulating influenza A virus strains are now resistant to licensed M2-targeting adamantane drugs, primarily due to the widespread prevalence of an M2 variant encoding a serine to asparagine 31 mutation (S31N). To identify new chemical leads that may target M2(S31N), we performed a virtual screen of molecules from two natural product libraries and identified chebulagic acid as a candidate M2(S31N) inhibitor and influenza antiviral. Chebulagic acid selectively restores growth of M2(S31N)-expressing yeast. Molecular modeling also suggests that chebulagic acid hydrolysis fragments preferentially interact with the highly-conserved histidine residue within the pore of M2(S31N) but not adamantane-sensitive M2(S31). In contrast, chebulagic acid inhibits in vitro influenza A replication regardless of M2 sequence, suggesting that it also acts on other influenza targets. Taken together, results implicate chebulagic acid and/or its hydrolysis fragments as new chemical leads for M2(S31N) and influenza-directed antiviral development.","Duncan, Maggie C; Onguéné, Pascal Amoa; Kihara, Ibuki; Nebangwa, Derrick N; Naidu, Maya E; Williams, David E; Balgi, Aruna D; Andrae-Marobela, Kerstin; Roberge, Michel; Andersen, Raymond J; Niikura, Masahiro; Ntie-Kang, Fidele; Tietjen, Ian",Molecules (Basel),648,18

In doing so, it examines the links between language and socio‐political discourse, focusing on tropes that invoke and engage with geographies of everyday life. The foundational contention is that, to a large extent, language constructs our lived reality. After reviewing scholarship linking language and disease, the commentary turns to a case study of New Zealand’s response to COVID‐19. The public health goal was to instil caution and protective practices in the population at large as a defence against transmission. The role of narrative and metaphor in daily press conferences from the Prime Minister and Director General of Health through March and April 2020 is examined by drawing on evidence from media reporting. Three key metaphors are considered: bubbles, levels, and the team, with each metaphor having spatialised implications in the popular imagination. The commentary considers perceptual and behavioural implications of this strategic use of metaphor.

The risk of occupational exposure to coronavirus depends on the type of industry and the nature of work. Currently, most countries are working for reactivating their economies and need to improve working conditions for a safe situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed to investigate the current engineering and administrative control measures, which are necessary to protect workers against COVID-19 in workplaces. METHODS: The current strategies, including engineering control, administrative control, personal protective equipment, and their efficiencies, were reviewed and discussed. RESULTS: Reviewing the literature indicated that a collection of control approaches should be implemented for an effective control of the virus. Control measures could be selected based on the risk of exposure to COVID-19. The results also revealed that relying solely on a specific control measure could not effectively control the outbreak. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, employers and health professionals must continually monitor international and local guidelines to identify changes in recommendations to make their workplaces safer. Establishment of an expert team in any workplace for the implementation of more effective control measures is warranted, as well.","Dehghani, Fatemeh; Omidi, Fariborz; Yousefinejad, Saeed; Taheri, Elnaz",Work,648,22

These medicines, essential to palliative care, are regulated under the international drug control conventions overseen by United Nations specialized agencies and treaty bodies and under national drug control laws. Those national laws and regulations directly affect bedside availability of Internationally Controlled Essential Medicines (ICEMs). The complex interaction between national regulatory systems and global supply chains (now impacted by COVID-19 pandemic) directly affects bedside availability of ICEMs and patient care. Despite decades of global civil society advocacy in the United Nations system, ICEMs have remained chronically unavailable, inaccessible, and unaffordable in low- and-middle-income countries, and there are recent reports of shortages in high-income countries as well. The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation, and delirium. Frequently used medicines include opioids such as morphine or fentanyl and midazolam, all of them listed as ICEMs. This paper describes the issues related to the lack of availability and limited access to ICEMs during the COVID-19 pandemic in both intensive and palliative care patients in countries of all income levels and makes recommendations for improving access.","Pettus, Katherine; Cleary, James F; de Lima, Liliana; Ahmed, Ebtesam; Radbruch, Lukas",J Pain Symptom Manage,648,16

The UBiquitous Integrated CARE (UBICARE) technology is a novel health digital platform at the validation stage in hospital setting. UBICARE might support the urgent need for digitalisation and early intervention, as well as minimise the face-to-face delivery of care in both hospital and community-based care settings. This research protocol aims to design an early-stage assessment of the multidimensional impact induced by UBICARE within the IT-NHS alongside technology validation in a hospital ward. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The targeted patients will be medium/high-risk hypertensive individuals as an illustrative first example of how UBICARE might bring benefits to susceptible patients. A mixed-method study will be applied to incorporate to the validation study a multistakeholder perspective, including perceived patient experiences and preferences, and facilitate technology adoption. First, semistructured interviews will be undertaken with a variety of stakeholders including clinicians, health managers and policy-makers to capture views on the likely technology utility, economic sustainability, impact of adoption in hospital practice and alternative adoption scenarios. Second, a monocentric, non-randomised and non-comparative clinical study, supplemented by the administration of standardised usability questionnaires to patients and health professionals, will validate the use of UBICARE in hospital practice. Finally, the results of the previous stages will be discussed in a multidisciplinary-facilitated workshop with IT-NHS relevant stakeholders to reconcile stakeholders' perspectives. Limitations include a non-random recruitment strategy in the clinical study, small sample size of the key stakeholders and potential stakeholder recruitment bias introduced by the research technique. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee for Clinical Experimentation of Tuscany Region approved the protocol. Participation in this study is voluntary. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and academic conferences.","Manetti, Stefania; Vainieri, Milena; Guidotti, Elisa; Zuccarino, Sara; Ferré, Francesca; Morelli, Maria Sole; Emdin, Michele",BMJ Open,648,24

A total of 92,977,768 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,991,289 deaths were reported globally up to January 14, 2021. COVID-19 also affects people's mental health and quality of life. At present, there is no effective therapeutic strategy for the management of this disease. Therefore, in the absence of a specific vaccine or curative treatment, it is an urgent need to identify safe, effective and globally available drugs for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities. In this review, we focus on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: a class of antidepressant drugs with widespread availability and an optimal tolerability profile) that can potentially be repurposed for COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials. We also summarize the existing literature on what is known about the link between serotonin (5-HT) and the immune system. From the evidence reviewed here, we propose fluoxetine as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for COVID-19 based on its known immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Fluoxetine may potentially reduce pro-inflammatory chemokine/cytokines levels (such as CCL-2, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;) in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, fluoxetine may help to attenuate neurological complications of COVID-19.","Pashaei, Yaser",J Clin Neurosci,648,16

We carried out a narrative review of international publications on the interactions of COVID-19 with the biological bases of suicide. RECENT FINDINGS: We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological processes that underlie suicidal behavior, such as the renin-angiotensin system, nicotinic receptors, and central and systemic inflammation. Social distancing measures may also worsen subjective or objective social disconnection, thus increasing the risk of suicide. Interestingly, the drugs used to prevent suicide could be promising options to counteract brain damage caused by this coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological pathways involved in suicide and opens a new window for understanding the suicidal process. The development of suicide prevention treatments in the context of a pandemic may benefit from knowledge on these interactions.","Conejero, I; Nobile, B; Olié, E; Courtet, Ph",Curr Psychiatry Rep,648,16

A systems view of host response to infections provides opportunities for discovering sensitive and robust molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We combine blood transcriptomes from six independent datasets (n = 756) with a knowledge-based human protein-protein interaction network, identifies subnetworks capturing host response to each infection class, and derives common response cores separately for viral and bacterial infections. We subject the subnetworks to a series of computational filters to identify a parsimonious gene panel and a standalone diagnostic score that can be applied to individual samples. We rigorously validate the panel and the diagnostic score in a wide range of publicly available datasets and in a newly developed Bangalore-Viral Bacterial (BL-VB) cohort. FINDING: We discover a 10-gene blood-based biomarker panel (Panel-VB) that demonstrates high predictive performance to distinguish viral from bacterial infections, with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) in eleven independent datasets (n = 898). We devise a new stand-alone patient-wise score (VB10) based on the panel, which shows high diagnostic accuracy with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.98) in 2996 patient samples from 56 public datasets from 19 different countries. Further, we evaluate VB10 in a newly generated South Indian (BL-VB, n = 56) cohort and find 97% accuracy in the confirmed cases of viral and bacterial infections. We find that VB10 is (a) capable of accurately identifying the infection class in culture-negative indeterminate cases, (b) reflects recovery status, and (c) is applicable across different age groups, covering a wide spectrum of acute bacterial and viral infections, including uncharacterized pathogens. We tested our VB10 score on publicly available COVID-19 data and find that our score detected viral infection in patient samples. INTERPRETATION: Our results point to the promise of VB10 as a diagnostic test for precise diagnosis of acute infections and monitoring recovery status. We expect that it will provide clinical decision support for antibiotic prescriptions and thereby aid in antibiotic stewardship efforts.

As demonstrated by the explosive outbreaks of COVID-19 seen in congregate settings, the need for effective outbreak prevention and mitigation strategies for these settings is critical. Here we consider how interventions that decrease the size of the susceptible populations, such as vaccination or depopulation, impact the expected number of infections due to outbreaks. Introduction of disease into the resident population from the community is modeled as a branching process, while spread between residents is modeled via a compartmental model. Control is modeled as a proportional decrease in both the number of susceptible residents and the reproduction number. We find that vaccination or depopulation can have a greater than linear effect on anticipated infections. For example, assuming a reproduction number of 3.0 for density-dependent COVID-19 transmission, we find that reducing the size of the susceptible population by 20% reduced overall disease burden by 47%. We highlight the California state prison system as an example for how these findings provide a quantitative framework for implementing infection control in congregate settings. Additional applications of our modeling framework include optimizing the distribution of residents into independent residential units, and comparison of preemptive versus reactive vaccination strategies.","Blumberg, Seth; Lu, Phoebe; Hoover, Christopher M; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Kwan, Ada T; Sears, David; Bertozzi, Stefano M; Worden, Lee",,648,20

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three merged data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient laboratory testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18-65 with continuous enrollment in the health plan from January 2019 to the date of a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three comparator groups, matched by propensity score, to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, an historical 2019 comparator group, and an historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: More than 50 clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as the date of first SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (index date) plus 21 days) were identified using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes. Excess risk in the four months after acute infection and hazard ratios with Bonferroni corrected 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: 14% of adults aged &#8804;65 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (27 074 of 193 113) had at least one new type of clinical sequelae that required medical care after the acute phase of the illness, which was 4.95% higher than in the 2020 comparator group. The risk for specific new sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection after the acute phase, including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety, and fatigue, was significantly greater than in the three comparator groups (2020, 2019, and viral lower respiratory tract illness groups) (all P<0.001). Significant risk differences because of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people (all P<0.001), and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 compared with the 2020 comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the excess risk of developing new clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were admitted to hospital because of covid-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults (aged &#8804;50), those with no pre-existing conditions, or those not admitted to hospital for covid-19 also had an increased risk of developing new clinical sequelae. The greater risk for incident sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for healthcare planning.","Daugherty, Sarah E; Guo, Yinglong; Heath, Kevin; Dasmariñas, Micah C; Jubilo, Karol Giuseppe; Samranvedhya, Jirapat; Lipsitch, Marc; Cohen, Ken",BMJ,648,3

While analysis of nasal and throat swabs from patients is the main way to detect COVID-19, analyzing chest images could offer an alternative method to hospitals, where health care personnel and testing kits are scarce. Deep learning (DL), in particular, has shown impressive levels of performance when analyzing medical images, including those related to COVID-19 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to perform a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of DL algorithms in the automatic stratification of COVID-19 patients using chest images. METHODS: A search strategy for use in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was developed, where we searched for articles published between January 1 and April 25, 2020. We used the key terms ""COVID-19,"" or ""coronavirus,"" or ""SARS-CoV-2,"" or ""novel corona,"" or ""2019-ncov,"" and ""deep learning,"" or ""artificial intelligence,"" or ""automatic detection."" Two authors independently extracted data on study characteristics, methods, risk of bias, and outcomes. Any disagreement between them was resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which included 5896 chest images from COVID-19 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the DL models in detecting COVID-19 were 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.97), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98. The positive likelihood, negative likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratio were 19.02 (95% CI 12.83-28.19), 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.10), and 368.07 (95% CI 162.30-834.75), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing other types of pneumonia from COVID-19 were 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95), respectively. The performance of radiologists in detecting COVID-19 was lower than that of the DL models; however, the performance of junior radiologists was improved when they used DL-based prediction tools. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings show that DL models have immense potential in accurately stratifying COVID-19 patients and in correctly differentiating them from patients with other types of pneumonia and normal patients. Implementation of DL-based tools can assist radiologists in correctly and quickly detecting COVID-19 and, consequently, in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Poly, Tahmina Nasrin; Islam, Md Mohaimenul; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack; Alsinglawi, Belal; Hsu, Min-Huei; Jian, Wen Shan; Yang, Hsuan-Chia",JMIR Med Inform,648,30

The current study comprised 46 third-year nursing students who attended an FFC course in 2019, and 56 third-year students who took the ERT version in 2020. Students' self-rated goal attainment and knowledge of genetics scores were compared before and after taking the courses. Scores between the two class types were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The students' worksheets were evaluated using keyword frequency and content analyses. Both classes achieved their goals satisfactorily, and this study confirmed that for this course, ERT was as effective as FFC. A comparison of the increase in domain goal attainment scores per student showed that only the psychomotor domain item, ""I can fully explain human diversity using genomic information"", was significantly different, as it was significantly higher for ERT (p = 0.003). This higher item in the ERT group suggests that ERT can pose a lack of practice caution in acquiring nursing skills.","Kawasaki, Hiromi; Yamasaki, Satoko; Masuoka, Yuko; Iwasa, Mika; Fukita, Susumu; Matsuyama, Ryota",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,24

There is good evidence that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the seasonal increase of virus infections of the respiratory tract, from the common cold to influenza, and now possibly also COVID-19. This communication explores key factors that make it more likely, particularly in combination, that individuals are vitamin D deficient. These factors include old age, obesity, dark skin tone and common genetic variants that impede vitamin D status. Precision nutrition is an approach that aims to consider known personal risk factors and health circumstances to provide more effective nutrition guidance in health and disease. In regard to avoiding vitamin D deficiency, people with excess body fat, a dark skin tone or older age usually need to use a moderately dosed daily vitamin D supplement, particularly those living in a high-latitude region, getting little ultraviolet B exposure due to air pollution or staying mostly indoors. Carriers of the GC (group-specific component) rs4588 AA genotype also are more likely to become deficient. Very high-dosed supplements with more than 4000 IU vitamin D are rarely needed or justified. A state-by-state Mendelian randomisation analysis of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the USA shows a greater disparity in northern states than in southern states. It is conceivable that vitamin D adequacy denies the virus easy footholds and thereby slows spreading of the contagion. This finding should drive home the message that vitamin D supplementation is particularly important for individuals with dark skin tones. Vitamin D deficiency, even for a few months during the winter and spring season, must be rigorously remedied because of its many adverse health impacts that include decreased life expectancy and increased mortality. Slowing the spread of COVID-19 would be an added bonus.","Kohlmeier, Martin",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,648,16

However, it is unknown whether the changes in heart rate variability precede neurological deterioration in such patients. We explored the changes in heart rate variability measured by electrocardiography in patients who had neurological deterioration following severe acute brain injury and examined the relationship between heart rate variability and electroencephalography parameters. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 25 patients who manifested neurological deterioration after severe acute brain injury and underwent simultaneous electroencephalography plus electrocardiography monitoring. Results: Eighteen electroencephalography channels and one simultaneously recorded electrocardiography channel were segmented into epochs of 120-second duration and processed to compute 10 heart rate variability parameters and three quantitative electroencephalography parameters. Raw electroencephalography of the epochs was also assessed by standardized visual interpretation and categorized based on their background abnormalities and ictal-interictal continuum patterns. The heart rate variability and electroencephalography parameters showed consistent changes in the 2-day period before neurological deterioration commenced. Remarkably, the suppression ratio and background abnormality of the electroencephalography parameters had significant reverse correlations with all heart rate variability parameters. Conclusion: We observed a significantly progressive decline in heart rate variability from the day before the neurological deterioration events in patients with severe acute brain injury were first observed.","Lee, Hyunjo; Jeon, Sang-Beom; Lee, Kwang-Soo",,648,20

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly demanded to develop treatments for COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 92.06% identity in their N protein RBDs' sequences, which results in very similar structures. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is more easily to spread. Utilizing multi-scale computational approaches, this work studied the fundamental mechanisms of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including their stabilities and binding strengths with RNAs at different pH values. Electrostatic potential on the surfaces of N proteins show that both the N proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have dominantly positive potential to attract RNAs. The binding forces between SARS-CoV N protein and RNAs at different distances are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, both in directions and magnitudes. The electric filed lines between N proteins and RNAs are also similar for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The folding energy and binding energy dependence on pH revealed that the best environment for N proteins to perform their functions with RNAs is the weak acidic environment.","Guo, Wenhan; Xie, Yixin; E Lopez-Hernandez, Alan; Sun, Shengjie; Li, Lin",Math Biosci Eng,648,29

The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives: To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods: Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results: Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion: An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence.","Devendran, Ragunathan; Kumar, Manish; Chakraborty, Supriya",Indian J Public Health,648,18

The lockdown measures for CoViD-19 allowed to simulate on a large scale the massive and prolonged reduction of road traffic (the main source for NO2 in urban environment). This work aims to selectively assess the maximum impact that total traffic blocking measures can have on NO2. For this reason, three megacities (London, Milan and Paris) were chosen that had similar characteristics in terms of climatic conditions, population, policies of urban traffic management and lockdown measures. 52 air quality control units have been used to compare data measured in lockdown and in the same periods of previous years, highlighting a significant decrease in NO2 concentration due to traffic (London: 71.1 % - 80.8 %; Milan: 8.6 % - 42.4%; Paris: 65.7 % - 79.8 %). In 2020 the contribution of traffic in London, Milan and Paris was dropped to 3.3 ± 1.3 µg m-3, 6.1 ± 0.8 µg m-3, and 13.4 ± 1.5 µg m-3, respectively. Despite the significant reduction in the NO2 concentration, in UT stations average NO2 concentrations higher than 40 µg m-3 were registered for several days. In order to reduce the pollution, the limitation of road traffic could be not enough, but a vision also aimed at rethink the vehicles and their polluting effects should be developed.","Collivignarelli, Maria Cristina; De Rose, Claudio; Abbà, Alessandro; Baldi, Marco; Bertanza, Giorgio; Pedrazzani, Roberta; Sorlini, Sabrina; Carnevale Miino, Marco",,648,10

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane Library for epidemiological studies of confirmed COVID-19, which include information about clinical characteristics and severity of patients' disease. We analyzed the potential associations between clinical characteristics and severe cases. RESULTS: We identified a total of 41 eligible studies including 21060 patients with COVID-19. Severe cases were potentially associated with advanced age (Standard Mean Difference (SMD) = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.34-2.12), male gender (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI:1.33-1.71), obesity (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.44-2.46), history of smoking (OR = 1.40, 95% CI:1.06-1.85), hypertension (OR = 2.42, 95% CI: 2.03-2.88), diabetes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.98-2.91), coronary heart disease (OR: 2.87, 95% CI: 2.22-3.71), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.63-5.41), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.54-3.97), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.89-4.38), malignancy (OR = 2.60, 95% CI: 2.00-3.40), and chronic liver disease (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.17). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 39.59, 95% CI: 19.99-78.41), shock (OR = 21.50, 95% CI: 10.49-44.06) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 8.84, 95% CI: 4.34-18.00) were most likely to prevent recovery. In summary, patients with severe conditions had a higher rate of comorbidities and complications than patients with non-severe conditions. CONCLUSION: Patients who were male, with advanced age, obesity, a history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, malignancy, coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic liver disease, COPD, or CKD are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms.

Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the value of anticytokine therapies to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This review summarizes the existing literature evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticytokine therapy to tackle the dysregulated immune response to infectious pathogens, discusses potential reasons for failure, applicability to coronavirus disease 2019, and future direction. Data Sources: Medline, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and media reports. Study Selection: The studies were included by author consensus. Data Extraction: Data were selected for inclusion after reviewing each study by author consensus. Data Synthesis: ""Cytokine storm"" is a nonspecific term, encompassing systemic inflammatory response to infectious pathogens, autoimmune conditions, cancers, trauma, and various chemotherapies. Like bacterial sepsis, viral pathogens may fuel immunopathogenesis by inducing a dysregulated autoamplifying cytokine cascade, ultimately leading to organ injury. This narrative review discusses what we know of the immune milieu of coronavirus disease 2019 versus noncoronavirus disease 2019 sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, summarizes the existing literature on cytokine inhibitors in patients with sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and discusses possible reasons for recurrent failure. In doing so, it aims to assist decisions regarding the use of anticytokine therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, as many regions of the world confront the second wave of the pandemic. Conclusions: As ongoing clinical trials determine the efficacy and safety of anticytokine therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, clinicians should uphold caution when incorporating it into treatment protocols, while maintaining focus on established evidence-based practices and the mantra of ""less is more.""","Rizvi, Mahrukh S; Gallo De Moraes, Alice",Crit Care Explor,648,33

There are limited data on mild or asymptomatic infections, but recognition of these individuals is key as they contribute to viral transmission. We describe the symptom profiles from individuals with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: From March 22 to April 22, 2020 in Wisconsin and Utah, we enrolled and prospectively observed 198 household contacts exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We collected and tested nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens by RT-PCR two or more times during a 14-day period. Contacts completed daily symptom diaries. We characterized symptom profiles on the date of first positive RT-PCR test and described progression of symptoms over time. RESULTS: We identified 47 contacts, median age 24 (3-75) years, with detectable SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The most commonly reported symptoms on the day of first positive RT-PCR test were upper respiratory (n=32, 68%) and neurologic (n=30, 64%); fever was not commonly reported (n=9, 19%). Eight (17%) individuals were asymptomatic at the date of first positive RT-PCR collection; two (4%) had preceding symptoms that resolved and six (13%) subsequently developed symptoms. Children less frequently reported lower respiratory symptoms (age <18: 21%, age 18-49: 60%, age 50+ years: 69%; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Household contacts with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported mild symptoms. When assessed at a single time-point, several contacts appeared to have asymptomatic infection; however, over time all developed symptoms. These findings are important to inform infection control, contact tracing, and community mitigation strategies.","Yousaf, Anna R; Duca, Lindsey M; Chu, Victoria; Reses, Hannah E; Fajans, Mark; Rabold, Elizabeth M; Laws, Rebecca L; Gharpure, Radhika; Matanock, Almea; Wadhwa, Ash; Pomeroy, Mary; Njuguna, Henry; Fox, Garrett; Binder, Alison M; Christiansen, Ann; Freeman, Brandi; Gregory, Christopher; Tran, Cuc H; Owusu, Daniel; Ye, Dongni; Dietrich, Elizabeth; Pevzner, Eric; Conners, Erin E; Pray, Ian; Rispens, Jared; Vuong, Jeni; Christensen, Kim; Banks, Michelle; O039,; Hegarty, Michelle; Mills, Lisa; Lester, Sandra; Thornburg, Natalie J; Lewis, Nathaniel; Dawson, Patrick; Marcenac, Perrine; Salvatore, Phillip; Chancey, Rebecca J; Fields, Victoria; Buono, Sean; Yin, Sherry; Gerber, Susan; Kiphibane, Tair; Dasu, Trivikram; Bhattacharyya, Sanjib; Westergaard, Ryan; Dunn, Angela; Hall, Aron J; Fry, Alicia M; Tate, Jacqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L",Clin. infect. dis,648,16

Interventions included combinations of high-volume intraoral suction (HVS[IO]), high-volume extraoral suction (HVS[EO]) and an air cleaning system (ACS).Method A sequence of six AGPs were performed on a phantom head. Real-time aerosol measurements (particle size range 0.0062-9.6 µm) were acquired from six locations within a typical dental treatment room (35 m3).Results The majority (>99%) of AGP particles were <0.3 µm diameter and remained at elevated levels around the dental team during the AGPs. With no active aerosol-management interventions, AGP particles were estimated to remain above the baseline range for up to 30 minutes from the end of the sequence of procedures.Conclusions The results emphasise the importance of personal protection equipment, particularly respiratory protection. Use of HVS(IO), either alone or in combination with the ACS, reduced particle concentrations to baseline levels on completion of AGPs. These data indicate potential to eliminate fallow time. The study was performed using a phantom head so confirmatory studies with patients are required.","Ehtezazi, Touraj; Evans, David G; Jenkinson, Ian D; Evans, Philip A; Vadgama, Vijay J; Vadgama, Jaimini; Jarad, Fadi; Grey, Nicholas; Chilcott, Robert P",Br. dent. j,648,1

Managing these demands cannot be effectively conducted without a nationwide collective effort that relies on data to forecast hospital demands on the national, regional, hospital and individual levels. To this end, we developed the COVID-19 Capacity Planning and Analysis System (CPAS)-a machine learning-based system for hospital resource planning that we have successfully deployed at individual hospitals and across regions in the UK in coordination with NHS Digital. In this paper, we discuss the main challenges of deploying a machine learning-based decision support system at national scale, and explain how CPAS addresses these challenges by (1) defining the appropriate learning problem, (2) combining bottom-up and top-down analytical approaches, (3) using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, (4) integrating heterogeneous data sources, and (5) presenting the result with an interactive and transparent interface. CPAS is one of the first machine learning-based systems to be deployed in hospitals on a national scale to address the COVID-19 pandemic-we conclude the paper with a summary of the lessons learned from this experience.","Qian, Zhaozhi; Alaa, Ahmed M; van der Schaar, Mihaela",Mach Learn,648,20

The virus responsible for the disease, named SARS-CoV-2, is enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. During its replication in the cytoplasm of host cells, the viral genome is transcribed into proteins, such as the structural protein spike domain S1, which is responsible for binding to the cell receptor of the host cells. Infected patients have initially flu-like symptoms, rapidly evolving to severe acute lung injury, known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by an acute and diffuse inflammatory damage into the alveolar-capillary barrier associated with a vascular permeability increase and reduced compliance, compromising gas exchange and causing hypoxemia. Histopathologically, this condition is known as diffuse alveolar damage which consists of permanent damage to the alveoli epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, with consequent hyaline membrane formation and eventually intracapillary thrombosis. All of these mechanisms associated with COVID-19 involve the phenotypic expression from different proteins transcription modulated by viral infection in specific pulmonary microenvironments. Therefore, this knowledge is fundamentally important for a better pathophysiological understanding and identification of the main molecular pathways associated with the disease evolution. Evidently, clinical findings, signs and symptoms of a patient are the phenotypic expression of these pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, no findings alone, whether molecular, clinical, radiological or pathological axis are sufficient for an accurate diagnosis. However, their intersection and/or correlation are extremely critical for clinicians establish the diagnosis and new treatment perspectives.","Batah, Sabrina Setembre; Fabro, Alexandre Todorovic",Respir Med,648,21

Current treatments differentiate severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with different products and programs. This differentiation is complex and costly. The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) assessed the effectiveness of a simplified, unified SAM/MAM protocol for children aged 6-59 months. Eliminating the need for separate products and protocols could improve the impact of programs by treating children more easily and cost-effectively, reaching more children globally. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial compared a combined protocol against standard care in Kenya and South Sudan. Randomization was stratified by country. Combined protocol clinics treated children using 2 sachets of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) per day for those with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 11.5 cm and/or edema, and 1 sachet of RUTF per day for those with MUAC 11.5 to <12.5 cm. Standard care clinics treated SAM with weight-based RUTF rations, and MAM with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). The primary outcome was nutritional recovery. Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness, coverage, defaulting, death, length of stay, and average daily weight and MUAC gains. Main analyses were per-protocol, with intention-to-treat analyses also conducted. The non-inferiority margin was 10%. From 8 May 2017 to 31 March 2018, 2,071 children were enrolled in 12 combined protocol clinics (mean age 17.4 months, 41% male), and 2,039 in 12 standard care clinics (mean age 16.7 months, 41% male). In total, 1,286 (62.1%) and 1,202 (59.0%), respectively, completed treatment; 981 (76.3%) on the combined protocol and 884 (73.5%) on the standard protocol recovered, yielding a risk difference of 0.03 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.10, p = 0.52; per-protocol analysis, adjusted for country, age, and sex). The amount of ready-to-use food (RUTF or RUSF) required for a child with SAM to reach full recovery was less in the combined protocol (122 versus 193 sachets), and the combined protocol cost US$123 less per child recovered (US$918 versus US$1,041). There were 23 (1.8%) deaths in the combined protocol arm and 21 (1.8%) deaths in the standard protocol arm (adjusted risk difference 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01, p = 0.87). There was no evidence of a difference between the protocols for any of the other secondary outcomes. Study limitations included contextual factors leading to defaulting, a combined multi-country power estimate, and operational constraints. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment for SAM and MAM is non-inferior to standard care. Further research should focus on operational implications, cost-effectiveness, and context (Asia versus Africa; emergency versus food-secure settings).

Blocking this interaction shows promise for blocking or ameliorating the virus' pathological effects on the body. By contrast to work focusing on the coronavirus, which has significant potential diversity through possible accumulation of mutations during transmission, targeting the conserved ACE2 protein expressed on human cells offers an attractive alternative route to developing pharmacological prophylactics against viral invasion. In this study, we screened a virtual database of natural peptides in silico, with ACE2 as the target, and performed structural analyses of the interface region in the SARS-COV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. These analyses have identified 15 potentially effective compounds. Analyses of ACE2/polypeptide interactions suggest that these peptides can block viral invasion of cells by stably binding in the ACE2 active site pocket. Molecular simulation results for Complestatin and Valinomycin indicate that they may share this mechanism.

RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset.AimTo determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type.MethodsWe used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once.ResultsThe probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (OP) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests.ConclusionNP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive.

This is well established for other coronaviruses. In order to understand why some patients develop such symptoms and others do not, we address herein the infectability of the central nervous system (CNS). Reports that the ACE2 receptor - critical for virus entry into lung cells - is found in different neurons supports this expectation. We employ a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BrainSphere model, which we used earlier for Zika, Dengue, HIV and John Cunningham virus infection studies. We detected the expression of the ACE2 receptor but not TMPRSS2 in the model. Incubating the BrainSpheres for 6 hours with SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 led to the infection of a fraction of neural cells with replication of the virus evident 72 hours later. Virus particles were found in the neuronal cell body extending into apparent neurite structures. PCR measurements corroborated the replication of the virus, suggesting at least a tenfold increase in virus copies per total RNA. Leveraging state-of-the-art 3D organotypic cell culture, which has been shown to allow both virus infection and (developmental) neurotoxicity but is at the same time simple enough to be transferred and used in a BSL-3 environment, we demonstrate, for the first time, the potential critically important neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.","Bullen, C Korin; Hogberg, Helena T; Bahadirli-Talbott, Asli; Bishai, William R; Hartung, Thomas; Keuthan, Casey; Looney, Monika M; Pekosz, Andrew; Romero, July C; Sillé, Fenna C M; Um, Peter; Smirnova, Lena",ALTEX,648,16

The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.","Daamen, Andrea R; Bachali, Prathyusha; Owen, Katherine A; Kingsmore, Kathryn M; Hubbard, Erika L; Labonte, Adam C; Robl, Robert; Shrotri, Sneha; Grammer, Amrie C; Lipsky, Peter E",Sci Rep,648,16

Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies. Objective: To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020. All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care). Results: We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 44 men and 56 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%). The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]). The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings. The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.","Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Jian, Shu-Wan; Liu, Ding-Ping; Ng, Ta-Chou; Huang, Wan-Ting; Lin, Hsien-Ho",JAMA Intern Med,648,20

However, the resultant doctors' workload of reading mammographic scans needs to be addressed. Although computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed to support readers, the findings are conflicting regarding whether traditional CAD systems improve reading performance. Rapid progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) field has led to the advent of newer CAD systems using deep learning-based algorithms which have the potential to reach human performance levels. Those systems, however, have been developed using mammography images mainly from women in western countries. Because Asian women characteristically have higher-density breasts, it is uncertain whether those AI systems can apply to Japanese women. In this study, we will construct a deep learning-based CAD system trained using mammography images from a large number of Japanese women with high quality reading. METHODS: We will collect digital mammography images taken for screening or diagnostic purposes at multiple institutions in Japan. A total of 15,000 images, consisting of 5000 images with breast cancer and 10,000 images with benign lesions, will be collected. At least 1000 images of normal breasts will also be collected for use as reference data. With these data, we will construct a deep learning-based AI system to detect breast cancer on mammograms. The primary endpoint will be the sensitivity and specificity of the AI system with the test image set. DISCUSSION: When the ability of AI reading is shown to be on a par with that of human reading, images of normal breasts or benign lesions that do not have to be read by a human can be selected by AI beforehand. Our AI might work well in Asian women who have similar breast density, size, and shape to those of Japanese women. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN, trial number UMIN000039009.

Widespread public health measures and travel restrictions have dampened viral spread but outbreaks are expected as restrictions are raised. This study was carried out in order to devise an approach that may help to predict deaths based on upsurges (spikes or waves) of cases. METHODS: Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to August 2020 was obtained from the Our World In Data website. For the purposes of more detailed analysis, in addition to total global data, three countries were chosen for sub analysis: Italy, Germany and the United States. RESULTS: Delay to death (days) were as follows: World: 20.6 (95% CI: 8.4-32.8); USA: 19.8 (95% CI: 9.3-30.4); Germany: 18.8 (95% CI: 6.1-31.6); Italy: 2.4 (95% CI -10.2-15.0). DISCUSSION: Countries may be able to contain viral resurgence by adhering to WHO advice for reopening from restrictions/lockdowns. However, outbreaks are almost inevitable and deaths are to be expected approximately 20 days after rises in cases. This paper may therefore aid healthcare systems and hospitals for surges in cases as positive COVID-19 swabs increase in any given locality. Italy was an exception in these results as the initial surge and swabs taken represented symptomatic/admitted cases and not community surveillance tracking and tracing.","Grech, Victor; Hagen, Scherb",Early Hum Dev,648,9

With few exceptions, these are lower in East and Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries compared with other regions. Epidemiological differences may reflect differences in border closures, lockdowns, and social distancing measures taken by each county, and by cultural differences, such as common use of face masks in East and Southeast Asian countries. The plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin was suggested to protect from COVID-19 by inhibiting TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease essential for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here, we present evidence that population differences in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in the COVID-19 epidemiology. Our study compared reported national estimates for the major alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS (SERPINA1 rs28929474 and rs17580, respectively) with the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center dataset. We found a significant positive correlation (R = .54, P = 1.98e-6) between the combined frequencies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin PiZ and PiS deficiency alleles in 67 countries and their reported COVID-19 mortality rates. Our observations suggest that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles may contribute to national differences in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality rates. Population-wide screening for carriers of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles should be considered for prioritizing individuals for stricter social distancing measures and for receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available.","Shapira, Guy; Shomron, Noam; Gurwitz, David",FASEB J,648,30

The 354 subjects included in our cohort may be stratified as follows: 25.99% GISs and FGISs, 27.97% GISs and no-FGISs, 10.17% no-GISs and FGISs, 35.87% no-GISs and no-FGISs. Results indicated an anxiety state for 48.9% of respondents, of which 64.74% also presented GISs. In addition, considered dietary habits, we detect the increased consumption of hypercaloric food, sweetened drinks, and alcoholic beverages. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of GISs during the lockdown period in a population of medical students, may be correlated to both dietary habits and anxiety state due to a concern for one's health.","Abenavoli, Ludovico; Cinaglia, Pietro; Lombardo, Giuditta; Boffoli, Eduardo; Scida, Miriam; Procopio, Anna Caterina; Larussa, Tiziana; Boccuto, Luigi; Zanza, Christian; Longhitano, Yaroslava; Fagoonee, Sharmila; Luzza, Francesco",,648,16

METHODS: We surveyed a sample (convenience sampling) of 5 groups of people: general population, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus (DM), people with cardiac problems, and people with psychiatric problems. The survey included 4 general questions (age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem) and 4 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific questions (contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask while in crowded places, and the frequency of daily hand washings). RESULTS: A total of 582 people (153 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with DM, 98 people with cardiac problems, 96 patients with psychiatric disorders, and 108 healthy individuals) participated. Twenty-eight (4.8%) people expressed that they do not wear a face mask when at crowded places. A lower education and less frequent daily hand washings had associations with mask wearing hesitancy.

In this unrelenting flow of information, Africa has been largely off the radar, escaping the attention of the scientific literature and the media. International agencies have been the exception: despite the still low numbers of cases and deaths, they have voiced concerns, often in catastrophic terms, on the health, economic and social impacts of COVID in African countries. These concerns contrast sharply with the optimistic view that Africa may be spared the worst consequences of the pandemic.This paper provides a snapshot of a crisis in evolution: its features could change as new data become available and our understanding improves. The paper examines the epidemic trends, the health impact, the containment measures and their possible side effects. Africa has a long experience of responding to epidemics: relevant lessons learned are outlined. The picture of the epidemic and its narrative are heterogenous, given the differing vulnerabilities of African countries and the diverse contexts within their borders. The paper, therefore, singles out selected countries as illustrative of specific situations and advocates for a transnational and subnational approach to future analyses.The virus has shown a strong capacity to adapt; therefore, a response strategy, in order to be effective, needs to be flexible and able to adapt to changes. The paper concludes with the recommendation that affected communities should be engaged in the response, to maintain or build trust. A lesson from the Ebola outbreak of a few years ago was that epidemiologists and community leaders learned, after initial difficulties, how to dialogue and work together.A summary update of the pandemic has been added, in view of its fast evolution.","Colombo, Sandro; Scuccato, Rino; Fadda, Antonello; Cumbi, Amélia Jossai",Epidemiol Prev,648,32

We also explain how concerns regarding increased authoritarianism and state excesses due to the use of these narratives are misplaced. We then tease out the colonial era concept of war that guides the arguments against the use of war metaphors in pandemics. We argue that in the post-modern world and in South Asian and African philosophies, wars are seen through the prism of the larger cause of dharma or ubuntu and that individual losses or gains in these contexts are part of a larger cause.

The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak and determined it a global pandemic. The current pandemic has infected nearly 300 million people and killed over 3 million. The current COVID-19 pandemic is smashing every public health barrier, guardrail, and safety measure in underdeveloped and the most developed countries alike, with peaks and troughs across time. Greatly impacted are those regions experiencing conflict and war. Morbidity and mortality increase logarithmically for those communities at risk and that lack the ability to promote basic preventative measures. States around the globe struggle to unify responses, make gains on preparedness levels, identify and symptomatically treat positive cases, and labs across the globe frantically rollout various vaccines and effective surveillance and therapeutic mechanisms. The incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 may continue to increase globally as no unified disaster response is manifested and disinformation spreads. During this failure in response, virus variants are erupting at a dizzying pace. Ungoverned spaces where nonstate actors predominate and active war zones may become the next epicenter for COVID-19 fatality rates. As the incidence rates continue to rise, hospitals in North America and Europe exceed surge capacity, and immunity post infection struggles to be adequately described. The global threat in previously high-quality, robust infrastructure health-care systems in the most developed economies are failing the challenge posed by COVID-19; how will less-developed economies and those health-care infrastructures that are destroyed by war and conflict fare until adequate vaccine penetrance in these communities or adequate treatment are established?

METHODS: Data on confirmed patients, with a final outcome reported as of 29 March 2020, were obtained from official websites and other internet sources. The hospitalized CFR (HCFR) was estimated, epidemiological features described, and risk factors for a fatal outcome identified. RESULTS: The overall HCFR in China was estimated to be 4.6% (95% CI 4.5-4.8%, P < 0.001). It increased with age and was higher in males than females. Although the highest HCFR observed was in male patients &#8805;70 years old, the relative risks for death outcome by sex varied across age groups, and the greatest HCFR risk ratio for males vs. females was shown in the age group of 50-60 years, higher than age groups of 60-70 and &#8805; 70 years. Differential age/sex HCFR patterns across geographical regions were found: the age effect on HCFR was greater in other provinces outside Hubei than in Wuhan. An effect of longer interval from symptom onset to admission was only observed outside Hubei, not in Wuhan. By performing multivariate analysis and survival analysis, the higher HCFR was associated with older age (both P < 0.001), and male sex (both P < 0.001). Only in regions outside Hubei, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, were associated with higher HCFR.

The clinical sensitivity (determined weekly) of 9 commercial serological assays were evaluated. Clinical specificity was assessed using 69 pre-pandemic sera. Correlation, agreement, and concordance with the VNT were also assessed on a subset of 170 samples. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was estimated at 2 neutralizing antibody titers. RESULTS: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease.

Internationally, governments are enforcing measures such as travel bans, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing leading to an extended period of time at home. This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression. Furthermore, CVD, diabetes, and elevated body fat are associated with greater risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe symptomology, underscoring the importance of avoiding the development of such morbidities. Here we review mechanisms of sarcopenia and their relation to the current data on the effects of COVID-19 confinement on physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and stress as well as extended bed rest due to COVID-19 hospitalization. The potential of these factors to lead to an increased likelihood of muscle loss and chronic disease will be discussed. By offering a number of home-based strategies including resistance exercise, higher protein intakes and supplementation, we can potentially guide public health authorities to avoid a lifestyle disease and rehabilitation crisis post-COVID-19. Such strategies may also serve as useful preventative measures for reducing the likelihood of sarcopenia in general and in the event of future periods of isolation.","Kirwan, Richard; McCullough, Deaglan; Butler, Tom; Perez de Heredia, Fatima; Davies, Ian G; Stewart, Claire",Geroscience,648,16

Most patients with COVID-19 infection present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms; while others present with atypical gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neurological manifestations. Here we present a series of four patients with COVID-19 that presented with acute stroke. METHODS: We searched the hospital databases for patients that presented with acute stroke and concomitant features of suspected COVID-19 infection. All patients who had radiographic evidence of stroke and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in the study. Patients admitted to the hospital with PCR- confirmed COVID-19 disease whose hospital course was complicated with acute stroke while inpatient were excluded from the study. Retrospective patient data were obtained from electronic medical records. Informed consent was obtained. RESULTS: We identified four patients who presented with radiographic confirmation of acute stroke and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We elucidate the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and the clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Timely assessment and hyperacute treatment is the key to minimize mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke. Stroke teams should be wary of the fact that COVID-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and should dawn appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient. Further studies are urgently needed to improve current understandings of neurological pathology in the setting of COVID-19 infection.","Avula, Akshay; Nalleballe, Krishna; Narula, Naureen; Sapozhnikov, Steven; Dandu, Vasuki; Toom, Sudhamshi; Glaser, Allison; Elsayegh, Dany",Brain Behav Immun,648,7

The five CRVs were then characterized by whole-genome sequencing. Our results showed that the genotype of Thai CRVs is G3P[3], which is the predominant genotype reported in dogs. The Thai CRVs posed a novel genetic constellation 'G3-P[3]-I3-R3-C3-M3-A9-N2-T3-E3-H6', which has never been reported in CRVs from dogs but has been reported in rotaviruses from humans. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the Thai CRVs are the result of multiple reassortments in which gene segments might have originated from human and bat rotaviruses and suggests the zoonotic potential of the virus.","Charoenkul, Kamonpan; Janetanakit, Taveesak; Bunpapong, Napawan; Boonyapisitsopa, Supanat; Tangwangvivat, Ratanaporn; Suwannakarn, Kamol; Theamboonlers, Apiradee; Poovorawan, Yong; Amonsin, Alongkorn",,648,16

Traditional approaches, such as multiple sequence alignment, rely on positional homology in order to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of taxa. Yet, mining information from the plethora of biological data and delineating species on a genetic basis, still proves to be an extremely difficult problem to consider. Multiple algorithms and techniques have been developed in order to approach the problem multidimensionally. Here, we propose a computational framework for identifying potentially meaningful features based on k-mers retrieved from unaligned sequence data. Specifically, we have developed a process which makes use of unsupervised learning techniques in order to identify characteristic k-mers of the input dataset across a range of different k-values and within a reasonable time frame. We use these k-mers as features for clustering the input sequences and identifying differences between the distributions of k-mers across the dataset. The developed algorithm is part of an innovative and much promising approach both to the problem of grouping sequence data based on their inherent characteristic features, as well as for the study of changes in the distributions of k-mers, as the k-value is fluctuating within a range of values.

To answer this question, Creighton’s principles of effective public participation are employed as benchmarks Moreover, the benchmarking indicates that public participation was not effectively applied Thus, the possible benefits of public participation could not or could only be partly reaped Furthermore, from a broader politico-economic perspective, the analysis exposes that public participation was just “a small cog in the machine” of the BER site selection process It seems that other factors had a more substantial influence on the siting decision than public participation and led decision makers, in addition to regular challenges, into a predicament that might have made Schönefeld the only possible siting solution In this context, different counterfactual scenarios are discussed to show under which circumstances other outcomes might have occurred regarding the BER site selection","Anonymous,",Sustainability,648,16

Management of dysarthria presents specific challenges in the telehealth modality. Evaluations of dysarthria typically rely heavily on perceptual judgments, which are difficult to obtain via telehealth given a variety of technological factors such as inconsistencies in mouth-to-microphone distance, changes to acoustic properties based on device settings, and possible interruptions in connection that may cause video freezing. These factors limit the validity, reliability, and clinicians' certainty of perceptual speech ratings via telehealth. Thus, objective measures to supplement the assessment of dysarthria are essential. Method This tutorial outlines how to obtain objective measures in real time and from recordings of motor speech evaluations to support traditional perceptual ratings in telehealth evaluations of dysarthria. Objective measures include pause patterns, utterance length, speech rate, diadochokinetic rates, and overall speech severity. We demonstrate, through clinical case vignettes, how these measures were completed following three clinical telehealth evaluations of dysarthria conducted via Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic. This tutorial describes how each of these objective measures were utilized, in combination with subjective perceptual analysis, to determine deviant speech characteristics and their etiology, develop a patient-specific treatment plan, and track change over time. Conclusion Utilizing objective measures as an adjunct to perceptual ratings for telehealth dysarthria evaluations is feasible under real-world pandemic conditions and can be used to enhance the quality and utility of these evaluations.","Sevitz, Jordanna S; Kiefer, Brianna R; Huber, Jessica E; Troche, Michelle S",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,648,1

Most of them are not prepared to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: A coordinated on-site medicalization program (MP) in response to a sizeable COVID-19 outbreak in four nursing homes was organized, with the objectives of improving survival, offering humanistic palliative care to residents in their natural environment, and reducing hospital referrals. Ten key processes and interventions were established (provision of informatics infrastructure, medical equipment, and human resources, universal testing, separation of 'clean' and 'contaminated' areas, epidemiological surveys, and unified protocols stratifying for active or palliative care approach, among others). Main outcomes were a composite endpoint of survival or optimal palliative care (SOPC), survival, and referral to hospital. RESULTS: 272 out of 457 (59.5%) residents and 85 out of 320 (26.5%) staff members were affected. The SOPC, survival, and referrals to hospital, occurred in 77%, 72.5%, and 29% of patients diagnosed before MP start, with respect to 97%, 83.7% and 17% of those diagnosed during the program, respectively. The SOPC was independently associated to MP (OR=15 [3-81]); and survival in patients stratified to active approach, to the use of any antiviral treatment (OR=28 [5-160]). All outbreaks were controlled in 39 [37-42] days. CONCLUSIONS: A coordinated on-site medicalization program of nursing homes with COVID-19 outbreaks achieved a higher survival or optimal palliative care rate, and a reduction in referrals to hospital, thus ensuring rigorous but also humanistic and gentle care to residents.","Bernabeu-Wittel, M; Ternero-Vega, J E; Nieto-Martín, M D; Moreno-Gaviño, L; Conde-Guzmán, C; Delgado-Cuesta, J; Rincón-Gómez, M; Díaz-Jiménez, P; Giménez-Miranda, L; Lomas-Cabezas, J M; Muñoz-García, M M; Calzón-Fernández, S; Ollero-Baturone, M","J. gerontol.

Activity in endoscopy centers globally was severely affected. We conducted a national survey aiming to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on endoscopic clinical practice in Brazil. Methods In April 2020, 3,719 associate members of SOBED (Brazilian Society of Digestive Endoscopy) were invited to respond to an electronic survey. An Internet link was established to provide access to the online questionnaire with 40 questions regarding personal profile, endoscopy unit logistics and schedule, availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), financial impact, and exposure to COVID-19. Results A total of 2,131 individuals (67%) accessed the questionnaire and 1155 responses were received. After review, 980 responses were considered valid. According to almost 90% of respondents, endoscopy activity was restricted to urgent procedures, in both public and private hospitals. All respondents increased PPE use after the outbreak, however, institutions provided adequate PPE to only 278 responders (28.7%). Significant income loss was universally reported. A total of 10 practitioners (1%) reported COVID-19 infection and attributed the contamination to endoscopic procedures. Conclusions Based on this nationwide survey with almost 1,000 respondents, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced the activity of endoscopy units in private and public settings.

Objective: To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020. Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network. Results: Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male.

Thrombotic coagulopathy is present in nearly three-quarters of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and both the clinical picture and pathologic findings are consistent with microvascular occlusive phenomena being a major contributor to their unique form of respiratory failure. Numerous studies are ongoing focusing on anti-cytokine therapies, antibiotics and anti-viral agents, but none to-date have focused on treating the underlying thrombotic coagulopathy in an effort to improve respiratory failure in COVID-19. There is animal data and a previous human trial demonstrating a survival advantage with fibrinolytic therapy to treat ARDS. Here we review the extant and emerging literature on the relationship between thrombotic coagulopathy and pulmonary failure in the context of COVID-19 and present the scientific rationale for consideration of targeting the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems to improve pulmonary function in these patients.","Barrett, Christopher D.; Moore, Hunter B.; Moore, Ernest E.; McIntyre, Robert C.; Moore, Peter K; Burke, John; Hua, Fei; Apgar, Joshua; Talmor, Daniel S.; Sauaia, Angela; Liptzin, Deborah R.; Veress, Livia A.; Yaffe, Michael B.",Res.

The percutaneous dilatation technique could reduce this risk, being performed at the bedside and minimising airway opening. In the COVID-19 context, however, with precarious respiratory status, it requires specific preparation. We designed a 3-hour training module, and here provide a step-by-step schedule, including video analysis, a demonstration of the kit, the recommended precautions related to COVID-19, and several simulation scenarios of increasing difficulty, using a high-tech mannequin. A low-tech procedural simulator was also developed for practicing the steps of the procedure. Our experience (3 sessions with 14 participants) highlighted the difficult points of the procedure in the COVID-19 context, and defined a checklist for clinical practice and an assessment grid. This type of simulation helps to prepare teams for a potentially delicate technical act.","Favier, V; Kimmoun, A; Gatin, A; Gallet, P",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,648,1

Effective treatments are urgently needed. The enzymatic activity of the HECT-E3 ligase family members has been implicated in the cell egression phase of deadly RNA viruses such as Ebola through direct interaction of its VP40 Protein. Here we report that HECT-E3 ligase family members such as NEDD4 and WWP1 interact with and ubiquitylate the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Furthermore, we find that HECT family members are overexpressed in primary samples derived from COVID-19 infected patients and COVID-19 mouse models. Importantly, rare germline activating variants in the NEDD4 and WWP1 genes are associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Critically, I3C, a natural NEDD4 and WWP1 inhibitor from Brassicaceae, displays potent antiviral effects and inhibits viral egression. In conclusion, we identify the HECT family members of E3 ligases as likely novel biomarkers for COVID-19, as well as new potential targets of therapeutic strategy easily testable in clinical trials in view of the established well-tolerated nature of the Brassicaceae natural compounds.","Novelli, Giuseppe; Liu, Jing; Biancolella, Michela; Alonzi, Tonino; Novelli, Antonio; Patten, J J; Cocciadiferro, Dario; Agolini, Emanuele; Colona, Vito Luigi; Rizzacasa, Barbara; Giannini, Rosalinda; Bigio, Benedetta; Goletti, Delia; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Grelli, Sandro; Mann, Justin; McKee, Trevor D; Cheng, Ke; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Guarracino, Andrea; Pepe, Gerardo; Tomino, Carlo; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Yacine; Uzunhan, Yurdagul; Tubiana, Sarah; Ghosn, Jade; Notarangelo, Luigi D; Su, Helen C; Abel, Laurent; Cobat, Aurélie; Elhanan, Gai; Grzymski, Joseph J; Latini, Andrea; Sidhu, Sachdev S; Jain, Suresh; Davey, Robert A; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Wei, Wenyi; Pandolfi, Pier Paolo",Cell Death Dis,648,26

In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students, to assess their anxiety level and their main anxiety sources related to this pandemic. METHODS: A Google Form was distributed to medical students using the virtual snowball sampling method. The form included the Beck Anxiety Inventory and additional 19 questions on sociodemographic characteristics, perceived level of knowledge about the epidemic, self-risk perceptions of COVID-19 and their anxiety levels about some other topics related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 3105 medical students with a mean age of 22.37 ± 2.46, took the survey. Amongst the participants, only 32% of the students defined their knowledge about the precautions that should be taken during an epidemic disease as acceptable. Students reported highest anxiety level for the continuing spread of COVID-19 in Turkey and transmitting coronavirus to another person. Clinically significant anxiety prevalence was 23.2%. Regression analysis revealed that factors that increased the risk of being anxious included being female, being other than a 5th-year student, thinking that being a medical student would increase the risk of coronavirus transmission or being uncertain about it, being exposed to a patient with COVID-19 or being uncertain about it, being anxious about the continuing spread of COVID-19 in Turkey, being anxious about acquiring COVID-19, being anxious for graduating and being on active duty, being anxious about a medical training interruption. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that anxiety is prevalent amongst Turkish medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and they have a weak preparedness for a pandemic such as COVID-19. Based on our results, new strategies should be implemented for medical education and for alleviating students' anxiety levels.","Kuman Tunçel, Özlem; Tasbakan, Selin Ece; Gökengin, Deniz; Erdem, Hüseyin Aytaç; Yamazhan, Tansu; Sipahi, Oguz Resat; Pullukçu, Hüsnü; Önen Sertöz, Özen; Isikgöz Tasbakan, Meltem",Int J Clin Pract,648,10

The need to economically plan and use urban green spaces has fueled the redefinition of public spaces and parks so as to provide the residents with both recreation and relaxation facilities, as well as a forum for contact with culture. This paper discusses the case of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (SNFCC) in the Kallithea district on the outskirts of Athens, near the Mediterranean Sea. It fills a gap in the research on the aspects of the practical functioning of such facilities. The methodology used in the research included an analysis of the literature, the SNFCC’s reports, and an in situ survey. The cultural center hosts a number of events aimed at promoting Greece’s natural and cultural heritage. The paper includes a detailed analysis of the events organized by the SNFCC in the period 2017–2020 and their immense impact on residents. The aim of the study is to show that the creation of the SNFCC with the park areas has functioned as a factor contributing to the improvement of the quality of urban space and the quality of life of the city’s inhabitants. The paper’s conclusions indicate that the sustainable SNFCC project, which fulfils the urban ecology criteria, has been very well received by the visitors—citizens and tourists alike.

The prognostic factors for fatal outcome remain sparsely investigated. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a cohort of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in one designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from 17 January-5 March 2020. The laboratory parameters and a panel of cytokines were consecutively evaluated until patients' discharge or death. The laboratory features that could be used to predict fatal outcome were identified. RESULTS: Consecutively collected data on 55 laboratory parameters and cytokines from 642 patients with COVID-19 were profiled along the entire disease course, based on which 3 clinical stages (acute stage, days 1-9; critical stage, days 10-15; and convalescence stage, day 15 to observation end) were determined. Laboratory findings based on 75 deceased and 357 discharged patients revealed that, at the acute stage, fatality could be predicted by older age and abnormal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, lymphocyte count, and procalcitonin (PCT) level. At the critical stage, the fatal outcome could be predicted by age and abnormal PCT, LDH, cholinesterase, lymphocyte count, and monocyte percentage. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was remarkably elevated, with fatal cases having a more robust production than discharged cases across the whole observation period. LDH, PCT, lymphocytes, and IL-6 were considered highly important prognostic factors for COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of predictors that were routinely tested might allow early identification of patients at high risk of death for early aggressive intervention.","Zeng, Hao-Long; Lu, Qing-Bin; Yang, Qing; Wang, Xu; Yue, Dao-Yuan; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Li, Hao; Liu, Wei; Li, Hui-Jun",Clin. infect. dis,648,16

Seeking ""people's behavioral changes,"" in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under circumstances in which the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years, were recruited. About 85 percent reported practising the social distancing measures recommended by the government including more females than males and more older than younger participants. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all participants, 92 percent of female, and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23 percent). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60 percent of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50 percent. However, the results also showed that about 20 percent of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, a drinking or smoking habit, and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioural changes using various means to reach and influence them.","Muto, Kaori; Yamamoto, Isamu; Nagasu, Miwako; Tanaka, Mikihito; Wada, Koji",PLoS One,648,1

So that we will build a mobile-based ODP TRACKING prototype that aims to prevent the COVID-19 that can be caused by ODP by using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology. The ODP Tracker application requires users such as the community, COVID-19 Village Handling Task Force, puskesmas, sub-district & district handling units, and the system administrator. Each of these users has a different role in the application but is related to one another. Several prototypes of the ODP Tracker application interface are shown in this study, including the Registration form interface, the ODP tracking interface, and the ODP report interface. The ODP Tracker application prototype can help the government or Covid-19 handling officers in Indonesia to track and monitor the whereabouts and conditions of people with ODP status.","Utomo, F.

The aim of this report is to present one potential solution to a clinical issue that of virtual and remote assessment for the purposes of spoken language research in persons with aphasia (PWA). To do so, we report detailed methods for conducting a multitimepoint (test-retest) virtual paradigm, assessing lifestyle, physiological, cognitive, and linguistic factors in persons with and without aphasia. Method Procedures for virtual assessment are detailed in a sample of adults with no brain damage (N = 24) and PWA (N = 25) on a test-retest paradigm (data collection approximately 10 ± 3 days apart). This report provides practical information about pre-assessment (e.g., recruitment, scheduling), assessment (e.g., aphasia-friendly consent presentation, investigator fidelity), and postassessment (e.g., data storage, quality check) procedures for human behavior research using a virtual platform. Results Preliminary study data are provided, indicating high retention rates, high rates of data acquisition, and feasibility. Common technological troubles and solutions are discussed, and solutions are offered. The results suggest that our pre-assessment, assessment, and postassessment procedures contributed to the success of our study. Conclusions We provide a practical methodology for conducting a multitimepoint study, with considerations for PWA, adding to the body of research on telehealth in clinical populations. Future studies should continue to evaluate telemethodology, which may be core for diversifying studies, improving study retention, and enrolling larger sample sizes.

OBJECTIVE: Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress. METHODS: We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians, resident physicians, and nursing staff, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. RESULTS: Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members and the stress of social distancing. Later, the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician-patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.","Viswanathan, Ramaswamy; Myers, Michael F; Fanous, Ayman H",Psychosomatics,648,24

This study sought to assess (i) the differences of miRNA profiles in patients with severe sMR compared to matched disease controls, (ii) the correlation between circulating miRNAs and surrogates of sMR severity as well as (iii) the prognostic implications of miRNA levels in severe sMR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six HFrEF patients were included, of these 44 patients with severe sMR 2:1 matched to HFrEF controls with no/mild sMR. A comprehensive set of miRNAs (miR-21, miR-29a, miR-122, miR-132, miR-133a, miR-let7i) were measured and correlated to echocardiographic sMR severity. RESULTS: miRNA patterns differed distinctly between patients with severe sMR and HFrEF controls (P < .05). Among the panel of assessed miRNAs, miR-133a correlated most strongly with surrogates of sMR severity (r = -0.41, P = .001 with sMR vena contracta width). Interestingly, elevated levels of miR-133 were associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular death and/or HF hospitalizations with and adjusted HR of 1.85 (95% CI 1.24-2.76, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: This study unveils distinct pathophysiologic maladaptions at a cellular level in patients with severe sMR compared to no/mild sMR by showing significant differences in miRNA profiles and correlations with sMR severity, supporting the concept that sMR drives cardiac remodelling in heart failure. Moreover, the increased risk for adverse outcome in HFrEF patients with severe sMR conveyed by miR-133a might indicate irreversible myocardial damage.","Spinka, Georg; Bartko, Philipp E; Pavo, Noemi; Freitag, Claudia; Zlabinger, Katrin; Prausmüller, Suriya; Arfsten, Henrike; Heitzinger, Gregor; Mascherbauer, Julia; Hengstenberg, Christian; Gyöngyösi, Mariann; Hülsmann, Martin; Goliasch, Georg",Eur J Clin Invest,648,21

In this article, we look at the anxiety problems that some parents and their children might experience when school reopens after the COVID-19 lockdown. Using a behavioral theory of development, we provide suggestions for how to handle the departure and separation problems that may emerge as parents drop their children off at school. Many parents are unsure about how to handle anxiety or fear as their children return to school or have to visit other environments outside their homes. Social distancing has caused families to develop stronger dependencies at home and to create new routines that vary, in many instances greatly, from their prepandemic routines. Families are adjusting to the new ""normal."" They are keeping their children busy with schoolwork as best they can. In particular, families have likely developed close attachment relationships. Families have been struggling with an unprecedented lockdown, and for many parents and their children, this extended period of family confinement and severe restrictions has been especially stressful, and the timing for returning to school is uncertain. We emphasize here that parents can be responsive to their children's needs, plan ahead, provide reassurance, and depart firmly without vacillating, and we provide other tips to avoid inadvertently shaping children's negative or anxiety behaviors as they go back to school. We offer some specific advice for parents and teachers to follow to prevent the departure and separation problems that typically develop during challenging behavioral interactions in school settings.","Pelaez, Martha; Novak, Gary",Behav Anal Pract,648,26

In this paper, the integrated management of HCWs in Wuhan, the first COVID-19-outbreaking city with over ten millions of people completely locking down, was collected, investigated and analyzed. During the pandemic, municipal solid wastes (MSWs) from designated hospitals, Fangcang shelter hospitals, isolation locations and residential areas (e.g. face masks) were collected and categorized as HCWs due to the high infectiousness and strong survivability of COVID-19, and accordingly the average production of HCWs per 1000 persons in Wuhan explosively increased from 3.64 kg/d to 27.32 kg/d. Segregation, collection, storage, transportation and disposal of HCWs in Wuhan were discussed and outlined. Stationary facilities, mobile facilities, co-processing facilities (Incineration plants for MSWs) and nonlocal disposal were consecutively utilized to improve the disposal capacity, from 50 tons/d to 280.1 tons/d. Results indicated that stationary and co-processing facilities were preferential for HCWs disposal, while mobile facilities and nonlocal disposal acted as supplementary approaches. Overall, the improved system of HCWs management could meet the challenge of the explosive growth of HCWs production during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. Furthermore, these practices could provide a reference for other densely populated metropolises.","Yang, Lie; Yu, Xiao; Wu, Xiaolong; Wang, Jia; Yan, Xiaoke; Jiang, Shen; Chen, Zhuqi",Resour.

Little is known about the experiences of critical care physicians caring for the sickest coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Our goal is to understand how high stress levels and shortages faced by these physicians during Spring 2020 have evolved. DESIGN: We surveyed (October 23, 2020 to November 16, 2020) U.S. critical care physicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients who participated in a National survey earlier in the pandemic (April 23, 2020 to May 3, 2020) regarding their stress and shortages they faced. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTION: Irrelevant. MEASUREMENT: Physician emotional distress/physical exhaustion: low (not at all/not much), moderate, or high (a lot/extreme). Shortage indicators: insufficient ICU-trained staff and shortages in medication, equipment, or personal protective equipment requiring protocol changes. MAIN RESULTS: Of 2,375 U.S. critical care attending physicians who responded to the initial survey, we received responses from 1,356 (57.1% response rate), 97% of whom (1,278) recently treated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Two thirds of physicians (67.6% [864]) reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress in the Spring versus 50.7% (763) in the Fall. Reports of staffing shortages persisted with 46.5% of Fall respondents (594) reporting a staff shortage versus 48.3% (617) in the Spring. Meaningful shortages of medication and equipment reported in the Spring were largely alleviated. Although personal protective equipment shortages declined by half, they remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS: Stress, staffing, and, to a lesser degree, personal protective equipment shortages faced by U.S. critical care physicians remain high. Stress levels were higher among women. Considering the persistence of these findings, rising levels of infection nationally raise concerns about the capacity of the U.S. critical care system to meet ongoing and future demands.","Gray, Bradley M; Vandergrift, Jonathan L; Barnhart, Brendan J; Reddy, Siddharta G; Chesluk, Benjamin J; Stevens, Jennifer S; Lipner, Rebecca S; Lynn, Lorna A; Barnett, Michael L; Landon, Bruce E",Crit Care Med,648,15

The virus infects the host by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the kidneys and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidneys and GI tract damage arising from the virus can be seen in patients and can cause acute conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and digestive problems for the patient. One of the complications of kidneys and GI involvement in COVID-19 is fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The most common ones of these disorders are hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, hypervolemia, and hypovolemia, which if left untreated, cause many problems for patients and even increase mortality. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances are more common in hospitalized and intensive care patients. Children are also at greater risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances complications. Therefore, clinicians should pay special attention to the fluid and electrolyte status of patients. Changes in fluid and electrolyte levels can be a good indicator of disease progression.","Pourfridoni, Mohammad; Abbasnia, Seyede Mahsa; Shafaei, Fateme; Razaviyan, Javad; Heidari-Soureshjani, Reza",Biomed Res Int,648,18

METHODS: Ninety-five symptomatic patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from 1 May to 14 July 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Follow-up CT findings and their distributions were analyzed and compared from symptom onset to late-stage disease. RESULTS: Among all patients, 15.8% had unilateral lung disease and 84.2% had bilateral disease with slight right lower lobe predilection (47.4%). Regarding lesion density, 49.4% of patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) and 50.5% had GGO with consolidation. Typical early-stage patterns were bilateral lesions in 73.6% of patients, diffuse lesions (41.0%), and GGO (65.2%). Pleural effusion occurred in 13.6% and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 11.5%. During intermediate-stage disease, 47.4% of patients showed GGO as the disease progressed; however, consolidation was the predominant finding (52.6%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifested on lung CT scans with bilateral, peripheral, and right lower lobe predominance and was characterized by diffuse bilateral GGO progressing to or coexisting with consolidation within 1 to 3 weeks. The most frequent CT lesion in the early, intermediate, and late phases was GGO. Consolidation appeared in the intermediate phase and gradually increased, ending with reticular and lung fibrosis-like patterns.","Darwish, Hoda Salah; Habash, Mohamed Yasser; Habash, Waleed Yasser",J Int Med Res,648,29

Clear and well-established benefits link daily physical activity to health and well-being-physical, mental, and existential. Despite these benefits, POC face additional barriers to participation. Thus, increasing physical activity among POC requires additional considerations so that POC can receive the same opportunities to safely participate in physical activity as Americans who are White. Framed within the Ecologic Model of Physical Activity, this commentary briefly describes health disparities in COVID-19, physical activity, and chronic disease experienced by POC; outlines underlying putative mechanisms that connect these disparities; and offers potential solutions to reduce these disparities.

The identification of potential symptoms has been reported to be a useful tool for clinical decision-making in emergency departments to avoid overload and improve the quality of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of symptoms as a diagnostic tool for SARS -CoV-2 infection. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, prospective and analytical study was carried out, during the period of time from April 14 to July 21, 2020. Data (demographic variables, medical history, respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms) were collected by emergency physicians. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 was evaluated by calculating the positive and negative likelihood ratios. A Mantel-Haenszel and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of symptoms with COVID-19. RESULTS: A prevalence of 53.72% of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. The symptom with the highest sensitivity was cough 71%, and a specificity of 52.68%. The symptomatological scale, constructed from 6 symptoms, obtained a sensitivity of 83.45% and a specificity of 32.86%, taking &#8805;2 symptoms as a cut-off point. The symptoms with the greatest association with SARS-CoV-2 were: anosmia odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% CI; 2.52-4.17), fever OR 2.98 (95% CI; 2.47-3.58), dyspnea OR 2.9 (95% CI; 2.39-3.51]) and cough OR 2.73 (95% CI: 2.27-3.28). CONCLUSION: The combination of &#8805;2 symptoms / signs (fever, cough, anosmia, dyspnea and oxygen saturation < 93%, and headache) results in a highly sensitivity model for a quick and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, and should be used in the absence of ancillary diagnostic studies. Symptomatology, alone and in combination, may be an appropriate strategy to use in the emergency department to guide the behaviors to respond to the disease.

Consecutive patients admitted to a high-volume intensive care unit (ICU) in London with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis were included if hs-TnT concentration at admission was known. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis performed, with cohorts classified a priori by multiples of the upper limit of normal (ULN). 277 patients were admitted during a 7-week period in 2020; 176 were included (90% received invasive ventilation). hs-TnT at admission was 16.5 (9.0 to 49.3) ng/L, 56% had concentrations >ULN. 56 patients (31.8%) died during the index admission. Admission hs-TnT level was lower in survivors (12.0 (8.0-27.8) vs 28.5 (14.0 to 81.0) ng/L, pâ¯=â¯0.001). Univariate predictors of mortality were age, APACHE-II Score and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.73, pâ¯=â¯0.007). By multivariate regression, only age (HR 1.33, CI: 1.16.to 1.51, p < 0.01) and admission hs-TnT (HR 1.94, CI: 1.22 to 3.10, pâ¯=â¯0.006) remained predictive. Survival was significantly lower when admission hs-TnT was >ULN (log-rank p-value<0.001). Peak hs-TnT was higher in those who died but was not predictive of death after adjustment for other factors. In conclusion, in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis, the hs-TnT level at admission is a powerful independent predictor of the likelihood of surviving to discharge from ICU. In most cases, hs-TnT elevation does not represent major myocardial injury but acts as a sensitive integrated biomarker of global stress. Whether stratification based on admission Troponin level could be used to guide prognostication and management warrants further evaluation.","Demir, Ozan M; Ryan, Matthew; Cirillo, Chiara; Desai, Nishita; Pericao, Ana; Sinclair, Hannah; Stylianidis, Vasileios; Victor, Kelly; Alaour, Bashir; Jones, Andrew; Pavlidis, Antonis N; Retter, Andrew; Carr-White, Gerald; Camporota, Luigi; Barrett, Nicholas; Marber, Michael; Perera, Divaka",Am J Cardiol,648,1

We performed this systematic review and meta analysis to assess the risk and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases compared with the general population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 1, 2020 to October 20, 2020 to determine epidemiological information related to patients with rheumatic diseases and COVID-19, including clear risk estimate or data that could be converted and extracted. We included 26 observational studies, totaling about 2000 patients with rheumatic diseases of whom were infected with COVID-19. Meta-analysis showed that the risk of COVID-19 infection in rheumatic patients was significantly higher than that in the general population (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.24-1.88, P = 0.000). In terms of hospitalization and severe clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19, we found that rheumatic patients showed similar results to the reference population (hospitalization OR = 1.36, 95% CI 0.81-2.29, P = 0.247; admitted to ICU OR = 1.94, 95% CI 0.88-4.27, P = 0.098; death OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.84-1.97, P = 0.248). The presence of comorbidities, hypertension, lung diseases were significantly associated with the increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization in rheumatic patients and anti-TNF drugs were associated with lower hospitalization risk. Older age was related to severe COVID-19. Our meta-analysis indicated that rheumatic patients were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection but might not lead to a more serious disease process.","Wang, Qingxiu; Liu, Jianbo; Shao, Runxia; Han, Xiaopeng; Su, Chenhao; Lu, Wenjia",Rheumatol Int,648,21

Our aim was to share this information with those who have an interest in problem-solving these significant and unique challenges. METHOD: The survey was distributed through the Association of Chairs of Psychiatry of Canada to Department Heads of Psychiatry at all sixteen medical schools. Information was collected via SurveyMonkey April 26-May 9, 2020. Eleven psychiatrists representing 11 different Canadian city/centre/zone(s) completed the survey. RESULTS: Information was collected about process changes: physical separation on the wards, symptom and vital signs screening, testing, isolation, rationales for number of beds allocated for COVID-positive, -suspect and -negative patients and for selecting a particular hospital to provide care to these different groupings of patients. One subsection of the information is presented in this letter. Further information is available upon request.

Methods An audit was conducted with routinely collected health data before both elective and non-elective surgery at two large Melbourne hospitals during April and early May 2020. We looked for documented systematic screening for COVID-19 disease and fever (>38°C) and results of SARS-COV-2 testing, and proposed a minimum acceptable documenting rate of 85%. Results The study included 2197 consecutive patients (1279 (58%) undergoing elective surgery, 917 (42%) undergoing non-elective surgery) across most specialities. Although 926 (72%) patients undergoing elective surgery had both systematic screening and temperature documented, approximately half that percentage undergoing non-elective surgery (n=347; 38%) had both documented. However, 871 (95%) of non-elective surgery patients had temperature documented. Acknowledging limited screening, 85 (9.3%) non-elective surgery patients had positive screening, compared with 39 (3.0%) elective surgery patients. All 152 (7%) patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and no cases were reported from external contact tracing. Conclusions Although 'not documented' does not necessarily equal 'not done', we found that documenting of COVID-19 screening could be improved. Better understanding of implementing screening practices in pandemics and other crises, particularly for non-elective surgery patients, is warranted. What is known about the topic? Little is known about routine screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical patients. However, it is well established that implementing effective uptake of safety and quality initiatives can be difficult. What does this paper add? We found that although most patients had documented temperature, fewer than 75% had a documented systematic questionnaire screen for COVID, particularly patients undergoing non-elective surgery. What are the implications for practitioners? Clear documenting is important in managing patients. Pandemics and other crises can require rapid changes in practice. Implementing such measures may be less complete than anticipated and may require greater use of evidence-based implementation strategies, particularly in the less predictable care of non-elective surgery patients.","Story, David; Coyle, Elizabeth; Devapalasundaram, Abarna; Sidiropoulos, Sofia; Ou Yang, Bobby; Coulson, Tim",Aust Health Rev,648,1

This study aimed to investigate if enhanced hygienic measures, including the systematic use of personal protective equipment (PPE), determined a decrease in HAI during the recent COVID-19 outbreak in ""COVID-free"" neurological units. METHODS: Patients hospitalized in neurology and stroke units of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital in Rome from March 8, 2020 and discharged prior to May 31, 2020 were included in the study and compared with patients hospitalized during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 319 patients were included in the study (n = 103 in 2020, n = 216 in 2019). Among patients hospitalized in 2019, the incidence of HAIs was 31.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.38), compared with 23.3% (95% CI: 0.15-0.32) in 2020 (p = 0.12). Multivariable logistic regression showed that hospitalization during 2020 was independently associated with a lower risk of HAIs (odds ratio: 0.34, 95% CI:0.16-0.71, p = 0.004). Poisson regression models showed that hospitalization during 2020 was also independently associated with both a lower number of HAIs (relative risk [RR]: 0.56, 95% CI:0.38-0.81, p = 0.01) and a lower number of prescribed antibiotics per patient (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our study design provides evidence regarding the impact of stricter hygienic measures, such as increased PPE use, on HAIs. Larger studies are needed to support the extension of preventive measures even after the COVID-19 outbreak in order to limit the occurrence of HAIs.","Cerulli Irelli, Emanuele; Orlando, Biagio; Cocchi, Enrico; Morano, Alessandra; Fattapposta, Francesco; Di Piero, Vittorio; Toni, Danilo; Ciardi, Maria R; Giallonardo, Anna T; Fabbrini, Giovanni; Berardelli, Alfredo; Di Bonaventura, Carlo",J Neurol Sci,648,6

METHODSWe measured soluble markers of inflammation in a SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort at early (<90 days) and late (>90 days) timepoints. We defined PASC as the presence of one or more COVID-19-attributed symptoms beyond 90 days. We compared fold-changes in marker values between those with and without PASC using mixed effects models with terms for PASC and early and late recovery time periods. RESULTSDuring early recovery, those who went on to develop PASC generally had higher levels of cytokine biomarkers including TNF-alpha (1.14-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, p=0.028) and IP-10 (1.28-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 1.01-1.62, p=0.038). Among those with PASC, there was a trend toward higher IL-6 levels during early recovery (1.28-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI 0.98- 1.70, p=0.07) which became more pronounced in late recovery (1.44-fold higher mean ratio, 95%CI: 1.11-1.86, p<0.001). These differences were more pronounced among those with a greater number of PASC symptoms. CONCLUSIONSPersistent immune activation may be associated with ongoing symptoms following COVID-19. Further characterization of these processes might identify therapeutic targets for those experiencing PASC.","Peluso, Michael J; Lu, Scott; Tang, Alex F.; Durstenfeld, Matthew S; Ho, Hsi-en; Goldberg, Sarah A.; Forman, Carrie A.; Munter, Sadie E.; Hoh, Rebecca; Tai, Viva; Chenna, Ahmed; Yee, Brandon C.; Winslow, John W.; Petropoulos, Christos J.; Greenhouse, Bryan; Hunt, Peter W.; Hsue, Priscilla Y.; Martin, Jeffrey N.; Kelly, J.

Here, an emulsion loop-mediated isothermal amplification (eLAMP) platform was developed to allow for the compartmentalization of LAMP reactions, leading to faster changes in emulsion characteristics, and thus lowering time-to-detection. Within these droplets, ongoing LAMP reactions lead to adsorption of amplicons to the water-oil interface, causing a decrease in interfacial tension, resulting in smaller emulsion diameters. Changes in emulsion diameter allow for the monitoring of the reaction by use of angle-dependent light scatter (based off Mie scatter theory). Mie scatter simulations confirmed that light scatter intensity is diameter-dependent and smaller colloids have lower intensity values compared to larger colloids. Via spectrophotometers and fiber optic cables placed at 30° and 60°, light scatter intensity was monitored. Scatter intensities collected at 5 min, 30° could statistically differentiate 10, 103, and 105 copies/µL initial concentrations compared to NTC. Similarly, 5 min scatter intensities collected at 60° could statistically differentiate 105 copies/µL initial concentrations in comparison to NTC. The use of both angles during the eLAMP assay allows for distinction between high and low initial target concentrations. The efficacy of a smartphone-based platform was also tested and had a similar limit of detection and assay time of less than 10 min. Furthermore, fluorescence-labeled primers were used to validate target nucleic acid amplification. Compared to existing LAMP assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, these times-to-detections are very rapid.","Day, Alexander S; Ulep, Tiffany-Heather; Safavinia, Babak; Hertenstein, Tyler; Budiman, Elizabeth; Dieckhaus, Laurel; Yoon, Jeong-Yeol",Biosens Bioelectron,648,0

However, the clinical efficacy is very limited due to its low oral bioavailability resulting from its poor aqueous solubility. In the present study, a new hybrid drug delivery system made of NIC, montmorillonite (MMT), and Tween 60 is proposed to overcome this obstacle. At first, NIC molecules were immobilized into the interlayer space of cationic clay, MMT, to form NIC-MMT hybrids, which could enhance the solubility of NIC, and then the polymer surfactant, Tween 60, was further coated on the external surface of NIC-MMT to improve the release rate and the solubility of NIC and eventually the bioavailability under gastrointestinal condition when orally administered. Finally, we have performed an in vivo pharmacokinetic study to compare the oral bioavailability of NIC for the Tween 60-coated NIC-MMT hybrid with Yomesan®, which is a commercially available NIC. Exceptionally, the Tween 60-coated NIC-MMT hybrid showed higher systemic exposure of NIC than Yomesan®. Therefore, the present NIC-MMT-Tween 60 hybrid can be a potent NIC drug formulation with enhanced solubility and bioavailability in vivo for treating Covid-19.","Yu, Seungjin; Piao, Huiyan; Rejinold, N Sanoj; Jin, Geunwoo; Choi, Goeun; Choy, Jin-Ho",,648,20

At the same time, climate change has both direct and indirect impacts on tourism, varying from damages of tourist assets due to extreme weather events, to losses of biodiversity. Small island developing states (SIDS) heavily depend on international tourism as a source of revenue and income. Therefore, much could be gained by assessing the vulnerability of the SIDS tourism sector and by identifying measures that may assist these islands in their sustainable adaptation efforts. Against this background, this interdisciplinary paper provides a review of tourism development and the implications of its emissions on the global climate, linked with observed and projected influences of climate change in the Pacific region, to explain the growing vulnerability of the overall sector, with a particular focus on SIDS tourism. A description of the effects of COVID-19 on international tourism and its consequences for SIDS complement the analysis. Case studies of two Pacific islands present some evidence of current climate impacts, underscoring the multiple risks small island nations and their tourism sectors face. The paper concludes by stating that some measures may be prioritized by decision-makers, so as to increase the resilience of a transforming tourism sector in SIDS. © 2021 by the authors.

In contrast, little is known about how these areas integrate memory information to lead to similar decisions. Using serial order learning, we explore how fragments of information, learned and stored independently (e.g., A > B and B > C), are linked in an abstract representation according to their reciprocal relations (such as A > B > C) and how this representation can be accessed and manipulated to make decisions. We show that manipulating information after learning occurs with increased difficulty as logical relationships get closer in the mental map and that the activity of neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) encodes the difficulty level during target selection for motor decision making at the single-neuron and population levels.","Mione, Valentina; Brunamonti, Emiliano; Pani, Pierpaolo; Genovesio, Aldo; Ferraina, Stefano",Cell Rep,648,6

As most democratic governments refrain from enacting mandatory testing, a key emerging challenge is to increase voluntary participation. Using behavioural economics insights complemented with data from a novel survey in the US and a survey experiment in Luxembourg, we examine behavioural factors associated with the individual willingness to get tested (WTT). In our analysis, individual characteristics that correlate positively with WTT include age, altruism, conformism, the tendency to abide by government-imposed rules, concern about contracting COVID-19, and patience. Risk aversion, unemployment, and conservative political orientation correlate negatively with WTT. Building on and expanding these insights may prove fruitful for policy to effectively raise people's propensity to get tested.","Fallucchi, Francesco; Görges, Luise; Machado, Joël; Pieters, Arne; Suhrcke, Marc",Health Policy,648,24

A variation on the patient influx might be one of the greater concerns, due to fewer people coming to emergency departments or coming too late. However, no data quantifying this have been published until now. The aim was to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak on hospital stroke admissions and their characteristics in our region. METHODS: The data of every patient admitted to any hospital of our healthcare system with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 19 April 2020 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and compared between periods before and after the setting of the state of emergency secondary to the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 354 patients with ischaemic stroke were admitted in our study period. There was a weekly average of 27.5 cases before the setting of the state of emergency against 12 afterwards (P < 0.001). This drop in stroke cases occurred progressively from week 11, persisting in time despite the decrease in confirmed cases of COVID-19. No differences in the proportion of intravenous thrombolysis (21.1% vs. 21.5%, P = 0.935) or endovascular therapy (12.4% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.510) were found, nor in other demographic or clinical characteristics except for median onset-to-door time (102 vs. 183 min, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study offers the perspective of a whole region in one of the countries more heavily stricken by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and shows that the decrease of stroke events, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, happened globally and without any specific patient distribution.","Tejada Meza, H; Lambea Gil, Á; Sancho Saldaña, A; Villar Yus, C; Pardiñas Barón, B; Sagarra Mur, D; Marta Moreno, J",Eur. j. neurol,648,23

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults &#8805;65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among COVID-19 positive patients. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge [92.0 (6.7) not frail, 81.0 (15.4) mild frailty, 48.6 (20.4) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], lower PT scores on discharge [54.2 (3.9) nonfrail, 51.5 (8.0) mild frailty, 37.1 (9.7) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], and lower OT score on discharge [52.9 (3.2) nonfrail, 45.8 (9.4) mild frailty, 32.4 (7.4) moderate or worse frailty; P = .001]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Older adults admitted to a SNF for post-acute care with COVID-19 had community discharge rates and functional improvement comparable to a COVID-19 negative group. However, those who are frailer at admission tended to have lower function at discharge.","Shi, Sandra; Lo, On-Yee; Newmeyer, Natalie; Bakaev, Innokentiy; Kim, Dae Hyun",J. Am. Med. Dir. Assoc,648,16

Time and resource restrictions, a focus on saving lives and new safety measures can lead to traditional aspects of care delivery being neglected. AIM: Identify barriers to delivering end-of-life care, describe attempts to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and understand the impact this had on staff. DESIGN: A rapid appraisal was conducted incorporating a rapid review of policies from the United Kingdom, semi-structured telephone interviews with healthcare workers, and a review of mass print media news stories and social media posts describing healthcare worker's experiences of delivering care during the pandemic. Data were coded and analysed using framework analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: From a larger ongoing study, 22 interviews which mentioned death or caring for patients at end-of-life, eight government and National Health Service policies affecting end-of-life care delivery, eight international news media stories and 3440 publicly available social media posts were identified. The social media analysis centred around 274 original tweets with the highest reach, engagement and relevance. Incorporating multiple workstreams provided a broad perspective of end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Three themes were developed: (1) restrictions to traditional care, (2) striving for new forms of care and (3) establishing identity and resilience. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic prohibited the delivery of traditional care as practical barriers restricted human connections. Staff prioritised communication and comfort orientated tasks to re-establish compassion at end-of-life and displayed resilience by adjusting their goals.","Mitchinson, Lucy; Dowrick, Anna; Buck, Caroline; Hoernke, Katarina; Martin, Sam; Vanderslott, Samantha; Robinson, Hannah; Rankl, Felicia; Manby, Louisa; Lewis-Jackson, Sasha; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",Palliat Med,648,6

In Austria, like in other European countries, informal care is carried out overwhelmingly by (non-cohabiting) relatives. Limited care services available during the pandemic, social-distancing, increased unemployment and competing care needs within households (e.g. due to school closures) may have changed the prevalence and intensity of informal caregiving. Moreover, these changes may have increased the psychological strain experienced by caregivers. Focusing on Austria, this study aims to empirically analyse the following research questions: how have the prevalence and intensity of informal care changed due to the pandemic? How has the psychological well-being of informal caregivers been affected? We use a pre- and post-onset of the pandemic research design based on a representative survey carried out in Austria in June 2020 (N = 2000) in combination with comparable 2015 data from the European Social Survey. Findings suggest that neither prevalence nor intensity of informal care changed significantly due to the pandemic. However, the psychological well-being gap between carers and non-carers increased with the start of the pandemic, especially among men. Findings are discussed in relation to the policy measures implemented and possible policy implications for the future.

The aim of the study is to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality and discharge in a cohort of Lombardy patients with COVID-19. All consecutive hospitalised patients from February 21st to March 30th, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 from the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Lombardy, Italy, were included. In-hospital mortality and discharge were evaluated by competing risk analysis. The Fine and Gray model was fitted in order to estimate the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for in-hospital mortality and discharge. 426 adult patients [median age 68 (IQR 56 to 77 years)] were admitted with confirmed COVID-19 over a 5-week period; 292 (69%) were male. By 21 April 2020, 141 (33%) of these patients had died, 239 (56%) patients had been discharged and 46 (11%) were still hospitalised. Among these 46 patients, updated as of 30 May, 2020, 5 (10.9%) had died, 8 (17.4%) were still in ICU, 12 (26.1%) were transferred to lower intensity care units and 21 (45.7%) were discharged. Regression on the CIFs for in-hospital mortality showed that older age, male sex, number of comorbidities and hospital admission after March 4th were independent risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Older age, male sex and number of comorbidities definitively predicted in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Zuccaro, Valentina; Celsa, Ciro; Sambo, Margherita; Battaglia, Salvatore; Sacchi, Paolo; Biscarini, Simona; Valsecchi, Pietro; Pieri, Teresa Chiara; Gallazzi, Ilaria; Colaneri, Marta; Sachs, Michele; Roda, Silvia; Asperges, Erika; Lupi, Matteo; Di Filippo, Alessandro; Seminari, Elena; Di Matteo, Angela; Novati, Stefano; Maiocchi, Laura; Enea, Marco; Attanasio, Massimo; Cammà, Calogero; Bruno, Raffaele",Sci Rep,648,16

A genome-wide association study illustrated the power of whole-genome sequences for analyzing clinical traits, identifying nine more significant candidate alleles than previously reported from the same linkage disequilibrium blocks. Also, Korea1K, as a reference, showed better imputation accuracy for Koreans than the 1KGP panel. As proof of utility, germline variants in cancer samples could be filtered out more effectively when the Korea1K variome was used as a panel of normals compared to non-Korean variome sets.

This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels, but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home-schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.","Altena, Ellemarije; Baglioni, Chiara; Espie, Colin A; Ellis, Jason; Gavriloff, Dimitri; Holzinger, Brigitte; Schlarb, Angelika; Frase, Lukas; Jernelöv, Susanna; Riemann, Dieter",J Sleep Res,648,16

The number of companies and the varieties of products in the online markets increased, as well as the numbers of consumers and consumers' segments diversification. The e-commerce in pandemic times offered clear benefits and opportunities for the consumers. It also created situations where the lack of confidence in e-commerce may intensify. This comes from the consumers' uncertainty on their key contractual rights and it is particularly a case when it comes to the contracts for supply of digital content and digital services. The European Union considered that legal certainty for consumers (and businesses) will increase by full harmonisation of key regulatory issues and that this would lead to growth of the potentials the e-commerce has on the common market. Aiming to achieve a genuine digital single market the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament in May 2019 have adopted the Directive (EU) 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services (the ""Digital Content Directive"") and the Directive (EU) 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods (the ""Sales of Goods Directive"") that regulate the supply of digital content and digital services and sale of goods with digital elements, respectively. Both directives lay down specific rules on the conformity of digital content or a digital service i.e., goods with digital elements with the contract, remedies in the cases of a lack of conformity or a failure to supply, as well as the modalities for the exercise of those remedies. The paper analyses the mechanisms for regulation of the contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services and the specific rights and obligations of the parties to these contracts. The main objective of the research is to assess to which extent these mechanisms are novelty in the European Consumer Law and to examine the obstacles that the application of consumer law to digital content contracts may encounter.","Zdraveva, Neda PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,648,16

Like other states around the country, the state of Colorado instituted a statewide lockdown to combat increasing case and hospitalization rates for COVID-19 throughout the state. The impact of this mandate on the ICU admission rates and outcomes of other medical problems has never been investigated. Our study aimed to determine the effects of stay-at-home orders on outcomes for other diagnoses by analyzing ICU admission rates and outcomes of patients presenting to the ICU for non-COVID related issues before, during, and after the statewide mandate. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all ICU admissions in three phases: before (2 months prior), during, and 1.5 months after the statewide lockdown (March 26 to April 27, 2020). We included all patients admitted to the University of Colorado Health System hospitals ICUs within this defined time period. A time-to-event analysis was performed with the date of index ICU stay set as time zero. Baseline characteristics were obtained. Primary outcome measures were 28-day mortality and all-time mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival probabilities, while Cox regression and multivariable logistic regression were utilized to model phase-specific mortality controlling for comorbidities, demographics, and admission diagnoses. Counts of typical ICU admission diagnoses were also analyzed to determine any changes across lockdown periods. RESULTS: 9201 total ICU admissions occurred, of which 8154 (88.6%) were non-COVID-19 related. Approximately 57.4% were male with a mean age of 60.4 years. 28-day mortality rates for non-COVID-19 ICU admissions were 475 (11.0%), 127 (13.8%), and 306 (10.5%) before, during, and after the lockdown, respectively. The increased mortality during lockdown persisted after adjustment for comorbidities and demographics (HR=1.23, 95% CI, 1.007 to 1.512, p = 0.043). Acute respiratory failure was the most common diagnosis in each time period, and increased during lockdown (p&lt;0.001). Admissions for sepsis increased during lockdown and decreased after (p = 0.001);myocardial infarction (MI) admission decreased during lockdown but increased after (p = 0.014);and alcohol withdrawal (AW) admission increased both during and after lockdown (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: For non-COVID-19 related ICU admissions, the mortality rate increased during the state-wide shutdown but decreased after shutdown, although this difference became insignificant after controlling for patient admission diagnoses. Admission diagnoses also differed with more admissions for sepsis and AW during lockdown and more admissions for MI and AW after lockdown.","Park, B. D.; Kannappan, A.; Rizzo, A.

To aid in this effort, we developed a general population risk calculator for COVID-19 mortality based on various sociodemographic factors and pre-existing conditions for the US population, combining information from the UK-based OpenSAFELY study with mortality rates by age and ethnicity across US states. We tailored the tool to produce absolute risk estimates in future time frames by incorporating information on pandemic dynamics at the community level. We applied the model to data on risk factor distribution from a variety of sources to project risk for the general adult population across 477 US cities and for the Medicare population aged 65 years and older across 3,113 US counties, respectively. Validation analyses using 54,444 deaths from 7 June to 1 October 2020 show that the model is well calibrated for the US population. Projections show that the model can identify relatively small fractions of the population (for example 4.3%) that might experience a disproportionately large number of deaths (for example 48.7%), but there is wide variation in risk across communities. We provide a web-based risk calculator and interactive maps for viewing community-level risks.","Jin, Jin; Agarwala, Neha; Kundu, Prosenjit; Harvey, Benjamin; Zhang, Yuqi; Wallace, Eliza; Chatterjee, Nilanjan",Nat. med,648,23

As was the case with COVID-19, the world is similarly unprepared to respond to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the challenges it will produce. COVID-19 presents an opportunity to examine how the international community might better respond to the growing AMR threat. MAIN BODY: The impacts of COVID-19 have manifested in health system, economic, social, and global political implications. Increasing AMR will also present challenges in these domains. As seen with COVID-19, increasing healthcare usage and resource scarcity may lead to ethical dilemmas about prioritization of care; unemployment and economic downturn may disproportionately impact people in industries reliant on human interaction (especially women); and international cooperation may be compromised as nations strive to minimize outbreaks within their own borders. CONCLUSION: AMR represents a slow-moving disaster that offers a unique opportunity to proactively develop interventions to mitigate its impact. The world's attention is currently rightfully focused on responding to COVID-19, but there is a moral imperative to take stock of lessons learned and opportunities to prepare for the next global health emergency.","Wilson, Lindsay A; Rogers Van Katwyk, Susan; Fafard, Patrick; Viens, A M; Hoffman, Steven J",Global Health,648,14

Methods: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of teleconsultations provided in the department of Strabismus, Paediatric and Neuro-ophthalmology was done. Patients with optic nerve related disorders were excluded. Study period was one month. Statistical analysis of collected data was done using Microsoft excel. Results: A total of 198 patients were provided teleconsultations (an average of seven teleconsultations/day). The final analysis included 161 patients after excluding optic nerve related disorders. The median age was seven years. We had a near equal gender distribution (53% males and 47% females) of whom a third were new cases. Video calling was used in 14%, review of clinical photos shared was used in 53%. Rest of the 33% were given telephonic advice. Allergic conjunctivitis (14%), pseudophakia (9%), strabismus (12%), status post strabismus surgery (8%), cranial nerve palsies (11%) were common diagnoses. 19% (n = 30) were advised/needed visit in emergency services on same or next day. Conclusion: Our experience of teleconsultation during COVID-19 times for paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus patients was very encouraging. Pivoting teleconsultation platform can provide primary eye care to most of the patients and work as essential forward triage for rest. As we continue to further explore the currently available avenues in multimedia such as video conferencing and web/mobile based applications, we believe that tele-ophthalmology platform can provide a reliable service in patient care.","Deshmukh, Ajinkya V; Badakere, Akshay; Sheth, Jenil; Bhate, Manjushree; Kulkarni, Sampada; Kekunnaya, Ramesh",Indian J Ophthalmol,648,24

In addition to well-known cases of bat rabies, we review other diseases that affect humans and might eventually reach them through cats that prey on bats. We also examine the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, from domestic cats to bats, which, although unlikely, might generate a novel wildlife reservoir in these mammals, and identify research and management directions to achieve more effective risk assessment, mitigation or prevention. Overall, not only does bat killing by cats represent a potentially serious threat to biodiversity conservation, but it also bears zoonotic implications that can no longer be neglected.","Salinas-Ramos, Valeria B; Mori, Emiliano; Bosso, Luciano; Ancillotto, Leonardo; Russo, Danilo",,648,1

This is being met with large quantities of imported produce as well as venison sourced from the UK, with wild-shot deer, parkland herds and farmed deer all contributing to the supply chain. This increase in demand has resulted in an expansion of the number and size of deer farming enterprises, and consequently an opportunity for veterinary consultancy and advice to farmers. During the Covid-19 pandemic, farmed venison demand has remained stable, but there has been a significant reduction in the value of wild venison. Some of the procedures and technologies used routinely to improve fertility and reproduction in cattle and sheep farming can be transferred to deer farming;by doing so, benefits in reproductive efficiency and performance of the herd can be realised.

With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. ResultsSARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.","Gazit, Sivan; Shlezinger, Roei; Perez, Galit; Lotan, Roni; Peretz, Asaf; Ben-Tov, Amir; Cohen, Dani; Muhsen, Khitam; Chodick, Gabriel; Patalon, Tal",,648,16

Methods Five COVID-19 patients, aged from 24 to 69 years old, received HBOT after routine therapies failed to stop the deterioration and progressive hypoxemia in General Hospital of the Yangtze River Shipping. The procedure of HBOT was as follows: compressed to 2.0 ATA (0.1 MPa gauge pressure, patient 1) or 1.6 ATA (0.06 MPa gauge pressure, patient 2-5) at a constant rate for 15 min, maintained for 90 min (first treatment) or 60 min (subsequent treatment), then decompressed to normal pressure for 20 min, once a day; the patients inhaled oxygen with the mask of Built-in-Breathing System continuously; and HBOT was ended when the daily mean pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) in wards was above 95% for two days. The symptoms, respiratory rate (RR), SpO2, arterial blood gas analysis, blood routine, coagulation function, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and chest computed tomography (CT) were collected. Paired t test was used to compare each index before and after treatment. Results After the first HBOT, the symptoms and signs of the five patients began to improve. Supine breathlessness disappeared after HBOT for four times, and digestive tract symptoms completely disappeared and only mild chest pain and breathlessness at rest and in motion remained after HBOT for five times. After finishing HBOT, the RR of the patients was significanlty lower than that before HBOT ([20.80±2.28] min-1 vs [27.20±5.40] min-1, P&lt;0.05). After finishing HBOT, daily SpO2 in wards was increased day by day, and the daily mean SpO2 recovered to more than 95% after the first, second, third, third and sixth HBOT in the five patients, respectively. After the first HBOT decompression, SpO2 was (93.60±0.07)%, which was signficantly higher than that before HBOT ([73.20±6.42] %) (P&lt;0.05). SpO2 values before compression of the second and third HBOT were signficantly higher than that before the first HBOT (both P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the SpO2 immediately before and after the third HBOT (P&gt;0.05). Before HBOT, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of the patients was (31.48±3.40) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), which was lower than the normal range (35-45 mmHg). After finishing HBOT, arterial partial pressure of oxygen ([130.20±18.58] mmHg), arterial oxygen saturation ([98.40±0.55]%), lymphocyte proportion (0.207 8±0.074 2) and lymphocyte count ([1.09±0.24]×109/L) were significantly higher than those before HBOT ([61.60±15.24] mmHg, [73.20±6.43]%, 0.094 6±0.062 1, and [0.61± 0.35]×109/L), while the levels of fibrinogen ([2.97±0.27] g/L) and hs-CRP ([7.76±6.95] mg/L) were significantly lower than those before HBOT ([4.45±0.94] g/L and [30.36±1.27] mg/L) (all P&lt;0.05). The levels of lacttic acid and D-dimer were decreased after HBOT versus before HBOT ([1.13±0.10] mmol/L vs [2.16±1.71] mmol/L, [0.42±0.13] mg/L vs [1.84±1.29] mg/L), but the differences were not significant (both P&gt;0.05). All the five patients had typical lung CT imaging changes of severe COVID-19 before HBOT, which were improved after HBOT. Conclusion Systemic hypoxia induced by persistent hypoxemia may be the main reason for the deterioration of severe COVID-19. The respiratory dysfunction of COVID-19 is mainly alveolar gas exchange dysfunction. HBOT may be the best way to correct the progressive hypoxemia which can not be controlled by atmospheric oxygen supply in severe COVID-19 patients. HBOT can provide enough oxygen supply for the continuous hypoxia tissues, and is beneficial to the recovery of immune function, circulatory function and stress level, so as to improve the condition of patients.","Rui-Yong, Chen; Yan-Chao, Tang; Xiao-Ling, Zhong; Yi, Liang; Bu-Jun, Li; Xiao-Lan, Tao; Chang-Bo, Liao",Acad.

The household survey designed and used by the participants characterized the food and nutrition insecurity situation in vulnerable areas of the community, in a dialogue with national and socioeconomic indicators, evidencing robust data. First of all, the relevance of participatory approaches stood out: while the results show how much FNS is intricately embedded into a broader social vulnerability context, they show how critical it is to consider FNS research as a political instrument and the knowledge it produces as a power-related instrument. In this sense, FNS assessment is established as an emancipatory process, indissociable from the action and social change actors.","Aliaga, Marie Agnes; Ribeiro, Mirella Santos; Santos, Sandra Maria Chaves Dos; Trad, Leny Alves Bomfim",Cien Saude Colet,648,33

In contrast, from the perspective of Austrian economic theory, interest rates have been pushed down on trend by central banks for a long time to stimulate growth, with the global financial crisis of 2007/08 and the Corona crisis of 2020 acting as powerful accelerators of the euthanasia of interest. New Keynesian theory would suggest that interest rates can be adjusted upward again when conditions change, without creating economic and financial disturbances.

This study aimed to examine the effect of radiation (method, dose, and dose rate) on the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, and fatty acid profile of fresh and freeze-dried largemouth bass fleshes. RESULTS: The AV, PV and TBARS presented dose dependent increase in fish meat for both cobalt-60 (60 Co) and electron beam (EB) irradiation. With a 6 kGy of radiation, all measured indices in 60 Co group were significantly higher than those in EB group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). With a 3 kGy of radiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in 200 Gy/min dose rate group were significantly lower than those in 2 Gy/min and 80 Gy/min groups (P<0.05). After 60 Co irradiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in most of fresh samples were significantly higher than those in freeze-dried samples (P<0.01). And 60 Co radiation decreased the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content in fresh samples and increased the UFA content in freeze-dried samples. Our study indicated that 60 Co irradiation, particularly at a low dose rate, accelerated lipid oxidation in fish meat. A large amount of muscle moisture enhances the amount of UFA loss in fish meat during 60 Co irradiation. CONCLUSION: Low dose (3 kGy) of EB irradiation, high dose rate (200 Gy/min) of 60 Co irradiation or freeze-drying treatment can alleviate the lipid oxidation of largemouth bass meat.

In this study, we aimed to determine if SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating in the Los Angeles (LA) area at a time when access to diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was severely limited. METHODS: We used a pooling strategy to look for SARS-CoV-2 in remnant respiratory samples submitted for regular respiratory pathogen testing from symptomatic patients from November 2019 to early March 2020. We then performed sequencing on the positive samples. RESULTS: We detected SARS-CoV-2 in 7 specimens from 6 patients, dating back to mid-January. The earliest positive patient, with a sample collected on January 13, 2020 had no relevant travel history but did have a sibling with similar symptoms. Sequencing of these SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that the virus was introduced into the LA area from both domestic and international sources as early as January. CONCLUSIONS: We present strong evidence of community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the LA area well before widespread diagnostic testing was being performed in early 2020.

RESULTS: We identified a cascade of 45 COVID-19 clusters across community facilities (corrections, nursing, assisted living, intermediate care, extended treatment, shelters, group homes). Attack rates were highest within small facilities (P < .01) and large facilities requiring extensive support to implement effective containment measures. For 25 clusters, we identified an index case who frequently (88%) was a healthcare worker. Engagement of clinical, community, and government partners through public health coordination efforts created opportunities to rapidly develop and coordinate effective response strategies to support the facilities facing the dawning impact of the pandemic.

Several dengue-endemic countries reported similar clinical and laboratory features between COVID-19 and dengue in the early incubation period, and thus discerning the infection is difficult. As a dengue-endemic country, Indonesia also poses the same challenge during the COVID-19 outbreak. This current study analyzed the IgG and IgM profiles from COVID-19 patients by using a serological SARS-CoV-2 and dengue rapid test. In addition, 38 sera from healthy individuals (pre-COVID-19 date) were analyzed using a dengue rapid test. Among 120 samples, 4 samples indicated dengue IgG positive. However, IgM, NS1, and RT-PCR analyses showed negative results. Interestingly, regarding seropositivity of NS1 and DENV IgG from healthy individuals (pre COVID-19 infection), two samples were positive DENV IgG, while one of them was positive NS1. This suggested that in the dengue-endemic area, many people have already experienced dengue and have immunity against dengue virus. There is also the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and dengue infection.

No meta-analysis has explored the impact of varied definitions of liver injury on the reported prevalence of liver injury. Moreover, few studies reported the extent of hypertransaminasemia stratified by COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase. The pooled prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia was estimated. Results: In total, 60 studies were included. The overall prevalence of liver injury was 25%. Compared to subgroups with the non-strict definition of liver injury (33%) and subgroups without giving detailed definition (26%), the subgroup with a strict definition had a much lower prevalence of liver injury (9%). The overall prevalence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation was 19% and 22%. The prevalence of elevated ALT and AST were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases (31% vs 16% and 44% vs 11%). In critically ill and fatal cases, no difference was found in the prevalence of elevated ALT (24% vs 30%) or AST (54% vs 49%). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the adjusted prevalence of ALT elevation, AST elevation, and liver injury decreased to 14%, 7%, and 12%. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of liver injury and hypertransaminasemia in COVID-19 patients might be overestimated. Only a small fraction of COVID-19 patients have clinically significant liver injury. The prevalence of hypertransaminasemia was significantly higher in severe COVID-19 cases compare to non-severe cases.

With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic.","Wuerzner, Grégoire; Waeber, Bernard",Praxis (Bern 1994),648,23

Various online courses were created and the utilisation by the students was analyzed. Material & methods: Examination videos, surgical images and videos were created and live lectures were held. In addition, patient cases of common otorhinolaryngological diseases were reconstructed on an interactive platform. A total of 16 cases were offered in weekly rotation. These cases are provided with gap texts, open and selection questions, links and videos and thematically appropriate digression offers. The time-consuming creation was carried out as a HTML 5 learning package with the authoring program Exelearning 2.5. Each case was to be evaluated separately after being worked on by the students. Results: The direct feedback and the evaluation results of the students on the internship and case presentations were consistently positive. However, on average only 50.72% of the registered students took part in the weekly video meetings. In the course of the semester, the willingness to participate decreased. In addition, the willingness to evaluate the patient cases was low. Discussion: With the case presentation tool, concrete patient examples can be well presented, especially when patient contact is not possible (especially in an ENT clinic due to violation of distance and hygienic rules). Even though the evaluations were positive in terms of content, the frequency of utilisation and also the motivation for feedback seems disappointing. This seems to be associated above all with an increasing return to everyday life after the end of the lockdown.","Vielsmeier, Veronika; Auerswald, Steffen; Marienhagen, Jörg; Keil, Stephanie; Müller, Nico",GMS J Med Educ,648,14

Our objective was to develop a risk score that can accurately quantify a patients probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsThis observational study enrolled consecutive adults who presented to the emergency departments of 32 hospitals participating in Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We divided our study population by randomly assigning study sites into derivation (75%) and validation (25%) cohorts We pre-specified predictors and used multiple imputation for variables with incomplete data. In the derivation cohort, we fit models using logistic regression, with spline functions for continuous variables, to predict the primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. We used a fast step-down procedure to select a concise model. The final reduced model had points allocated to each variable based on their predictive strength. We then validated the model in the geographically distinct validation cohort. FindingsWe derived a ten-item CCEDRRN COVID-19 Infection Score using data from 21,743 patients. This score included variables from history and physical examination, and an indicator of local disease incidence. The score had a C-statistic of 0.838 with excellent calibration. We externally validated the rule in 5,295 patients. The score maintained excellent discrimination and calibration, and had superior performance compared to another previously published risk score. InterpretationThe CCEDRRN COVID-19 Infection Score uses clinical characteristics and publicly available indicators of disease incidence to quantify a patients probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The score can identify patients at sufficiently high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to warrant isolation and empiric therapy prior to test confirmation, while also identifying patients at sufficiently low risk of infection that they may not need testing.

There is hardly research where system evolution is described on the base of information flows in the system. The paper focuses on the link between the dynamics of information and system evolution. Information, exchanged between different system's parts, before being processed is first provided with meaning by the system. Meanings are generated from the perspective of hindsight, i.e. against the arrow of time. The same information can be differently interpreted by different system's parts (i,e,provided with different meanings) so that the number of options for possible system development is proliferated. Some options eventually turn into observable system states. So that system evolutionary dynamics can be considered as due to information processing within the system. This process is considered here in a model representation. The model under study is Triple Helix (TH) model, which was earlier used to describe interactions between university, industry and government to foster innovations. In TH model the system is comprised of three interacting parts where each part process information ina different way. The model is not limited to the sphere of innovation and can be used in a broader perspective.

METHODS: A case-control study in which 701 confirmed COVID-19 patients (of which 41 were intensive care unit [ICU]-admitted) and 250 control subjects were enrolled. The study was conducted retrospectively in October on patients admitted to 3 separate hospitals in Saudi Arabia namely: King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz University Hospital (Riyadh), Ohud Hospital (Madinah), and Nojood Medical Center (Madinah) between May and September 2020. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was calculated based on absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count. Institutional ethical approval was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: Patients (median age 35 years), of which 54.8% were females, were younger than the control cohort (median age 48 years). Patients had significantly higher NLR compared to the control group. Intensive care unit admitted patients had significantly higher platelet, WBC and neutrophil counts. The ICU patients' NLR was almost twice as of the non-intensive patients. The NLR value of 5.5 was found to be of high specificity (96.4%) and positive predictive value (91.4%) in diagnosing COVID-19. Furthermore, it had a very good sensitivity (86.4%) in predicting severe forms of disease, such as, ICU admission. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an important tool in determining the COVID-19 clinical status. This study further confirms the prognostic value of NLR in detecting severe infection, and those patients with high NLR should be closely monitored and managed.","Sayed, Anwar A; Allam, Assem A; Sayed, Ayman I; Alraey, Mohammed A; Joseph, Mercy V",Saudi Med J,648,1

However, regulation of IFN production is crucial because chronic IFN responses can have deleterious effects on both antitumor and antimicrobial immunity in addition to provoking autoinflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Therefore, further understanding of the mechanisms regulating IFN production is necessary for developing better vaccines and immunotherapies. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we focus on the accumulated evidence on antimicrobial and antitumor activities of type I and II IFNs acquired before the COVID-19 era. We first summarize the intracellular and intercellular mechanisms regulating IFN production and signaling. Then, we discuss the mechanisms modulating the dual nature of IFNs for both antitumor and antimicrobial immune responses. Finally, we review the detrimental role of IFNs for induction of autoinflammation and autoimmunity. EXPERT OPINION: Vaccines and immunotherapies activate the immune system for IFN production, which is indispensable for boosting robust antigen-specific immune responses. The current evidence suggests that the dual role of IFNs for antimicrobial and antitumor immunity is dependent not only on the timing, administration route, and dose of IFNs but also on the type of pathogen/tumor. Nevertheless, chronic IFN production may have devastating effects, such as provocation of autoinflammation that could be followed by autoimmunity. Therefore, designing vaccines or immunotherapies requires a deliberate consideration of the mechanisms modulating the dual role of IFN for each specific disease. Indeed, combinatorial therapies involving IFN-inducing adjuvants and immune-checkpoint blockers may offer therapeutic potential, especially for cancer, whereas infectious diseases require fine adjustment of timing, dose, and route of the administration for candidate IFN-based vaccines or immunotherapies.","Temizoz, Burcu; Ishii, Ken J",Expert rev. vaccines (Online),648,1

METHODS: To explore the efficacy and safety of Reduning injection in the treatment of COVID-19, a randomized, open-labeled, multicenter, controlled trial was conducted from 12 general hospitals between 2020.02.06 and 2020.03.23. Patients with COVID-19 who met the diagnostic criteria of the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"". Patients were randomized to routine treatment with or without Reduning injection (20 mL/day for 14 days) (ChiCTR2000029589). The primary endpoint was the rate of achieving clinical symptom recovery on day 14 of treatment. RESULTS: There were 77 and 80 participants in the Reduning and control groups. The symptom resolution rate at 14 days was higher in the Reduning injection than in controls [full-analysis set (FAS): 84.4% vs. 60.0%, P=0.0004]. Compared with controls, the Reduning group showed shorter median time to resolution of the clinical symptoms (143 vs. 313.5 h, P<0.001), shorter to nucleic acid test turning negative (146.5 vs. 255.5 h, P<0.001), shorter hospital stay (14.1 vs. 18.1 days, P<0.001), and shorter time to defervescence (29 vs. 71 h, P<0.001).

This is consistent with the hypothesis from a previous study that for core protein attachment, viruses are glycosylated at HS attachment sites (i.e., serine residues intended to receive the D-xylose molecule for initiating HS chains). Heparanase overexpression, endocytic entry, and syndecan shedding enhancement, all of which are observed during viral infection, lead to glycocalyx deregulation and appear to be direct consequences of this hypothesis.

(Box program) by working with approved suppliers (or distributors) to purchase fresh produce, dairy, and meat directly from farmers and package them into boxes Recognizing that food banks did not have spare capacity to support the Box program, how should these food boxes be distributed to people who are in need? The USDA developed a novel solution by asking: (a) suppliers to distribute food boxes directly to agencies (shelters, food pantries, and soup kitchens);and (b) food banks to serve as ?virtual intermediaries? to coordinate supply and demand between suppliers and agencies However, as food banks were overwhelmed with their regular operations for distributing donated food during the pandemic, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank (LARFB) found it difficult to develop and deploy a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the Box program with limited manpower and expertise In this paper, we describe a DSS co-developed by LARFB, Salesforce, and UCLA Unlike other DSSs developed in normal circumstances, the development and deployment of the DSS were conducted virtually within 45 days Without this DSS, it would have been impossible for LARFB to support the Box program Because this DSS was developed in a record time, we discuss several limitations and suggest future research opportunities for managing food bank operations during a pandemic","Blackmon, Lester Chan Ross Carbral Omar Chintapally Geeta Dhara Sandip Felix Peter Jagdish Aditi Konakalla Srini Labana Jasbir McIlvain Jeff Stone Jason Tang Christopher S.; Torres, Jason Wu Weldon",Production and Operations Management,648,21

AIM: To investigate patient preferences for treatment settings in the light of the current pandemic. METHODS: Patients, who prior to the pandemic had attended two different outpatient clinics in a university hospital for their infusions or injections, were interviewed by telephone. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: Out of 49 patients with either anti-inflammatory or immunoglobulin treatments (response rate: 83 %), 24 (49.0 %) switched from subcutaneous (sc) injections in the hospital to the community setting, 18 (36.7 %) from intravenous infusions (iv) in the hospital to sc administration at home and 7 (14.3 %) moved to iv at home. During the pandemic 38 (80.9 %) wanted to continue their treatment at home, but after the pandemic 22 (46.8 %) would opt to go back to the hospital. Satisfaction was high with both settings, slightly favoring drug administration in hospital. Qualitative data shows that patients while emphasizing the importance of the relationship with the healthcare team, had increased concerns about safety as a result of COVID-19.

Materials and method: Online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across West Bengal city, using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire had 17 questions: (1) Section A was 'General section' which comprised of socio-demographic and professional details of the subjects; and (2) Section B comprised of 14 questions depicting knowledge, awareness attitude and practice regarding COVID-19. The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis with level of significance at p=0.05. The descriptive statistical analysis was done to compute frequency and percentages. Intergroup comparison was determined by Chi-square statistical analysis to determine the level of significance for responses of each question. Results: Around 70.4% undergraduates participated in the study. Only 4.3% showed accurate knowledge with respect to the incubation period of coronavirus. Coughing and sneezing was considered to be the most common mode of transmission. 98.9% of dentists considered fever to be the characteristic symptom of the disease. Hand washing and alcohol rubs was advocated by 99.5% of the dentist. Emergency procedures were considered necessary by 90.8% dentists. 75.1% of dentists agree that their practice has been affected by the pandemic. Conclusion: A constant update regarding COVID-19 should be made available to dental health care professionals through webinars, seminars, discussions and articles.

Data from hourly sampling indicated a peak in the viral RNA during the morning hours (6-9 am) when the all the domestic activities are maximum. The daily sampling and processing revealed the dynamic nature of infection spread among the population. The two sampling methods viz. grab, and composite showed a good correlation. Overall, this study establishes a structured protocol for performing WBE studies that could provide useful insights on the spread of the pandemic at a given point of time. Moreover, this framework could be extrapolated to monitor several other clinically relevant diseases. Following these guidelines, it is possible to achieve measurable and reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater infrastructure and establish a national surveillance system.

This study aims to develop a novel deep learning approach for accurate and rapid non-invasive identification of brain metastatic tumor histology with conventional whole-brain MRI. The use of clinical whole-brain data and the end-to-end pipeline obviate external human intervention. This IRB-approved single-site retrospective study was comprised of patients (n=1,293) referred for MRI treatment-planning and gamma knife radiosurgery from July 2000 to May 2019. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted contrast enhanced and T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery brain MRI exams (n=1,428) were minimally preprocessed (voxel resolution unification and signal-intensity rescaling/normalization), requiring only seconds per an MRI scan, and input into the proposed deep learning workflow for tumor segmentation, modality transfer, and primary site classification associated with brain metastatic disease in one of four classes (lung, melanoma, renal, and other). Ten-fold cross-validation generated the overall AUC of 0.941, lung class AUC of 0.899, melanoma class AUC of 0.882, renal class AUC of 0.870, and other class AUC of 0.885. It is convincingly established that whole-brain imaging features would be sufficiently discriminative to allow accurate diagnosis of the primary organ site of malignancy. Our end-to-end deep learning-based radiomic method has a great translational potential for classifying metastatic tumor types using whole-brain MRI images, without additional human intervention. Further refinement may offer invaluable tools to expedite primary organ site cancer identification for treatment of brain metastatic disease and improvement of patient outcomes and survival.","Lyu, Qing; Namjoshi, Sanjeev V.; McTyre, Emory; Topaloglu, Umit; Barcus, Richard; Chan, Michael D.; Cramer, Christina K.; Debinski, Waldemar; Gurcan, Metin N.; Lesser, Glenn J.; Lin, Hui-Kuan; Munden, Reginald F.; Pasche, Boris C.; Sai, Kiran Kumar Solingapuram; Strowd, Roy E.; Tatter, Stephen B.; Watabe, Kounosuke; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Ge; Whitlow, Christopher T.",,648,16

The new pathogen β-coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus was initially named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), identified in a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Patients developed alterations in the respiratory system leading to severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Objective: To review the available scientific evidence related to the care of the respiratory system in order to establish general treatment guidelines. Methods: Narrative review of the literature was carried out that included a search, selection, and review of original and secondary articles written in English or Spanish in the different databases: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE published up to March 2020. Results: No specific treatment for the new disease has been defined, with symptomatic control as the main therapeutic measure. The use of biosecurity elements, such as goggles, hats, gloves, long waterproof aprons, high efficiency masks for healthcare personnel (FFP2 or N95) is recommended. In symptomatic patients use surgical masks, hospital soap, paper towels, and 70% alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Use oxygen through low flow systems.

As the pandemic is still spreading, new data concerning Covid-19 complications and related mechanisms become increasingly available. Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid-19 period. This may be further exacerbated by drug-related cardiac toxicity of Covid-19 treatment regimens. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid-19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative, not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures. Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation. The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also discussed in this review. Finally, we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid-19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug-related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies.","Mavraganis, Georgios; Aivalioti, Evmorfia; Chatzidou, Sofia; Patras, Raphael; Paraskevaidis, Ioannis; Kanakakis, Ioannis; Stamatelopoulos, Kimon; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios",Food Chem Toxicol,648,1

It is critical for kidney transplant centers to understand the behaviors, concerns and wishes of transplant recipients and waiting list candidates. METHODS: French kidney patients were contacted to answer an online electronic survey at the end of the lockdown. RESULTS: At the end of the first wave of the pandemic in France (11 May 2020), 2112 kidney transplant recipients and 487 candidates answered the survey. More candidates than recipients left their home during the lockdown, mainly for health care (80.1% vs. 69.4%; P<0.001). More candidates than recipients reported being exposed to Covid-19 patients (2.7% vs. 1.2%; P=0.006). Many recipients and even more candidates felt inadequately informed by their transplant center during the pandemic (19.6% vs. 54%; P<0.001). Among candidates, 71.1% preferred to undergo transplant as soon as possible, 19.5% preferred to wait until Covid-19 had left their community, and 9.4% were not sure what to do. CONCLUSIONS: During the Covid-19 pandemic in France, the majority of candidates wished to receive a transplant as soon as possible without waiting until Covid-19 had left their community. Communication between kidney transplant centers and patients must be improved to better understand and serve patients' needs.","Couzi, Lionel; Manook, Miriam; Caillard, Sophie; Épailly, Éric; Barrou, Benoît; Anglicheau, Dany; Buchler, Mathias; Mussot, Sacha; Dumortier, Jérôme; Thaunat, Olivier; Sebbag, Laurent; Blancho, Gilles; Le Meur, Yannick; Patel, Yuval A; Samoylova, Mariya; McElroy, Lisa; Shaw, Brian I; Sanoff, Scott; Hazzan, Marc",Nephrol. ther,648,21

We studied the association of GM diversity and composition, plasma metabolites, predicted functional metagenomics and steatosis. Approach & Results This is a cross-sectional analysis of the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. We used 16Sribosomal-RNA gene sequencing and determined taxonomy using the Silva-reference database. Alpha-and beta-diversity were calculated using Shannon-index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. Differences were tested across steatosis using PerMANOVA. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography. We subsequently selected genera using regularized regression. The functional metagenome was predicted based on the GM using KEGG-pathways. Serum metabolomics were assessed using high-throughput proton nuclear magnetic resonance. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, alcohol, diet, and proton-pump inhibitors. We included 1355 participants of which 472 had steatosis. Alpha-diversity was lower in steatosis (P=1.1â10-9 ) and beta-diversity varied across steatosis strata (P=0.001). Lasso selected 37 genera of which three remained significantly associated after adjustment (Coprococcus3: ß=-65; Ruminococcus Gauvreauiigroup: ß=62; and Ruminococcus Gnavusgroup: ß=45, Q-value =0.037). Predicted metagenome analyses revealed that pathways of secondary bile-acid synthesis and biotin metabolism were present and D-alanine metabolism was absent in steatosis. Metabolic profiles showed positive associations for aromatic-and branched chain amino acids and glycoprotein acetyls with steatosis and R. Gnavusgroup, whereas these metabolites were inversely associated with alpha-diversity and Coprococcus3. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed, for the first time on a large-scale, the lower microbial diversity and association of Coprococcus and Ruminococcus Gnavus with steatosis. We additionally showed that steatosis and alpha-diversity share -opposite- metabolic profiles.","Alferink, Louise Jm; Radjabzadeh, Djawad; Erler, Nicole S; Vojinovic, Dina; Medina-Gomez, Carolina; Uitterlinden, André G; Knegt, Robert J de; Amin, Najaf; Ikram, M Arfan; Janssen, Harry LA; Kiefte-deJong, J C; Metselaar, Herold J; Duijn, Cornelia M van; Kraaij, Robert; Darwish Murad, Sarwa",Hepatology (Baltim.),648,10

An experimental temporal query engine has been implemented in a NoSQL database using our new ELII strategy. Near-real-time performance was achieved on a large Covid-19 EHR dataset, with 1.3 million unique patients and 3.76 billion records. We evaluated the performance of ELII on several types of queries: classical (non-temporal), absolute temporal, and relative temporal. Our experimental results indicate that ELII accomplished these queries in seconds, achieving average speed accelerations of 26.8 times on relative temporal query, 88.6 times on absolute temporal query, and 1037.6 times on classical query compared to a baseline approach without using ELII.

Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited, and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Although guiding data is scarce, we present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic. The overarching goals of these approaches are the following: (1) reduce the number of visits to a health care facility, (2) reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (3) attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and (4) provide effective oncologic therapy. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive nonoperative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Nonoperative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available. The order of treatments may be on the basis of patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually, cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is increased for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.","Kumar, Sameera; Chmura, Steven; Robinson, Clifford; Lin, Steven H; Gadgeel, Shirish M; Donington, Jessica; Feliciano, Josephine; Stinchcombe, Thomas E; Werner-Wasik, Maria; Edelman, Martin J; Moghanaki, Drew",J Thorac Oncol,648,1

We reported 2 cases of shoulder weakness and amyotrophy related to spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy due to neuralgic amyotrophy occurring after COVID-19 infection. METHODS: For both patients, clinical history, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX), and imaging examinations invalidated other diagnoses but confirmed NA diagnosis. RESULTS: The NA involved only the SAN in both cases. EDX revealed a characteristic axonal lesion found in NA. SAN conduction study revealed normal latencies and low compound motor action potential amplitude for trapezius muscle when needle examination demonstrated a neurogenic pattern and denervation signs in the trapezius muscle. Both patient's MRI revealed denervation T2 hypersignal in impaired muscles, and hypersignal of the involved roots, trunks, or nerves without any mass, cyst, injury, fibrous band, or tearing signs along SAN course. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 infection could be the trigger for NA as many other viruses, and as it is a possible trigger for Guillain-Barré syndrome.","Coll, Clemence; Tessier, Muriel; Vandendries, Christophe; Seror, Paul",Joint Bone Spine,648,2

Detection of COVID-19 at an early stage is essential to provide adequate healthcare to affected patients and protect the uninfected community. This paper aims to design and develop a novel ensemble-based classifier to predict COVID-19 cases at a very early stage so that appropriate action can be taken by patients, doctors, health organizations, and the government. In this paper, a synthetic dataset of COVID-19 is generated by a dataset generation algorithm. A novel ensemble-based classifier of machine learning is employed on the COVID-19 dataset to predict the disease. A convex hull-based approach is also applied to the data to improve the proposed novel, ensemble-based classifier's accuracy and speed. The model is designed and developed through the python programming language and compares with the most popular classifier, i.e., Decision Tree, ID3, and support vector machine. The results indicate that the proposed novel classifier provides a more significant precision, kappa static, root means a square error, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.","Singh, Prabh Deep; Kaur, Rajbir; Singh, Kiran Deep; Dhiman, Gaurav",Inf Syst Front,648,24

Hospital staff from the isolation wards were trained in the safety and proper use of the hazardous materials suit and the proper managing of the biohazard materials. We were not expecting the situation, so we started to create more restrictions than facilities for mothers giving birth. In the context of infection risk for the fetus, scientists still search for vertical transmission evidence, but available data are ambiguous, and more research is needed. Concerning the infant safety and to minimalize the infection risk for medical teams, the first Polish guidelines published by the national consultants in obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology, and perinatology regarding the safest formula of birth were as the following: in the case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cesarean section for epidemic indications should be considered, except in an advanced or rapid labor. In the lately updated consensus (14th May), it was written that because the risk of vertical and intranatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission seemed to be low, the SARS-CoV-2 infection was not the main indication to perform cesarean section for any longer. Regardless of the birth formula, the newborns are separated from their mothers immediately after the labor in Polish obstetrician hospitals. The Polish Lactation Study Centre, consociating International Breastfeeding Certified Lactation Consultant, recommends feeding the newborn with its own mother's milk, even if she is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and isolated from her infant.","Wszolek, Katarzyna M; Chmaj-Wierzchowska, Karolina; Wilczak, Maciej",Ginekol Pol,648,1

Objective: To report the neurological manifestations of children with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-series study, patients younger than 18 years who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological symptoms to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (London, UK) between March 1, 2020, and May 8, 2020, were included after infection was confirmed by either a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay by nasopharyngeal swab or a positive test result for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical and paraclinical features were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results: Of the 27 children with COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 4 patients (14.8%) who were previously healthy had new-onset neurological symptoms. Symptoms included encephalopathy, headaches, brainstem and cerebellar signs, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. All 4 patients required intensive care unit admission for the treatment of COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Splenium signal changes were seen in all 4 patients on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. In the 2 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was tested, samples were acellular, with no evidence of infection on polymerase chain reaction or culture (including negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results) and negative oligoclonal band test results. In all 3 patients who underwent electroencephalography, a mild excess of slow activity was found. Tests for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and aquaporin-4 autoantibodies had negative results in all patients.

This is the third novel coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades and presents an ensuing healthcare resource burden that threatens to overwhelm available healthcare resources. A study of the initial Chinese response has shown that there is a significant positive association between coronavirus disease 2019 mortality and healthcare resource burden. Based on the Chinese experience, some 19% of coronavirus disease 2019 cases develop severe or critical disease. This results in a need for adequate preparation and mobilisation of critical care resources to anticipate and adapt to a surge in coronavirus disease 2019 case-load in order to mitigate morbidity and mortality. In this article, we discuss some of the peri-operative and critical care resource planning considerations and management strategies employed in a tertiary academic medical centre in Singapore in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.","Lee, C C M; Thampi, S; Lewin, B; Lim, T J D; Rippin, B; Wong, W H; Agrawal, R V",Anaesthesia,648,16

Azithromycin didn't bind to BSA neither did it interfere in binding of colchicine. The results from molecular docking studies also led to a similar conclusion that azithromycin didn't interfere in the binding of colchicine to BSA.

However, it is questionable whether existing BioNER models can effectively handle them. In this work, we systematically analyze the three types of recognition abilities of BioNER models: memorization, synonym generalization, and concept generalization. We find that although BioNER models achieve state-of-the-art performance on BioNER benchmarks based on overall performance, they have limitations in identifying synonyms and new biomedical concepts such as COVID-19. From this observation, we conclude that existing BioNER models are overestimated in terms of their generalization abilities. Also, we identify several difficulties in recognizing unseen mentions in BioNER and make the following conclusions: (1) BioNER models tend to exploit dataset biases, which hinders the models' abilities to generalize, and (2) several biomedical names have novel morphological patterns with little name regularity such as COVID-19, and models fail to recognize them. We apply a current statistics-based debiasing method to our problem as a simple remedy and show the improvement in generalization to unseen mentions. We hope that our analyses and findings would be able to facilitate further research into the generalization capabilities of NER models in a domain where their reliability is of utmost importance.","Kim, Hyunjae; Kang, Jaewoo",,648,16

AIM: To conduct an in-depth investigation into the risk factors for liver injury and into the effective measures to prevent subsequent mortality risk. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 440 consecutive patients with relatively severe COVID-19 between January 28 and March 9, 2020 at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data on clinical features, laboratory parameters, medications, and prognosis were collected. RESULTS: COVID-19-associated liver injury more frequently occurred in patients aged &#8805; 65 years, female patients, or those with other comorbidities, decreased lymphocyte count, or elevated D-dimer or serum ferritin (P < 0.05). The disease severity of COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for liver injury (severe patients: Odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78-4.59; critical patients: OR = 13.44, 95%CI: 7.21-25.97). The elevated levels of on-admission aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin indicated an increased mortality risk (P < 0.001). Using intravenous nutrition or antibiotics increased the risk of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Hepatoprotective drugs tended to be of assistance to treat the liver injury and improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19-associated liver injury. CONCLUSION: More intensive monitoring of aspartate aminotransferase or total bilirubin is recommended for COVID-19 patients, especially patients aged &#8805; 65 years, female patients, or those with other comorbidities.

Despite the current implementation of COVID-19 vaccination schedules, identifying effective antiviral drug treatments for this disease continues to be a priority. A recent study showed that masitinib (MST), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ). Although MST is a potential candidate for COVID-19 treatment, a comprehensive analysis of its interaction with Mpro has not been done. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the MST-Mpro complex crystal structure. The effect of the protonation states of Mpro H163 residue and MST titratable groups were studied. Furthermore, we identified the MST substituents and Mpro mutations that affect the stability of the complex.

Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS: Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS: We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels can trigger ferroptosis onset, some drugs that scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals can help control ferroptosis-related disorders, including AKI.","Mishima, Eikan; Sato, Emiko; Ito, Junya; Yamada, Ken-Ichi; Suzuki, Chitose; Oikawa, Yoshitsugu; Matsuhashi, Tetsuro; Kikuchi, Koichi; Toyohara, Takafumi; Suzuki, Takehiro; Ito, Sadayoshi; Nakagawa, Kiyotaka; Abe, Takaaki",J Am Soc Nephrol,648,20

Since then there has been a rapid rise in development of maternal and perinatal health guidelines related to COVID-19. The aim of this project was to develop a database of Australian and international recommendations relating to antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care of women during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to identify inconsistencies in clinical guidance. METHODS: We conducted weekly web searches from 30th March to 15th May 2020 to identify recommendations pertaining to the care of women during pregnancy, labour and postpartum period from national or international professional societies, specialist colleges, Ministries of Health, Australian state and territory governments, and international guideline development organisations. Individual recommendations were extracted and classified according to intervention type, time period, and patient population. Findings were reported using descriptive analysis, with areas of consensus and non-consensus identified. RESULTS: We identified 81 guidelines from 48 different organisations. Generally, there was high consensus across guidelines for specific interventions. However, variable guidance was identified on the use of nitrous oxide during labour, administration of antenatal corticosteroids, neonatal isolation after birth, labour and birth companions, and the use of disease modifying agents for treating COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between different guideline development organisations creates challenges for maternity care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Collating recommendations and keeping up-to-date with the latest guidance can help clinicians provide the best possible care to pregnant women and their babies.","Pavlidis, Pollyanna; Eddy, Katherine; Phung, Laura; Farrington, Elise; Connolly, Mairead; Lopes, Rudy; Wilson, Alyce N; Homer, Caroline S E; Vogel, Joshua P",Women and birth (Online),648,26

The healthcare industry has been a relatively slow adopter of digital innovation due to the conventional belief that humans need to be at the center of healthcare delivery tasks. However, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to carry out specific tasks such as pre-hospital triage and enable clinicians to deliver care at scale. Recognizing that the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild and do not require hospitalization, Partners HealthCare (now Mass General Brigham) implemented a digitally-automated pre-hospital triage solution to direct patients to the appropriate care setting before they showed up at the emergency department and clinics, which would otherwise consume resources, expose other patients and staff to potential viral transmission, and further exacerbate supply-and-demand mismatching. Although the use of AI has been well-established in other industries to optimize supply and demand matching, the introduction of AI to perform tasks remotely that were traditionally performed in-person by clinical staff represents a significant milestone in healthcare operations strategy.","Lai, Lucinda; Wittbold, Kelley A; Dadabhoy, Farah Z; Sato, Rintaro; Landman, Adam B; Schwamm, Lee H; He, Shuhan; Patel, Rajesh; Wei, Nancy; Zuccotti, Gianna; Lennes, Inga T; Medina, Danika; Sequist, Thomas D; Bomba, Garrett; Keschner, Yonatan G; Zhang, Haipeng Mark",Healthc (Amst),648,20

Infection prevention (IP) performance among aircraft cabin crew is crucial for preventing in-flight transmission. We aimed to identify the level of IP performance and factors affecting IP performance among aircraft cabin crew during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. An online survey was conducted with 177 cabin crew members between August and September 2020. The survey assessed IP performance, and IP awareness, using a five-point Likert scale, and also evaluated simulation-based personal protective equipment (PPE) training experience, and organizational culture. The average IP performance score was 4.56 ± 0.44. Although the performance level for mask-wearing was high (4.73 ± 0.35), hand hygiene (HH) performance (4.47 ± 0.56) was low. Multivariate analysis showed that IP performance was significantly associated with IP awareness (p < 0.05) and simulation-based PPE training experience (p < 0.05). Since HH performance was relatively low, cabin crew and airlines should make efforts to improve HH performance. Furthermore, a high level of IP awareness and PPE training experience can improve IP performance among cabin crew members. Therefore, simulation-based PPE training and strategies to improve IP awareness are essential for preventing in-flight infection transmission.","Ryu, Jaegeum; Kim, Jungha; Choi-Kwon, Smi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),648,17

Immunosuppressives and biological treatments multiply the chances of opportunistic and lung infections, especially in combination therapy, so due to the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) epidemic, which primarily causes respiratory disease, it is advisable to use different therapeutic considerations for effective and safe patient care. Contrary to the expectations, a study from Italy and China each, despite of the large number of infected cases, did not report any SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which can be due to a number of favorable factors, such as the lower average age of the patients, lack of comorbidities, etc. However, it should not be forgotten that the patients on immunosuppressive and/or biological therapy belong to the compromised group. Consequently, in some cases there is a need to modify the therapy, but we should keep in mind that the relapse alongside with the need of medical consultation and even hospitalization elevate the chance of being infected. Thus, flare-ups ought to be avoided as far as they can be, so continuing the already started maintenance therapy can be a reasonable solution, but, in the high-risk group, modifying it can be reasonable as well.

METHOD: Chest CT derived measurements were evaluated retrospectively for 217 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Using a CT histogram analysis, we measured pectoralis muscle volume (PV) and pectoralis muscle density (PD). Patients were divided into groups first according to gender and then subgroups, which are age and outcome. RESULTS: The COVID-19 diagnoses were confirmed by RT-PCR testing, chest CT and clinical findings in 217 patients (108 men, 109 women), aged 21-92 years (mean 61 years). PD measurements were lower in the exitus group (p = 0.001) and in patients aged &#8805;65 than in those aged <65 years (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between PD measurements of outpatient and inpatient under 65 years age (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between fatty volume measurements according to the exitus status of cases (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CT-derived measurements of the pectoralis muscle can be useful in predicting disease severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in adult patients.","Hocaoglu, Elif; Ors, Suna; Yildiz, Omer; Inci, Ercan",Acad. radiol,648,1

COVID-19 may yield a variety of clinical pictures, differing from pneumonitis to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) along with vascular damage in the lung tissue, which is named as endotheliitis, To date, no specific treatment was approved by any authority for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Materials and MethodsHere, we presented our experience on COVID-19 with evaluating 11,190 COVID-19 patients by presenting the manifestations of endotheliitis in skin, lung, and brain tissues according to different phases of COVID-19. Since distinctive manifestations in each COVID-19 patient, including non-respiratory conditions in the acute phase and the emerging risk of long-lasting complications, suggest that COVID-19 has an endotheliitis-centred thrombo-inflammatory pathophysiology, our treatment strategy was adopted to prevent both respiratory and vascular distresses, which are categorized according to extent of endotheliitis. (Group A: no or mild pulmonary involvement, Group B: moderate pulmonary involvement with clinical risk of deterioration, Group C: severe pulmonary involvement and respiratory failure). ResultsA total of 11.190 COVID-19 patients that were diagnosed and treated in Samsun VM Medicalpark Hospital, Turkey, between March 2020 and April 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age was 59.2 {+/-}17.3 years and male to female ratio was 5507/5683. Among these patients, 1896 (16.9%) individuals were hospitalized. While 1220 (64.3%) of the inpatients were hospitalized within the first 10 days after the diagnosis, 676 (35.7%) of them were hospitalized 10 days after their diagnosis. The number of patients who did not respond to group A and B treatments and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (Group C) was 520 (27.4%). Among hospitalized patients, 146 (7.7%) individuals needed ventilator support (non-invasive/invasive mechanical ventilation) and were followed in the intensive care unit, and 43 (2.2%) patients died. ConclusionPotential pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to endotheliitis includes cytokine storm and toxic plasma, thromboinflammation and systemic microangiopathy. Endotheliitis can also explain the mechanism behind the respiratory failure in COVID-19, and the difference of COVID-19 related ARDS from ARDS seen in other critical conditions. Hence, daily evaluation of momentary changes in clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of patients and deciding appropriate pathophysiological treatment would help to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19.","Dirican, Adem; Ildir, Selin; Uzar, Tugce; Karaman, Irem; OZKAYA, Sevket",,648,30

Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to quickly build the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage of past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T­cell receptor Î³Î´ cells are in the first line of defense, activated by stress molecules and recognizing some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex-independent but still specific, eg, cytomegalovirus, as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism-both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS­CoV­2. Most deaths occur due to pneumonitis, in the course of which overwhelming inflammation impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails and, therefore, patients at risk, mostly the elderly, show higher levels of anti-SARS­CoV­2 antibodies and enhanced inflammation in the lungs. Apparently, there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype­associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, considering the anti­inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these 2 immunotherapeutic tools is understandable based on basic immunology and this knowledge may direct the efforts of the medical community aimed at combating the virus.","Jaskula, Emilia; Lange, Andrzej",Pol Arch Intern Med,648,33

Within the 12 months prior to hospitalization for Covid-19, 79 patients (71%) were treated for their lymphoma. Among them, 63 (57%) received an anti-CD20 therapy. Fourteen patients (12%) had relapsed/refractory disease. The median LOS was 14 days (range, 1-235). After a median follow-up of 191 days (3-260), the 6-month overall survival was 69%. In multivariable analyses, recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy was associated with prolonged LOS (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.42-3.6, p < 0.001) and higher risk of death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.52, p = 0.039). An age &#8805; 70 years and relapsed/refractory lymphoma were also associated with prolonged LOS and decreased overall survival. In conclusion, an age &#8805; 70 years, a relapsed/refractory lymphoma and recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy are risk factors for prolonged LOS and death for lymphoma patients hospitalized for Covid-19. These findings may contribute to guide the management of lymphoma during the pandemic, support evaluating specific therapeutic approaches, and raise questions on the efficacy and timing of vaccination of this particular population.","Duléry, Rémy; Lamure, Sylvain; Delord, Marc; Di Blasi, Roberta; Chauchet, Adrien; Hueso, Thomas; Rossi, Cédric; Drenou, Bernard; Deau Fischer, Bénédicte; Soussain, Carole; Feugier, Pierre; Noël, Nicolas; Choquet, Sylvain; Bologna, Serge; Joly, Bertrand; Philippe, Laure; Kohn, Milena; Malak, Sandra; Fouquet, Guillemette; Daguindau, Etienne; Taoufik, Yassine; Lacombe, Karine; Cartron, Guillaume; Thiéblemont, Catherine; Besson, Caroline",Am J Hematol,648,15

METHODS: A total of 71 age-matched pediatric IA and COVID-19 patient pairs were formed and their clinical data on admission were compared. RESULTS: Fever, cough, nasal congestion and nausea/vomiting were the most common symptoms on admission for both infections but occurred less often in COVID-19. The IA patients were more likely to have lower-than-normal levels of lymphocyte count and percentage and to have higher-than-normal levels of activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, serum C-reactive protein, and serum procalcitonin, while the COVID-19 patients had higher odds of having lower-than-normal levels of neutrophil count and percentage. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that influenza A is more symptomatic than COVID-19 for children and might be an overall more severe infection at the time of admission.","Liang, Feng; Wang, Xianfeng; Shao, Jianbo; Chen, Jun; Liu, Lei; Li, Hui; Xu, Yi; He, Liya; Liang, Huiying; Li, Kuanrong; Gong, Sitang; Xia, Huimin",BMC Infect Dis,648,16

Going beyond a traditional needs assessment by providing projections of local palliative and end-of-life care needs in all conditions over 20 years, the study will support locality commissioning and development of appropriate health care services. STUDY DESIGN: Population-based needs assessment involving secondary analysis of routinely available regional mortality and population data for Central Lancashire (2017). Palliative care need was estimated using three different recognised methods. METHODS: These estimates were combined with routinely available population and mortality projections and observed trends in palliative care need to provide projections up to 2040. RESULTS: Palliative care need in 2017 in Chorley & South Ribble and Greater Preston is estimated to be between 75% (1292) and 97% (1670), and 74.9% (1337) and 95.7% (1710) of all deaths, respectively. By 2040, the annual need is projected to increase compared with 2017 figures, by 24.2-55.9% (314-729 more deaths) in Chorley & South Ribble and by 13.4-41.4% (180-554 more deaths) in Greater Preston. The numbers of deaths from dementia are forecast to increase by three-fold in both localities. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates practical application of public health data to support the development of locally responsive palliative care services. Dissemination of findings from this needs assessment on rising palliative care need, including numbers of deaths in different disease groups, provides direction to plan appropriate, equitable and sustainable services. Rapidly growing dementia deaths deserve particular attention in the planning of care. Collaborative work between public health and palliative care in other settings is encouraged, and will likely increase in significance as the full impact of COVID-19 is felt.","Jeba, J; Taylor, C; O039,; Donnell, V",Public Health,648,14

As a consequence, it imposed delirious consequences in patients with underlying co - morbid conditions that make them immunocompromised. The purpose of this paper is to provide an in - depth review of influence of COVID - 19 in patients with underlying HIV in terms of mortality and hospitalization. Authors also aim to provide a thorough risk analysis of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality of PLWH and COVID-19. The secondary objective was to analyze the CD4+ count variations and outcome of COVID - 19 and to correlate if ART provided a protective role. Authors also aim to provide an evaluation of typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 in PLWH. ART is found to show activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and there is some similarity in the structure of HIV-1 gp41 and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV since they both belong to +ssRNA type. MethodsWe conducted a literature review using search engines namely, Cochrane, PubMed and Google Scholar. The following keywords were targeted: ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" and ""HIV."" We included case reports, case series, and cohort (retrospective and prospective) studies. We excluded clinical trials and review articles. We came across 23 articles that met the inclusion criteria.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the education system closure/total lockdown in Israel on March 2020, we have noticed a decrease in pediatric ED visits and an increase in hospitalizations of asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: to examine the patterns of ED visits for asthma exacerbations during COVID-19 outbreak, in comparison to the previous year. METHODS: A retrospective study comparing asthma related ED visits and hospitalizations among children aged 2-18 years at a tertiary center in southern Israel. Three time periods were selected: 2020 A (prelockdown, 2/1/20 to 3/14/20), 2020 B (lockdown, 3/15/20 to 5/15/20) and 2020 C (postlockdown, 5/16/20 to 6/30/20) and compared to the three parallel time periods in 2019. Data regarding demographics, number of ED visits and clinical severity parameters were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twelve children visited the ED for asthma exacerbation: 273 children during 2019 and 239 children during 2020. Lockdown period in 2020 revealed significantly fewer ED visits per day compared to the parallel calendar period in 2019 (1.8 vs. 1.43, p < .001). Significantly higher hospitalization rate (47.1% vs. 33.7%, p = .05) and longer length of stay (3.15 vs. 1.9 days, p = .03) were observed during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: Lockdown is associated with fewer ED visits for asthma exacerbation, probably due to; reduced exposure to viral infections and environmental allergens, decreased availability of primary physicians and families' reluctance to arrive to the ED. ED visits during lockdown were characterized by higher hospitalization rate and longer LOS.","Golan-Tripto, Inbal; Arwas, Noga; Maimon, Michal S; Bari, Romi; Aviram, Micha; Gatt, Dvir; Goldbart, Aviv",Pediatr. pulmonol,648,26

Every year thousands of crowded events are organised around the globe. Majority of the crowded events are religious in nature, with sensitivities and emotions attached. Organisation of crowded events, especially during a pandemic like COVID-19, poses a considerable challenge. To contain the spread of a human to human contagious disease, several restrictions, including wearing face masks, maintain social distancing, and adhering to regular cleaning and sanitisation, are critical. These restrictions stress the need for the event organisers, including the local or central government, to overhaul policies and practices about crowd management during a pandemic. Some crowded events are regular, whereas the others are occasional, which could be spontaneous such as a protest march, a political rally or a funeral procession. Controlling spontaneous crowded events can be quite difficult, especially during a crisis like COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we shall review several crowded events which have taken place during the ongoing pandemic and investigate their impact and contribution in the spreading or containing COVID-19. We shall also provide a framework for effectively organising crowded events during the ongoing and future pandemics.","Basahel, Sarah Alsabban Abdullah Yamin Mohammad",International journal of information technology : an official journal of Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management,648,24

This study aimed to determine the level of satisfaction on the quality of education and virtual education during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis in nursing students of Aja University of Medical Sciences in 2020. Methods: This cross-sectional study (descriptive-correlation) was conducted at the end of the second semester of 2019-2020. All Aja nursing students were selected by the census method and recruited in the study. Individual characteristics questionnaire, course experience questionnaire (CEQ), and e-learning satisfaction questionnaire were used to collect data. Results: More than 66% of students were satisfied with the quality of the training course. More than half of the students (56.3%) were relatively satisfied with virtual education. Among individual variables, only students' semester was considered as a predictor of satisfaction with the course (P &lt;0001). There was no significant relationship between the dimensions and the CEQ score with students' academic achievement (P &lt;0.05). All dimensions of the CEQ were significant predictors of students' satisfaction with the course (P &lt;0.0001). Conclusion: Continuation of education in medical universities in the Covid-19 pandemic to train professional and empowered graduates to reduce the workload of hospitals is one of the main concerns of educational administrators. It is recommended to pay special attention to the quality of these training to introduce, identify and evaluate the experience of successful teaching-learning styles and start the cycle of modification and improvement of the training process even in the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

Myocardial inflammation is known to occur with SARS-CoV-2. Different screening approaches for detection of myocarditis have been reported. The Big Ten Conference requires comprehensive cardiac testing including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for all athletes with COVID-19, allowing comparison of screening approaches. Objective: To determine the prevalence of myocarditis in athletes with COVID-19 and compare screening strategies for safe return to play. Design, Setting, and Participants: Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry principal investigators were surveyed for aggregate observational data from March 1, 2020, through December 15, 2020, on athletes with COVID-19. For athletes with myocarditis, presence of cardiac symptoms and details of cardiac testing were recorded. Myocarditis was categorized as clinical or subclinical based on the presence of cardiac symptoms and CMR findings. Subclinical myocarditis classified as probable or possible myocarditis based on other testing abnormalities. Myocarditis prevalence across universities was determined. The utility of different screening strategies was evaluated. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcome and Measure: Myocarditis via cardiovascular diagnostic testing. Results: Representing 13 universities, cardiovascular testing was performed in 1597 athletes (964 men [60.4%]). Thirty-seven (including 27 men) were diagnosed with COVID-19 myocarditis (overall 2.3%; range per program, 0%-7.6%); 9 had clinical myocarditis and 28 had subclinical myocarditis. If cardiac testing was based on cardiac symptoms alone, only 5 athletes would have been detected (detected prevalence, 0.31%). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for all athletes yielded a 7.4-fold increase in detection of myocarditis (clinical and subclinical). Follow-up CMR imaging performed in 27 (73.0%) demonstrated resolution of T2 elevation in all (100%) and late gadolinium enhancement in 11 (40.7%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive athletes with CMR screening after COVID-19 infection, 37 athletes (2.3%) were diagnosed with clinical and subclinical myocarditis. Variability was observed in prevalence across universities, and testing protocols were closely tied to the detection of myocarditis. Variable ascertainment and unknown implications of CMR findings underscore the need for standardized timing and interpretation of cardiac testing. These unique CMR imaging data provide a more complete understanding of the prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in college athletes after COVID-19 infection. The role of CMR in routine screening for athletes safe return to play should be explored further.","Daniels, Curt J; Rajpal, Saurabh; Greenshields, Joel T; Rosenthal, Geoffrey L; Chung, Eugene H; Terrin, Michael; Jeudy, Jean; Mattson, Scott E; Law, Ian H; Borchers, James; Kovacs, Richard; Kovan, Jeffrey; Rifat, Sami F; Albrecht, Jennifer; Bento, Ana I; Albers, Lonnie; Bernhardt, David; Day, Carly; Hecht, Suzanne; Hipskind, Andrew; Mjaanes, Jeffrey; Olson, David; Rooks, Yvette L; Somers, Emily C; Tong, Matthew S; Wisinski, Jeffrey; Womack, Jason; Esopenko, Carrie; Kratochvil, Christopher J; Rink, Lawrence D",JAMA cardiol.

Moreover, clinicians have little information to identify patients at high risk of intubation despite awake PP. We sought to assess the intubation rate among patients treated with awake PP in our Emergency Department (ED) and identify predictors of need for intubation. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted for known or suspected COVID-19 who were treated with awake PP in the ED. We excluded patients intubated in the ED. Our primary outcome was prevalence of intubation during initial hospitalization. Other outcomes were intubation within 48 h of admission and mortality. We performed classification and regression tree analysis to identify the variables most likely to predict the need for intubation. RESULTS: We included 97 patients; 44% required intubation and 21% were intubated within 48 h of admission. Respiratory oxygenation (ROX) index and P/F (partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio measured 24 h after admission were the variables most likely to predict need for intubation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Among COVID-19 patients treated with awake PP in the ED prior to admission, ROX index and P/F ratio, particularly 24 h after admission, may be useful tools in identifying patients at high risk of intubation.","Downing, Jessica; Cardona, Stephanie; Alfalasi, Reem; Shadman, Shahrad; Dhahri, Amina; Paudel, Riddhi; Buchongo, Portia; Schwartz, Bradford; Tran, Quincy K",Am J Emerg Med,648,1

This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions.

For understanding the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we report the expression pattern of ACE2 across > 150 different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and organs based on stringent immunohistochemical analysis. The results were compared with several datasets both on the mRNA and protein level. ACE2 expression was mainly observed in enterocytes, renal tubules, gallbladder, cardiomyocytes, male reproductive cells, placental trophoblasts, ductal cells, eye, and vasculature. In the respiratory system, the expression was limited, with no or only low expression in a subset of cells in a few individuals, observed by one antibody only. Our data constitute an important resource for further studies on SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry, in order to understand the biology of the disease and to aid in the development of effective treatments to the viral infection.","Hikmet, Feria; Méar, Loren; Edvinsson, Åsa; Micke, Patrick; Uhlén, Mathias; Lindskog, Cecilia",Mol Syst Biol,648,16

Increases in serum aminotransferase levels (ranging from 16% to 62%) and bilirubin levels (ranging from 5% to 21%) have been reported and seem to be more often observed in patients with severe forms of COVID-19. Although absolute changes in these parameters are frequently seen, other variables, such as the ratio above the upper limit of normal, the onset of liver injury as a complication in severe cases and histopathological findings, reinforce that liver changes are of dubious clinical relevance in the course of this disease. Other factors must also be considered in these analyses, such as the repercussions of hemodynamic changes, the presence of thrombotic events, and, mainly, the possible drug-induced liver injury with the current, yet off-label, treatment.

We test three hypotheses: [H1] Asians in the US are more likely to report experiencing coronavirus stigmatization than non-Hispanic Whites; [H2] Coronavirus stigmatization is associated with psychological distress; [H3] Magnitude of association between coronavirus stigmatization and psychological distress is more pronounced among US-born Asians, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. DESIGN: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from the 10-31 March 2020 wave of the Understanding America Survey, a nationally representative survey of adults in the US. Psychological distress was assessed with the PHQ-4. Measures of association were estimated using multiple logistic regression and survey sampling weights. Predicted probabilities were calculated using marginal standardization ( n = 6707). RESULTS: [H1] The adjusted predicted probability of experiencing any coronavirus stigma among foreign-born Asians (11.2%, 95% CI: 5.5-17.0%; E-value = 4.52), US-born Asians (10.9%, 95% CI: 5.8-16.0%; E-value = 4.23), Blacks (8.0%, 95% CI: 5.3-10.7%; E-value = 2.92), and Hispanic Whites (7.3%, 95% CI: 4.6-9.9%; E-value = 2.58) was significantly greater than non-Hispanic Whites (4.5%, 95% CI: 3.7-5.4%). [H2] Individuals reporting any coronavirus stigma experience were significantly more likely to exhibit psychological distress (19.9%, 95% CI: 14.6-25.2% vs 10.6%, 9.6-11.6%; E-value = 3.16). [H3] The overall magnitude of association between experience of any coronavirus stigma and psychological distress was not significantly between US-born Asians and non-Hispanic Whites, though we found gender to mask this effect. US-born Asian females who experienced coronavirus stigmatization were more likely to exhibit psychological distress than non-Hispanic white females who experienced coronavirus stigmatization (relative risk (RR): 10.21, 95% CI: 2.69-38.74 vs 1.24, 95% CI: 0.76-2.01; p < 0.01).

Telemedicine was seen as a pragmatic solution to provide follow-up care. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and satisfaction of a telephone consultation in neuro-urology. METHODS: During the pandemic, the scheduled medical visits were converted into telephone consultation. For each teleconsultation, the physician assessed the efficiency and the patient-rated global satisfaction of the teleconsultation. The physician and the patient assessed whether this teleconsultation replaced a physical visit. RESULTS: About 358 neurologic patients were included in the study. The mean efficiency of the telephone consultation was 9.3/10 (±1.5). The mean global satisfaction was 9.0/10 (±1.3). The majority of the patients (52.4%) would prefer a physical consultation. 90.2% might convert some clinic visits to teleconsultations in the future. No agreement was found between the patient and the physician when they were asked if the teleconsultation replaced the physical consultation initially scheduled (weight kappa = 0.02; 95% confidence interval = [-0.06 to 0.11]). Cognitive impairment, difficulty to obtain relevant information, and lack of physical examination were unfavorable to the efficiency of the teleconsultation. Cognitive impairment, embarrassing nature of the teleconsultation, and preference for a physical consultation were unfavorable to satisfaction of the patient. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine in neuro-urology was associated with a high satisfaction of the patients and was described as efficient by the physicians. Despite this, the majority of the patients reported a preference for physical consultation. The COVID-19 pandemic might be an opportunity to refine our practices in neuro-urology and to develop telemedicine.","Chesnel, Camille; Hentzen, Claire; Le Breton, Frédérique; Turmel, Nicolas; Tan, Eliane; Haddad, Rebecca; Amarenco, Gérard",Neurourol Urodyn,648,16

Analytical expressions of bow shock normal in 2D and 3D are given for any point on the shock's surface. This empirical technique is applicable to any planetary environment with a defined shock structure. Applied to the Martian environment and the NASA/MAVEN mission, the predicted shock location from ephemerides data is on average within 0.15 planetary radius $R_p$ of the actual bow shock crossing as seen from magnetometer data. Using a simple predictor-corrector algorithm based on the absolute median deviation of the total magnetic field and the general form of quasi-perpendicular shock structures, this estimate is further refined to within a few minutes of the true crossing (0.05 $R_p$). With the refined algorithm, 14,929 bow shock crossings, predominantly quasi-perpendicular, are detected between 2014 and 2021. Analytical 2D conic and 3D quadratic surface fits, as well as standoff distances, are given for Martian years 32 to 35, for several (seasonal) solar longitude ranges and for two solar EUV flux levels. Although asymmetry in $Y$ and $Z$ Mars Solar Orbital coordinates is on average small, it is shown that for Mars years 32 and 35, Ls = [135-225$^\circ$] and high solar flux, it can become particularly noticeable and is superimposed to the usual North-South asymmetry due to the presence of crustal magnetic fields.","Wedlund, C.

Yet, research in social policy has long depicted the US safety net as parsimonious and inadequate relative to its European counterparts, even when considering benefits from programs that reward favorable work histories. Other theories predict variability across states and regional clustering even amid low overall spending. Moreover, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has exposed the insufficiency and lack of resilience of the major US safety nets in the face of unprecedented unemployment. This study examines the benefit expenditures on three safety net programs available to American families with recently unemployed breadwinners—Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Unemployment Insurance—as a proportion of median annual income for a given state-year between 1997 and 2017. We examine the overall spending as well as variability and clustering across states. We find that the average benefit expenditure comprises only 42% of median income, and while there is substantial variability around this average, only one state is above 78%. We also find that spending levels appear to be regionally clustered. We conclude that safety nets for the recently unemployed and their families are weak relative to earned income and that the extent of this weakness varies by state, with some regional patterning. © 2021 Policy Studies Organization","Reynolds, M.

A total of 1,493 interviews were conducted, and a social media analysis that reviewed 9,079 posts from April to December 2020 was performed. The results show large socio-economic and environmental impacts (e.g. 89% of the markets closed in April, and 72% of respondents perceived an increase in the amount of solid waste). Women have faced increased inequalities when accessing fishing resources or healthcare. Responses have been varied and include closing communities, and fishing organizations distributing emergency funds. Fishers relate feeling very or moderately comfortable with technology and have spent more time using digital platforms during the pandemic than before. While the effects are still unfolding, there is an urgent need to breach the digital divide to guarantee equal opportunities for all. Efforts are needed to ensure that the most vulnerable groups (e.g. women, indigenous people, and elderly individuals) are not excluded from opportunities to access, use or manage resources, including technology.

As of October 5, 2020, there were over 34.8 million reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and more than 1 million reported deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), globally. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing policies, hand hygiene, and mask use, are key public health measures to control COVID-19. In response to, or in some cases even before, the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in their countries, policy makers across Africa issued various social distancing policies. Methods: we describe social distancing policies issued from March 1 to April 24, 2020 in 22 Anglophone countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We reviewed policies identified online. Results: though all 22 countries closed schools and banned gatherings, they took a variety of approaches to sizes of gatherings banned and to stay-at-home orders, with 13 countries issuing national stay-at-home orders, four issuing subnational stay-at-home orders, and five not issuing stay-at-home orders. Enforcement provisions varied by country, as did funeral and health care exceptions. Conclusion: movement restrictions, business restrictions, and school closures can have substantial negative impacts on economies, education, nutrition, and routine health care.

Trust, experts, and covid-19",17.313927,4.443434,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Chaiqin chengqi decoction (CQCQD) has been proven clinically to be an effective treatment for AP for decades in West China Hospital. Quality control for CQCQD containing many hundreds of characteristic phytochemicals poses a challenge for developing robust quality assessment metrics. PURPOSE: To evaluate quality consistency of CQCQD with a multi-strategy based analytical method, identify potential quality-markers (Q-markers) based on drug properties and effect characteristics, and endeavor to establish CQCQD as a globally-accepted medicine. METHODS: A typical analysis of constitutive medicinal plant materials was performed following the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The extraction process was optimized through an orthogonal array (L9(34)) to evaluate three levels of liquid to solid ratio, soaking time, duration of extraction, and the number of extractions. An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) fingerprinting combined with absolute quantitation of multi chemical marker compounds, coupled with similarity, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were performed to evaluate 10 batches of CQCQD. On the basis of systematic analysis of fundamental features of CQCQD in treating AP, the potential Q-marker screen was proposed through detection of quality transfer and efficacy for chemical markers. UHPLC coupled with quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry were used to determine compounds in medicinal materials, decoctions and plasma. Network pharmacology and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate induced pancreatic acinar cell death were used to evaluate the correlation between chemical markers and anti-pancreatitis activity. A cerulein induced AP murine model was used to validate quality assessed CQCQD batches at clinically-equivalent dose. The effective content of chemical markers was predicted using linear regression analysis on quantitative information between validated batches and the other batches. RESULTS: The chemical markers and other physical and chemical indices in the original materials met Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. A total of 22 co-existing fingerprint peaks were selected and the similarity varied between 0.946 and 0.990. Batch D10 possessed the highest similarity index. HCA classified the 10 batches into 2 main groups: 7 batches represented by D10 and 3 batches represented by D1. During the initial Q-marker screen stage, 22 compounds were detected in both plant materials and decoctions, while 13 compounds were identified in plasma. Network pharmacology predicted the potential targets and pathway of AP related to the 22 compounds. All 10 batches showed reduced necrosis below 60% with the best effect achieved by D10 (~40%). The spectrum-efficacy relationship analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis indicated that emodin, rhein, aloe emodin, geniposide, hesperridin, chrysin, syringin, synephrine, geniposidic acid, magnolol, physcion, sinensetin, and baicalein showed positive correlation with pancreatic acinar cell death protection. Similar to the in vitro evaluation, batch D10 significantly reduced total histopathological scores and biochemical severity indices at a clinically-equivalent dose but batch D1 did not. The content of naringin, narirutin and baicalin in batches D1, D5 and D9 consistently exceeds the upper limit of the predicted value. Eight markers whose lower limit is predicted to be close to 0 contributed less to the material basis for AP protection. CONCLUSION: Despite qualified materials used for CQCQD preparation, the clinical effect depends on appropriate content range of Q-markers. Emodin, rhein, aloe emodin, magnolol, hesperidin, synephrine, baicalein, and geniposide are considered as vital Q-markers in the primary screen. This study proposed a feasible platform for producing highly consistent batches of CQCQD in future study.","Liang, Ge; Yang, Jingyu; Liu, Tingting; Wang, Shisheng; Wen, Yongjian; Han, Chenxia; Huang, Yan; Wang, Rui; Wang, Yiqin; Hu, Liqiang; Wang, Guangzhi; Li, Fei; Tyndall, Joel D A; Deng, Lihui; Du, Dan; Xia, Qing",Phytomedicine,648,16

Here, we summarize our experience and successful treatment plan with a critical COVID-19 patient who required mechanical ventilation (MV). A 56-year-old man presented with a fever, cough, and dyspnea. He had not been to a medium/high risk epidemic area in the past year and had no family history of a disease cluster. COVID-19 was suspected based on clinical symptoms and radiologically detected ground-glass lung changes in the context of a normal white blood cell count (WBCC) and lymphocyte fraction (L%). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by nucleic acid testing. Initially, he was started on noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Because his respiratory distress worsened over the following 2 h, he was transitioned to mechanical ventilation (MV), placed in prone positioning 12 h/day, and given a multi-pronged pharmacotherapy regimen that included an antiviral cocktail (lopinavir/ritonavir plus α-interferon), an immunity enhancer (thymosin α1), an anti-coagulant to prevent thrombosis (heparin). He was given an antibiotic to treat an opportunistic nosocomial infection. The patient has recovered well. The regimen applied in this case of timely evaluation, early prone positioning with MV, and a multi-pronged pharmacotherapy may be an effective strategy for patients with critical COVID-19, particularly with respect to preventing life-threatening worsening of the illness.

However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data documenting the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the U.S. from January 22 to April 6, 2020, and reconstructed the epidemic using a 5-parameter logistic growth model. We fitted our model to data from a 2-week window (i.e., from March 21 to April 4, approximately one incubation period) during which large-scale testing was being conducted. With parameters obtained from this modeling, we reconstructed and predicted the growth of the epidemic and evaluated the extent and potential effects of underdetection. Results: The data fit the model satisfactorily. The estimated daily growth rate was 16.8% overall with 95% CI: [15.95, 17.76%], suggesting a doubling period of 4 days. Based on the modeling result, the tipping point at which new cases will begin to decline will be on April 7th, 2020, with a peak of 32,860 new cases on that day. By the end of the epidemic, at least 792,548 (95% CI: [789,162, 795,934]) will be infected in the U.S. Based on our model, a total of 12,029 cases were not detected between January 22 (when the first case was detected in the U.S.) and April 4. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the utility of a 5-parameter logistic growth model with reliable data that comes from a specified period during which governmental interventions were appropriately implemented. Beyond informing public health decision-making, our model adds a tool for more faithfully capturing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Chen, Ding-Geng; Chen, Xinguang; Chen, Jenny K",Glob Health Res Policy,648,16

Announcing that the country was at ""war,"" President Macron called upon all to play a role in mitigating against further development of contagion. This extreme measure never seen before during peace time was the result of adapting not only the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP) being applied to the national context but also real-time clinical, epidemiological, and scientific information about the evolution of COVID-19 infection in the country. The situation was further complicated by local municipal elections and political agendas by populist opinions. Despite mass communication about the importance of individual behavioral attitudes to counter disease propagation, few heeded government advice. Consequently, the situation rapidly deteriorated with increasing number of cases that started to overwhelm health services. As a result, decisive and immediate action was taken by the State for the national public health interest.

The objective of this work is to report the initial experience with epidemiologic and clinical features, as well as with the management of COVID-19 patients in India. This is a descriptive case series of the first 21 COVID-19 infected patients confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and admitted to a tertiary care centre in India from 01.02.2020 to 19.03.2020. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including age, sex, nationality, travel history, symptoms, duration of stay, and comorbidities. The mean age of the population was 40.3 years with a male preponderance. Thirteen (62%) patients had recent travel history outside India in the previous 30 days, two thirds of whom had travelled to Italy. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (42.9%) followed by sore throat, headache and breathlessness. Vital and laboratory parameters were preserved in all patients and none of them required ventilatory support. Among the first 21 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in India, the typical clinical presentation consisted in a mild upper respiratory tract infection predominantly affecting the young male population. One patient required supplemental oxygen.

DIAGNOSIS: Family members from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic came to stay in the patient's home 16 days before the onset of his disease, and his mother had been diagnosed with COVID-19. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a history of exposure and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was admitted to hospital and treated symptomatically with oral medication. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered completely and was discharged after one month of hospitalization. He tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR and a chest CT performed 4 weeks after admission showed marked improvement prior to discharge. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be aware of the presentation of COVID-19 in children because it differs from that in adults.","Li, Chenxi; Luo, Fan; Wu, Bing",Medicine (Baltimore),648,1

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods study of telemedicine visits across pediatric endocrinology, nephrology, orthopedic surgery, and rheumatology at a large children's hospital. We used deductive analysis to review observational data from 40 video visits. Providers and patients/caregivers were surveyed around areas of satisfaction and communication. RESULTS: We found adaptations of telemedicine including shared-screen use and provider-guided parent procedures among others. All providers felt that it was safest for their patients to conduct visits by video, and 72.7% reported completing some component of a clinical exam. Patients rated the areas of being respected by the clinical staff/provider and showing care and concern highly, and the mean overall satisfaction was 86.7 ± 19.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been used to deliver care to pediatric patients during the pandemic, and we found that patients were satisfied with the telemedicine visits during this stressful time and that providers were able to innovate during visits. Telemedicine is a tool that can be successfully adapted to patient and provider needs, but further studies are needed to fully explore its integration in pediatric subspecialty care. IMPACT: This study describes telemedicine use at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic from both a provider and patient perspective, in four different pediatric subspecialties. Prior to COVID-19, pediatric telehealth landscape analysis suggested that many pediatric specialty practices had pilot telehealth programs, but there are few published studies evaluating telemedicine performance through the simultaneous patient and provider experience as part of standard care. We describe novel uses and adaptations of telemedicine during a time of rapid deployment in pediatric specialty care.","Pooni, Rajdeep; Pageler, Natalie M; Sandborg, Christy; Lee, Tzielan",Pediatr. res,648,16

Il divario culturale come ulteriore effetto del Covid-19,17.506687,4.580154,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, elective surgeries, including oncologic surgeries, were delayed. Little prospective data existed to guide practice, and professional surgical societies issued recommendations grounded mainly in common sense and expert consensus, such as medical therapy for early-stage breast and prostate cancer patients. To understand the patient experience of delay in cancer surgery during the pandemic, we interviewed breast and prostate cancer patients whose surgeries were delayed due to the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with early-stage breast or prostate cancer who suffered surgical postponement at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) were invited to participate. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 21 breast and prostate cancer patients. Interviews were transcribed, and qualitative analysis using ground-theory approach was performed. RESULTS: Most patients reported significant distress due to cancer and COVID. Key themes that emerged included the lack of surprise and acceptance of the surgical delays but endorsed persistent cancer- and delay-related worries. Satisfaction with patient-physician communication and the availability of a delay strategy were key factors in patients' acceptance of the situation; perceived lack of communication prompted a few patients to seek care elsewhere. DISCUSSION: The clinical effect of delay in cancer surgery will take years to fully understand, but there are immediate steps that can be taken to improve the patient experience of delays in care, including elicitation of individual patient perspectives and ongoing communication. More work is needed to understand the wider experiences of patients, especially minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and uninsured patients, who encounter delays in oncologic care.","Sokas, Claire; Kelly, Masami; Sheu, Christina; Song, Julia; Welch, H Gilbert; Bergmark, Regan; Minami, Christina; Trinh, Quoc-Dien",Ann. surg. oncol,648,16

There have been concerns on whether alterations of ACE2 expression by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors would contribute to the infectivity and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a case-control study to investigate the association between RAAS inhibitors and risk and severity of COVID-19 infection in South Korea using the population-based data provided by the Korean National Health Insurance System. Of 16 281 subjects with hypertension, there were 950 (5.8%) confirmed COVID-19 cases. After case-control matching, multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis was performed. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% CIs for COVID-19 infection and long-term hospitalization comparing exposure to RAAS inhibitors and nonexposure to RAAS inhibitors was 1.161 (0.958-1.407) and 0.863 (0.533-1.397), respectively. When comparing exposure to RAAS inhibitors and nonexposure to RAAS inhibitors for intensive care unit admission, high-flow oxygen therapy, and death, the adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) were 1.515 (0.402-5.701), 0.663 (0.272-1.619), and 1.363 (0.513-3.662), respectively. In all analyses, P values were not significant (P>0.05). The present study demonstrates the absence of an identifiable association between the exposure to RAAS inhibitors and risk and severity of COVID-19 infection, supporting the current medical guidelines and recommendations that patients should not discontinue RAAS inhibitors out of a concern that they are at increased risk for infection or severe illness of COVID-19.","Son, Minkook; Seo, Jeongkuk; Yang, Sung",Hypertension,648,9

Restrictions imposed to help minimise virus transmission have limited both population movement and employment, as well as altering the potential mechanisms of high-energy trauma. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pelvic and acetabular trauma. Materials and methods A retrospective observational study of the incidence, causality, patient profile, fracture morphology, and treatment strategy of pelvic and acetabular trauma managed in a national tertiary referral specialist pelvic and acetabular centre between the 1(st) of March and 1(st) of August 2020 was undertaken and compared to corresponding time periods in the two preceding years. Results A total of 78 patients were referred for management following pelvic and acetabular trauma during the study period with a mean age of 52 years (SD +/- 24.2). Overall, 45% and 42% of patients were referred following isolated pelvic or acetabular fractures respectively. The most frequent mechanism of injury was a fall from height (>1m) (42%), with 53% of patients suffering from concomitant injuries and 32% requiring surgical management. While there was a statistically significant difference in mechanism of injury (P=0.026), there was no significant difference in overall incidence, fracture types, incidence of concomitant injuries, or overall proportion requiring surgical intervention during the study period when compared to previous years. Conclusion While some variation in the mechanisms of injury have been observed, the overall incidence, patient, fracture, and injury profiles associated with pelvic and acetabular trauma appear to have remained consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the number and proportion of those requiring surgical treatment of these fractures have remained stable. Understanding the continued burden of these potentially severe injuries may help guide injury prevention, treatment, and resource allocation as the pandemic continues.","Mohan, Kunal; McCabe, Patrick; Mohammed, Wafi; Hintze, Justin M; Raza, Hasnain; O'Daly, Brendan; Leonard, Michael",Cureus,648,1

Thus, this study investigates the impact of several electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Seven medical centers in Daegu admitted 822 patients with COVID-19 between February and April 2020. This study examined 267 patients among them who underwent an ECG test and evaluated their biochemical parameters like C-reactive protein (CRP), log N-terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac enzyme, and ECG parameters (heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, T inversion, QT interval, and Tpe [the interval between peak to end in a T wave]). RESULTS: Those patients were divided into 3 groups of mild (100 patients), moderate (89 patients), and severe (78 patients) according to clinical severity score. The level of CRP, log NT-proBNP, and creatinine kinase-myocardial band were significantly increased in severe patients. Meanwhile, severe patients exhibited prolonged QT intervals (QTc) and Tpe (Tpe-c) compared to mild or moderate patients. Moreover, deceased patients (58; 21.7%) showed increased dispersion of QTc and Tpe-c compared with surviving patients (78.2±41.1 vs. 40.8±24.6 ms and 60.2±37.3 vs. 40.8±24.5 ms, both p<0.05, respectively).

METHODS: Agendas in Committees A/B of the WHA were classified as Administrative or Technical and Health Matters. Agenda items of Health Matters were sorted into five categories by the WHO reform in the 65th WHA. The agenda items in each category and sub-category were counted. RESULTS: There were 1647 agenda items including 423 Health Matters, which were sorted into five categories: communicable diseases (107, 25.3%), health systems (81, 19.1%), noncommunicable diseases (59, 13.9%), preparedness surveillance and response (58, 13.7%), and health through the life course (36, 8.5%). Among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, millennium development goals, influenza, and international health regulations, were discussed frequently and appeared associated with the public health milestones, but maternal and child health were discussed three times. The number of the agenda items differed for each Director-General's term of office. CONCLUSIONS: The WHA agendas cover a variety of items, but not always reflect international health issues in terms of disease burden. The Member States of WHO should take their responsive roles in proposing more balanced agenda items.","Kitamura, Tomomi; Obara, Hiromi; Takashima, Yoshihiro; Takahashi, Kenzo; Inaoka, Kimiko; Nagai, Mari; Endo, Hiroyoshi; Jimba, Masamine; Sugiura, Yasuo",Health Policy,648,1

The formulations of buprenorphine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for pain management include intravenous injection, transdermal patch, and buccal film. A comparison of efficacy and safety data from studies of buprenorphine and conventional opioids suggests that buprenorphine may be a better-tolerated treatment option for many patients that provides similar or superior analgesia.

In particular, micro-mobility, an emerging mode of urban transport, is profoundly shaped by this crisis. However, there is limited research devoted to understanding the rapidly evolving trip patterns of micro-mobility in response to COVID-19. To fill this gap, we analyze the changes in micro-mobility usage before and during the lockdown period exploiting high-resolution micro-mobility trip data collected in Zurich, Switzerland. Specifically, docked bike, docked e-bike, and dockless e-bike are evaluated and compared from the perspective of space, time and semantics. First, the spatial and temporal analysis results uncover that the number of trips decreased remarkably during the lockdown period. The striking difference between the normal and lockdown period is the decline in the peak hours of workdays. Second, the origin-destination flows are used to construct spatially embedded networks. The results suggest that the origin-destination pairs remain similar during the lockdown period, while the numbers of trips between each origin-destination pair is reduced due to COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the semantic analysis is conducted to uncover the changes in trip purpose. It is revealed that the proportions of Home, Park, and Grocery activities increase, while the proportions of Leisure and Shopping activities decrease during the lockdown period. The above results can help planners and policymakers better make evidence-based policies regarding micro-mobility in the post-pandemic society.","Li, Aoyong; Zhao, Pengxiang; Haitao, He; Mansourian, Ali; Axhausen, Kay W.",Comput Environ Urban Syst,648,16

We, as the EMERGE (EMErging RheumatoloGists and rEsearchers) group of PReS (Pediatric Rheumatology European Society) analyzed how the pandemic has affected pediatric rheumatology practice. METHODS: An online survey was developed to assess changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the pandemic. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: From 70 countries, 493 pediatric rheumatologists (80.3% in pediatric rheumatology practice for ≥5 years) responded to the survey. Around 70% disagreed that the pandemic led to reduced prescription of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Almost half were more likely to taper corticosteroids faster. One-fifth hesitated to switch the major immunosuppressant during a flare. Patients encountering difficulties obtaining hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab due to shortages were noted by 192 (38.9%) and 44 (8.9%), respectively. Twenty to 30% indicated that their patients had experienced a flare or delay in diagnosis/intervention due to postponed appointments.53% mentioned use of phone calls/smartphone applications while 47% shifted towards video consultations for patient care. Respondents indicated an increased number of patients with Kawasaki disease (30%), macrophage activation syndrome (15.6%), unusual vasculitic rashes (31.4%), and hyperinflammation (33.5%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This is the largest survey to date addressing changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary changes were due to delays in clinic appointments, increase in use of virtual technologies, and concerns about the use of immunosuppressive therapies. An increased number of patients with Kawasaki disease/hyperinflammation mentioned by the respondents is noteworthy.","Batu, Ezgi Deniz; Lamot, Lovro; Sag, Erdal; Ozen, Seza; Uziel, Yosef",Semin Arthritis Rheum,648,16

METHODS: : In cases of rAAA during the pandemic, a perioperative workflow was applied to expedite coronavirus testing and avoid pre-operative delay, combined with a strategy for preventing cross-infection. Data of rAAA treated in 11 vascular centers between January-March 2020 collected retrospectively were compared to the corresponding period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: : Eight, 12, and 14 rAAA patients were treated in 11 centers in January-March 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. An increased portion were treated at local hospitals with a comparable outcome compared with large centers in Guangzhou. With EVAR-first strategy, 85.7% patients with rAAA in 2020 underwent endovascular repair, similar to that in 2018 and 2019. The surgical outcomes during the pandemic were not inferior to that in 2018 and 2019. The average length of ICU stay was 1.8±3.4 days in 2020, tending to be shorter than that in 2018 and 2019, whereas the length of hospital stay was similar among three years.

Recent emerging threats including the Zika and Ebola virus outbreaks highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. In low-resource areas, a key obstacle is quick and accurate detection of viruses near the point of care. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal pre-amplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable (with ∼24-hour development time) to detect other viruses. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.","Zhou, Lifeng; Chandrasekaran, Arun Richard; Punnoose, Jibin Abraham; Bonenfant, Gaston; Charles, Stephon; Levchenko, Oksana; Badu, Pheonah; Cavaliere, Cassandra; Pager, Cara T.; Halvorsen, Ken",bioRxiv,648,16

Although most WBE studies use data from large sewage treatment plants, timely data from smaller catchments are needed for targeted public health action. Traditional sampling methods, like autosamplers or grab sampling, are not conducive to quick ad hoc deployments and high-resolution monitoring at these smaller scales. This study develops and validates a cheap and easily deployable passive sampler unit, made from readily available consumables, with relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic but with broader use for WBE. We provide the first evidence that passive samplers can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from populations with low prevalence of active COVID-19 infections (0.034 to 0.34 per 10,000), demonstrating their ability for early detection of infections at three different scales (lot, suburb, and city). A side by side evaluation of passive samplers (n = 245) and traditionally collected wastewater samples (n = 183) verified that the passive samplers were sensitive at detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. On all 33 days where we directly compared traditional and passive sampling techniques, at least one passive sampler was positive when the average SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the wastewater equaled or exceeded the quantification limit of 1.8 gene copies per mL (n = 7). Moreover, on 13 occasions where wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were less than 1.8 gene copies per mL, one or more passive samplers were positive. Finally, there was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) positive relationship between the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the levels found on the passive samplers, indicating that with further evaluation, these devices could yield semi-quantitative results in the future. Passive samplers have the potential for wide use in WBE with attractive feasibility attributes of cost, ease of deployment at small-scale locations, and continuous sampling of the wastewater. Further research will focus on the optimization of laboratory methods including elution and extraction and continued parallel deployment and evaluations in a variety of settings to inform optimal use in wastewater surveillance.","Schang, Christelle; Crosbie, Nicolas D.; Nolan, Monica; Poon, Rachael; Wang, Miao; Jex, Aaron; John, Nijoy; Baker, Louise; Scales, Peter; Schmidt, Jonathan; Thorley, Bruce R.; Hill, Kelly; Zamyadi, Arash; Tseng, Chi-Wen; Henry, Rebekah; Kolotelo, Peter; Langeveld, Jeroen; Schilperoort, Remy; Shi, Baiqian; Einsiedel, Steve; Thomas, Michael; Black, James; Wilson, Simon; McCarthy, David T.",Environ Sci Technol,648,1

In this respect, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) emerged as a reliable and fast tool to understand the complex flow patterns in such spaces. Most of the recent studies, nonetheless, focused on the spatial distribution of airborne pathogens to identify the infection probability without considering the exposure time. This research proposes a framework to evaluate the infection probability related to both spatial and temporal parameters. A validated Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD model of exhaled droplets is first developed and then evaluated with an office case study impacted by different ventilation strategies (i.e., cross- (CV), single- (SV), mechanical- (MV) and no-ventilation (NO)). CFD results were analyzed in a bespoke code to calculate the tempo-spatial distribution of accumulated airborne pathogens. Furthermore, two indices of local and general infection risks were used to evaluate the infection probability of the ventilation scenarios. The results suggest that SV has the highest infection probability while SV and NO result in higher dispersions of airborne pathogens inside the room. Eventually, the time history of indices reveals that the efficiency of CV and MV can be poor in certain regions of the room.","Motamedi, H; Shirzadi, Mohammadreza; Tominaga, Yoshihide; Mirzaei, P A",Sustain Cities Soc,648,16

Four hundred twenty eight throat swabs were examined for atypical bacteria antigen (Chlamydophila pneumoniae) (n = 214) and typical pathogens (n = 214). Chl. pneumoniae detection was performed using indirect immunofluorescence test. Classical microbiological culture was used for typical bacteria detection. Chl. pneumoniae antigen was detected in 55/214 (26.0 %) patients with chronic cough (in 31 (28.2 %) women, 14 (21.9 %) men, and 10 (25.0 %) children).

Twenty-nine of the isolates were classified as the Massachusetts genotype. These 29 isolates, as well as two previously isolated Massachusetts genotype IBV strains, were studied further. Of the 31 strains, 24 were H120-like and two were M41-like isolates as determined by complete genomic sequence analysis, indicating that most of the IBV isolates were likely the reisolated vaccine virus. The remaining five IBV isolates, ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219, ck/CH/LHB/130598, ck/CH/LDL/110931, and ck/CH/LHB/130573, were shown to have originated from natural recombination events between an H120-like vaccine strain and other types of viruses. The virus cross-neutralization test found that the antigenicity of ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219, and ck/CH/LHB/130598 was similar to that of H120. Vaccination with the H120 vaccine offered complete protection against challenge with these isolates. However, isolates ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/CH/LHB/130573 were serotypically different from their parental viruses and from other serotypes in this study. Furthermore, vaccination with the H120 vaccine did not provide protection against challenge with these two isolates. The results of this study demonstrated that recombination is the mechanism that is responsible for the emergence of new serotype strains, and it has the ability to alter virus serotypes. Therefore, IBV surveillance of chicken flocks vaccinated with IBV live vaccines, as well as the consideration of new strategies to effectively control IBV infection using inactivated or/and genetically engineered vaccines, is of great importance.","Chen, Lingfeng; Zhang, Tingting; Han, Zongxi; Liang, Shuling; Xu, Yang; Xu, Qianqian; Chen, Yuqiu; Zhao, Yan; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Wang, Kexiong; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Vet Microbiol,648,28

METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Scielo, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy aimed at retrieving studies focusing on RSV prevalence, burden, risk factors, and the routine clinical practice in the prevention and management of RSV infections in Latin American countries. Only articles published between January 2011 and December 2017 were considered. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included. Percentages of RSV detection varied highly across included studies for adult subjects with respiratory infections (0% to 77.9%), influenza-like illness (1.0% to 16.4%) and community-acquired pneumonia (1.3% to 13.5%). Considerable percentages of hospitalization were reported for RSV-infected adults with influenza-like illness (40.9% and 69.9%) and community-acquired pneumonia (91.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Recent RSV data regarding adult populations in Latin America are scarce. RSV was documented as a cause of illness in adults and the elderly, being identified in patients with acute respiratory infections, influenza-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. The studies suggest that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization in adult populations in Latin America, including younger adults.","Ali, Abraham; Lopardo, Gustavo; Scarpellini, Bruno; Stein, Renato T.; Ribeiro, Diogo",Int J Infect Dis,648,1

Currently, the pathogenic mechanism of PDCoV remains largely unclear, and effective strategies to prevent or treat PDCoV infection are still limited. In this study, the interaction between autophagy and PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells was investigated. We demonstrated that PDCoV infection induced a complete autophagy process. Pharmacologically induced autophagy with rapamycin increased the expression of PDCoV N, while pharmacologically inhibited autophagy with wortmannin decreased the expression of PDCoV N, suggesting that PDCoV-induced autophagy facilitates virus replication. Further experiments showed that PDCoV infection activated p38 signaling pathway to trigger autophagy. Besides, ergosterol peroxide (EP) alleviated PDCoV-induced activation of p38 to suppress autophagy, thus exerting its antiviral effects. Finally, we employed a piglet model of PDCoV infection to demonstrate that EP prevented PDCoV infection by suppressing PDCoV-induced autophagy via p38 signaling pathway in vivo. Collectively, these findings accelerate the understanding of the pathogenesis of PDCoV infection and provide new insights for the development of EP as an effective therapeutic strategy for PDCoV.","Duan, Cong; Liu, Yi; Hao, Zhihui; Wang, Jiufeng",Vet Microbiol,648,16

In this context, the Oklahoma Children's Hospital implemented virtual neonatology prenatal visits for pregnant women with a diagnosis of fetal anomalies. While tele-consultations have been broadly used with a high degree of acceptance in rural and remote areas, satisfaction has not been assessed in this particular scenario, where patients and physicians discussing sensitive healthcare information had to rapidly adjust to this new modality. Objectives: To evaluate patients' and neonatologists' satisfaction with virtual prenatal consultations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare satisfaction levels of patients receiving virtual consultation with those receiving in-person consults. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated patients' and neonatologists' satisfaction with virtual consultations. Participants included pregnant women with diagnosis of fetal anomalies who received neonatology prenatal consultations at Oklahoma Children's Hospital, either in-person or through telemedicine, from May to mid-November 2020, and neonatologists providing virtual prenatal consultations in the same period. Virtual visits were delivered via Zoom Pro™. Patients and physicians who agreed to participate rated acceptability completing an anonymous 5-point Likert scale survey. Item frequencies and means for categories of items were computed by group (video-consult patients, in-person patients, physicians) and analyzed, using Welch's t for unequal sample size. Results: Overall consultation quality was rated good or excellent by 35 (100%) video-consult patients and 12 (100%) in-person patients. Patient group means computed on six 5-point Likert items about patient-physician communication did not differ significantly, video-consult: M = 28.71 (2.22); in-person consult: M = 28.92 (1.78) (p = 0.753263). All eight physicians (100%) agreed or strongly agreed that telemedicine was effective, using a 5-point Likert scale, and their combined consultation quality score computed on 10 survey questions was high: M = 46.4 (3.11). Conclusion: Despite patient inexperience with tele-consultations, the quick implementation of telemedicine, and the sensitive reason for the visit, patients and physicians were highly satisfied with virtual visits. Telemedicine is a safe, effective alternative for providing neonatology prenatal consultations for pregnant women with diagnosis of fetal anomalies during the pandemic.","Lapadula, Maria C.; Rolfs, Shanna; Szyld, Edgardo G.; Hallford, Gene; Clark, Tracie; McCoy, Mike; McKnight, Stephanie; Makkar, Abhishek",Front Pediatr,648,10

A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41°C. Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection and inflammation that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. Utilizing a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that temperature elevation induces wide-spread transcriptome changes that impact upon the regulation of multiple pathways, including epigenetic regulation and lncRNA expression, without disruption of general cellular transcription or the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defences. Respiratory tissue incubated at temperatures >37°C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection but severely restricted the initiation of viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of intraepithelial viral RNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus. To our knowledge, we present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data identify an important role for temperature elevation in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 that occurs independently of the induction of canonical IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression.","Herder, Vanessa; Dee, Kieran; Wojtus, Joanna K.; Goldfarb, Daniel; Rozario, Christoforos; Gu, Quan; Jarrett, Ruth F.; Epifano, Ilaria; Stevenson, Andrew; McFarlane, Steven; Stewart, Meredith E.; Szemiel, Agnieszka M.; Pinto, Rute M.; Garriga, Andreu Masdefiol; Graham, Sheila V.; Murcia, Pablo R.; Boutell, Chris",bioRxiv,648,6

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires from June to August 2020, which included patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosed with a positive result. Follow-up occurred from discharged until ED-readmission or 14 days. We estimate cumulative incidence using the Kaplan-Meier model and associated factors using logistic regression. RESULTS: We included 1,239 patients, with a median of 41 years and 53.82% male. A total of 167 patients were readmitted to the ED within 14 days, with a global incidence rate of 13.08% (95%CI 11.32-15.08). Of these, 83 required hospitalization (median time from diagnosis 4.98 days), 5.98% was not related to any COVID-19 complication, and five patients died. After adjustment by confounders (age ≥65, sex, diabetes, hypertension, former smoking, active smoking, fever, diarrhea, and oxygen saturation), we found significant associations: former smoking (adjusted OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.31-3.34, p0 .002), fever (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.07-2.28, p0.002) and oxygen saturation (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95, p0.009).

OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. METHOD: Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from 20 January to 10 February 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. RESULTS: The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into four themes. Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.","Sun, Niuniu; Shi, Suling; Jiao, Dandan; Song, Runluo; Ma, Lili; Wang, Hongwei; Wang, Chao; Wang, Zhaoguo; You, Yanli; Liu, Shuhua; Wang, Hongyun",Am J Infect Control,648,16

Previously developed prediction models may assist in triaging patients when allocating healthcare resources. We aimed to assess the value of several prediction models when applied to COVID-19 patients in the ED. Methods: All consecutive COVID-19 patients who visited the ED of a combined secondary/tertiary care center were included. Prediction models were selected based on their feasibility. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcomes were 14-day mortality, and a composite outcome of 30-day mortality and admission to the medium care unit (MCU) or the intensive care unit (ICU). The discriminatory performance of the prediction models was assessed using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A total of 403 ED patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Within 30 days, 95 patients died (23.6%), 14-day mortality was 19.1%. Forty-eight patients (11.9%) were admitted to the MCU, 66 patients (16.4%) to the ICU and 152 patients (37.7%) met the composite endpoint. Eleven models were included: RISE UP score, 4C mortality score, CURB-65, MEWS, REMS, abbMEDS, SOFA, APACHE II, CALL score, ACP index and Host risk factor score. The RISE UP score and 4C mortality score showed a very good discriminatory performance for 30-day mortality (AUC 0.83 and 0.84 respectively, 95% CI 0.79-0.88 for both), for 14-day mortality (AUC 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79-0.88, for both) and for the composite outcome (AUC 0.79 and 0.77 respectively, 95% CI 0.75-0.84). The discriminatory performance of the RISE UP score and 4C mortality score was significantly higher compared to that of the other models. Conclusion: The RISE UP score and 4C mortality score have good discriminatory performance in predicting adverse outcome in ED patients with COVID-19. These prediction models can be used to recognize patients at high risk for short-term poor outcome and may assist in guiding clinical decision-making and allocating healthcare resources.","van Dam, P.

Here, we characterize the oral mycobiome, including mycobiome-bacteriome interactions, in the setting of remission-induction chemotherapy (RIC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oral samples (n = 299) were prospectively collected twice weekly from 39 AML patients during RIC until neutrophil recovery. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (V4) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing were used to determine bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Intrakingdom and interkingdom network connectivity at baseline (T1) and at midpoint (T3) and a later time point (T6) were assessed via SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference). In this exploratory study, mycobiome α-diversity was not significantly associated with antibiotic or antifungal receipt. However, postchemotherapy mycobiome α-diversity was lower in subjects receiving high-intensity chemotherapy. Additionally, greater decreases in Malassezia levels were seen over time among patients on high-intensity RIC compared to low-intensity RIC (P = 0.003). A significantly higher relative abundance of Candida was found among patients who had infection (P = 0.008), while a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium was found among patients who did not get an infection (P = 0.03). Analyses of intrakingdom and interkingdom relationships at T1, T3, and T6 indicated that interkingdom connectivity increased over the course of IC as bacterial α-diversity diminished. In (to our knowledge) the first longitudinal mycobiome study performed during AML RIC, we found that mycobiome-bacteriome interactions are highly dynamic. Our study data suggest that inclusion of mycobiome analysis in the design of microbiome studies may be necessary to optimally understand the ecological and functional role of microbial communities in clinical outcomes. IMPORTANCE This report highlights the importance of longitudinal, parallel characterization of oral fungi and bacteria in order to better elucidate the dynamic changes in microbial community structure and interkingdom functional interactions during the injury of chemotherapy and antibiotic exposure as well as the clinical consequences of these interrelated alterations.","Robinson, Sarah; Peterson, Christine B.; Sahasrabhojane, Pranoti; Ajami, Nadim J.; Shelburne, Samuel A.; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P.; Galloway-Peña, Jessica R.",mSphere,648,33

Furthermore, the surface expression of the GhV attachment glycoprotein (G) is reduced compared to NiV and most of this protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we generated truncated as well as chimeric GhV G proteins and investigated the influence of the structural domains (cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, ectodomain) of this protein on the intracellular transport and the fusogenicity following coexpression with the GhV fusion protein (F).

Fine particulate matter is one of the air pollutants that damages pulmonary tissue. The combination of the coronavirus and fine particulate matter air pollution may exacerbate the coronavirus’ effect on human health. RESEARCH QUESTION: This paper considers whether the long-term concentration of fine particulate matter of different sizes changes the number of detected coronavirus infections and the number of COVID-19 fatalities in Germany. STUDY DESIGN: Data from 400 German counties for fine particulate air pollution from 2002 to 2020 are used to measure the long-term impact of air pollution. Kriging interpolation is applied to complement data gaps. With an ecological study, the correlation between average particulate matter air pollution and COVID-19 cases, as well as fatalities, are estimated with OLS regressions. Thereby, socioeconomic and demographic covariates are included. MAIN FINDINGS: An increase in the average long-term air pollution of 1 μg/m(3) particulate matter PM(2.5) is correlated with 199.46 (SD = 29.66) more COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany. For PM(10) the respective increase is 52.38 (SD = 12.99) more cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of COVID-19 deaths were also positively correlated with PM(2.5) and PM(10) (6.18, SD = 1.44, respectively 2.11, SD = 0.71, additional COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). CONCLUSION: Long-term fine particulate air pollution is suspected as causing higher numbers of COVID-19 cases. Higher long-term air pollution may even increase COVID-19 death rates.

The recurrent positive RT-PCR test results drew widespread concern. We observed a certain number of cured COVID-19 patients with positive RT-PCR test results and try to analyze the factors that caused the phenomenon. METHODS: We conducted an observational study in COVID-19 patients discharged from 6 rehabilitation stations in Wuhan, China. All observed subjects met the criteria for hospital discharge and were in quarantine. Data regarding age, sex, body mass index (BMI), course of disease, comorbidity, smoking status and alcohol consumption, symptoms in and out of quarantine, and intervention were collected from the subjects’ medical records and descriptively analyzed. The main outcome of this study was the RT-PCR test result of the observed subjects at the end of quarantine (negative or positive). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the influencing factors related to recurrent positive RT-PCR test results. RESULTS: In this observational study, 420 observed subjects recovered from COVID-19 were included. The median age was 56 years, 63.6% of the subjects were above 50 years old, and 50.7% (213/420) were female. The most common comorbidities were hypertension [26.4% (111/420)], hyperlipidemia [10.7% (45/420)], and diabetes [10.5% (44/420)]. 54.8% (230/420) manifested one or more symptoms at the beginning of the observation period, the most common symptoms were cough [27.6% (116/420)], shortness of breath 23.8% (100/420)], and fatigue [16.2% (68/420)], with fever rare [2.6% (11/420)]. A total of 325 subjects were exposed to comprehensive intervention; 95 subjects were absence of intervention. The recurrence rate of positive RT-PCR test results with comprehensive intervention was 2.8% (9/325), and that with no intervention was 15.8% (15/95). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusted for factors such as age, sex, and comorbidity and found out that comprehensive intervention was correlated with the recurrent positive RT-PCR test results. There was appreciably less recurrence in the comprehensive intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The factors related to positive RT-PCR test results in observed subjects recovered from COVID-19 were age, comorbidity, and comprehensive intervention, among which comprehensive intervention might be a protective factor.

METHODS: A sample of patients of all ages presenting with ILI was included by physicians of the French Sentinelles network during two seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17). Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for the presence of influenza virus (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Patients' characteristics associated with each of the four virus classes were studied using multivariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 5859 individuals were included in the study: 48.0% tested positive for IV, 7.9% for HRV, 7.5% for RSV and 4.1% for HMPV. Cough was associated with IV (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.81–2.52) RSV (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.75–3.74) and HMPV detection (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.40–3.45). Rhinorrhoea was associated mainly with HRV detection (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.34–2.32). Headache was associated with IV detection (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.34–2.32), whereas absence of headache was associated with RSV and HMPV detection. Dyspnoea was associated with RSV detection (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.73–3.12) and absence of dyspnoea with IV detection. Conjunctivitis was associated with IV detection (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.50). Some associations were observed only in children: dyspnoea and cough with RSV detection (age <5 years), conjunctivitis with IV detection (age <15 years). Period of onset of symptoms differed among aetiological diagnoses. Seasonal influenza vaccination decreased the risk of IV detection (OR, 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.86). CONCLUSIONS: This study allowed the identification of symptoms associated with several viral aetiologies in patients with ILI.

Transfusion of convalescent immune plasma (CP) is commonly used in epidemics. Several articles now describe clinical report data of CP for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease. Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted using the NCBI curated COVID-19 related open-resource literature database LitCovid to identify studies using CP as treatment for COVID-19 patients. We retrieved and curated all COVID-19 related patient and treatment characteristics from previously reported studies. A Poisson model was developed to evaluate the association between age of the patients, older age being the most common risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, and recovery time since CP treatment using data extracted from the literature. Results. From 18,293 identified COVID-19 related articles, we included ten studies reporting results of CP treatment for COVID-19 from a total of 61 patients. Decreased symptoms of severe COVID-19 and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were the most direct observations. We found that patients over the age of sixty who received CP treatment for COVID-19 had a significantly prolonged recovery estimated by viral clearance (from 10 to 29 days since first dose of CP) compared to younger patients, who recovered from the infection in less than a week after receiving CP treatment. Conclusions. Limited published results on plasma transfusion treatment for COVID-19 disease with concomitant treatments suggest that CP therapy for COVID-19 is well tolerated and effective. First randomized clinical trial results, however, reveal no improvements in recovery time for elderly patients with severe COVID-19 between standard treatment alone and added with convalescent plasma. Accordingly, we argue that older patients may need a significantly longer time for recovery. Further randomized clinical trial data for COVID-19 with rigorous ethical standards is urgently needed.","Pimenoff, V. N.; Elfstrom, M.; Dillner, J.",,648,1

As an adjacent city to the origin of COVID-19, Hong Kong has been facing different public health challenges raised by the epidemic.ObjectivesThis paper examined the prevalence of common physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, somatic symptoms, and health anxiety among the Hong Kong youth population.MethodsHKYES is an on-going territory-wide epidemiological study collecting youth mental health data with randomly stratified sampling. Participants aged 15-24 years were to complete a physical symptom checklist, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI).ResultsA total of 594 participants have completed the survey since April 2020. The three most common physical symptoms were headache (n=106, 17.8%), fever (n=94, 15.8%) and fatigue (n=78, 13.1%). The mean scores of DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscales were 7.98 (SD 8.14), 5.81 (SD 6.32), and 8.83 (SD 7.93) respectively. Among all, 135 (22.8%) participants reported moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms, 133 (22.4%) reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms, and 71 (12%) reported moderate to severe levels of stress. There were 40 (6.7%) and 60 (10.1%) participants showing significant levels of insomnia and somatic symptoms, while around one-third of the participants reported a high level of health anxiety.ConclusionsYouth is at risk of severe psychological impact during the coronavirus. Monitoring the mental health trajectory for youth should become routine practice during times of crisis.","Chung, T. H.; Yuen, A. S.; Wong, C. S.; Hui, C. L.; Chan, S. K.; Chang, W.; Lee, E.

METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory data, and ACEi/ARB usage were analyzed. To account for confounders, patients were substratified by whether they developed hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI) during the index hospitalization. RESULTS: Mortality (22% vs 17%, P > .05) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (26% vs 12%, P > .05) rates were not significantly different between non-ACEi/ARB and ACEi/ARB groups. However, patients who continued ACEi/ARBs in the hospital had a markedly lower ICU admission rate (12% vs 26%; P = .001; odds ratio [OR] = 0.347; 95% confidence interval [CI], .187–.643) and mortality rate (6% vs 28%; P = .001; OR = 0.215; 95% CI, .101–.455) compared to patients who discontinued ACEi/ARB.

Furthermore, vLAB was effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Since this method is inexpensive and no RNA purification equipment or additional cDNA synthesis is required, this dRT-PCR with vLAB should be considered as an alternative method for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Castellanos-Gonzalez, Alejandro; Shelite, Thomas R.; Lloyd, Nicole; Sadiqova, Aygul; Ping, Ren; Williams-Bouyer, Natalie; Melby, Peter C.; Travi, Bruno L.",Sci Rep,648,16

Among them, convalescent plasma administered to hospitalized patients has been unsuccessful, perhaps because antibodies should be administered earlier in the course of illness. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of convalescent plasma with high IgG titers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in older adult patients within 72 hours after the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was severe respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air, or both. The trial was stopped early at 76% of its projected sample size because cases of Covid-19 in the trial region decreased considerably and steady enrollment of trial patients became virtually impossible. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients underwent randomization. In the intention-to-treat population, severe respiratory disease developed in 13 of 80 patients (16%) who received convalescent plasma and 25 of 80 patients (31%) who received placebo (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.94; P=0.03), with a relative risk reduction of 48%. A modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded 6 patients who had a primary end-point event before infusion of convalescent plasma or placebo showed a larger effect size (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.81). No solicited adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of high-titer convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 to mildly ill infected older adults reduced the progression of Covid-19.

Consequently, the number of individuals placed into quarantine is increasing too. The large number of individuals in quarantine has high societal and economical costs, as well as infringing on the freedom of the individual. This has led to a vigorous debate about the duration of quarantine, particularly in light of the potentially low specificity of quarantine (i.e. low probability of quarantined individuals indeed being infected). We present a mathematical model that leverages empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects transmission. With this model we address the impact of shortening the quarantine for returning travellers and traced contacts of confirmed cases, both in terms of prevented transmission and the ratio of prevented transmission to days spent in quarantine. We also consider the impact of i) test-and-release strategies; ii) additional hygiene measures imposed upon release after a negative test; iii) the development of symptoms during quarantine; iv) the relationship between quarantine duration and adherence; and v) the specificity of quarantine. When considering the benefit versus cost utility of quarantine, we find that the diminishing impact of longer quarantine on transmission prevention may support a quarantine duration below 10 days, particularly for returning travellers. A greater gain of utility can be achieved through a test-and-release strategy, and this can be even further strengthened by imposed hygiene measures post-release. We also find that unless a test-and-release strategy is considered, the specificity of quarantine does not affect the optimal duration of quarantine. Therefore, the argument that we should shorten quarantine because of lack of specificity is misguided.","Ashcroft, P.; Lehtinen, S.; Bonhoeffer, S.",,648,1

The increase in students’ working hours due to COVID-19 and the switch to a digital teaching format raised the question as to how a successful and flexible educational concept can be created online in this context. A blended-learning strategy in combination with a competency model for interprofessional learning was chosen as theoretical reference point for implementation. Based on a module for academic poster presentation in front of an interprofessional plenum, the sequence of the learning process organization in the phases “kick-off”, “self-directed learning” and “online seminar” is exemplified and discussed with regard to its suitability for digital interprofessional teaching. Implementation: During implementation it was important to clearly define the module’s scope and sequence at the very beginning. The use of screencasts enabled students to individually pace their learning during the preparatory self-directed learning phase. Embedding assignments in the screencasts served to aid students in their learning. The synchronous exchange in interprofessional small groups was experienced as profitable for the own poster production. Several students perceive their own poster presentation in digital format as an increase in competence and a basis for future academic presentations. Summary: In summary, the entire interprofessional module was successfully implemented digitally in the phases “kick-off”, “self-directed learning” and “online seminar”. For synchronous learning, virtual small group workspaces seem particularly suitable for learner activation. The practical implementation of the acquired competencies in the form of the poster presentation is crucial for ensuring the learning success.","Krakau, Franziska; Doll, Lea; Mitzkat, Anika",GMS J Med Educ,648,16

For general communities, epidemic modeling based on social networks is being recognized as a useful tool. However, disease propagation may occur in a healthcare facility in a manner different from that in a urban community setting due to different network architecture. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed social networks in the hospital have hierarchical and modular structure in which dense substructure such as departments, wards, and rooms, are globally but only loosely connected, and do not reveal extremely right-skewed distributions of the number of contacts per individual. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors (i.e. transmitters) of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating individuals with large betweenness centrality (frequency of mediating connection between pairs of individuals along the shortest paths) is superior to vaccinating ones with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, which was suggested by previous model studies.","Ueno, Taro; Masuda, Naoki",J Theor Biol,648,16

We describe the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 mortalities, observation of frequent rapid response teams (RRT)/cardiac arrest (CA) calls for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and factors that contributed to RRT/CA calls. Methods: A team of registered nurses reviewed medical records of inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before or on admission and died between March 13 (first Northwell inpatient expiration) and April 30, 2020 at 15 Northwell hospitals. Findings for these patients were abstracted into a database and statistically analyzed. Findings: Of 2634 COVID-19 mortalities, 56.1% had oxygen saturation levels greater than or equal to 90% on presentation and required no respiratory support. At least one RRT/CA was called on 42.2% of patients at a non-ICU level of care. Before the RRT/CA call, the most recent oxygen saturation levels for 76.6% of non-ICU patients were at least 90%. At the time RRT/CA was called, 43.1% had an oxygen saturation less than 80%. Interpretation: This study represents one of the largest cohorts of reviewed mortalities that also captures data in non-structured fields. Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level of care, despite admission to the appropriate care setting with normal staffing. The data imply a sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory status requiring RRT/CA in a large number of non-ICU patients. Patients admitted to a non-ICU level of care suffer rapid clinical deterioration, often with a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. These patients could benefit from additional monitoring (eg, continuous central oxygenation saturation), although this approach warrants further study.","Jarrett, M. P.; Schultz, S. F.; Lyall, J.

However, the impact of this reduction on hospital mortality is unknown. We describe temporal trends in the presentation of patients with acute heart failure (HF) and their in‐hospital outcomes from two referral centres in London during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1372 patients hospitalized for HF in two referral centres in South London between 7(th) January and 14(th) June 2020, were included in the study and compared to the same time period in 2019. The primary outcome was all‐cause in‐hospital mortality. HF hospitalizations were significantly reduced during the COVID‐19 pandemic, compared to 2019 (p<0.001). Specifically, we observed a temporary reduction in hospitalizations during the COVID‐19 peak, followed by a return to 2019 levels. Patients admitted during the COVID‐19 pandemic had similar demographic characteristics compared to the same period in 2019. However, in‐hospital mortality was significantly higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (p=0.015). Hospitalization in 2020 was independently associated with worse in‐hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.23, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.34 – 3.72; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: During the COVID‐19 pandemic there was a reduction in HF hospitalizations and higher in‐hospital mortality. Hospitalisation for HF in 2020 is independently associated with more adverse outcomes. Further studies are required to investigate the predictors of these adverse outcomes to help inform potential changes to the management of HF patients while some constraints to usual care remain.

This study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic affected Korean parents’ and children’s daily lives and stress levels. Parents’ childcare time, children’s screen time, the time spent for social interactions and learning, and parents’ and children’s stress levels before and after the pandemic were compared. The main caregivers’ childcare time increased significantly during the pandemic (4.00 h/day). For children, the time spent for screen time (1.76 h) and online interactions (0.95 h) increased significantly, whereas face-to-face interaction time (4.17 h) and time spent learning (2.16 h) decreased significantly. In addition, parents’ and children’s stress levels increased significantly during the pandemic. Other descriptive information is provided and discussed. Our results indicate that Korean parents and children experienced significant disruption to their daily lives and increased stress during the pandemic.","Park, Joo-hyang; Park, Ji-young; Jin, Kyong-sun",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,648,1

The identical structure of the molecule in all living organisms is its main advantage, as it translates into the minimal probability of immunogenicity. Therefore, it is the closest to the ideal preparation used as a filler, due to its biocompatibility and stability at the site of implantation. This paper includes the discussion of the potential mechanisms of adverse immune reactions to HA along with the mechanisms of reaction following vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the literature, we tried to systematize adverse immune reactions with systemic manifestations to HA. The occurrence of unpredictable reactions to hyaluronic acid indicates that they may not be treated as neutral or non-allergenic. The modifications of the chemical structure of HA, additives and individual tendencies in a patient may be the cause of unpredictable reactions, leading to serious health consequences. Preparations of unknown origin, poorly purified, or including bacterial DNA are particularly dangerous. Therefore, long-lasting follow-up of the patient and the selection of a preparation approved by the FDA or EMA are of high importance. Patients are often unaware of the consequences of cheaper procedures performed by persons without suitable knowledge with the use of unregistered products, so the public should be educated and legal regulations should be introduced.","Owczarczyk-Saczonek, Agnieszka; Zdanowska, Natalia; Wygonowska, Ewa; Placek, Waldemar",Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,648,29

These highly specialized structures concentrate viral proteins and nucleic acids, prevent the activation of cell-intrinsic defenses, and coordinate the release of progeny particles. Reoviruses are common pathogens of mammals that have been linked to celiac disease and show promise for oncolytic applications. These viruses form nonenveloped, double-shelled virions that contain ten segments of double-stranded RNA. Replication organelles in reovirus-infected cells are nucleated by viral nonstructural proteins µNS and σNS. Both proteins partition the endoplasmic reticulum to form the matrix of these structures. The resultant membranous webs likely serve to anchor viral RNA–protein complexes for the replication of the reovirus genome and the assembly of progeny virions. Ongoing studies of reovirus replication organelles will advance our knowledge about the strategies used by viruses to commandeer host biosynthetic pathways and may expose new targets for therapeutic intervention against diverse families of pathogenic viruses.","Tenorio, Raquel; Fernández de Castro, Isabel; Knowlton, Jonathan J.; Zamora, Paula F.; Sutherland, Danica M.; Risco, Cristina; Dermody, Terence S.",Viruses,648,20

They provide insights into human diseases and enhance biomedical knowledge. Livestock production has favored the pace of human social development over millennia. Today's society is more aware of animal welfare than past generations. The general public has marked objections to animal research and many species are falling into disuse. The search for an ideal methodology to replace animal use is on, but animal modeling still holds great importance to human health. Bone research, in particular, has unmet requirements that in vitro technologies cannot yet fully address. In that sense, standardizing novel models remains necessary and rabbits are gaining in popularity as potential bone models. Our aim here is to provide a broad overview of animal modeling and its ethical implications, followed by a narrower focus on bone research and the role rabbits are playing in the current scenario.","Schafrum Macedo, Aline; Cezaretti Feitosa, Caroline; Yoiti Kitamura Kawamoto, Fernando; Vinicius Tertuliano Marinho, Paulo; dos Santos Dal‐Bó, Ísis; Fiuza Monteiro, Bianca; Prado, Leonardo; Bregadioli, Thales; Antonio Covino Diamante, Gabriel; Ricardo Auada Ferrigno, Cassio",Animal Model Exp Med,648,26

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 through direct lysis of infected lung epithelial cells, which releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu causing systemic inflammation. Anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents have shown limited therapeutic efficacy. Soluble CD24 (CD24Fc) can dampen the broad inflammatory response induced by DAMPs, and a recent randomized phase III trial evaluating impact of CD24Fc in patients with severe COVID-19 has shown encouraging clinical efficacy. METHODS. We studied peripheral blood samples obtained from 22 patients enrolled in the SAC-COVID trial (NCT04317040), which were collected before and at multiple time points after treatment with CD24Fc or placebo. We performed high dimensional spectral flow cytometry analysis and measured cytokine levels to discern the immunological impact of CD24Fc treatment on patients with COVID-19. RESULTS. Patient characteristics from the CD24Fc vs. placebo groups were clinically matched allowing us to compare results without apparent confounding factors. Using high-content spectral flow cytometry, we found systemic hyper-activation of multiple cellular compartments in the placebo group, including CD8(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD56(+) NK cells in patients with untreated COVID-19. By contrast, CD24Fc-treated patient samples demonstrated blunted systemic inflammation, with a return to homeostasis in both NK and T cells within days. A single dose of CD24Fc significantly attenuated systemic IL-10 and IL-15 cytokines, and diminished the coexpression and networking among inflammatory cytokines associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS. Our clinical and immunological data supports further development of CD24Fc as a novel therapeutic against severe COVID-19.","Song, No-Joon; Allen, Carter; Vilgelm, Anna E.; Riesenberg, Brian P.; Weller, Kevin P.; Reynolds, Kelsi; Chakravarthy, Karthik B.; Kumar, Amrendra; Khatiwada, Aastha; Sun, Zequn; Ma, Anjun; Chang, Yuzhou; Yusuf, Mohamed; Li, Anqi; Zeng, Cong; Evans, John P.; Bucci, Donna; Gunasena, Manuja; Xu, Menglin; Liyanage, Namal P.M.; Bolyard, Chelsea; Velegraki, Maria; Liu, Shan-Lu; Ma, Qin; Devenport, Martin; Liu, Yang; Zheng, Pan; Malvestutto, Carlos D.; Chung, Dongjun; Li, Zihai",medRxiv,648,30

Participants (n = 704) completed measures of individualism–collectivism, belief in conspiracy theories about COVID‐19, feelings of powerlessness, and intentions to engage in behaviours that reduce the spread of COVID‐19. Results revealed that vertical individualism negatively predicted intentions to engage in social distancing, directly and indirectly through both belief in COVID‐19 conspiracy theories and feelings of powerlessness. Vertical collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions directly. Horizontal collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions indirectly through feelings of powerlessness. Finally, horizontal collectivism positively predicted hygiene‐related intentions both directly and indirectly through lower feelings of powerlessness. These findings suggest that promoting collectivism may be a way to increase engagement with efforts to reduce the spread of COVID‐19. They also highlight the importance of examining the interplay between culture and both personal feelings (powerlessness) and information consumption (conspiracy theories) during times of crisis.","Biddlestone, Mikey; Green, Ricky; Douglas, Karen M.",Br J Soc Psychol,648,1

This study focused on the possible association between lymphopenia and computed tomography (CT) scan features and COVID‐19 patient mortality. The clinical data of 596 COVID‐19 patients were collected from February 2020 to September 2020. The patients' serological survey and CT scan features were retrospectively explored. The median age of the patients was 56.7 ± 16.4 years old. Lung involvement was more than 50% in 214 COVID‐19 patients (35.9%). The average blood lymphocyte percentage was 20.35 ± 10.16 (normal range, 20%–50%). Although the levels of C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were high in more than 80% of COVID‐19 patients; CRP, ESR, and platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR) may not indicate the in‐hospital mortality of COVID‐19. Patients with severe lung involvement and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of death (odds ratio, 9.24; 95% confidence interval, 4.32–19.78). These results indicated that lymphopenia < 20% along with pulmonary involvement >50% impose a multiplicative effect on the risk of mortality. The in‐hospital mortality rate of this group was significantly higher than other COVID‐19 hospitalized cases. Furthermore, they meaningfully experienced a prolonged stay in the hospital (p = .00). Lymphocyte count less than 20% and chest CT scan findings with more than 50% involvement might be related to the patient's mortality. These could act as laboratory and clinical indicators of disease severity, mortality, and outcome.","Zaboli, Ehsan; Majidi, Hadi; Alizadeh‐Navaei, Reza; Hedayatizadeh‐Omran, Akbar; Asgarian‐Omran, Hossein; Vahedi Larijani, Laleh; Khodaverdi, Vahid; Amjadi, Omolbanin",J Med Virol,648,20

An estimated 71.8 % of zoonotic EID events are caused by pathogens in wildlife and the incidence of such diseases is increasing significantly in humans. In addition, human diseases are starting to infect wildlife, especially non-human primates. The chimpanzee is an endangered species that is threatened by human activity such as deforestation, poaching, and human disease transmission. Recently, several respiratory disease outbreaks that are suspected of having been transmitted by humans have been reported in wild chimpanzees. Therefore, we need to study zoonotic pathogens that can threaten captive chimpanzees in primate research institutes. Serological surveillance is one of several methods used to reveal infection history. We examined serum from 14 captive chimpanzees in Japanese primate research institutes for antibodies against 62 human pathogens and 1 chimpanzee-borne infectious disease. Antibodies tested positive against 29 pathogens at high or low prevalence in the chimpanzees. These results suggest that the proportions of human-borne infections may reflect the chimpanzee’s history, management system in the institute, or regional epidemics. Furthermore, captive chimpanzees are highly susceptible to human pathogens, and their induced antibodies reveal not only their history of infection, but also the possibility of protection against human pathogens.

We investigated the individual differences in the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on optimism and meaning in life in a sample from the Netherlands Twin Register. Participants completed surveys before (N = 9964, Mean age: 48.2, SD = 14.4) and during the first months of the pandemic (i.e. April–May 2020, N = 17,464, Mean age: 44.6 SD = 14.8), with a subsample completing both surveys (N = 6461, Mean age T1: 48.8, SD = 14.5). We applied genetic covariance structure models to twin data to investigate changes in the genetic architecture of the outcome traits due to the pandemic and the interaction of genes with the environmental exposure. Although 56% and 35% of the sample was negatively affected by the pandemic in their optimism and meaning in life, many participants were stable (32% and 43%) or even showed increased optimism and meaning in life (11% and 22%). Subgroups, specifically women, higher educated people, and people with poorer health, experienced larger negative effects. During the first months of the pandemic, slightly lower heritability estimates for optimism and meaning in life (respectively 20% and 25%) were obtained compared to pre-pandemic (respectively 26% and 32%), although confidence intervals overlap. The lower than unity genetic correlations across time (.75 and .63) suggest gene-environment interactions, where the expression of genes that influence optimism and meaning in life differs before and during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a strong exposure that leads to imbalanced effects on the well-being of individuals. Some people decrease in well-being, while others get more optimistic and consider their lives as more meaningful during the pandemic. These differences are partly explained by individual differences in genetic sensitivity to extreme environmental change. More knowledge on the person-specific response to specific environmental variables underlying these individual differences is urgently needed to prevent further inequality.

We have conducted a survey to analyze caseload and measures to adapt indications for a perception of crisis. METHODS: We constructed a questionnaire to survey a snapshot of neurosurgical activity, resources, and indications during 1 week with usual activity in December 2019 and 1 week during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in March 2020. The questionnaire was sent to 34 neurosurgical departments in Europe; 25 departments returned responses within 5 days. RESULTS: We found unexpectedly large differences in resources and indications already before the pandemic. Differences were also large in how much practice and resources changed during the pandemic. Neurosurgical beds and neuro-intensive care beds were significantly decreased from December 2019 to March 2020. The utilization of resources decreased via less demand for care of brain injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage, postponing surgery and changed surgical indications as a method of rationing resources. Twenty departments (80%) reduced activity extensively, and the same proportion stated that they were no longer able to provide care according to legitimate medical needs. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical centers responded swiftly and effectively to a sudden decrease of neurosurgical capacity due to relocation of resources to pandemic care. The pandemic led to rationing of neurosurgical care in 80% of responding centers. We saw a relation between resources before the pandemic and ability to uphold neurosurgical services. The observation of extensive differences of available beds provided an opportunity to show how resources that had been restricted already under normal conditions translated to rationing of care that may not be acceptable to the public of seemingly affluent European countries.

We aimed to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) in naïve antiretroviral (ARV) treated HIV positive patients comparing native Italian group (ItG) to a Migrants group (MiG) upon arrival in Italy. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 83 HIV patients less than 50 years old. We used the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) within six months from the HIV diagnosis. Participants were categorized as having low BMD if the femoral neck or total lumbar spine Z-score was– 2 or less. RESULTS: MiG showed low BMD more often than ItG (37.5% vs.13.6%), especially for the female gender (16.7% vs. 0.0%). A low CD4 rate (<200 cells/μl) was most often detected in MiG than ItG. In particular, we found most often male Italians with abnormal CD4 than male migrants (67.8% vs. 33.3%) and vice versa for females (30.5% vs. 66.7%). We found an abnormal bone mineral density at the lumbar site. Low BMD at the lumbar site was more frequently observed in female migrants than female Italians. Both male and female migrants had a Z-score value significantly lower than male and female Italians, respectively. By logistic regression low vitamin-D level was positively correlated to low BMD in ItG only. All data were verified and validated using a triple code identifier. CONCLUSIONS: Both DXA and vitamin-D evaluation should be offered after the diagnosis of HIV infection. Lumbar site low BMD is an initial condition of bone loss in HIV young patients, especially in female migrants. Vitamin D levels and supplementation may be considered after HIV diagnosis independently of age to improve bone health. HIGHLIGHTS: This study evaluates the frequency of bone mineral density in HIV positive patients naive to antiretroviral therapy. It compares the density of the native Italian population with that of HIV Migrants upon arrival in Italy. The results show that HIV positive migrants, even if younger than 50 years of age, are at risk for osteoporosis, especially if they are female.","Cascio, Antonio; Colomba, Claudia; Di Carlo, Paola; Serra, Nicola; Lo Re, Giuseppe; Gambino, Angelo; Lo Casto, Antonio; Guglielmi, Giuseppe; Veronese, Nicola; Lagalla, Roberto; Sergi, Consolato",PLoS One,648,26

La moitié des patients (n =74) à j30 et 40 % (n =52) à j60 rapportaient une asthénie persistante, avec respectivement 7 % (n =11) et 3,1 % (n =4) avec un grade 3 à 4 selon l’échelle OMS. D’autres symptômes étaient également décris lors des appels de réévaluation comme des arthralgies (9,8 % [n =13] à j30 et 16,3 % [n =21] à j60) ou la persistance de douleurs thoraciques (18 % [n =27] à j30 et 13,1 % [n =17] à j60). La persistance d’au moins un symptôme à j60 était significativement liée à un âge compris entre 40 et 60 ans (p =0,026), à une hospitalisation initiale (p =0,011) ainsi qu’au fait d’avoir eu une auscultation anormale lors de l’évaluation clinique initiale (0,046). À j30, l’oxygénothérapie initiale (p =0,014) ainsi que la dyspnée à la phase initiale (p =0,037) étaient des facteurs supplémentaires associés à la persistance de symptômes. Conclusion À j30 et j60 de la phase initiale de la maladie, deux tiers des adultes ayant présenté une atteinte modérée de COVID-19 présentent encore des symptômes, principalement une anosmie/agueusie, une dyspnée ou une asthénie. Un suivi médical prolongé des patients suite à une infection à SARS-CoV-2 semble essentielle quelle que soit la présentation clinique initiale de la maladie.","Carvalho Schneider, C.; Laurent, E.; Lemaignen, A.; Beaufils, E.; Bourbao Tournois, C.; Bruyère, F.; Stefic, K.; Guillon Grammatico, L.; Bernard, L.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,648,28

The influence of smoking and vaping on the incidence and course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection as well as possibility of using nicotine in the treatment of COVID-19 - Review of the literature,17.21312,5.662618,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the role of different age groups in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries, particularly under current social distancing practices. METHODS: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10–14y through 45–49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10–49y during weeks 13–14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10–11, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk RR(g) for the age group g to be the ratio RR(g) = PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1, g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio OR(g1, g2) = RR(g1)/RR(g2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group g1 vs. g2 for the later vs. early periods is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. RESULTS: The relative risk RR(g) was highest for individuals aged 20–24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15–19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30–34y (RR=1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25–29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35–39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40–44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45–49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10–14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20–24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15–19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10–14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. CONCLUSIONS: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15–34y (particularly those aged 20–24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35–49y or 10–14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15–34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15–34y (particularly those aged 20–24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","Goldstein, Edward; Lipsitch, Marc",medRxiv,648,20

The possible nano zinc oxide was successfully synthesized by precipitation technique and then impregnated effectively over cellulose fibres through sodium alginate matrix. XRD analysis revealed the ‘rod-like’ shape alignment of zinc oxide with an interplanar d-spacing of 0.246 nm corresponding to the (1 0 1) planes of the hexagonal wurtzite structure. TEM analysis confirmed the nano dimension of the synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles. The presence of nano zinc oxide over cellulose fibres was evident from the SEM–EDS experiments. FTIR and TGA studies exhibited their effective bonding interaction. The tensile stress–strain curves data indicated the feasibility of the fabricated fibres for longer duration utility without any significant damage or breakage. The antibacterial studies against Escherichia coli revealed the excellent bacterial devastation property. Further, it was observed that when all the parameters remained constant, the variation of sodium alginate concentration showed impact in devastating the E. coli. In overall, the fabricated nano zinc oxide–sodium alginate cellulose fibres can be effectively utilized as antibacterial fibres for biomedical applications.","Varaprasad, Kokkarachedu; Raghavendra, Gownolla Malegowd; Jayaramudu, Tippabattini; Seo, Jongchul",Carbohydr Polym,648,1

Emergency contraception and induced abortion are overlooked in policy and research. Men’s roles in the SRHR of others are significant, particularly as obstacles to universal SRHR. Evidence on gender, masculinities and SRHR is essential to understand and reduce the barriers faced by individuals seeking to avoid the conception or continuation of a pregnancy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study aims to understand men’s masculinities and their relationships with emergency contraception and abortion. The protocol presents a multimethod study of men aged over 18 years in James Town, Accra, Ghana. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the research will use two mobile-based methods: a survey and in-depth interviews. Using respondent-driven sampling, an estimated 789 men will be recruited to participate in the survey, asking questions on their knowledge, attitude, behaviours and roles in emergency contraception and abortion. In-depth interviews focused on constructions of masculinity will be conducted with a purposive sample of men who participated in the survey. Data will be analysed concurrently using multiple regression analyses of quantitative data and abductive analysis of qualitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the London School of Economics and Political Science and the Ghana Health Service. The findings in this study will: engage with emerging research on masculinities and SRHR in Ghana and elsewhere; offer methodological insight for future research; and provide evidence to inform interventions to reduce obstacles for emergency contraception and abortion care seekers. Dissemination will occur at all levels—policy, academic, community—including multiple academic articles, policy briefs, workshops and presentations, conference papers, and theatre/radio-based performances of key messages.","Strong, Joe",BMJ Open,648,10

Ideally, anti-COVID-19 masks should protect the carrier not only by size exclusion of virus aerosol particles, but also be able to capture and destroy or inactivate the virus. Here we present the proof-of-concept of a filter mat for such a mask, which actively attracts aerosol droplets and kills the virus. The electrospun mats are made of polycaprolactone (PCL) a hydrophilic, functionalizable and biodegradable polyester, into which inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) a physiological biocompatible, biodegradable and antivirally active polymer (chain length, ∼40 P(i) units) has been integrated. A soluble Na-polyP as well as amorphous calcium polyP nanoparticles (Ca-polyP-NP) have been used. In this composition, the polyP component of the polyP-PCL mats is stable in aqueous protein-free environment, but capable of transforming into a gel-like coacervate upon contact with divalent cations and protein like mucin present in (virus containing) aerosol droplets. In addition, the Ca-polyP-NP are used as a carrier of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) which blocks the function of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein, an ion channel forming viroporin. The properties of this novel mask filter mats are as follows: First, to attract and to trap virus-like particles during the polyP coacervate formation induced in situ by aerosol droplets on the spun PCL fibers, as shown here by using SARS-CoV-2 mimicking fluorescent nanoparticles. Second, after disintegration the NP by the aerosol-mucus constituents, to release polyP that binds to and abolishes the function of the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Third, to destroy the virus by releasing tretinoin, as shown by the disruption of virus-mimicking liposomes with the integrated recombinant viral viroporin. It is proposed that these properties, which are inducible (stimuli responsive), will allow the design of antiviral masks that are smart.","Müller, Werner E.

The present study consisted of 150 patients, including 91 volunteering women and 59 men, admitting to our dermatology clinic with any dermatological symptoms. The presence of symptoms, such as itching, rash, drying and peeling, discomfort, redness, burning, pain, swelling, acne, oily skin symptoms because of mask use, and previous history of facial dermatological disease, whether this disease increased with the use of mask, were questioned. The diagnosis made after dermatological examination and the dermatological examination findings were evaluated with the results of the survey. The most common finding in all patients after mask use was itching with a rate of 64.7%. Similar rates were detected for other symptoms. A significant increase was detected in the severity of acneiform and inflammatory dermatosis after the use of masks (P < .05). Our study showed that long‐term mask use caused primary skin symptoms, such as itching, redness, rash, dryness and peeling, burning, oily skin, and acne formation in individuals who have dermatological diseases, and also increased the existing dermatological facial diseases. Therefore, it should be recommended to use water‐based moisturizers as it may have a barrier effect on the faces of individuals who use a face mask and have any facial dermatosis, and patients should be closely monitored for skin diseases on the face.","İnan Doğan, Esra; Kaya, Ferit",Dermatol Ther,648,20

This work examined three parts of intestine from twelve gilts experimentally infected with PCV2-spiked semen, six vaccinated (V group) and six unvaccinated (NV group) against PCV2, 29 and 53 days post infection (DPI). An immunohistochemical investigation for IgA-, IgG- and IgM-antibody bearing plasma cells (PCs) was run on intestinal samples coupled with a sandwich immunohistochemical method to reveal anti-PCV2 antibody-secreting PCs. Plasma cell density was compared in the two groups of animals at 29 and 53 DPI. The IgA, IgG and IgM PC density did not differ between groups but displayed an increase from the upper (villus) to the lower part of the crypts while a decreasing trend in PC density was identified from duodenum to ileum. In the NV group, no increase in anti-PCV2 PC density was demonstrable in the two sampling moment: the amounts of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs remained constant, 10.55 ± 4.24 and 10.06 ± 5.01 at 29 DPI and 53 DPI, respectively. In the V group a significant increase in PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs was observed over time. The amounts of PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs increased from 9.37 ± 13.36 at 29 DPI to 18.76 ± 15.83 at 53 DPI. The data on IgA, IgM and IgG PC counts can be considered reference values in a population of adult pigs. The sandwich method can be proposed as a technique able to identify specific antibody-secreting PCs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a “booster-like” response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals. After virus challenge, vaccination induced an increase in the number of PCs containing specific anti-PCV2 antibodies at the level of intestinal mucosa.","Bianco, C.; Felice, V.; Panarese, S.; Marrocco, R.; Ostanello, F.; Brunetti, B.; Muscatello, L.V.; Leotti, G.; Vila, T.; Joisel, F.; Sarli, G.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,648,1

Taking a vitamin D supplement reduced the risk of having ARI. Non-ICU in-patients in our hospital with a vitamin D deficiency were supplemented with vitamin D. Methods and procedures From March to May 2020, data of non-ICU patients with Covid-19 infection were collected at discharge. Vitamin D serum levels were assessed at admission and correlated to age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), length of stay (LOS) and discharge outcome. Mean and standard deviation or percentage were calculated for all data. Results Vitamin D serum level was assessed at admission in n. 97 non-ICU patients. Most of them (80%) have a deficiency of vitamin D (< 20 ng/mL), median age is 63,7 years, 71% are men, mean BMI is 26,5, median LOS is 13,6 days (Table 1) and above 25% have a worse discharge outcome (sub-ICU, ICU or death) as shown in Table 2. Patients with a sub-obtimal vitamin D level are 14%, mostly female (64%), with a lower mean BMI (24,8), mean LOS of 15,4 days and a worse discharge outcome in 14% of cases. Only 5 patients have a sufficient vitamin D serum level, mean age of 61,2 years, mean BMI of 24,6, mean LOS of 9,2 and home discharge outcome for all of them. Conclusion Low vitamin D levels seem to correlate with a higher risk of developing the disease; supplementation of vitamin D may help in reducing the risk of ARI and improving outcome.","Mascheroni, A.; Cremonesi, I.; Merelli, E.; Misotti, A.

Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30. This estimation gives a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population, as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources in health.","Cruz-Pacheco, Gustavo; Bustamante-Castaneda, Fernando J; Caputo, Jean Guy; Jimenez-Corona, Maria Eugenia; Ponce-de-Leon, Samuel",,648,8

Data were collected on July 2020 using mixed methods to obtain more in‐depth information. Surveys were administered, and three focus groups were conducted. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were analysed systematically by starting with a priori questions and themes followed by data categorisation, reduction, display and conclusion drawing. Results showed six themes related to mental health stressors including economics (e.g., job insecurity), immigration (e.g., undocumented status), misinformation, family stress (e.g., changes in family dynamics and the home environment), health (e.g., limited healthcare access) and social isolation. Coping skills of the community were categorised into four themes with multiple codes including behavioural strategies (e.g., identifying reliable information), cognitive strategies (e.g., collectivistic thinking), social support and spirituality. Findings indicate that underserved Latinx communities are dealing with substantial distress and mental health concerns secondary to the COVID‐19 pandemic; yet these are resilient communities.

Currently, and despite collaborative efforts, diverse therapeutic strategies from ongoing clinical trials are still debated. To address the need for such an immediate call of action, we leveraged the largest dataset of drug-induced transcriptomic perturbations, public SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic datasets, and expression profiles from normal lung transcriptomes. Most importantly, our unbiased systems biology approach prioritized more than 50 repurposable drug candidates (e.g., Corticosteroids, Janus kinase and Bruton kinase inhibitors).

Strategies for overcoming common challenges to non-COVID-19 trial continuation have been reported, but this literature is limited to pharmacological intervention trials from high-income settings. The purpose of this paper is to expand the literature to include a low- and middle-income country perspective. We describe the challenges posed by COVID-19 for a randomised feasibility trial of a psychological intervention for adolescents in Cape Town, South Africa, and lessons learned when implementing strategies to facilitate trial continuation in this context. We used a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle method to explore whether our adaptations were having the desired effect on trial accrual and retention. We found that stakeholder engagement, trial coordination and team communication need to be intensified while testing these procedural changes. We learned that strategies found to be effective in high-income countries required significant adaptation to our resource-constrained setting. The detailed documentation of extraneous influences, procedural changes and trial process information was essential to guiding decisions about which adaptations to retain. This information will be used to examine the potential impact of these changes on study outcomes. We hope that these reflections will be helpful to other trialists from low- and middle-income countries grappling with how to minimise the impact of public health emergencies on their research.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a review of current literature related to surgical and clinical management of patients during COVID-19 crisis paying special attention to oncological ones and especially those suffering from PCa. Based on these publications and current urological guidelines, a manual to manage PCa patients is suggested. RESULTS: Patients suffering from cancer are likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 disease together with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the management of oncological patients should be taken into special consideration and most of the treatments postponed. In case the procedure is not deferrable, it should be adapted to the current situation. While the shortest radiotherapy (RT) regimens should be applied, surgical procedures must undergo the following recommendations proposed by main surgical associations. PCa prognosis is generally favourable and therefore one can safely delay most of the biopsies up to 6 months without interfering with survival outcomes in the vast majority of cases. In the same way, most of the localised PCa patients are suitable for active surveillance (AS) or hormonal therapy until local definitive treatment could be reconsidered. In metastatic as well as castration resistant PCa stages, adding androgen receptor targeted agents (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) could be considered in high risk patients. On the contrary, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and Radium-223 must be avoided with regard to the consequence of hematologic toxicity and risk of COVID-19 infection because of immunodepression. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the biopsies should be delayed while AS is advised in those patients with low risk PCa. ADT allows us to defer definitive local treatment in many cases of intermediate and high risk PCa. In regard to metastatic and castration resistant PCa, combination therapies with abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide could be considered. Chemotherapy, Radium-223 and immunotherapy are discouraged.","Sanchez, Lara Rodriguez; Cathelineau, Xavier; Pinto, Alexis M.

Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate. Therefore, these PIPs might play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in some patients. Highlights Nine potential PIPs were predicted exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 PIPs showed homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Most of PIPs were produced by enzymatic cleavage of the spike glycoproteins.

Its hybrid publishing/citation nature and inherent bias against younger researchers, women, people in low resourced countries, and those not prioritizing publishing arguably give it little value for most formal and informal research evaluations. Nevertheless, it is well-known by academics, used in some promotion decisions, and is prominent in bibliometric databases, such as Google Scholar. In the context of this apparent conflict, it is important to understand researchers’ attitudes towards the h-index. This article used public tweets in English to analyse how scholars discuss the h-index in public: is it mentioned, are tweets about it positive or negative, and has interest decreased since its shortcomings were exposed? The January 2021 Twitter Academic Research initiative was harnessed to download all English tweets mentioning the h-index from the 2006 start of Twitter until the end of 2020. The results showed a constantly increasing number of tweets. Whilst the most popular tweets unapologetically used the h-index as an indicator of research performance, 28.5% of tweets were critical of its simplistic nature and others joked about it (8%). The results suggest that interest in the h-index is still increasing online despite scientists willing to evaluate the h-index in public tending to be critical.

Through experimental coinfection with influenza A virus (IAV) and either pseudotyped or live SARS-CoV-2 virus, we found that IAV preinfection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. Remarkably, in vivo, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice coinfected with IAV. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not observed with several other respiratory viruses, likely due to a unique feature of IAV to elevate ACE2 expression.

This review describes the properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and highlights not only their anti-viral effects but also their important immune-modulatory properties and their well-known use in autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus and arthritis. Chloroquine appears to inhibit in vitro SARS virus' replication and to interfere with SARS-CoV2 receptor (ACE2). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine impede lysosomal activity and autophagy, leading to a decrease of antigen processing and presentation. They are also known to interfere with endosomal Toll-like receptors signaling and cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids, which result in a decreased cellular activation and thereby a lower type I interferons and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Given the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, there is a rational to use them against SARS-CoV2 infection. However, the anti-interferon properties of these molecules might be detrimental, and impaired host immune responses against the virus. This duality could explain the discrepancy with the recently published studies on CQ/HCQ treatment efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, although these treatments could be an interesting potential strategy to limit progression toward uncontrolled inflammation, they do not appear per se sufficiently potent to control the whole inflammatory process in COVID-19, and more targeted and/or potent therapies should be required at least in add-on.","Gies, Vincent; Bekaddour, Nassima; Dieudonné, Yannick; Guffroy, Aurélien; Frenger, Quentin; Gros, Frédéric; Rodero, Mathieu Paul; Herbeuval, Jean-Philippe; Korganow, Anne-Sophie",Front Immunol,648,1

We qualitatively explored clinicians’ and patients’ experiences of the pandemic’s impact on the delivery and receipt of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) care. METHODS: Between September and December 2020, we conducted ten 90-minute virtual focus groups with sleep clinicians (n=19) and English and Spanish-speaking patients with OSA (n= 30) recruited through an urban academic sleep clinic, national organizations, social media, and snowball sampling. An interdisciplinary team conducted a rapid qualitative analysis that included prefigured and emergent domains. The team developed a comprehensive analytic matrix, identifying key themes within and between groups and triangulating them across participant types. RESULTS: Clinicians and patients across all groups confirmed a rapid shift to the adoption of telemedicine. Clinicians reported telemedicine enhanced evaluations by enabling direct observation of the home environment, providing opportunities to guide patients on medical equipment used in the home, and cultivating meaningful social connections for patients. Perceived benefits varied across patient subgroups (age, language, technological self-efficacy). The majority of clinicians reported that telemedicine’s initial uptake resulted in delays in care and revenue loss, but sustained use was thought to be feasible over time. Patients reported delays in care related to the pandemic’s disruption on healthcare and their personal safety concerns. Additionally, telemedicine’s adoption directly altered other elements of care, including the delivery of patient education materials and loss of tacit information gained during the in-person visit. All groups reported adequate mask fitting as a central challenge for patients using positive airway pressure therapy. Spanish-speaking patients noted concerns of increased difficulty accessing care and navigating the OSA care system due to limited English proficiency, in addition to the limited availability of OSA resources in Spanish. CONCLUSION: During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rapid adoption of telemedicine largely facilitated OSA care but altered patient-clinician interactions, delivery of patient education materials, and mask fitting success. Given that telemedicine will likely be sustained post-pandemic, there are needs for targeted efforts aimed at addressing disparities in telemedicine, enhancing practitioner telepresence and education, and new approaches for mask fitting to ensure successful OSA care.

COVID-19 has caused 77 national governments worldwide to impose a lockdown in part or all their countries, as of April 4, 20203. The United States and the United Kingdom estimated the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths, but there is less evidence to support choice of control measures in middle-income countries4. We used Colombia, an upper-middle income country, as a case-study to assess the effect of social interventions to suppress or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that a combination of social distancing interventions, triggered by critical care admissions, can suppress and mitigate the peak of COVID-19, resulting in less critical care use, hospitalizations, and deaths. We found, through a mathematical simulation model, that a one-time social intervention may delay the number of critical care admissions and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a series of social interventions (social and work distance and school closures) over a period of a year can reduce the expected burden of COVID-19, however, these interventions imply long periods of lockdown. Colombia would prevent up to 97% of COVID-19 deaths using these triggered series of interventions during the first year. Our analyses could be used by decision-makers from other middle-income countries with similar demographics and contact patterns to Colombia to reduce COVID-19 critical care admissions and deaths in their jurisdictions.","Paternina-Caicedo, Angel Jose; Choisy, Marc; Garcia-Calavaro, Christian; Camargo-España, Guido; Rojas-Suarez, José; Dueñas, Carmelo; Smith, Adrian; De la Hoz-Restrepo, Fernando Pio",,648,1

However, there is more, as the SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates not only innate immune mechanisms but also T and B cell repertoires. Most genetic, hematological and immunological studies in COVID-19 are at present phenomenological. However, these and antecedent studies contain the seed grains to resolve many unanswered questions and a whole range of testable hypotheses. What are the links, if existing, between genetics and the occurrence of interferon-neutralizing antibodies? Are NAGGED (neutralizing and generated by gene defect) antibodies involved or not? Is the autoimmune process cause or consequence of virus infection? What are the roles played by cytokine posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis, glycosylation, citrullination and others? How is systemic autoimmunity linked with type 1 interferons? These questions place cytokines and growth factors at pole positions as keys to unlock basic mechanisms of infection and (auto)immunity. Related to cytokine research, (1) COVID-19 patients develop neutralizing autoantibodies, mainly against alpha interferons and it is not yet established whether this is the consequence or cause of virus replication. (2) The glycosylation of recombinant interferon-beta protects against breaking tolerance and the development of neutralizing antibodies. (3) SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammation and release of extracellular proteases leading to remnant epitopes, e.g. of cytokines. (4) In the rare event of homozygous cytokine gene segment deletions, observed neutralizing antibodies may be named NAGGED antibodies. (5) Severe cytolysis releases intracellular content into the extracellular milieu and leads to regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and selection of antibody repertoires, similar to those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (6) Systematic studies of novel autoimmune diseases on single cytokines will complement the present picture about interferons. (7) Interferon neutralization in COVID-19 constitutes a preamble of more studies about cytokine-regulated proteolysis in the control of autoimmunity. Here we reformulate these seven conjectures into testable questions for future research.","Opdenakker, Ghislain; Van Damme, Jo",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,648,1

The murine IFN-γ gene was cloned into the DI vector under the control of an MHV transcriptional promoter and transfected into MHV-infected cells. IFN-γ was secreted into culture medium as early as 6 hr posttransfection and reached a peak level (up to 180 U/ml) at 12 hr posttransfection. The DI-expressed IFN-γ (DE-IFN-γ) exhibited an antiviral activity comparable to that of recombinant IFN-γ and was blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IFN-γ. Treatment of macrophages with DE-IFN-γ selectively induced the expression of the cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase and the IFN-γ-inducing factor (IGIF) but did not affect the amounts of the MHV receptor mRNA. Antiviral activity was detected only when cells were pretreated with IFN-γ for 24 hr prior to infection; no inhibition of virus replication was detected when cells were treated with IFN-γ during or after infection. Furthermore, addition of IFN-γ together with MHV did not prevent infection, but appeared to prevent subsequent viral spread. MHV variants with different degrees of neurovirulence in mice had correspondingly different levels of sensitivities to IFN-γ treatmentin vitro,with the most virulent strain being most resistant to IFN-γ treatment. Infection of susceptible mice with DE-IFN-γ-containing virus caused significantly milder disease, accompanied by more pronounced mononuclear cell infiltrates into the CNS and less virus replication, than that caused by virus containing a control DI vector. This study thus demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of this MHV DI vector for expressing cytokines and may provide a model for studying the role of cytokines in MHV pathogenesis.","Zhang, Xuming; Hinton, David R.; Cua, Daniel J.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,648,1

We performed a systematic review on the oncological effects of delayed surgery for patients with localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the targeted therapy (TT) era. METHOD: The protocol of this review is registered on PROSPERO(CRD42020190882). A comprehensive literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL using MeSH terms and keywords for randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the topic. Risks of biases were assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. For localised RCC, immediate surgery [including partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN)] and delayed surgery [including active surveillance (AS) and delayed intervention (DI)] were compared. For metastatic RCC, upfront versus deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) were compared. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included for quantitative analysis. Delayed surgery was significantly associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.23–2.27, p < 0.01) in T1a RCC, but no significant difference was noted for overall survival. For localised ≥ T1b RCC, there were insufficient data for meta-analysis and the results from the individual reports were contradictory. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN was associated with better overall survival when compared to upfront CN followed by deferred TT (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43–0.86, p < 0.001).

One major aspect of VR applications in this domain includes virtual reality-based training (VRT), which simplifies the complicated visualization process of diagnosis, treatment, disease analysis, and prevention. However, not much is known on how well the domain knowledge is shared and considered in the development of VRT applications. A pertinent mechanism, known as ontology, has acted as an enabler toward making the domain knowledge more explicit. Hence, this paper presents an overview to reveal the basic concepts and explores the extent to which ontologies are used in VRT development for medical education and training in the healthcare domain. From this overview, a base of knowledge for VRT development is proposed to initiate a comprehensive strategy in creating an effective ontology design for VRT applications in the healthcare domain.","Mohamad, Ummul Hanan; Ahmad, Mohammad Nazir; Benferdia, Youcef; Shapi'i, Azrulhizam; Bajuri, Mohd Yazid",Front Med (Lausanne),648,4

CBA mice were immunized intramuscularly with formalin-inactivated A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1)NIBRG-14 (H5N1). Serum samples were obtained on days 7, 12, 14, 21 after immunization. At day 14, the mice were infected intranasally with the A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1)IDCDC-RG2 (H5N1) influenza virus with half of the animals receiving a mixture of the antihistamines. 67% of the vaccinated mice were protected from the lethality compared to 43% in the PBS-immunized group. Administration of antihistamines increased survival up to 85%–95%. Immunohistochemical examination using CD117 staining of the lungs demonstrated a larger quantity of activated mast cells after infection of immunized mice compared to mock-immunized mice. This was correlated to increased histamine level in the lungs and blood. Our experimental results suggest the involvement of mast cells and the histamine they produce in the pathogenesis of influenza infection in case of incomplete formation of the immune response to vaccination and mismatch of the vaccine and infection influenza viruses.","Desheva, Yulia; Mamontov, Andrey; Petkova, Nadezhda; Karev, Vadim; Nazarov, Peter",Life Sci,648,16

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, RA patients were followed in rheumatology clinics of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, and a group of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from index population were recruited. Outcomes of COVID-19 were assessed by the hospitalization rate and need to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. During a period of 12 weeks, 128 RA patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 760 RA control group, and 92 COVID-19 patients from index population were enrolled. RESULTS: Being female, obese, and diabetic, having pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and treatment with prednisolone > 5 mg/d and TNFα inhibitors (TNFis) were independent predictors of COVID-19 in RA patients. Dyspnea, anosmia, and taste loss were more common in RA patients compared with the index population. Admission in hospital, need to ICU care, and mortality occurred in 38, 11.9, and 8.6 percent of RA patients, respectively. Although hospitalization rate in RA patients was more than the index population, there were no significant differences in need to ICU care and mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with prednisolone and TNFis and having comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and CKD increase the risk of COVID-19 in RA patients. Although some differences exist in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in RA patients and index population, prognosis of COVID-19 in RA patients is not any worse.","Malek Mahdavi, Aida; Varshochi, Mojtaba; Hajialilo, Mehrzad; Dastgiri, Saeed; Khabbazi, Raha; Khabbazi, Alireza",Clin Rheumatol,648,1

When the basic reproduction number, R0, is 2.4, 65% effective social protection alone (35% of the unprotected transmission) brings the R below 1. Alternatively, 20% effective social protection brings the reproduction number below 1.0 so long as 75% of the symptomatic population is covered by TTI within 12 hours of symptom onset. Even with 20% effective social protection, TTI of 1 in 4 symptomatic individuals can substantially 'flatten the curve' cutting the peak daily incidence in half.","Chowell, Diego; Chowell, Gerardo; Roosa, Kimberlyn; Dhillon, Ranu; Srikrishna, Devabhaktuni",,648,20

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in human monocytes, experimentally infected and in patients under intensive care. Pyroptosis was dependent on caspase-1 engagement, prior to IL-1beta production and inflammatory cell death. Monocytes exposed to SARS-CoV-2 downregulate HLA-DR, suggesting a potential limitation to orchestrate the immune response. Our results originally describe the mechanism by which monocytes, a central cellular component recruited from peripheral blood to respiratory tract, succumb in patients with severe 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and emphasize the need for identifying anti-inflammatory and antiviral strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced pyroptosis.","Ferreira, A.

The physician’s primary sphere of influence is in direct patient care. However, physicians today often have many other roles, especially within larger health care institutions in which physicians often occupy positions of authority. Physicians are therefore well-positioned to act within these spheres in ways that draw upon the ethical principles that guide patient care and contribute materially to the cause of equity for colleagues and patients alike. By making changes to the ways they already work within their clinical spaces, institutional leadership roles, and wider communities, physicians can counteract the structural problems that undermine the health of the patients they serve.","Karches, Kyle; DeCamp, Matthew; George, Maura; Prochaska, Micah; Saunders, Milda; Thorsteinsdottir, Bjorg; Dzeng, Elizabeth",J Gen Intern Med,648,27

We assess changes in food insecurity in the UK population from April to July 2020. Method: We analyze 11,095 respondents from the April through July waves of the Understanding Society COVID-19 longitudinal study survey linked with Wave 9 of the UK Understanding Society study. Food insecurity was defined as having used a food bank in the last 4 weeks; being hungry but not eating in the last week; or not able to eat healthy and nutritious food in the last week. Unadjusted estimates to examine changes in population prevalence and logistic regression were used to assess the association between employment transitions and food insecurity. Findings: The prevalence of reporting at least one form of food insecurity rose from 7.1% in April to 20.2% by July 2020. Some of the largest increases were among Asian respondents (22.91 percentage points), the self-employed (15.90 percentage points), and 35-44-year-olds (17.08 percentage points). In logistic regression models, those moving from employment to unemployment had higher odds of reporting food insecurity relative to furloughed individuals (OR=2.23; 95% CI: 1.20 to 4.13) and to the persistently employed (OR=2.38; 95% CI: 1.33 to 4.27), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.

This study explores initial PD patients’ lived experiences to observe how quality of life and health care has been affected at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insight into the importance of patient engagement and virtual care. METHODS: Twenty-two virtual, in-depth semi-structured interviews with persons diagnosed with PD who usually attend a Movement Disorders specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, were completed between April 28 and May 13, 2020, and the care partners that wished to participate. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, after which transcripts were analyzed and coded into relevant themes using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Impacts from the public health measures and COVID-19 results into three main themes: (1) Impacts of COVID-19 on PD Clinical Care; (2) Activities of Daily Living; (3) Attitudes and Perceptions. Participants reported worsening in motor and nonmotor symptoms and had to accommodate to clinical care via virtual means which were associated with limitations and suggestions for improvement of remote care. CONCLUSION: This study provides a unique opportunity for researchers to better understand the lived experiences of PD patients in all aspects of their life suggesting that innovative means are needed for facilitating virtual health care medicine and increased social interaction.","Anghelescu, Beatrice Ana-Maria; Bruno, Veronica; Martino, Davide; Roach, Pamela",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in addition to patchy infiltrates. Patients with HAPE also exhibit patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern and CT findings reveal increased lung markings and ground glass-like changes as well. Widespread ground-glass opacities are most commonly a manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Similarly, elevated fibrinogen levels in both conditions are likely an epiphenomenon of edema formation rather than coagulation activation. Autopsy results of a COVID-19 fatality revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). HAPE itself is initially caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and induces altered alveolar-capillary permeability via high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema. It appears that COVID-19 and HAPE both discretely converge on ARDS. In light of this, a countermeasure that has been shown to be effective in the analogous condition of HAPE is Acetazolamide. Acetazolamide has a myriad of effects on different organ systems, potently reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, improves minute ventilation and expired vital capacity. Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This review describes COVID-19 in parallel to HAPE. Deranged respiratory parameters that are present in both conditions are highlighted. The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed. Given the medical emergency of a growing contagion and the thousands of lives at stake, expedient attempts to improve survival are needed. Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be potential countermeasures.","Solaimanzadeh, Isaac",Cureus,648,8

However, the causative agent is often not identified, resulting in antibiotic overtreatment, which is a key driver of antimicrobial resistance and adverse events. We aim to test the hypothesis that comprehensive molecular testing, compared with routine microbiological testing, would be effective in reducing antibiotic use in patients with CAP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a randomised, controlled, open-label clinical trial with two parallel groups (1:1) at two tertiary hospitals between 2020 and 2022. Non-severely immunosuppressed adults hospitalised for CAP will be considered eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental diagnosis (comprehensive molecular testing plus routine microbiological testing) or standard diagnosis (only microbiological routine testing). The primary endpoint will be antibiotic consumption measured as days of antibiotic therapy per 1000 patient-days. Secondary endpoints will be de-escalation to narrower antibiotic treatment, time to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics, days to reaching an aetiological diagnosis, antibiotic-related side effects, length of stay, days to clinical stability, intensive care unit admission, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital readmission up to 30 days after randomisation and death from any cause by 48 hours and 30 days after randomisation.

The ideal PCR test detects all variants of the target pathogen, including newly discovered and emerging variants, while closely related pathogens and their variants should not be detected. This is challenging as pathogens show a high degree of genetic variation due to genetic drift, adaptation and evolution. Therefore, frequent re-evaluation of PCR diagnostics is needed to monitor its usefulness. Validation of PCR diagnostics recognizes three stages, in silico, in vitro and in vivo validation. In vitro and in vivo testing are usually costly, labour intensive and imply a risk of handling dangerous pathogens. In silico validation reduces this burden. In silico validation checks primers and probes by comparing their sequences with available nucleotide sequences. In recent years the amount of available sequences has dramatically increased by high throughput and deep sequencing projects. This makes in silico validation more informative, but also more computing intensive. To facilitate validation of PCR tests, a software tool named PCRv was developed. PCRv consists of a user friendly graphical user interface and coordinates the use of the software programs ClustalW and SSEARCH in order to perform in silico validation of PCR tests of different formats. Use of internal control sequences makes the analysis compliant to laboratory quality control systems. Finally, PCRv generates a validation report that includes an overview as well as a list of detailed results. In-house developed, published and OIE-recommended PCR tests were easily (re-) evaluated by use of PCRv.

Protecting HCWs is of paramount importance to maintain continuous patient care and keep healthcare systems functioning. Used alongside administrative and engineering control measures, personal protective equipment (PPE) is the last line of defense and the core component of protection. Current data suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. Airborne transmission may occur during aerosol-generating procedures. However, the modes of transmission still remain uncertain, especially regarding the possibility of airborne transmission when aerosol-generating procedures are not performed. Thus, there are some inconsistencies in the respiratory protective equipment recommended by international and national organizations. In Korea, there have been several modifications to PPE recommendations offering options in choosing PPE for respiratory and body protection, which confuses HCWs; they are often unsure what to wear and when to wear it. The choice of PPE is based on the risk of exposure and possible modes of transmission. The level of protection provided by PPE differs based on standards and test methods. Thus, understanding them is the key in selecting the proper PPE. This article reviews evidence on the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, compares the current PPE recommendations of the World Health Organization with those in Korea, and discusses standard requirements and the proper selection of PPE.","Park, Sun Hee",Infect Chemother,648,16

Methods: Data was collected through PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, and APA PsycInfo databases until January 2021. Results: Seven studies conducted in five different countries (United States, Spain, Italy, China, and United Kingdom) were included in the final review. Overall, most studies reported a significant decrease in mild physical activity (i.e., walking) among undergraduate students but not among graduate students. Consistently, most studies reported a significant increase in sedentary time (i.e., sitting time on weekdays) in undergraduate students but not in graduate students. We observed that students who were more sedentary previous to lockdown, increased or did not change their moderate and/or vigorous physical activity. In contrast, those who were less sedentary previous to lockdown decreased their moderate and/or vigorous physical activity. Conclusions: COVID 19 induced lockdowns appear to have negatively affected walking and sedentary behavior among undergraduate students but not among graduate students. Our results highlight the importance of promoting the World Health Organization recommendations for physical activity and sedentary behavior among university students to improve health outcomes.","Rivera, Paola Andrea; Nys, Bojan Luc; Fiestas, Fabián",Medwave,648,5

However, knowledge about the basic process of sorption in soils and sediments is limited, complicating regulatory decisions. Therefore, batch equilibrium studies were conducted for the widely used antiparasitics abamectin, doramectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin to add to the assessment of their environmental fate. RESULTS: We examined 20 soil samples and six sediments from Germany and Morocco. Analysis was based on HPLC-fluorescence detection after derivatization. For soils, this resulted in distribution coefficients K(D) of 38–642 mL/g for abamectin, doramectin, and ivermectin. Moxidectin displayed K(D) between 166 and 3123 mL/g. Normalized to soil organic carbon, log K(OC) coefficients were 3.63, 3.93, 4.12, and 4.74 mL/g, respectively, revealing high affinity to organic matter of soils and sediments. Within sediments, distribution resulted in higher log K(OC) of 4.03, 4.13, 4.61, and 4.97 mL/g for the four substances. This emphasizes the diverse nature of organic matter in both environmental media. The results also confirm a newly reported log K(OW) for ivermectin which is higher than longstanding assumptions. Linear sorption models facilitate comparison with other studies and help establish universal distribution coefficients for the environmental risk assessment of veterinary antiparasitics. CONCLUSIONS: Since environmental exposure affects soils and sediments, future sorption studies should aim to include both matrices to review these essential pharmaceuticals and mitigate environmental risks from their use. The addition of soils and sediments from the African continent (Morocco) touches upon possible broader applications of ivermectin for human use. Especially for ivermectin and moxidectin, strong sorption further indicates high hydrophobicity and provides initial concern for potential aquatic or terrestrial ecotoxicological effects such as bioaccumulation. Our derived K(OW) estimates also urge to re-assess this important regulatory parameter with contemporary techniques for all four substances.

However, experimental determination of the atomic structures is laborious and technically difficult. The large gap between the number of sequences and the experimentally determined structures enables the thriving development of computational approaches to modeling RNAs. However, computational methods based on all-atom simulations are intractable for large RNA systems, which demand long time simulations. Facing such a challenge, many coarse-grained (CG) models have been developed. Here, we provide a review of CG models for modeling RNA 3D structures, compare the performance of the different models, and offer insights into potential future developments.","Li, Jun; Chen, Shi-Jie",Front Mol Biosci,648,1

As SARS-CoV-2 sequences highlight wide changes across the samples, we aim to explore whether these changes reveal the geographical origin of the corresponding samples. The k-mer distributions, denoting normalized frequency counts of all possible combinations of nucleotide of size upto k, are often helpful to explore sequence level patterns. Given the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are highly imbalanced by its geographical origin (relatively with a higher number samples collected from the USA), we observe that with proper under-sampling k-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences predict its geographical origin with more than 90% accuracy. The experiments are performed on the samples collected from six countries with maximum number of sequences available till July 07, 2020. This comprises SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Australia, USA, China, India, Greece and France. Moreover, we demonstrate that the changes of genomic sequences characterize the continents as a whole. We also highlight that the network motifs present in the sequence similarity networks have a significant difference across the said countries.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine growth performance, morbidity, and mortality responses of nursery pigs fed UV-irradiated SDPP (UV-SDPP) compared with nonirradiated spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP). Pigs (n = 480; 6.09 ± 2.4 kg initial BW) were blocked by initial BW, and blocks were assigned to pens. the sex ratio was equalized within blocks and pens. Pens were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 dietary treatments (8 pigs/pen and 12 replicates/treatment) in a 3-phase feeding program (phase 1 = d 0 to 13, phase 2 = d 14 to 27, and phase 3 = d 28 to 55). Dietary treatments included a control diet without UV-SDPP or SDBP and diets containing 3% UV-SDPP, 3% SDBP, 6% UV-SDPP, or 6% SDBP during phase 1. Diets were formulated to meet or exceed nutrient requirements and contained the same concentrations of standardized ileal digestible Lys and Lys:ME ratio within phases. Pigs were provided ad libitum access to diets throughout the 55-d experiment. Dietary inclusion rates during phase 2 were reduced to 1.5% UV-SDPP, 1.5% SDBP, 3% UV-SDPP, and 3% SDBP, and all pigs were fed a common diet without UV-SDPP or SDBP during phase 3. Growth performance data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with a control within a completely randomized block design to evaluate the main effects of plasma processing (UV irradiated vs. nonirradiated) and dietary inclusion level, and block, room, and pen were random effects. In phase 1, there were no differences in G:F among treatments, but pigs fed 6% UV-SDPP and 6% SDBP had greater (P < 0.01) ADG (0.11 vs. 0.08 kg/d) and ADFI (0.17 vs. 0.15 kg/d) than pigs fed the control, 3% SDBP, and 3% UV-SDPP diets. After phase 1 (d13), feeding UV-SDPP or SDBP increased (P = 0.02) the BW of pigs. In phases 2 and 3 and the overall feeding period (d 0 to 55), there were no differences in ADG, ADFI, and G:F among dietary treatments. There was a linear decrease (P < 0.01) in mortality of nursery pigs as dietary inclusion rate of SDBP and UV-SDPP increased. In conclusion, feeding SDBP or UV-SDPP diets improved ADG and ADFI during the first 2 wk after weaning due to improved feed consumption, and UV irradiation appeared to have no detrimental effects on the feeding value of SDPP.","Cottingim, K.

Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico. There was also a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.001 and 0.03) and poor correlation (P values ranging from .09 to .94) for values for the six individual domains of the NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico. CONCLUSION: The NHSPI does not appear to be a valid predictor of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico during the first six months of the pandemic.","Keim, Mark E.; Lovallo, Alex P.",Prehospital and disaster medicine,648,30

Previous studies showed that H1N1 virus cannot replicate efficiently in Tmprss2(−/−) knock-out mice whereas H3N2 viruses are able to replicate to the same levels in Tmprss2(−/−) as in wild type (WT) mice. Here, we investigated the sequence requirements for the HA molecule that allow IAV to replicate efficiently in the absence of TMPRSS2. We showed that replacement of the H3 for the H1-loop sequence (amino acids 320 to 329, at the C-terminus of HA(1)) was not sufficient for equal levels of virus replication or severe pathology in Tmprss2(−/−) knock-out mice compared to WT mice. However, exchange of a distant amino acid from H1 to H3 sequence (E31D) in addition to the HA-loop substitution resulted in virus replication in Tmprss2(−/−) knock-out mice that was comparable to WT mice. The higher virus replication and lung damage was associated with increased epithelial damage and higher mortality.

There is, however, a paucity of information on SimEx application to test the functionality of health systems alongside emergency preparedness, response and recovery. Given the important implications health services resilience has for the protection and improvement of human life, this scoping review was undertaken to determine how the publicly available body of existing global SimEx materials considers health systems, together with health security functions in the event of disruptive emergencies. The global review identified 668 articles from literature and 73 products from institutional sources. Relevant screening identified 51 materials suitable to examine from a health system lens using the six health system building blocks as per the WHO Health System Framework. Eight materials were identified for further examination of their ability to test health system functionality from a resilience perspective. SimEx are an effective approach used extensively within health security and emergency response sectors but is not yet adequately used to test health system resilience. Currently available SimEx materials lack an integrated health system perspective and have a limited focus on the quality of services delivered within the context of response to a public health emergency. The materials do not focus on the ability of systems to effectively maintain core services during response. Without adjustment of the scope and focus, currently available SimEx materials do not have the capacity to test health systems to support the development of resilient health systems. Dedicated SimEx materials are urgently needed to fill this gap and harness their potential as an operational tool to contribute to improvements in health systems. They can act as effective global goods to allow testing of different functional aspects of health systems and service delivery alongside emergency preparedness and response.

Efforts to define ways to assess functionality of health systems have however varied, with many not translating into concrete policy action and influence on system development. We present an approach to provide countries with information on the functionality of their systems in a manner that will facilitate movement towards universal health coverage. We conceptualise functionality of a health system as being a construct of four capacities: access to, quality of, demand for essential services and its resilience to external shocks. We test and confirm the validity of these capacities as appropriate measures of system functionality. We thus provide results for functionality of the 47 countries of the WHO African Region based on this. The functionality of health systems ranges from 34.4 to 75.8 on a 0–100 scale. Access to essential services represents the lowest capacity in most countries of the region, specifically due to poor physical access to services. Funding levels from public and out-of-pocket sources represent the strongest predictors of system functionality, compared with other sources. By focusing on the assessment on the capacities that define system functionality, each country has concrete information on where it needs to focus, in order to improve the functionality of its health system to enable it respond to current needs including achieving universal health coverage, while responding to shocks from challenges such as the 2019 coronavirus disease.

Ejaculate volume and color, sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, and membrane integrity (hypoosmotic swelling test and fluorescent staining) were assessed. For each dog, seminal plasma was pooled from all three ejaculates and proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE, using polyacrylamide concentrations of 13% and 22% in the separation gels. After staining, gel images were digitized to estimate molecular weights (MW) and integrated optical density (IOD) of each lane and of individual bands. Total seminal plasma protein concentration was 2.19 ± 1.56 g/dL (mean ± SD; range 1.12–5.19 g/dL). A total of 37 protein bands were identified (although no dog had all 37 bands).

More frequent in cases with respect to controls were decidual arteriopathy (40.9% vs. 1.4% p < 0.0001), decidual inflammation (32.4% vs. 0.7% p < 0.0001), perivillous fibrin deposition (36.6% vs. 3.5% p < 0.0001) and fetal vessel thrombi (22.5% vs. 0.7% p < 0.0001). No significant differences in the percentage of terminal villous hyperplasia and chorioamnionitis were observed between the two groups. As the pandemic continues, these studies will become more urgent in order to clarify the possible mechanism of maternal–fetal transmission of the virus.","Resta, Leonardo; Vimercati, Antonella; Cazzato, Gerardo; Mazzia, Giulia; Cicinelli, Ettore; Colagrande, Anna; Fanelli, Margherita; Scarcella, Sara Vincenza; Ceci, Oronzo; Rossi, Roberta",Viruses,648,16

It inhibits viral infection and regulates the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). We recently reported that macrophages differentiated from human primary monocytes in the presence of IL-27 and human AB serum resisted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and showed significant autophagy induction. In the current study, the miRNA profiles in these cells were investigated, especially focusing on the identification of novel miRNAs regulated by IL-27-treatment. The miRNA sequencing analysis detected 38 novel miRNAs. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed that IL-27 differentially regulated the expression of 16 of the 38 miRNAs. Overexpression of the synthesized miRNA mimics by transfection revealed that miRAB40 had potent HIV-inhibiting and autophagy-inducing properties. B18R, an interferon (IFN)-neutralization protein, partially suppressed both activities, indicating that the two functions were induced via IFN-dependent and -independent pathways. Although the target mRNA(s) of miRAB40 involving in the induction of both functions was unable to identify in this study, the discovery of miRAB40, a potential HIV-inhibiting and autophagy inducing miRNA, may provide novel insights into the miRNA (small none-coding RNA)-mediated regulation of HIV inhibition and autophagy induction as an innate immune response.","Imamichi, Tomozumi; Goswami, Suranjana; Hu, Xiaojun; Laverdure, Sylvain; Yang, Jun; Qiu, Ju; Chen, Qian; Sherman, Brad T.; Chang, Weizhong",Int J Mol Sci,648,6

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.","Yang, Wuyue; Zhang, Dongyan; Peng, Liangrong; Zhuge, Changjing; Hong, Liu",,648,24

Some of these gaps are addressed in this summary of a Special Feature of Sustainability Science, including new findings and emerging issues on (1) the characteristics of SDG interactions; (2) methods/methodology to analyse these interactions; and (3) the elaboration of drivers that influence SDG synergies. The importance of scale is clear in two emerging issues. First, there is evidence of a disconnect between national planning for SDGs and their implementation at the local scale which is leading to SDG trade-offs between these scales. Second, the concept of a “critical transition zone” is introduced where SDG trade-offs pose a particular challenge to SDG implementation. These are areas (e.g., peri-urban and forest margin areas in the Global South) undergoing rapid biophysical and/or socio-economic changes and inhabited by populations especially vulnerable to these changes. While trade-offs occur among the SDGs, there are also many examples of synergies which provide opportunities for advancing multiple goals. To distinguish between synergies and the actions that exploit them, the term “synergy driver” is introduced to refer to policies and measures that positively advance two or more goals. Several examples of synergy drivers are presented, including sustainable global supply chains, people-centred early warning systems, and joint conservation-public health programmes. To make synergy drivers relevant to the broader policy community, the research community (working with stakeholders) should first consolidate knowledge about these drivers and then evaluate their effectiveness/applicability to different policy settings.","Alcamo, Joseph; Thompson, John; Alexander, Anthony; Antoniades, Andreas; Delabre, Izabela; Dolley, Jonathan; Marshall, Fiona; Menton, Mary; Middleton, Jo; Scharlemann, Jörn P.

OBJECTIVE: Describe the experience and perceptions of students of the Nursing university degree during their participation as health support in the COVID‐19 health crisis in Spain. DESIGN: We conducted a cross‐sectional survey study. METHOD: 503 students enrolled in the 4th course of the Nursing degree in Spain during the months of March and April 2020. An online questionnaire was developed, based on a pilot study and distributed through the Nursing Association, students’ unions and students’ associations. Variables were used to describe their participation, degree of preparedness and training needs to determine how to improve training through descriptive statistics, as well as nonparametric tests to analyse the relationship between training and degree of preparedness nursing students. Results are reported according to the STROBE Statement. RESULTS: 73.2% (368) of students offered to participate in healthcare aid, of which 225 were actively involved. 27.8% carried out nursing tasks without supervision, and 47.7% assisted COVID‐19 patients as any other nurse. Only 3.4% felt very prepared to work in the field of intensive care, finding that those students who perceived a higher degree of preparedness had received previous training in personal protective equipment and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.005). The highest scores for training activities that may improve their preparedness were simulations to improve levels of anxiety and stress when managing critical patients, simulation in ventilatory support and mandatory practices in services where ventilators are used. CONCLUSIONS: Although three out of four students were willing to provide health assistance, they recognise that they were not specially prepared in the field of intensive care and demand training with simulation to improve anxiety and stress levels in the management of critical patients and simulation in ventilatory support. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Students have been vital resources for our health system and society when they have been needed. It is now up to us, both teachers and health authorities, to share their efforts by implementing the necessary improvements in training and safety measures not only because these affects the health and safety of the patient, but because they will be essential parts in future pandemics.","Hernández‐Martínez, Antonio; Rodríguez‐Almagro, Julián; Martínez‐Arce, Alejandro; Romero‐Blanco, Cristina; García‐Iglesias, Juan Jesús; Gómez‐Salgado, Juan",J Clin Nurs,648,18

The secondary objectives were to estimate the degree of risk based on country of origin and to assess knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 control measures and subjective well-being during the quarantine period. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of arriving international travellers. SETTING: Toronto Pearson Airport Terminal 1, Toronto, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of this study were passengers arriving on international flights. Inclusion criteria were those aged 18 or older who had a final destination within 100 km of the airport, spoke English or French, and provided consent. Excluded were those taking a connecting flight, had no internet access, exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival or were exempted from quarantine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus on reverse transcription PCR with self-administered oral-nasal swab and general well-being using the WHO-5 Well-being Index. RESULTS: Of 16 361 passengers enrolled, 248 (1.5%, 95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%) tested positive. Of these, 167 (67%) were identified on arrival, 67 (27%) on day 7, and 14 (6%) on day 14. The positivity rate increased from 1% in September to 2% in October. Average well-being score declined from 19.8 (out of a maximum of 25) to 15.5 between arrival and day 7 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A single arrival test will pick up two-thirds of individuals who will become positive by day 14, with most of the rest detected on the second test on day 7. These results support strategies identified through mathematical models that a reduced quarantine combined with testing can be as effective as a 14-day quarantine.","Goel, Vivek; Bulir, David; De Prophetis, Eric; Jamil, Munaza; Rosella, Laura C; Mertz, Dominik; Regehr, Cheryl; Smieja, Marek",BMJ Open,648,1

A cross-section of 1317 U.S. metropolitan, acute care, not-for-profit hospitals for the year 2015 was employed. We use a frontier method, stochastic frontier analysis, to estimate hospital efficiency. Total margin and operating margin were used as profit variables in OLS regressions that were corrected for heteroskedacity. In addition to estimated efficiency, control variables for internal and external correlates of profitability were included in the regression models. We found that more efficient hospitals were also more profitable. The results show a positive relationship between profitability and size, concentration of output, occupancy rate and membership in a multi-hospital system. An inverse relationship was found between profits and academic medical centers, average length of stay, location in a Medicaid expansion state, Medicaid and Medicare share of admissions, and unemployment rate. The results of a Hausman test indicates that efficiency is exogenous in the profit equations. The findings suggest that not-for-profit hospitals will be responsive to incentives for increasing efficiency and use market power to increase surplus to pursue their objectives.","Rosko, Michael; Al-Amin, Mona; Tavakoli, Manouchehr",Int J Health Econ Manag,648,33

This hybrid model is called MLP-MC. In this study, 136 data (days) are collected from May 13, 2020, to April 1, 2021, divided into two parts: training and test. The training data are used to train the MLP network, and the trained MLP network is used to predict the test data and the next 40 days. Then the residual errors of actual and predicted values are calculated. In the next step, the MC model is used to classify the errors and predict the values of the indicators according to the probabilities related to the error states and improve the performance of the MLP model in forecasting. Finally, the prediction accuracy of MLP and MLP-MC models are compared using three evaluation metrics: MAD, MSE and RMSE.

The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic value of two different frailty scores in patients hospitalised for COVID‐19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult (≥18 years) inpatients with COVID‐19 and took place from 3 March to 2 May 2020. Patients were categorised by Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). The primary outcome was in‐hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were tocilizumab treatment, length of hospital stay, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Results were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, kidney function and comorbidity. RESULTS: Of the 290 included patients, 54 were frail according to the CFS (≥5 points; prevalence 18.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4‐23.7) vs 65 by HFRS (≥5 points; prevalence: 22.4%, 95% CI 17.8‐27.7). Prevalence of frailty increased with age according to both measures: 50‐64 years, CFS 1.9% vs HFRS 12.3%; 65‐79 years, CFS 31.5% vs HFRS 40.0%; and ≥80 years, CFS 66.7% vs HFRS 40.0% (P < .001). CFS‐defined frailty was independently associated with risk of death (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.49‐9.04) and less treatment with tocilizumab (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08‐0.93). HFRS‐defined frailty was independently associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.53‐5.44), ICU admission (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.84‐9.52) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.93, 95% CI 2.33‐15.10). CONCLUSION: In the spring 2020 wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Spain, CFS‐defined frailty was an independent predictor for death, while frailty as measured by the HFRS was associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days, ICU admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation.","Ramos‐Rincon, Jose‐Manuel; Moreno‐Perez, Oscar; Pinargote‐Celorio, Hector; Leon‐Ramirez, Jose‐Manuel; Andres, Mariano; Reus, Sergio; Herrera‐García, Cristian; Martí‐Pastor, Ana; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Sanchez‐Martinez, Rosario; Merino, Esperanza",Int J Clin Pract,648,16

SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http://www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","Laurent, Estelle MN; Sofianatos, Yorgos; Komarova, Anastassia; Gimeno, Jean-Pascal; Tehrani, Payman Samavarchi; Kim, Dae-Kyum; Abdouni, Hala; Duhamel, Marie; Cassonnet, Patricia; Knapp, Jennifer J; Kuang, Da; Chawla, Aditya; Sheykhkarimli, Dayag; Rayhan, Ashyad; Li, Roujia; Pogoutse, Oxana; Hill, David E; Calderwood, Mike E; Falter-Braun, Pascal; Aloy, Patrick; Stelzl, Ulrich; Vidal, Marc; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Pavlopoulos, Georgios A; Werf, Sylvie Van Der; Fournier, Isabelle; Roth, Frederick P; Salzet, Michel; Demeret, Caroline; Jacob, Yves; Coyaud, Etienne",bioRxiv,648,16

METHODS We summarize lessons learned from the HIV epidemic that offer insights about how the response to COVID-19 can be improved, especially in the United States which has incurred one quarter of world's infections to date. RESULTS Lessons learned include: the need to develop and deploy valid tests for point-of-care diagnosis and surveillance; the importance of considering HIV and COVID-19 in the context of syndemics; the potential role of structural interventions that address drivers of disparities; how existing research infrastructure can be leveraged to accelerate development of therapeutics and vaccines; and how modeling that is tailored to regional epidemics can inform policy. CONCLUSIONS The window of opportunity to prevent a widespread COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has already closed, but it is not too late to implement a mitigation strategy that can save thousands of lives. Decisive leadership that develops policies grounded in scientific evidence is key to charting a path forward. The question is whether the United States is prepared to learn from its past successes and mistakes with the HIV epidemic to develop a nation-wide plan that puts politics aside and prioritizes saving lives.","Strathdee, Steffanie A.; Martin, Natasha K.; Pitpitan, Eileen V.; Stockman, Jamila K.; Smith, Davey M.",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,648,1

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~85% of the total number of lung cancer cases. In the past two decades, immunotherapy has become a more promising treatment method than traditional treatments (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Immunotherapy has been shown to improve the survival rate of patients and to have a superior effect when controlling lung cancer than traditional therapy. However, only a small number of patients can benefit from immunotherapy, and not all patients who qualify experience long-term benefits. In the clinic, the objective response rate of programmed cell death protein 1 treatment without the prior screening of patients is only 15–20%. Immunotherapy is associated with both opportunities and challenges for patients with NSCLC. The current challenges of immunotherapy include the lack of accurate biomarkers, inevitable resistance and insufficient understanding of immune checkpoints. In previous years, several methods for overcoming the challenges posed by immunotherapy have been proposed, but combination therapy is the most suitable choice. A large number of studies have shown that the combination of drugs can significantly improve their efficacy, compared with monotherapy, and that some therapeutic combinations have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of NSCLC. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a traditional medical practice in China that can play an important role in immunotherapy. Most agents used in TCM originate from plants, and have the advantages of low toxicity and multiple targets. In addition, TCM includes a unique class of drugs that can improve autoimmunity. Therefore, TCM may be a promising treatment method for all types of cancer.","Ma, Lin-Rui; Li, Jia-Xin; Tang, Ling; Li, Run-Ze; Yang, Jia-Shun; Sun, Ao; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Yan, Pei-Yu",Oncol Lett,648,1

The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people ≥80 years old ranged from approximately 1 in 6,000 in Germany to 1 in 420 in Spain. The COVID-19 death risk in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 9 miles per day (Germany) and 415 miles per day (New York City). People <65 years old and not having any underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.3%, 0.7%, and 1.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in Netherlands, Italy, and New York City. CONCLUSIONS: People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in the hotbeds of the pandemic and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.","Ioannidis, John P.

Hospitals that have an agile process to evaluate chief complaints of patients seeking emergency care may be able to more quickly identify subtle changes in the community's health. An easily adaptable prototype system was developed to monitor emergency department patient visits during the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, from April 16–May 14, 2002. Use of the system was continued during the same festival periods in 2003 and 2004. METHOD: Twelve area hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky, participated in a prospective analysis of the chief symptoms of patients who sought care in the emergency department during the Kentucky Derby Festival during 2002. Six hospitals were classified as computer record groups (CRG) and used their existing computerized record capabilities. The other 6 hospitals used a personal digital assistant (PDA) with customized software (PDA group). Data were evaluated by the health department epidemiologist using SaTScan, a modified version of a cancer cluster detection program, to look for clusters of cases above baseline over time and by Zip code. RESULTS: All 12 hospitals were able to collect and provide data elements during the study period. The 6 CRG hospitals were able to perform daily data transmission; however, 3 CRG hospitals were unable to interpret their data because it was transmitted in pure text format. In contrast, data from all 6 PDA group hospitals were interpretable. Real-time data analysis was compared with postevent data, and it was found that the real-time evaluation correctly identified no unusual disease activity during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The 12 hospitals participating in this study demonstrated that community-wide surveillance using computerized data was possible and that the 6 study hospitals using a PDA could quickly interpret emergency department patients' chief complaints. The emergency department chief complaints group could serve as a disease sentinel for the community.","Carrico, Ruth; Goss, Linda",Disaster Manag Response,648,22

However, the magnitude of the effect of PP on clinical outcomes (e.g., the risk of endotracheal intubation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, or mortality) in these patients remains uncertain. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of PP to improve the clinical outcomes in non-intubated patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception through February 24, 2020 for all the studies all studies that all compared PP versus no PP in non-intubated patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome of interest was the rate of endotracheal intubation. The secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) rates. Pooled odds risk (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by the Mantel-Haenszel method within a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of five studies (two randomized controlled trials and three observational studies), involving 470 non-intubated patients with COVID-19 (185 patients received PP and 285 did not) were included. The mean age was 59.82 years, and males represented 67% of total patients. The follow-up period ranged from 14 to 30 days. The endotracheal intubation rate was similar between PP and control groups (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.41-1.35, P = 0.33, I2 = 20%). There was no difference in the in-hospital mortality rate between the two groups (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.16-2.85, P = 0.60, I2 = 60%). Four studies reported the risk of ICU admission and demonstrated no difference between the two groups (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30-1.95, P = 0.58, I2 = 37%). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that prone positioning in non-intubated COVID-19 patients did not reduce the risk of endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, PP failed to reduce in-hospital mortality and ICU admission rates. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although our meta-analysis showed that prone positioning might not reduce the risks of intubation, in-hospital mortality, or ICU admission rate in spontaneously breathing non-intubated COVID-19 patients, more large-scale trials with a standardized protocol for prone positioning are needed to better evaluate the effectiveness of prone positioning in this select population.

Up to now, the development of vaccine is still in the stage of clinical research, and there is no clinically approved specific antiviral drug for human coronavirus infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the key molecules involved in response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide references for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted in-depth and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of human proteins identified with SARS-CoV-2, including functional enrichment analysis, protein interaction network analysis, screening of hub genes, and evaluation of their potential as therapeutic targets. In addition, we used the gene-drug database to search for inhibitors of related biological targets. RESULTS: Several significant pathways, such as PKA, centrosome and transcriptional regulation, may greatly contribute to the development and progression of COVID-2019 disease. Taken together 15 drugs and 18 herb ingredients were screened as potential drugs for viral treatment. Specially, the trans-resveratrol can significantly reduce the expression of N protein of MERS-CoV and inhibit MERS-CoV. In addition, trans-resveratrol, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and BX795 all show good anti multiple virus effects. CONCLUSION: Some drugs selected through our methods have been proven to have antiviral effects in previous studies.

We aimed to systematically investigate how COVID-19 affects perioperative management and clinical outcomes, to develop evidence-based guidelines. METHODS: First, we conducted a rapid literature review in Embase, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (1(st) January to 1(st) July 2020), using a predefined protocol. Secondly, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 166 women undergoing Caesarean section at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, imaging, laboratory, and clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. RESULTS: The review identified 26 studies, mainly case reports/series. One large cohort reported greater mortality in elective surgery patients diagnosed after, rather than before surgery. Higher 30-day mortality was associated with emergency surgery, major surgery, poorer preoperative condition and surgery for malignancy. Regional anaesthesia was favoured in most studies and personal protective equipment (PPE) was generally used by healthcare workers (HCW), but its use was poorly described for patients. In the retrospective cohort study, duration of surgery, oxygen therapy and hospital stay were longer in suspected or confirmed patients than negative patients, but there were no differences in neonatal outcomes. None of the 262 participating HCWs was infected with SARS-CoV-2 when using level 3 PPE perioperatively. CONCLUSIONS: When COVID-19 is suspected, testing should be considered before non-urgent surgery. Until further evidence is available, HCWs should use level 3 PPE perioperatively for suspected or confirmed patients, but research is needed on its timing and specifications. Further research must examine longer-term outcomes.

Since its emergence in late December 2019 and its declaration as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease known as (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. The process of modeling and predicting the pandemic behavior became crucial as the different states needed accurate predictions to be able to adopt suitable policies to minimize the pressure on their health care systems. Researchers have employed modified variants of classical SIR/SEIR models to describe the dynamics of this pandemic. In this paper, after proven effective in numerous countries, a modified variant of SEIR is implemented to predict the behavior of COVID-19 in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East. Methods. We built MATLAB simulations to fit the real data of COVID-19 Active, recovered and death Cases in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to the modified SEIR model via Nelder-Mead algorithm to be able to estimate the future dynamics of the pandemic. Findings. We estimate several characteristics of COVID-19 future dynamics in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

The method consists of stacking collected temporal snapshots into a matrix and mapping the nonlinear dynamics using a linear operator. The classical procedure considers that snapshots possess the same dimensionality for all the observable data. However, this often does not occur in numerical simulations with adaptive mesh refinement/coarsening schemes (AMR/C). This paper proposes a strategy to enable DMD to extract features from observations with different mesh topologies and dimensions, such as those found in AMR/C simulations. For this purpose, the adaptive snapshots are projected onto the same reference function space, enabling the use of snapshot-based methods such as DMD. The present strategy is applied to challenging AMR/C simulations: a continuous diffusion–reaction epidemiological model for COVID-19, a density-driven gravity current simulation, and a bubble rising problem. We also evaluate the DMD efficiency to reconstruct the dynamics and some relevant quantities of interest. In particular, for the SEIRD model and the bubble rising problem, we evaluate DMD’s ability to extrapolate in time (short-time future estimates).","Barros, Gabriel F.; Grave, Malú; Viguerie, Alex; Reali, Alessandro; Coutinho, Alvaro L.

In this study, we describe PCT levels overtime and their relationship with bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) critically ill patients with pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in an ICU of a University Hospital. All consecutive COPD patients admitted for pneumonia between September 2005 and September 2006 were included. Respiratory samples were tested for the presence of bacteria and viruses. Procalcitonin was sequentially assessed and patients classified according to the probability of the presence of a bacterial infection. RESULTS: Thirty four patients were included. The PCT levels were assessed in 32/34 patients, median values were: 0.493 μg/L [IQR, 0.131 to 1.471] at the time of admission, 0.724 μg/L [IQR, 0.167 to 2.646] at six hours, and 0.557 μg/L [IQR, 0.123 to 3.4] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 μg/L in 3/32 (9%) patients and greater than 0.25 μg/L in 22/32 (69%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Fifteen bacteria and five viruses were detected in 15/34 (44%) patients. Bacteria were not detected in patients with PCTmax levels < 0.1 μg/L. In contrast, bacteria were detected in 4/7 (57%) patients estimated unlikely to have a bacterial infection by PCT levels (PCTmax > 0.1 and < 0.25 μg/L). CONCLUSION: Based on these results we suggest that a PCT level cut off > 0.1 μg/L may be more appropriate than 0.25 μg/L (previously proposed for non severe lower respiratory tract infection) to predict the probability of a bacterial infection in severe COPD patients with pneumonia. Further studies testing procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategies are needed in COPD patients with severe pneumonia.","Daubin, Cédric; Parienti, Jean-Jacques; Fradin, Sabine; Vabret, Astrid; Ramakers, Michel; Terzi, Nicolas; Freymuth, François; Charbonneau, Pierre; du Cheyron, Damien",BMC Infect Dis,648,20

To date, however, it remains unknown what the minimal level of Nab is required to achieve sterile immunity in humans. It is therefore important to explore techniques to maximize the level of Nab response in vivo. Here, we evaluate various vaccination regimens using combinations of DNA-S, MVA-S, and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5-S) vaccines. We show that in vaccinated mice and rabbits, a heterologous MVA-S prime with Ad5-S boost regimen induces the highest and most persistent level of Nab response when compared with other combinations. Interestingly, the initial level of Nab after prime does not necessarily predict the magnitude of the secondary response after the boost. Thus, our data provides a promising optimal regimen for vaccine development in humans against SARS-CoV infection.","Ba, Lei; Yi, Christopher E.; Zhang, Linqi; Ho, David D.; Chen, Zhiwei",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,648,24

The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can provide crucial epidemiological information about the extent of infections independent of virologically detected case numbers. There is no large population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey from Norway; thus we estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Norway before the introduction of vaccines and described its distribution across demographic groups. In November-December 2020, a total of 110,000 people aged 16 years or older were randomly selected from the National Population Register and invited to complete a questionnaire and provide a dried blood spot (DBS) sample. The response rate was 30%; compliance rate for return of DBS samples was 88%. The national weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 0.9% (confidence interval 0.7-1.0).

The incidence and severity of anesthetic complications in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative complications in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those with negative testing. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing complications for children under 18 years of age who underwent anesthesia between April 28 and September 30, 2020 at a large, academic pediatric hospital. Each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within the prior 10 days was matched to a patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, age, gender, and procedure. Children who were intubated prior to the procedure, underwent organ transplant surgery, or had severe COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the risk difference of a composite of intra- or postoperative respiratory complications in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those with negative testing. Secondarily, we used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for respiratory complications before and after adjustment using propensity scores weighting to adjust for possible confounders. Other secondary outcomes included neurologic, cardiovascular, hematologic, and renal complications, unanticipated postoperative admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS During the study period, 9,812 general anesthetics that had a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Sixty encounters occurred in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing preoperatively and 51 were included for analysis. The matched controls cohort included 99 encounters. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%; risk difference 10.8%, 95% CI 1.6-19.8%; P = 0.003). After adjustment, the odds ratio for respiratory complications was 14.37 (95% CI 1.59-130.39; P = 0.02) for SARS-CoV-2 positive children as compared to controls. There was no occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative pneumonia, or perioperative mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher rates of perianesthetic respiratory complications than matched controls with negative testing. However, severe morbidity was rare and there were no mortalities. The incidence of complications was similar to previously published rates of perianesthetic complications in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection. This risk persisted after adjustment for preoperative upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting an increased risk in symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Saynhalath, Rita; Alex, Gijo; Efune, Proshad N; Szmuk, Peter; Zhu, Hong; Sanford, Ethan L",Anesthesia and analgesia,648,1

Traditionally, brain activity has been studied from a frequency perspective by computing the power spectral density of the EEG recordings and extracting features from different frequency sub-bands. However, these features are often individually extracted from single EEG channels, such that each brain region is separately evaluated, even when it has been corroborated that mental processes are based on the coordination of different brain areas working simultaneously. To take advantage of the brain’s behaviour as a synchronized network, in the present work, 2-D and 3-D spectral images constructed from common 32 channel EEG signals are evaluated for the first time to discern between emotional states of calm and distress using a well-known deep-learning algorithm, such as AlexNet. The obtained results revealed a significant improvement in the classification performance regarding previous works, reaching an accuracy about 84%. Moreover, no significant differences between the results provided by the diverse approaches considered to reconstruct 2-D and 3-D spectral maps from the original location of the EEG channels over the scalp were noticed, thus suggesting that these kinds of images preserve original spatial brain information.","Martínez-Rodrigo, Arturo; García-Martínez, Beatriz; Huerta, Álvaro; Alcaraz, Raúl",Sensors (Basel),648,25

Substantial variations in COVID-19 outcomes and built environment features existed across neighborhoods. Using rigorous simulation-assisted discrete outcome random parameter models, the results shed new lights on the direct and indirect connections between built environment, travel behavior, positivity, hospitalization, and mortality rates. More mixed land use and greater pedestrian-oriented street connectivity is correlated with lower COVID-19 hospitalization/fatality rates. Greater participation in sedentary travel correlates with higher COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality whereas the reverse is true for greater participation in active travel. COVID-19 hospitalizations strongly mediate the relationships between built environment, active travel, and COVID-19 survival.

METHOD: A web‐based cross‐sectional survey was administered during and shortly after the COVID‐19 related lockdown in Spain and Greece. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify country differences associated with eating behaviour, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: This study included 1,002 responders in Spain and 839 in Greece. The mean ± SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5 ± 0.79, 2.1 ± 0.81 and 2.6 ± 0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7 ± 0.85, 2.3 ± 0.99 and 2.9 ± 0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (p < .001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%.

Pandemic-related restrictions and reorganization of healthcare services may affect thyroid disease management. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To analyze and discuss the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid diseases from several perspectives. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov were searched for this purpose by using free text words and medical subject headings as follows: “sars cov 2”, “covid 19”, “subacute thyroiditis”, “atypical thyroiditis”, “chronic thyroiditis”, “hashimoto’s thyroiditis”, “graves’ disease”, “thyroid nodule”, “differentiated thyroid cancer”, “medullary thyroid cancer”, “methimazole”, “levothyroxine”, “multikinase inhibitor”, “remdesivir”, “tocilizumab”. Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed to answer the following clinical questions: “What evidence suggests that COVID-19 may induce detrimental consequences on thyroid function?""; ""Could previous or concomitant thyroid diseases deteriorate the prognosis of COVID-19 once the infection has occurred?”; “Could medical management of thyroid diseases influence the clinical course of COVID-19?”; “Does medical management of COVID-19 interfere with thyroid function?”; “Are there defined strategies to better manage endocrine diseases despite restrictive measures and in-hospital and ambulatory activities reorganizations?”. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may induce thyroid dysfunction that is usually reversible, including subclinical and atypical thyroiditis. Patients with baseline thyroid diseases are not at higher risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, and baseline thyroid dysfunction does not foster a worse progression of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether low levels of free triiodothyronine, observed in seriously ill patients with COVID-19, may worsen the disease's clinical progression and, consequently, if triiodothyronine supplementation could be a tool for reducing this burden. Glucocorticoids and heparin may affect thyroid hormone secretion and measurement, respectively, leading to possible misdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in severe cases of COVID-19. High-risk thyroid nodules require a fine-needle aspiration without relevant delay, whereas other non-urgent diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions should be postponed. DISCUSSION: Currently, we know that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to short-term and reversible thyroid dysfunction, but thyroid diseases seem not to affect the progression of COVID-19. Adequate management of patients with thyroid diseases remains essential during the pandemic, but it could be compromised because of healthcare service restrictions. Endocrine care centers should continuously recognize and classify priority cases for in-person visits and therapeutic procedures. Telemedicine may be a useful tool for managing patients not requiring in-person visits.","Lisco, G.; De Tullio, A.; Jirillo, E.; Giagulli, V.

METHODS: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. A total of 148 CSAP patients will be randomly allocated into two groups through central randomization in a 1:1 ratio. This trial will include a 2-week screening period, a 4-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. The primary outcome is the frequency of angina attacks from baseline to 4 weeks after inclusion. Secondary outcomes include the frequency of angina attacks from baseline to 4 weeks after acupuncture treatment, the pain intensity of angina, total ischemia burden, heart rate variability, QT dispersion, the score of Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and the score of Short-Form of McGill Pain Questionnaire.

The lungs are the main organ involved in COVID-19, and severe progressive respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in the affected patients; however, many other organs can be involved with variable clinical manifestations. Concerning abdominal manifestations, the gastrointestinal tract and the hepatobiliary system are mainly affected, although the pancreas, urinary tract and spleen may also be involved. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms are loss of appetite, followed by nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal imaging findings include bowel wall thickening, sometimes associated with hyperemia and mesenteric thickening, fluid-filled segments of the large bowel and rarely intestinal pneumatosis and ischemia. Hepatic involvement manifests as an increase in the enzymatic levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum bilirubin and γ-glutamyl transferase with clinical manifestations in most cases mild and transient. The most frequent radiological features are hepatic steatosis, biliary sludge and gallstones. Edematous acute pancreatitis, kidney infarct and acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis have been described more rarely in COVID-19. Lastly, splenic involvement is characterized by splenomegaly and by the development of solitary or multifocal splenic infarcts with classic wedge-shaped or even rounded morphology, with irregular or smooth profiles. In summary, the abdominal radiological findings of COVID-19 are nonspecific and with poor pathological correlation reported in the literature. Ultrasound and particularly computed tomography with multiphasic acquisition are the diagnostic methods mainly utilized in COVID-19 patients with abdominal clinical symptoms and signs. Although radiological signs are not specific of abdominal and gastrointestinal involvement, the diagnostic imaging modalities and in particular computed tomography are helpful for the clinician in the management, evaluation of the severity and evolution of the COVID-19 patients.","Boraschi, Piero; Giugliano, Luigi; Mercogliano, Giuseppe; Donati, Francescamaria; Romano, Stefania; Neri, Emanuele",World J Gastroenterol,648,1

Optimal management strategies are still unclear, including the role of immunomodulatory therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the context of cardiogenic shock. We report a case of a middle-aged female with COVID-19 who developed respiratory distress and hemodynamic deterioration with elevated troponin levels on the seventh day of symptoms. Echocardiography demonstrated pericardial effusion with diastolic restriction of the right ventricle. Cardiac arrest developed during pericardiocentesis, resulting in emergency thoracotomy and pericardial drainage. Venoarterial ECMO was subsequently initiated due to refractory cardiogenic shock. Tocilizumab, immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and convalescent plasma were added to supportive care, with progressive recovery of cardiac function and successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. This case highlights the potential role of ECMO, convalescent plasma and immunomodulatory therapies in the management of cardiogenic shock associated with COVID-19 myopericarditis.","Sampaio, Pedro Paulo N.; Ferreira, Roberto M.; de Albuquerque, Felipe N.; Colafranceschi, Alexandre S.; de Almeida, Alexandre C.P.; Nunes, Marcos Alexandre V.; Filho, João Mansur; Lima, Ricardo Antônio C.",Cardiovasc Revasc Med,648,1

We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31–February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4–15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19, 2020. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei.

The current study evaluated the effects of academic career courses offered at two institutions that were specifically designed to increase career awareness, interest, and career-related confidence among doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. Methods: Participants enrolled in a career course at trainees’ respective academic institutions and responded to pre- and post-course surveys (n=32, n=148). The paper offers a thematic analysis of each of the two courses using an individualized learning plan career development framework and describes the results of their respective pretest-posttest evaluations which indicated increases in career readiness. Results: Though the format and content provided in each course varied, participation was associated with increases in career readiness. Participants reported increased career-awareness including a greater familiarity with different types of careers overall. Furthermore, interest in tenure track faculty careers increased in both samples, which may assuage fears that exposure to diverse career pathways could reduce interest in academic careers. Transferrable skills, including career planning and awareness also significantly increased. Course participants reported an increase in the number and type of mentors they interacted with beyond their principal faculty mentor (other faculty, professional PhDs, peers, and administrative staff). Conclusions: Findings provide supporting evidence for the benefits of implementing structured career development efforts during PhD training; even with varying content, delivery methods, and instructor type, both academic career courses led to significant gains in career awareness and readiness. Successful development and delivery of academic career courses, with a focus on career planning skills, suggest that institutions can utilize these and are an effective way to prepare PhDs for their transition from training positions into careers.","Layton, Rebekah L.; Solberg, V.

Metformin (MF) and paracetamol (PA) are of the most consumable drugs worldwide. A portion of natural clay was treated with distilled water, and another part was treated with hydrochloric acid. The water-treated clay (WTC) and the acid-treated clay (ATC) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption isotherm. Batch experiments were employed to investigate the influence of contact time and solution parameters on the adsorption of PA and MF on WTC and ATC. 30 min attained the equilibrium for all sorbent-sorbate systems. Both sorbents fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with a preference to the nonlinear fitting, and the mechanism of adsorption partially fitted the liquid-film diffusion model. The PA and MF adsorption on WTC and ATC fitted the Freundlich model in preference to nonlinear fitting. The adsorption of pollutants on both sorbents was spontaneous, exothermic, and physisorption in nature. Even at low concentrations, both WTC and ATC showed efficiency above 80% in removing PA and MF from tab water, groundwater, and Red seawater. These findings nominated natural clay as an alternative to the costly nanomaterials as sorbents for removing pharmaceutical contaminants from water.","Elamin, Mohamed R.; Abdulkhair, Babiker Y.; Algethami, Faisal K.; Khezami, L.",Sci Rep,648,20

However, these raise the risk of infection, and the drugs may not be effectively metabolized in patients with liver disease. A 61-year old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and antibody-mediated IR who required >800 units of daily insulin presented with acute decompensation of his preexisting cirrhosis from recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis. Laboratory tests confirmed an IA level of >625 μU/mL (reference: <5.0 μU/mL). METHODS: Centrifugal plasmapheresis and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were used to treat the patient to achieve glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring was implemented to monitor glycemic control pre- and posttherapy. Laboratory evaluation included levels of IA, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, salivary cortisol, zinc transporter 8, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kilodalton isoform antibody, and islet-cell antibodies. RESULTS: We initiated MMF followed by 5 sessions of plasmapheresis, leading to an overall 77.3% reduction from pretherapy insulin requirements after 6 months without further episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or infection. The cirrhosis stabilized, and there was an improvement in HbA1C from 8.7% (72 mmol/mol) to 6.6% (49 mmol/mol) and time in euglycemic range from 30% to 61%. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of MMF and centrifugal plasmapheresis use to mitigate the effects of IA-mediated IR in a patient with cirrhosis. We recommend further studies to determine the utility of this treatment to improve care for patients at high risk for IA-mediated IR.","Brooks, Danielle; Grewal, Priya; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne A.; Maximos, Samir; Shah, Nirali A.",AACE Clin Case Rep,648,1

It is especially interesting in metropolitan areas where spread can be very fast, and proper sewage systems are available for sampling with short flow times and thus little decay of the virus. We started in March 2020 to set up a once-a-week qualified spot sampling protocol in six different locations in Munich carefully chosen to contain primarily wastewater of permanent residential areas, rather than industry or hospitals. We used RT-PCR and sequencing to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Munich population with temporo-spatial resolution. The study became fully operational in mid-April 2020 and has been tracking SARS-CoV-2 RNA load weekly for one year. Sequencing of the isolated viral RNA was performed to obtain information about the presence and abundance of variants of concern in the Munich area over time. We demonstrate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads (between <7.5 and 3874/mL) in these different areas within Munich correlates well with official seven day incidence notification data (between 0.0 and 327 per 100,000) obtained from the authorities within the respective region. Wastewater viral loads predicted the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 local incidence about 3 weeks in advance of data based on respiratory swab analyses. Aligning with multiple different point-mutations characteristic for certain variants of concern, we could demonstrate the gradual increase of variant of concern B.1.1.7 in the Munich population beginning in January 2021, weeks before it became apparent in sequencing results of swabs samples taken from patients living in Munich. Overall, the study highlights the potential of WBE to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, including the introduction of variants of concern in a local population.","Rubio-Acero, Raquel; Beyerl, Jessica; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Roth, Marc Sancho; Castelletti, Noemi; Paunovic, Ivana; Radon, Katja; Springer, Bernd; Nagel, Christian; Boehm, Bernhard; Böhmer, Merle M.; Graf, Alexander; Blum, Helmut; Krebs, Stefan; Keppler, Oliver T.; Osterman, Andreas; Khan, Zohaib Nisar; Hölscher, Michael; Wieser, Andreas; Emad, Alamoudi; Jared, Anderson; Abhishek, Bakuli; Maxilmilian, Baumann; Marc, Becker; Franziska, Bednarzki; Olimbek, Bemirayev; Jessica, Beyerl; Patrick, Bitzer; Rebecca, Böhnlein; Isabel, Brand; Jan, Bruger; Friedrich, Caroli; Noemi, Castelletti; Josephine, Coleman; Lorenzo, Contento; Alina, Czwienzek; Flora, Deák; Diefenbach Maximilian, N.; Jana, Diekmannshemke; Gerhard, Dobler; Jürgen, Durner; Ute, Eberle; Judith, Eckstein; Tabea, Eser; Philine, Falk; Manuela, Feyereisen; Volker, Fingerle; Felix, Forster; Turid, Frahnow; Jonathan, Frese; Günter, Fröschl; Christiane, Fuchs; Mercè, Garí; Otto, Geisenberger; Christof, Geldmacher; Leonard, Gilberg; Kristina, Gillig; Philipp, Girl; Elias, Golschan; Michelle, Guggenbuehl Noller Jessica; Maria, Guglielmini Elena; Pablo, Gutierrez; Anslem, Haderer; Marlene, Hannes; Lena, Hartinger; Jan, Hasenauer; Alejandra, Hernandez; Leah, Hillari; Christian, Hinske; Tim, Hofberger; Michael, Hölscher; Sacha, Horn; Kristina, Huber; Christian, Janke; Ursula, Kappl; Antonia, Keßler; Zohaib, Khan; Johanna, Kresin; Inge, Kroidl; Arne, Kroidl; Magdalena, Lang; Clemens, Lang; Silvan, Lange; Michael, Laxy; Ronan, Le Gleut; Reiner, Leidl; Leopold, Liedl; Xhovana, Lucaj; Fabian, Luppa; Sophie, Nafziger Alexandra; Petra, Mang; Alisa, Markgraf; Rebecca, Mayrhofer; Dafni, Metaxa; Hannah, Müller; Katharina, Müller; Laura, Olbrich; Ivana, Paunovic; Michael, Plank; Claire, Pleimelding; Michel, Pletschette; Michael, Pritsch; Stephan, Prückner; Kerstin, Puchinger; Peter, Pütz; Katja, Radon; Elba, Raimundéz; Jakob, Reich; Friedrich, Riess; Camilla, Rothe; Raquel, Rubio-Acero; Viktoria, Ruci; Elmar, Saathoff; Nicole, Schäfer; Yannik, Schälte; Benedikt, Schluse; Lara, Schneider; Mirjam, Schunk; Lars, Schwettmann; Alba, Soler; Peter, Sothmann; Kathrin, Strobl; Jeni, Tang; Fabian, Theis; Verena, Thiel; Sophie, Thiesbrummel; Vincent, Vollmayr; Emilia, Von Lovenberg; Jonathan, Von Lovenberg; Julia, Waibel; Claudia, Wallrauch; Andreas, Wieser; Simon, Winter; Roman, Wölfel; Julia, Wolff; Tobias, Würfel; Sabine, Zange; Eleftheria, Zeggini; Anna, Zielke; Thorbjörn, Zimmer",Sci Total Environ,648,12

Study design Observational study with quantitative analyses. Method Data were obtained from Malta’s COVID dashboard, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and Maltese newspapers. The case-fatality ratio (CFR) and Years of Life Lost (YLLs) for COVID were calculated. Comparisons were made between COVID-19 mortality and YLL to the pre-COVID leading mortality causes. Comparative observations were made between positive and mortality cases stratified by age groups in relation to the cumulative vaccination doses. Results The elderly were cocooned during the first wave (CFR 0.98) through the Vulnerable Act, with only 10.80% of positive cases and 7 out 9 deaths above 65 years. The Vulnerable Act was not reinstated again, with 13.68% of positive cases and 91.34% (n=369) of deaths above 65 years during the second wave (CRF 1.39). The elderly were given priority in COVID vaccination rollout leading to an inverse relationship between positive cases/mortality and vaccination coverage.

We aimed to review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcomes in these patients. METHODS: We performed meta-analysis using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. A fixed- or random-effects model was used for calculating heterogeneity. We used contour-enhanced funnel plot and Egger’s tests to assess potential publication bias. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included. The proportion of males was lower in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.61, 0.94]). The proportion of respiratory diseases was significantly lower in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group (OR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.29, 0.60]). The proportion of patients with fever, cough, and dyspnea was significantly lower in the survivor group (fever: OR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.31, 0.92]; cough: OR = 0.50, 95% CI [0.38, 0.65]; dyspnea: OR = 0.25, 95% CI [0.14, 0.47]) than in the non-survivor group. Compared with the non-survivor group, the survivor group had higher albumin and platelet levels and lower leucocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS: Male patients might have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Comorbidities, such as respiratory diseases could also greatly influence the clinical prognosis of COVID-19. Clinical features, such as fever, dyspnea, cough, and abnormal platelet, leucocyte, and albumin levels, could imply eventual death. Our findings will help clinicians identify markers for the detection of high mortality risk in HD patients at an early stage of COVID-19.","Wang, Fengping; Ao, Guangyu; Wang, Yushu; Liu, Fuqiang; Bao, Mulong; Gao, Ming; Zhou, Shulu; Qi, Xin",Renal failure,648,1

The aim of this study is to characterize the extent of MS patients’ perceptions of risk and adherence to care during the pandemic. METHODS: : A survey was emailed to patients from a large MS center in New York City during the local peak of the pandemic to assess perceptions of infection risk and adherence to MS care including appointments, laboratory studies, MRIs, and taking disease-modifying therapies (DMT). RESULTS: : 529 patients from the MS center responded to the survey during two weeks in April 2020. Patients collectively showed concern about becoming infected with COVID-19 (88%) and perceived a higher infection risk due of having MS (70%) and taking DMTs (68%). Patients frequently postponed appointments (41%), laboratory studies (46%), and MRIs (41%). Noncompliance with DMTs was less common (13%). Decisions to alter usual recommendations for care were made by the patient more often than by the provider regarding adherence to appointments (68%), laboratory studies (70%), MRI (67%), and DMT (65%). Degree of concern for infection was associated with adherence to appointments (p=0.020) and laboratory studies (p=0.016) but not with adherence to MRI and DMTs.

However, the current detection technologies are far from ideal. A lack of timely and accessible testing for identifying cases and close contacts has allowed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), the causative virus of the ongoing coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, to spread uncontrollably. The slow and expensive detection of mutations—predictors for chronic diseases such as cancer—form a barrier to personalized treatment. A recently developed diagnostic assay is ideal and field‐ready—it relies on CRISPR‐Cas13. CRISPR‐Cas13 works similarly to other CRISPR systems: Cas13 is guided by a crRNA to cleave next to a specific RNA target sequence. Additionally, Cas13 boasts a unique collateral cleavage activity; collateral cleavage of a fluorescent reporter detects the presence of the target sequence in sample RNA. This system forms the basis of CRISPR‐Cas13 diagnostic assays. CRISPR‐Cas13 assays have >95% sensitivity and >99% specificity. Detection is rapid (<2 h), inexpensive ($0.05 per test), and portable—a test using lateral flow strips is akin to a pregnancy test. The recent adaptation of micro‐well chips facilitates high‐level multiplexing and is high‐throughput. In this review, we cover the development of CRISPR‐Cas13 assays for medical diagnosis, discuss the advantages of CRISPR‐Cas13‐based diagnosis over the traditional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), and present examples of detection from real patient samples.","Shihong Gao, David; Zhu, Xiaodong; Lu, Binfeng",J Med Virol,648,16

As the two fields share many of the same goals, arguments have been made for a rapprochement between the two. Drawing inspiration from a historical debate between the scholars John Dewey and Walter Lippmann, the present article is a case-oriented theoretical contribution applying models from science education and science communication in relation to a current socio-scientific issue (SSI), the COVID-19 pandemic. The main question of interest is how selected didactic (didaktik) models from science education and science communication can contribute to shed light on the present situation of an ongoing pandemic specifically and socio-scientific issues in general. Three models are synthesised to give a new composite model that may help communicators and educators understand, discuss, and analyse complex socio-scientific issues. The model is subsequently applied on the apparently contradictory issue of Norwegian and Swedish governments’ very different responses to the pandemic, despite grounding their decisions on largely the same scientific evidence and advice. Contrast is made by comparison with another SSI, anthropogenic global warming (AGW). It is argued that the exchange and combination of didactic models from the two fields may open new spaces for cross-pollination and cross-fertilisation to the mutual benefit of both science education and science communication.","Fooladi, Erik C.",Sci Educ (Dordr),648,16

How obesity impacts the secretion of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients, however, is not understood. The serum of adult COVID-19 patients contains autoimmune antibodies generated in response to virus-induced tissue damage and cell death leading to the release of intracellular antigens not known to be immunogenic autoantigens. The objective of this study is to evaluate the presence of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients with obesity. Subjects/Methods: Thirty serum samples from individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR were collected from inpatient and outpatient settings. Of these, 15 were lean (BMI<25), and 15 were obese (BMI [≥]30). Control serum samples were from 30 uninfected individuals, age- gender- and BMI-matched, recruited before the current pandemic. Serum IgG antibodies against two autoimmune specificities, as well as against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, were measured by ELISA. IgG autoimmune antibodies were specific for malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and for adipocyte-derived protein antigens (AD), markers of virus-induced cell death in the obese AT. Results: Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces anti-MDA and anti-AD autoimmune antibodies more in lean than in obese patients as compared to uninfected controls. Serum levels of these autoimmune antibodies, however, are always higher in obese versus lean COVID-19 patients. Moreover, because the autoimmune antibodies found in serum samples of COVID-19 patients have been correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a general marker of inflammation, we also evaluated the association of anti-MDA and anti-AT antibodies with serum CRP and found a significant association between CRP and autoimmune antibodies in our cohort of lean and obese COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the quality of the antibody response in COVID-19 patients with obesity, particularly the presence of autoimmune antibodies, and identify biomarkers of self-tolerance breakdown. This is crucial to protect this vulnerable population that is at higher risk of responding poorly to infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to lean controls.","Frasca, D.; Reidy, L.; Romero, M.; Diaz, A.; Cray, C.; Kahl, K.; Blomberg, B.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,648,16

Viral suppression did not significantly differ between HIV+ partnered (78.5% virally suppressed) and unpartnered (76.0% virally suppressed) individuals. Among individuals in partnerships, viral suppression was significantly associated with having a partner who attended monthly clinic visits (AOR 2.99; 95% CI 1.00–8.93). Instrumental social support—attending monthly visits—may improve the odds of viral suppression among HIV+ individuals in serodiscordant relationships.

Considerable evidence established that the immuno-endocrine balance could deeply influence the experimental T. cruzi progression inside the host’s body. A high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring approach (MRMHR) was used to study the influence of melatonin on adrenal and plasma steroidal hormones profile of T. cruzi infected Wistar rats. Young (5 weeks) and middle-aged (18 months) male Wistar rats received melatonin (5 mg/Kg, orally) during the acute Chagas disease. Corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC), cortisol, cortisone, aldosterone, progesterone and melatonin concentration were evaluated. Interleukin-1 alpha and β (IL-1α and β), IL-6 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) were also analyzed. Our results revealed an increased production of corticosterone, cortisone, cortisol and aldosterone in middle-aged control animals, thus confirming the aging effects on the steroidal hormone profile. Serum melatonin levels were reduced with age and predominantly higher in young and middle-aged infected rats. Melatonin treatment reduced the corticosterone, 11-DHC, cortisol, cortisone, aldosterone and progesterone in response to T. cruzi infection. Decreased IL-1 α and β concentrations were also found in melatonin treated middle-aged infected animals. Melatonin treated middle-aged control rats displayed reduced concentrations of TGF-β. Melatonin levels were significantly higher in all middle-aged rats treated animals. Reduced percentages of early and late thymocyte apoptosis was found for young and middle-aged melatonin supplemented rats. Finally, our results show a link between the therapeutic and biological effects of melatonin controlling steroidal hormones pathways as well as inflammatory mediators.","Brazão, Vânia; Santello, Fabricia Helena; Colato, Rafaela Pravato; Duarte, Andressa; Goulart, Amanda; Sampaio, Pedro Alexandre; Nardini, Viviani; Sorgi, Carlos Arterio; Faccioli, Lúcia Helena; do Prado, José Clóvis",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,648,21

Main outcomes assessed: cognitive function [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)], disease severity [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)], clinician-assessed improvement and safety. Mean MoCA score increased from 24.2 points (baseline) to 29.7 points (month 6), placing most subjects within the cognitively normal range (≥26 points). Compared with baseline, MoCA and DSST scores were significantly improved at months 1, 3 and 6 (P < 0.001 for all). Global CDR scores significantly improved from baseline to month 6 (mean change −0.37 points; P < 0.001), representing an improvement from very mild impairment (0.50 points) to cognitively normal status (0.13 points), mainly in CDR memory scores.

A lack of permissive cell lines has limited investigations into WU virus pathogenesis and prevalence. METHODS: The encoding region of the capsid protein VP2 gene was amplified from a WU virus DNA-positive clinical specimen and expressed as a recombinant Histagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed VP2 was identified by expected molecular weight and immunoreactivity with anti-His monoclonal antibody in Western blotting assay. Serum samples collected from 455 individuals of all ages in Beijing without symptoms of ARI were tested for IgG antibodies against the affinity-purified recombinant VP2 protein by Western blotting to investigate the prevalence of natural WU virus infection. In addition, serum samples from four ARI pediatric patients, whose nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WU virus DNA and negative for all other respiratory-related viruses, were tested for IgM antibody against the recombinant VP2. RESULTS: Of the 455 serum samples, 238 reacted with the recombinant VP2, yielding an overall positive rate of 52.3% for IgG against VP2 of WU virus. The positive rate was the highest in serum samples from infants and children between 1 to 4 years of age. One of four ARI pediatric patients was positive for IgM against WU virus VP2, implicating WU virus as the causative disease agent. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of IgG against WU polyomavirus in Beijing-based study population indicates that WU virus infection is common in Beijing. WU virus may be responsible for some pediatric ARI cases, and primary infection of this virus may occur mostly in childhood.","Zhang, Ni-Na; Zhao, Lin-Qing; Qian, Yuan; Zhu, Ru-Nan; Deng, Jie; Wang, Fang; Sun, Yu; Liu, Li-Ying",World J Pediatr,648,5

How neutralization relates to the binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here, we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA, ELISA, and neutralization assays, we observed a strong correlation between these parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of pseudoviral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","Ding, Shilei; Laumaea, Annemarie; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Gasser, Romain; Medjahed, Halima; Pancera, Marie; Stamatatos, Leonidas; McGuire, Andrew T.; Bazin, Renée; Finzi, Andrés",Viruses,648,20

Although nanobodies can be delivered as proteins, in vivo expression from adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors represents an attractive strategy. This is due to the fact that AAV vectors, that can provide long-term expression of recombinant genes, have shown an excellent safety profile, and can accommodate genes for one or several nanobodies. In fact, several studies showed that AAV vectors can provide sustained nanobody expression both locally or systemically in preclinical models of human diseases. Some of the pathologies addressed with this technology include cancer, neurological, cardiovascular, infectious, and genetic diseases. Depending on the indication, AAV-delivered nanobodies can be expressed extracellularly or inside cells. Intracellular nanobodies or “intrabodies” carry out their function by interacting with cell proteins involved in disease and have also been designed to help elucidate cellular mechanisms by interfering with normal cell processes. Finally, nanobodies can also be used to retarget AAV vectors, when tethered to viral capsid proteins. This review covers applications in which AAV vectors have been used to deliver nanobodies, with a focus on their therapeutic use.","Silva-Pilipich, Noelia; Smerdou, Cristian; Vanrell, Lucía",Microorganisms,648,12

To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and FDA authorized for emergency, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this “first wave” and suggest that the notion of “herd immunity” at rates of ~60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making.","Jin, Daniel K.; Nesbitt, Daniel J.; Yang, Jenny; Chen, Haidee; Horowitz, Julie; Jones, Marcus; Vandergaast, Rianna; Carey, Timothy; Reiter, Samantha; Russell, Stephen J.; Kyratsous, Christos; Hooper, Andrea; Hamilton, Jennifer; Ferreira, Manuel; Deng, Sarah; Straus, Donna; Baras, Aris; Hillyer, Christopher D.; Luchsinger, Larry L.",PLoS One,648,17

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir antiviral treatment in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. After registration with INPLASY, a search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Library, WanFang Data, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) and other databases for all relevant literature on lopinavir/ritonavir treatment of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.

A total of 18 eligible studies (including randomized controlled studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies) were retrieved and included with a total of 2273 patients. The lopinavir/ritonavir group exhibited an increased nucleic acid conversion rate (P=0.004), higher virus clearance rate (P<0.0001), lower mortality rate (P=0.002), and reduced incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (P=0.02) compared with the control group. No significant benefit in the improvement rate of chest CT (P=0.08) or incidence of adverse events (P=0.45) was noted. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had a lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (P=0.02).

The efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of patients with SARS, MERS and COVID-19 was significantly better than that of the control. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events did not significantly increase. Lopinavir/ritonavir is effective in the treatment of COVID-19, and this combination should be further assessed in RCT studies. In addition, when we analyzed the differences in age and sex, we found that the differences were statistically significant in the safety and effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19, and both of these factors played a significant role in the trial.","Wu, Liusheng; Zheng, Yuzhen; Liu, Jixian; Luo, Ruixing; Wu, Dingwang; Xu, Pengcheng; Wu, Da; Li, Xiaoqiang",Aging (Albany NY),648,20

Results The main initial CT features were as follows: bilateral distribution (112/126, 88.9%), diffuse distribution (106/126, 84.1%), multiple lesions (117/126, 92.9%), nodular shapes (84/126, 66.7%), patchy shapes (98/126, 77.8%), pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) (95/126, 75.4%), “vascular thickening sign” (98/126, 77.8%), “air bronchogram sign” (70/126, 55.6%), “crazy paving pattern” (93/126, 73.8%), and “pleura parallel sign” (72/126, 57.1%). The main dynamic evolution characteristics were as follows: ① Imaging findings of the progression process: the main CT changes were increased GGOs with consolidation (118/126, 93.7%), an increased “crazy paving pattern” (104/126, 82.5%), an increased “vascular thickening sign” (105/126, 83.3%), and an increased “air bronchogram sign” (95/126, 75.4%); ② Imaging findings of the absorption process: the main CT changes were the obvious absorption of consolidation displayed as inhomogeneous partial GGOs with fibrosis shadows, the occurrence of a “fishing net on trees sign” (45/126, 35.7%), an increased “fibrosis sign” (40/126, 31.7%), an increased “subpleural line sign” (35/126, 27.8%), a decreased “crazy paving pattern” (19.8%), and a decreased “vascular thickening sign” (23.8%); and ③ In the stage of discharge, the main CT manifestations were further absorption of GGOs, consolidation and fibrosis shadows in the lung, and no appearance of new lesions, with only a small amount of shadow with fibrotic streaks and reticulations remaining in some cases (16/126, 12.7%). Conclusion The initial CT features and dynamic evolution of early-stage patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics and regularity; CT of the chest is critical for early detection, evaluation of disease severity and follow-up of patients.","Wang, Chuanbin; Shi, Bin; Wei, Chao; Ding, Huaming; GU, Jinfeng; Dong, Jiangning",Radiol Infect Dis,648,16

We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, COVID-19 research database, Epistemonikos, EPPI-Centre, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Scopus and Web of Science databases for studies where a non-contact infrared device was used to detect fever against a reference standard of conventional thermometers. Forest plots and Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves were used to describe the pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. From a total of 1063 results, 30 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, of which 19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.808 (95%CI 0.656-0.903) and 0.920 (95%CI 0.769-0.975), respectively, for the NCITs (using forehead as the site of measurement), and 0.818 (95%CI 0.758-0.866) and 0.923 (95%CI 0.823-0.969), respectively, for thermal scanners. The sensitivity of NCITs increased on use of rectal temperature as the reference. The sensitivity of thermal scanners decreased in a disease outbreak/pandemic setting. Changes approaching statistical significance were also observed on the exclusion of neonates from the analysis. Thermal screening had a low positive predictive value, especially at the initial stage of an outbreak, while the negative predictive value (NPV) continued to be high even at later stages. Thermal screening has reasonable diagnostic accuracy in the detection of fever, although it may vary with changes in subject characteristics, setting, index test, and the reference standard used. Thermal screening has a good NPV even during a pandemic. The policymakers must take into consideration the factors surrounding the screening strategy while forming ad-hoc guidelines.","Aggarwal, Nishant; Garg, Mohil; Dwarakanathan, Vignesh; Gautam, Nitesh; Kumar, Swasthi S; Jadon, Ranveer Singh; Gupta, Mohak; Ray, Animesh",J Travel Med,648,29

However, no clinical research has investigated their relevance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the guidance applied for the prevention of the COVID-19 epidemic between the LTCFs having been contaminated by COVID-19 and LTCFs having not been contaminated. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent and systematically accompanied by phone call to the 132 LTCFs of Haute-Garonne (Occitania region, South-West of France). The questionnaire focused on the preventive measures implemented before March 23, 2020 (first LTCFs contaminated in this area). The questionnaire focused on physician support, implementation of usual guidance (eg, masks, hydro-alcoholic solute used), training on hygiene, containment in residents’ rooms and other distancing measures, use of temporary workers, compartmentalization within zones of residents and staff and a self-assessment analogic scale on the quality of the application of the preventive measures. We compared implementation of the guidance between the LTCFs with at least one case of COVID-19 among residents and/or health care professionals and LTCFs without COVID-19 case (between March 23rd and May 6th). RESULTS: 124 LTCFs participated (93.9%). 30 LTCFs (24.19%) were contaminated with COVID-19. Large heterogeneity of the application of the guidance was observed. Public LTCFs (OR= 0.39 (0.20–0.73), LTCFs which organized staff compartmentalization within zones (OR= 0.19 (0.07–0.48)), and LTCF with a staff who self-assessed a higher quality implementation of the preventive measures (OR= 0.65 (0.43–0.98)) were significantly more likely to avoid contamination by the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the relevance of guidance to prevent the entry of COVID-19, in particular the staff compartmentalization within zones, as well as the perception of the staff regarding the quality of implementation of those measures in LTCFs.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the similarities and differences in clinical features between COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in US children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included children who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 25 and May 15, 2020, and children diagnosed with seasonal influenza between October 1, 2019, and June 6, 2020, at Children’s National Hospital in the District of Columbia. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 or influenza A or B. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilator use and the association between underlying medical conditions, clinical symptoms, and COVID-19 vs seasonal influenza. RESULTS: The study included 315 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (164 [52%] male; median age, 8.3 years [range, 0.03-35.6 years]) and 1402 patients diagnosed with seasonal influenza (743 [53%] male; median age, 3.9 years [range, 0.04-40.4 years]). Patients with COVID-19 and those with seasonal influenza had a similar hospitalization rate (54 [17%] vs 291 [21%], P = .15), intensive care unit admission rate (18 [6%] vs 98 [7%], P = .42), and use of mechanical ventilators (10 [3%] vs 27 [2%], P = .17).

The role of micronutrient status and metabolic health emerge as pivotal in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the immune system’s response. Metabolic disruption, proceeding from modifiable factors, has been proposed as a significant risk factor, accounting for infection susceptibility, disease severity and risk for post-COVID complications. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study and quantification of intermediates and products of metabolism, is a rapidly evolving field and a novel tool in biomarker discovery. In this article, we propose that leveraging insulin resistance biomarkers, along with biomarkers of micronutrient deficiencies, will allow for a diagnostic window and provide functional therapeutic targets. Specifically, metabolomics can be applied as: a. At-home test to assess the risk of infection and propose nutritional support, b. A screening tool for high-risk COVID-19 patients to develop serious illness during hospital admission and prioritize medical support, c(i). A tool to match nutritional support with specific nutrient requirements for mildly ill patients to reduce the risk for hospitalization, and c(ii). for critically ill patients to reduce recovery time and risk of post-COVID complications, d. At-home test to monitor metabolic health and reduce post-COVID symptomatology. Metabolic rewiring offers potential virtues towards disease prevention, dissection of high-risk patients, taking actionable therapeutic measures, as well as shielding against post-COVID syndrome.","Tsoukalas, Dimitris; Sarandi, Evangelia; Georgaki, Spyridoula",Clin Nutr ESPEN,648,1

Yet, there is limited data on vaccine perceptions in the disability community. OBJECTIVE: To explore COVID-19 vaccine perceptions in individuals with IDD, their family members, and those who work with them, to inform a statewide vaccine information and messaging project. METHODS: A national survey, adapted in five languages for the IDD community, was distributed to a convenience sample of IDD organizations throughout New York State. Constructs included vaccine intention, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and trusted sources of vaccine information. Zip code data were used to map respondent location and vaccine preferences. RESULTS: Of n = 825 respondents, approximately 75% intended to or had received the vaccine across roles (i.e., people with developmental disabilities, family members, direct care workers) and racial/ethnic groups. Greater vaccine hesitancy was reported in younger individuals and those making decisions on behalf of a person with IDD. Concerns included side effects and the swiftness of vaccine development. Black and Hispanic participants had heightened concerns about being an “experiment” for the vaccine. Trusted sources of information included healthcare providers and family members. Respondents who intended to/received the vaccine were dispersed throughout the state. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine preferences in this New York State disability community sample align with national data. Identified concerns suggest the need for community education that addresses misperceptions. Age and race differences in perspectives highlight the need for tailored education, delivered by trusted messengers.","Iadarola, Suzannah; Siegel, Joanne F.; Gao, Qi; McGrath, Kathleen; Bonuck, Karen A.",Disabil Health J,648,1

In my commentary I move to another direction and suggest that psychology does not need more solid foundations, but rather foundations characterized by reflective stance towards its phenomena, theories, methods and data production processes. I suggest that this kind of stance would be in accordance with the process ontological perspective that allows focusing on meaningful human experience as central object of study for psychology, together with an idiographic approach to research. I thus suggest that psychology will endure only by turning its reflective gaze towards oneself, by thinking about its past, imagining its future and constructing novelty from the creative assemblage of the two.","Märtsin, Mariann",Integr Psychol Behav Sci,648,1

Here we compared the inflammatory and cardiovascular disease‐related protein cargo of circulating large and small extracellular vesicles (EVs) from 84 hospitalized patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 with different stages of disease severity. Our findings reveal significant enrichment of proinflammatory, procoagulation, immunoregulatory and tissue‐remodelling protein signatures in EVs, which remarkably distinguished symptomatic COVID‐19 patients from uninfected controls with matched comorbidities and delineated those with moderate disease from those who were critically ill. Specifically, EN‐RAGE, followed by TF and IL‐18R1, showed the strongest correlation with disease severity and length of hospitalization. Importantly, EVs from COVID‐19 patients induced apoptosis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in the order of disease severity. In conclusion, our findings support a role for EVs in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 disease and underpin the development of EV‐based approaches to predicting disease severity, determining need for patient hospitalization and identifying new therapeutic targets.","Krishnamachary, Balaji; Cook, Christine; Kumar, Ashok; Spikes, Leslie; Chalise, Prabhakar; Dhillon, Navneet K.",J Extracell Vesicles,648,24

Method: A postal survey was sent in June 2020 to 859 participants from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), an ongoing longitudinal study. The survey was developed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related infection-control measures on daily life, specifically commitment to distancing measures, access to health care and social services, daily activities, and changes in cognitive and social activities. Results: By September 2020, 613 (71%) participants responded (mean age = 77.7 years, 32% lived alone, and 80% had at least one chronic condition). Three quarters adopted some distancing practices during the first months of the pandemic. Older participants were more likely to practice total isolation than younger ones (29 vs. 19%; p = 0.003). Non-acute health-care visits were canceled for 5% of the participants who needed appointments, but cancellations in dental health care (43%), home aid (30%), and rehabilitative services (53%) were more common. Pandemic-related changes were reported in social engagements, for example, less contact with friends (55%) and family (31%), or less frequent attendance in cultural events (38%) or associations (25%), although remote contact with others increased for 40%. Feelings of loneliness increased for 21%, particularly those who were older (p = 0.023) or living alone (p < 0.001). Physical activity reduced for 34%, but dietary habits remained stable or improved. Pandemic-related changes in lifestyle and activities were more evident among those living alone. Conclusions: Finnish older persons generally reported less negative changes in lifestyles and behaviors during the pandemic than expected. Older people and those living alone seemed more susceptible to negative changes. It is important to compare how coping strategies may compare with other European countries to identify factors that may help older individuals to maintain healthy lifestyles during future waves of COVID-19.","Lehtisalo, Jenni; Palmer, Katie; Mangialasche, Francesca; Solomon, Alina; Kivipelto, Miia; Ngandu, Tiia",Front Psychiatry,648,16

Understanding difficulties during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 can help improve waste recycling in the post-pandemic period in Brazil and other developing nations that face similar issues. The current pandemic exposed the deficiencies of this system, and some important lessons can be learned. Recommendations are drawn to advance the proper management of recyclables in the country. The Government must increase total investments in the recycling industry's infrastructure and support local recycling initiatives during a public health crisis and beyond. In sum, this paper strengthens the idea that waste segregation at the source and selective collection will not be sufficient without massive investments in the recycling sector’s infrastructure.

Serodiagnostics performed in the lateral flow immunoassay format (immunochromatography) meet the modern requirements for point-of-care testing and are supported by existing technologies of large-scale diagnostic tests production, thus increasing the amount of attention in a tense epidemiological situation. For traditional lateral flow serodiagnostics formats, a large number of nonspecific immunoglobulins in the sample significantly reduces the degree of detectable binding. To overcome these limitations, an assay based on the formation of immobilized antigen-specific antibody-labeled antigen complexes detection was proposed. However, the requirements for its implementation, providing maximum sensitivity, have not been established. This article describes the mathematical model for the above assay. The influence of the ratio of reagent concentrations on the analysis results is considered. It is noted that the formation of specific antibody complexes with several labeled antigens is the main limiting factor in reducing the detection limit, and methods are proposed to minimize this factor. Recommendations for the choice of the assay conditions, following from the analysis of the model, are confirmed experimentally.","Sotnikov, Dmitriy V.; Zherdev, Anatoly V.; Dzantiev, Boris B.",Sensors (Basel),648,26

The degree to which achieving IHR compliance will result in global health security is not clear, but what is clear is that progress against the threat of epidemic disease requires a focused approach that can be monitored and measured efficiently. We developed concrete goals and metrics for 4 of the 8 core capacities with other US government partners in consultation with WHO and national collaborators worldwide. The intent is to offer an example of an approach to implementing and monitoring IHR for consideration or adaptation by countries that complements other frameworks and goals of IHR. Without concrete metrics, IHR may waste its considerable promise as an instrument for global health security against public health emergencies.","Ijaz, Kashef; Kasowski, Eric; Arthur, Ray R.; Angulo, Frederick J.; Dowell, Scott F.",Emerg Infect Dis,648,20
