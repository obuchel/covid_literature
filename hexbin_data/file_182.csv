429,429,429,The role of infections in the pathogenesis and course of multiple sclerosis,14.238327,8.844878,2010,"Interplay between susceptibility genes and environmental factors is considered important player in the genesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Among environmental factors, a role for an infectious pathogen has long been considered central to the disease process. This opinion has support both from epidemiological data and the findings of immunological abnormalities in spinal fluid that reflect an immune response to an as yet undetermined antigen, possibly a pathogen, in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our review will outline the current understanding of the role of infection in the causation and progression of MS. We will review the data that point to an infectious cause of MS and consider the specific agents Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, Human Herpes Virus 6, and Epstein-Barr Virus, that are implicated in either the development or progression of MS.","Pawate, Siddharama; Sriram, Subramaniam",Ann Indian Acad Neurol,182,1
601,601,601,Equal Graph Partitioning on Estimated Infection Network as an Effective Epidemic Mitigation Measure,14.076783,8.546002,2011-07-22,"Controlling severe outbreaks remains the most important problem in infectious disease area. With time, this problem will only become more severe as population density in urban centers grows. Social interactions play a very important role in determining how infectious diseases spread, and organization of people along social lines gives rise to non-spatial networks in which the infections spread. Infection networks are different for diseases with different transmission modes, but are likely to be identical or highly similar for diseases that spread the same way. Hence, infection networks estimated from common infections can be useful to contain epidemics of a more severe disease with the same transmission mode. Here we present a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the effectiveness of epidemic mitigation based on such estimated infection networks. We first generate artificial social networks of different sizes and average degrees, but with roughly the same clustering characteristic. We then start SIR epidemics on these networks, censor the simulated incidences, and use them to reconstruct the infection network. We then efficiently fragment the estimated network by removing the smallest number of nodes identified by a graph partitioning algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this targeted strategy, by comparing it against traditional untargeted strategies, in slowing down and reducing the size of advancing epidemics.","Hadidjojo, Jeremy; Cheong, Siew Ann",PLoS One,182,1
708,708,708,Two Birds with One Stone? Possible Dual-Targeting H1N1 Inhibitors from Traditional Chinese Medicine,14.395588,8.618114,2011-12-22,"The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 has claimed over 18,000 lives. During this pandemic, development of drug resistance further complicated efforts to control and treat the widespread illness. This research utilizes traditional Chinese medicine Database@Taiwan (TCM Database@Taiwan) to screen for compounds that simultaneously target H1 and N1 to overcome current difficulties with virus mutations. The top three candidates were de novo derivatives of xylopine and rosmaricine. Bioactivity of the de novo derivatives against N1 were validated by multiple machine learning prediction models. Ability of the de novo compounds to maintain CoMFA/CoMSIA contour and form key interactions implied bioactivity within H1 as well. Addition of a pyridinium fragment was critical to form stable interactions in H1 and N1 as supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Results from MD, hydrophobic interactions, and torsion angles are consistent and support the findings of docking. Multiple anchors and lack of binding to residues prone to mutation suggest that the TCM de novo derivatives may be resistant to drug resistance and are advantageous over conventional H1N1 treatments such as oseltamivir. These results suggest that the TCM de novo derivatives may be suitable candidates of dual-targeting drugs for influenza.","Chang, Su-Sen; Huang, Hung-Jin; Chen, Calvin Yu-Chian",PLoS Comput Biol,182,19
1296,1296,1296,Spironolactone Attenuates Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Injury Partially via Modulating Mononuclear Phagocyte Phenotype Switching in Circulating and Alveolar Compartments,14.315773,8.625527,2013-11-19,"BACKGROUND: Recent experimental studies provide evidence indicating that manipulation of the mononuclear phagocyte phenotype could be a feasible approach to alter the severity and persistence of pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has been reported as a target to regulate macrophage polarization. The present work was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential of MR antagonism in bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We first demonstrated the expression of MR in magnetic bead-purified Ly6G-/CD11b+ circulating monocytes and in alveolar macrophages harvested in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from C57BL/6 mice. Then, a pharmacological intervention study using spironolactone (20mg/kg/day by oral gavage) revealed that MR antagonism led to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine production (downregulated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor β1, and interleukin-1β at mRNA and protein levels) and collagen deposition (decreased lung total hydroxyproline content and collagen positive area by Masson’ trichrome staining) in bleomycin treated (2.5mg/kg, via oropharyngeal instillation) male C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, serial flow cytometry analysis in blood, BALF and enzymatically digested lung tissue, revealed that spironolactone could partially inhibit bleomycin-induced circulating Ly6C(hi) monocyte expansion, and reduce alternative activation (F4/80+CD11c+CD206+) of mononuclear phagocyte in alveoli, whereas the phenotype of interstitial macrophage (F4/80+CD11c-) remained unaffected by spironolactone during investigation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present work provides the experimental evidence that spironolactone could attenuate bleomycin-induced acute pulmonary injury and fibrosis, partially via inhibition of MR-mediated circulating monocyte and alveolar macrophage phenotype switching.","Ji, Wen-Jie; Ma, Yong-Qiang; Zhou, Xin; Zhang, Yi-Dan; Lu, Rui-Yi; Guo, Zhao-Zeng; Sun, Hai-Ying; Hu, Dao-Chuan; Yang, Guo-Hong; Li, Yu-Ming; Wei, Lu-Qing",PLoS One,182,1

The pathogenesis of PH is complex and multifactorial, involving a dysregulated autonomic nervous system and immune response. Inflammatory mechanisms have been linked to the development and progression of PH; however, these are usually restricted to systemic and/or local lung tissue. Inflammation within the CNS, often referred to as neuroinflammation involves activation of the microglia, the innate immune cells that are found specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Microglial activation results in the release of several cytokines and chemokines that trigger neuroinflammation, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. In this review, we introduce the concept of neuroinflammation in the context of PH, and discuss possible strategies that could be developed for PH therapy based on this concept.","Hilzendeger, Aline M.; Shenoy, Vinayak; Raizada, Mohan K.; Katovich, Michael J.",Curr Hypertens Rep,182,1

HIV-induced systemic and localized inflammation is considered to be one of the mechanisms of HAND. The levels of cytokines in CSF were associated with neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection. However, the changes of cytokines involved in cognition impairment in plasma have not been shown, and their relationships between CSF and plasma require to be addressed. We compared cytokine levels in paired CSF and plasma samples from HIV-infected individuals with or without neurocognitive impairment. Cytokine concentrations were measured by Luminex xMAP. In comparing the expression levels of cytokines in plasma and CSF, IFN-α2, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 were significantly higher in CSF. Eotaxin was significantly higher in plasma, whereas G-CSF showed no difference between plasma and CSF. G-CSF (P = 0.0079), IL-8 (P = 0.0223), IP-10 (P = 0.0109), and MCP-1 (P = 0.0497) in CSF showed significant difference between HIV-CI and HIV-NC group, which may indicate their relationship to HIV associated neurocognitive impairment. In addition, G-CSF (P = 0.0191) and IP-10 (P = 0.0377) in plasma were significantly higher in HIV-CI than HIV-NC. The consistent changes of G-CSF and IP-10 in paired plasma and CSF samples might enhance their potential for predicting HAND.","Yuan, Lin; Liu, An; Qiao, Luxin; Sheng, Bo; Xu, Meng; Li, Wei; Chen, Dexi",Biomed Res Int,182,1
2448,2448,2448,Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) controls monocyte production and maturation and the steady-state size of the liver in pigs,14.2250805,8.527256,2016-07-21,"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) is an essential growth and differentiation factor for cells of the macrophage lineage. To explore the role of CSF1 in steady-state control of monocyte production and differentiation and tissue repair, we previously developed a bioactive protein with a longer half-life in circulation by fusing pig CSF1 with the Fc region of pig IgG1a. CSF1-Fc administration to pigs expanded progenitor pools in the marrow and selectively increased monocyte numbers and their expression of the maturation marker CD163. There was a rapid increase in the size of the liver, and extensive proliferation of hepatocytes associated with increased macrophage infiltration. Despite the large influx of macrophages, there was no evidence of liver injury and no increase in circulating liver enzymes. Microarray expression profiling of livers identified increased expression of macrophage markers, i.e., cytokines such as TNF, IL1, and IL6 known to influence hepatocyte proliferation, alongside cell cycle genes. The analysis also revealed selective enrichment of genes associated with portal, as opposed to centrilobular regions, as seen in hepatic regeneration. Combined with earlier data from the mouse, this study supports the existence of a CSF1-dependent feedback loop, linking macrophages of the liver with bone marrow and blood monocytes, to mediate homeostatic control of the size of the liver. The results also provide evidence of safety and efficacy for possible clinical applications of CSF1-Fc.","Sauter, Kristin A.; Waddell, Lindsey A.; Lisowski, Zofia M.; Young, Rachel; Lefevre, Lucas; Davis, Gemma M.; Clohisey, Sara M.; McCulloch, Mary; Magowan, Elizabeth; Mabbott, Neil A.; Summers, Kim M.; Hume, David A.",Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,182,1
2660,2660,2660,Proof-of-concept study: profile of circulating microRNAs in Bovine serum harvested during acute and persistent FMDV infection,14.09955,8.674016,2017-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Changes in the levels of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the serum of humans and animals have been detected as a result of infection with a variety of viruses. However, to date, such a miRNA profiling study has not been conducted for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection. METHODS: The relative abundance of 169 miRNAs was measured in bovine serum collected at three different phases of FMDV infection in a proof-of-concept study using miRNA PCR array plates. RESULTS: Alterations in specific miRNA levels were detected in serum during acute, persistent, and convalescent phases of FMDV infection. Subclinical FMDV persistence produced a circulating miRNA profile distinct from cattle that had cleared infection. bta-miR-17-5p was highest expressed during acute infection, whereas bta-miR-31 was the highest during FMDV persistence. Interestingly, miR-1281was significantly down-regulated during both acute and persistent infection. Cattle that cleared infection resembled the baseline profile, adding support to applying serum miRNA profiling for identification of sub-clinically infected FMDV carriers. Significantly regulated miRNAs during acute or persistent infection were associated with cellular proliferation, apoptosis, modulation of the immune response, and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role for non-coding regulatory RNAs in FMDV infection of cattle. Future studies will delineate the individual contributions of the reported miRNAs to FMDV replication, determine if this miRNA signature is applicable across all FMDV serotypes, and may facilitate development of novel diagnostic applications.

2706,2706,2706,Multiple Immunosuppressive Effects of CpG-c41 on Intracellular TLR-Mediated Inflammation,14.061244,8.703155,2017-04-30,"A growing body of literature suggests that most chronic autoimmune diseases are associated with inappropriate inflammation mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7/8, or TLR9. Therefore, research into blocking TLR activation to treat these disorders has become a hot topic. Here, we report the immunomodulatory properties of a nonstimulatory CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN), CpG-c41, which had previously only been known as a TLR9 antagonist. In this study, we found that both in vitro and in vivo CpG-c41 decreased levels of various proinflammatory factors that were induced by single activation or coactivation of intracellular TLRs, but not membrane-bound TLRs, no matter what downstream signal pathways the TLRs depend on. Moreover, CpG-c41 attenuated excessive inflammation in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model of skin inflammation by suppressing immune cell infiltration and release of inflammatory factors. We also found evidence that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on other intracellular TLRs are mediated by a TLR9-independent mechanism. These results suggest that CpG-c41 acts as an upstream of signaling cascades, perhaps on the processes of ligand internalization and transfer. Taken together, these results suggest that CpG-c41 disrupts various aspects of intracellular TLR activation and provides a deeper insight into the regulation of innate immunity.","Liu, Wancheng; Yang, Xuejiao; Wang, Ning; Fan, Shijun; Zhu, Yuanfeng; Zheng, Xinchuan; Li, Yan",Mediators Inflamm,182,1

This study aimed to investigate the frequency of MALS and to develop a biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis. METHODS: Patients with infections and systemic inflammatory response syndrome were assigned to one test cohort (n = 3417) and a validation cohort (n = 1704). MALS was diagnosed for patients scoring positive either for the hemophagocytic syndrome score and/or having both hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the predictive value of MALS for 10-day mortality in both cohorts. Ferritin, sCD163, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured in the blood the first 24 h; ferritin measurements were repeated in 747 patients on day 3. RESULTS: The frequency of MALS was 3.7% and 4.3% in the test and the validation cohort, respectively. In both cohorts, MALS was an independent risk factor for 10-day mortality. A ferritin level above 4420 ng/ml was accompanied by 66.7% and 66% mortality after 28 days, respectively. Ferritin levels above 4420 ng/ml were associated with an increase of IL-6, IL-18, INF-γ, and sCD163 and a decreased IL-10/TNF-α ratio, indicating predominance of pro-inflammatory phenomena. Any less than 15% decrease of ferritin on day 3 was associated with more than 90% sensitivity for unfavorable outcome after 10 days. This high mortality risk was also validated in an independent Swedish cohort (n = 109). CONCLUSIONS: MALS is an independent life-threatening entity in sepsis.

2876,2876,2876,An avian influenza H7 DNA priming vaccine is safe and immunogenic in a randomized phase I clinical trial,14.140005,8.6133175,2017-06-01,"A novel avian influenza subtype, A/H7N9, emerged in 2013 and represents a public health threat with pandemic potential. We have previously shown that DNA vaccine priming increases the magnitude and quality of antibody responses to H5N1 monovalent inactivated boost. We now report the safety and immunogenicity of a H7 DNA-H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine prime-boost regimen. In this Phase 1, open label, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated three H7N9 vaccination regimens in healthy adults, with a prime-boost interval of 16 weeks. Group 1 received H7 DNA vaccine prime and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine boost. Group 2 received H7 DNA and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a prime and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a boost. Group 3 received H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine in a homologous prime-boost regimen. Overall, 30 individuals between 20 to 60 years old enrolled and 28 completed both vaccinations. All injections were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. 2 weeks post-boost, 50% of Group 1 and 33% of Group 2 achieved a HAI titer ≥1:40 compared with 11% of Group 3. Also, at least a fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody responses was seen in 90% of Group 1, 100% of Group 2, and 78% of Group 3 subjects.

2901,2901,2901,Leukemia/lymphoma‐related factor (LRF) exhibits stage‐ and context‐dependent transcriptional controls in the oligodendrocyte lineage and modulates remyelination,14.156134,8.329027,2017-05-30,"Leukemia/lymphoma‐related factor (LRF), a zinc‐finger transcription factor encoded by Zbtb7a, is a protooncogene that regulates differentiation in diverse cell lineages, and in the CNS, its function is relatively unexplored. This study is the first to examine the role of LRF in CNS pathology. We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreER (T) :Zbtb7a (fl/fl) mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen‐induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6‐week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreER (T) :Zbtb7a (fl/fl) mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone. LRF knockdown from either the Plp/CreER (T) line or the NG2CreER (T) line did not significantly change OP or oligodendrocyte populations. In vitro promoter assays demonstrated the potential for LRF to regulate transcription of myelin‐related genes and the notch target Hes5, which has been implicated in control of myelin formation and repair. In summary, in the oligodendrocyte lineage, LRF is expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes but is not required for oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions. Furthermore, LRF can modulate the extent of remyelination, potentially by contributing to interactions regulating transcription.","Davidson, Nathan L.; Yu, Fengshan; Kijpaisalratana, Naruchorn; Le, Tuan Q.; Beer, Laurel A.; Radomski, Kryslaine L.; Armstrong, Regina C.",J Neurosci Res,182,1
3257,3257,3257,Infectious Disease Prevalence and Factors Associated with Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats Following Relocation,14.221499,8.582901,2018-06-09,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Relocation of cats and kittens is a relatively new practice in animal welfare. It is one of the many tools used by animal welfare agencies to decrease shelter euthanasia rates across the country. However, there are few and sometimes conflicting guidelines for either minimum standards or best practices regarding relocation programs. Most operational practices are evolving and are often based on lessons learned. Concerns about the frequency of infectious diseases and the corresponding likelihood of spread are commonly raised in the context of animal relocation. In this study, which followed one relocation program over a 7-month period, highly contagious infectious diseases, feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and ringworm, were uncommon in cats following relocation into one shelter. Upper respiratory infection (URI) was, however, relatively more frequent with younger age, increased time in transport during relocation and increased time spent at the shelter following relocation all associated with increased disease frequency. Accordingly, even in an established relocation program, steps should be taken to mitigate the risk of upper respiratory infection in relocated cats. ABSTRACT: Feline relocation is used increasingly in animal welfare to decrease shelter euthanasia rates and increase positive outcomes. Concerns about infectious disease introduction and transmission are often expressed; however, little research has been conducted on even the baseline prevalence of infectious disease following relocation. This study, which collected data on 430 cats relocated through an established program over 7 months, evaluated the prevalence of upper respiratory infection (URI), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and dermatophytosis at one destination agency. The period prevalence was 25.8% for URI, 1.6% for FPV and 0.9% for dermatophytosis. Mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to investigate factors associated with URI. Younger age, increased time in transport, and increased length of stay at the destination agency were associated with increased URI prevalence following relocation. The findings of this study reveal that certain highly contagious and environmentally persistent infectious diseases, such as FPV and dermatophytosis, are uncommon following relocation in an established program; however, URI in relocated cats should be proactively managed. Animal welfare agencies can use this information to guide shelter and relocation operations and mitigate the impact of URI in relocated cats.","Aziz, Mehnaz; Janeczko, Stephanie; Gupta, Maya",Animals (Basel),182,17

Evidence has indicated that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potential method for the diagnosis of patients with cardiovascular injury. However, the efficacy of MRI in diagnosing patients with myocardial infarction requires to be improved. In the present study, a novel nano-size contrast agent, a chitosan/Fe(3)O(4)-enclosed albumin (CFEA), was introduced that was used to quantify blood volume and permeability in the infarcted myocardium. A total of 68 patients with suspected myocardial infarction were recruited to analyze the efficacy of MRI combined with CFEA (MRI-CFEA). All patients received diagnosis by MRI and MRI-CFEA. It was revealed that MRI-CFEA provided a higher signal intensity than MRI in the same patients. It was demonstrated that the diagnostic efficacy of MRI-CFEA for patients with myocardial infarction was higher than that of MRI (P<0.05). By MRI-CFEA, 50/68 of cases with myocardial infarction were diagnosed, providing a significantly higher diagnostic rate compared with the 38/68 of cases diagnosed by contrast-enhanced MRI (P<0.01). MRI-CFEA successfully discriminated the infarcted regions based on a decreased fractional blood volume and increased permeability-surface (PS) area product in the infarcted myocardium. A pharmacodynamics analysis indicated that CFEA was eliminated within 24 h in all individuals. In conclusion, the present study provided a novel method to diagnose infarcted myocardium for patients with myocardial infarction, providing an imaging biomarker for the assessment of endothelial dysfunction in the clinic.","Qin, Jiangjun; Zhou, Shuchang; Li, Zhiwei; Chen, Yinan; Qin, Qun; Ai, Tao",Exp Ther Med,182,22

The development of drug-resistant TB during the treatment increases the treatment complexity, and the long-term pulmonary complications after completing treatment raise the epidemic health burden. This study intended to investigate the utilization of Chinese medicine (CM) for respiratory symptoms by patients with a medical history of TB in Taiwan. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of one million individuals who were randomly selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The inclusion criteria of patients (n = 7905) with history of TB (ICD-9-CM codes 010–018 and A02) were: (1) TB diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010 (2) 18 years old or over (3) Clinical records for at least 2 months with complete demographic information (4) Record of treatment with first-line TB medication prescriptions. CM users for conditions other than respiratory discomforts (n = 3980) were excluded. Finally, a total of 3925 TB patients were categorized as: CM users for respiratory discomforts (n = 2051) and non-CM users (n = 1874). RESULTS: Among the 3925 subjects, 2051 (52.25%) were CM users, and 1874 (44.753%) were non-CM users. Female patients and those who were younger (18–39 y/o) and who lived in urbanized areas relatively tended to be CM users (p < .0001). Most of the CM users (1944, 94.78%) received Chinese medicines. The most commonly prescribed herbal formulas and single herbs were Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang and Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng), respectively. The core pattern of Chinese medicines for TB patients consisted of Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang, Bulbus Fritillariae Thunbergii (Bei-Mu), Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng) and Semen Armeniacae (Xing-Ren). CONCLUSIONS: The use of CM is popular among patients with a medical history of TB complicated with long-term respiratory discomforts in Taiwan.

The present study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of inhibiting lipid accumulation in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells caused by bark and fruit extracts of Toona sinensis (TSB and TSF). FFA induced lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, which was attenuated by TSB and TSF. TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism. Moreover, TSB and TSF reduced TG contents, implying the therapeutic use of TSB and TSF in NAFLD.","Chen, Yung-Chia; Chen, Hsin-Ju; Huang, Bu-Miin; Chen, Yu-Chi; Chang, Chi-Fen",J Clin Med,182,22

In the current study, we investigated the alterations of cytokines levels among control, mild MPP and severe MPP children to determine whether cytokine signatures associate with MPP and correlate with disease severity. We measured 13 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 88 children with MPP and 26 children with foreign body aspiration (FB) using a Luminex system. Linear discriminant analyses were performed to develop predictive models of mild MPP and severe MPP on these children. We observed nearly complete separations of severe MPP group, mild MPP group and control group in linear discriminant analyses. Eleven cytokines significantly increased in children with MPP, and seven cytokines had statistically significant upward linear trends correlated with MPP severity.

However, the immunological effect of adjuvants on immune cells from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy remains to be demonstrated. Different adjuvants currently used in cancer vaccine clinical trials were evaluated in the present study on immune cells from cancer patients before and after chemotherapy in an ex vivo setting. METHODS: PBMCs were obtained from 4 healthy volunteers and 23 patients affected by either colon (OMA) or lung cancer (OT). The effect of CpG, Poly I:C, Imiquimod and RNA-based adjuvant (RNAdjuvant(®)) was assessed using a multiparametric approach to analyze network dynamics of early immune responses. Evaluation of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression as well as the downstream effect on CD4(+) T cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry; cytokine and chemokine production was evaluated by Bio-Plex ProTM. RESULTS: Treatment with RNAdjuvant(®) induced the strongest response in cancer patients in terms of activation of innate and adoptive immunity. Indeed, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression was found upregulated in circulating dendritic cells, which promoted a CD4(+) T cell differentiation towards an effector phenotype. RNAdjuvant(®) was the only one to induce most of the cytokines/chemokines tested with a pronounced Th1 cytokine pattern. According to the different parameters evaluated in the study, no clear cut difference in immune response to adjuvants was observed between healthy subjects and cancer patients. Moreover, in the latter group, the chemotherapy treatment did not consistently correlate to a significant altered response in the different parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first analysis of immunological effects induced by adjuvants in cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, who are enrolled in the currently ongoing cancer vaccine clinical trials. The results show that the RNAdjuvant(®) is a potent and Th1 driving adjuvant, compared to those tested in the present study. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that chemotherapy does not significantly impair the immune system, implying that cancer patients are likely to respond to a cancer vaccine even after a chemotherapy treatment.","Mauriello, Angela; Manolio, Carmen; Cavalluzzo, Beatrice; Avallone, Antonio; Borrelli, Marco; Morabito, Alessandro; Iovine, Emanuele; Chambery, Angela; Russo, Rosita; Tornesello, Maria Lina; Buonaguro, Franco M.; Tagliamonte, Maria; Buonaguro, Luigi",J Transl Med,182,22

Autonomous DL algorithms are capable of maximizing information embedded in digital fundus photographs and ocular coherence tomographs to outperform ophthalmologists in disease detection. Other unsupervised algorithms such as principal component analysis (axis learning) and archetypal analysis (corner learning) facilitate visual field interpretation and show great promise to detect functional glaucoma progression and differentiate it from non-glaucomatous changes when compared with conventional software packages. Forecasting tools such as the Kalman filter may revolutionize glaucoma management by accounting for a host of factors to set target intraocular pressure goals that preserve vision. Activation maps generated from DL algorithms that process glaucoma data have the potential to efficiently direct our attention to critical data elements embedded in high throughput data and enhance our understanding of the glaucomatous process. It is hoped that AI will realize more accurate assessment of the copious data encountered in glaucoma management, improving our understanding of the disease, preserving vision, and serving to enhance the deep bonds that patients develop with their treating physicians.","Mayro, Eileen L.; Wang, Mengyu; Elze, Tobias; Pasquale, Louis R.",Eye (Lond),182,1

We hypothesize that partial preservation of diaphragm function, such as during assisted modes of ventilation, will restore diaphragm thickness. We also aim to correlate the changes in diaphragm thickness and function to outcomes and clinical factors. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Patients mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h in controlled mode and eventually switched to assisted ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm ultrasound and clinical data collection were performed every 48 h until discharge or death. A threshold of 10% was used to define thinning during controlled and recovery of thickness during assisted ventilation. Patients were also classified based on the level of diaphragm activity during assisted ventilation. We evaluated the association between changes in diaphragm thickness and activity and clinical outcomes and data, such as ventilation parameters. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients ventilated in controlled mode and then switched to the assisted mode of ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness significantly decreased during controlled ventilation (1.84 ± 0.44 to 1.49 ± 0.37 mm, p < 0.001) and was partially restored during assisted ventilation (1.49 ± 0.37 to 1.75 ± 0.43 mm, p < 0.001). A diaphragm thinning of more than 10% was associated with longer duration of controlled ventilation (10 [5, 15] versus 5 [4, 8.5] days, p = 0.004) and higher PEEP levels (12.6 ± 4 versus 10.4 ± 4 cmH(2)O, p = 0.034). An increase in diaphragm thickness of more than 10% during assisted ventilation was not associated with any clinical outcome but with lower respiratory rate (16.7 ± 3.2 versus 19.2 ± 4 bpm, p = 0.019) and Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (37 ± 11 versus 44 ± 13, p = 0.029) and with higher Pressure Muscle Index (2 [0.5, 3] versus 0.4 [0, 1.9], p = 0.024). Change in diaphragm thickness was not related to diaphragm function expressed as diaphragm thickening fraction. CONCLUSION: Mode of ventilation affects diaphragm thickness, and preservation of diaphragmatic contraction, as during assisted modes, can partially reverse the muscle atrophy process. Avoiding a strenuous inspiratory work, as measured by Rapid Shallow Breathing Index and Pressure Muscle Index, may help diaphragm thickness restoration.","Grassi, Alice; Ferlicca, Daniela; Lupieri, Ermes; Calcinati, Serena; Francesconi, Silvia; Sala, Vittoria; Ormas, Valentina; Chiodaroli, Elena; Abbruzzese, Chiara; Curto, Francesco; Sanna, Andrea; Zambon, Massimo; Fumagalli, Roberto; Foti, Giuseppe; Bellani, Giacomo",Crit Care,182,3

Oseltamivir is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in the clinical management of pandemic and seasonal influenza of varying severity, and as the primary antiviral agent for treatment of avian H5N1 influenza infection in humans. This article is a nonsystematic review of the experience gained from the first 10 years of using oseltamivir for influenza infections since its launch in early 2000, emphasizing recent advances in our understanding of the product and its clinical utility in five main areas. The article reviews the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, including information on special populations such as children and elderly adults, and the co-administration of oseltamivir with other agents. This is followed by a summary of data on the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis in patients with all types of influenza, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian H5N1 influenza. The implications of changes in susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to oseltamivir and other antiviral agents are also described, as is the emergence of antiviral resistance during and after the 2009 pandemic. The fourth main section deals with the safety profile of oseltamivir in standard and special patient populations, and reviews spontaneously reported adverse event data from the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods and the topical issue of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Finally, the article considers the pharmacoeconomics of oseltamivir in comparison with vaccination and usual care regimens, and as a component of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies.","Smith, James R.; Rayner, Craig R.; Donner, Barbara; Wollenhaupt, Martina; Klumpp, Klaus; Dutkowski, Regina",Adv Ther,182,1

Persistence of PVB19 in asymptomatic individuals has been reported in skin, synovium, myocardium and bone marrow. A higher level of PVB19 DNA has been observed in various tissues from cases of disease than in controls. Simultaneously, equal detection of PVB19 DNA has been shown in both cases and controls. Thus, it has become fundamental to study PVB19 DNA persistence in tissues that are unaffected by disease. This will help to better understand PVB19 DNA persistence in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and its possible pathogenic role in various diseases. A total of 70 adult autopsies were included and divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) groups based on PVB19 IgG. Nested PCR for PVB19 DNA was carried out in myocardium, liver, kidney, and bone marrow. Of the 70 patients, 60 % belonged to the SP group and 40 % to the SN group. Seropositivity ranged from 50 % in the 12 to 20 year old group to 66.7 % in the 61 to 80 year old group.

However, transplantation does play a role if TPN fails, with failure defined by Medicare as liver failure, frequent line sepsis, major central vein thrombosis, or recurrent dehydration. Of these complications, the relationship between liver failure and subsequent death in high-risk subgroups of long-term TPN patients has been shown clearly. Patients with less than 100 cm of postduodenal small bowel, an end-jejunostomy, no ileocecal valve or cecum, or persistently elevated liver function levels are at high risk for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Early referral to experienced centers is suggested in these circumstances. High-risk patients may also take part in clinical trials of promising therapies to increase intestinal adaptation and prevent liver failure. Living donors should be considered for transplant candidates to minimize waiting time and optimize HLA matching. ESLD patients need a liver-intestine transplant. Because their waiting-list mortality is very high, their status on the liver waiting list should be elevated if possible. High incidence of early death from sepsis is reported after intestinal transplant, even at experienced centers. Aggressive measures should be taken if uncontrolled sepsis occurs, including discontinuing immunosuppression and removing the graft. Further research is needed in intestinal immunology and in development of strategies to decrease the need for aggressive immunosuppression in these transplant recipents. The ultimate role of intestinal transplantation will be determined by its capacity to show superiority, both in effectiveness and safety, to long-term TPN.","Jonathan Paul, Fryer",Curr Gastroenterol Rep,182,1

Although esophageal varices can be treated with endoscopic procedures, the treatment for gastric varices is still controversial. The aim of this study was to describe a surgical technique and our preliminary results of hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab’s procedure. METHODS: Between February 2002 and May 2005, we performed 7 cases of gastric varices with this type of operation. The patients included 4 men and 3 women who ranged in age from 23 to 74 years (underlying liver disease: 5 case of liver cirrhosis, 1 case of polycystic disease, 1 case of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction). After splenctomy was performed, we devascularized the vessels of the upper stomach and the esophagus 5 cm away from the esophago-cardia junction. RESULTS: The operative time ranged from 132 to 290 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was estimated to be from 50 ml to 475 ml. The weight of removed spleen ranged from 110 g to 800 g. During the follow-up period, all gastric varices disappeared and no bleeding from varicose veins was observed. All patients had hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia before surgery (mean: 11.1 ± 7.4 × 10(4)/ml), which was improved postoperatively (mean: 30.8 ±19.0 × 10(4)/ml). This data were statistically significant (P = 0.033). One patient died of aspiration pneumonia related to postoperative pyloric stricture. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no agreement concerning the best treatment of gastric varices, the hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab’s operation is a safe, moderately invasive method, and its outcome appears to be equal to that of other open procedures.","Yamamoto, Joji; Nagai, Motoki; Smith, Barry; Tamaki, Satoshi; Kubota, Tadao; Sasaki, Ken; Ohmori, Toshihiro; Maeda, Kiyotaka",World J Surg,182,1

Infection of the human CNS with many different viruses or infection of the rodent CNS induces vigorous host-inflammatory responses with recruitment of large numbers of leukocytes, particularly T lymphocytes and macrophages. Chemokines coordinate trafficking of peripheral blood leukocytes by stimulating their chemotaxis, adhesion, extravasation, and other effector functions. In view of these properties, research efforts have turned increasingly to the possible involvement of chemokines in regulating both peripheral tissue and CNS leukocyte migration during viral infection. The biological effects of chemokines are mediated via their interaction with receptors belonging to the family of seven transmembrane (7TM)-spanning, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the normal mammalian CNS, the number of leukocytes present in the brain is scant. However, these cells are attracted to, and accumulate in, a variety of pathologic states, many involving viral infection. Although leukocyte migration into local tissue compartments, such as the CNS, is a multifactorial process, it has become clear that chemokines are pivotal components of this process, providing a necessary chemotactic signal for leukocyte recruitment.","Asensio, Valerie C.; Campbell, lain L.",Adv Virus Res,182,22

However, approved vaccines that prevent ZV infection are not available. To develop an effective vaccine against ZV infection, a lipidated form of ZV envelope protein domain III that possesses an intrinsic adjuvant property was rationally designed. Our goal was to examine the immunogenicity of recombinant lipidated ZV envelope protein domain III (rLZE3) and evaluate its potential as a vaccine candidate against ZV. METHODS: Recombinant ZV envelope protein domain III (rZE3) and rLZE3 were prepared with an Escherichia coli-based system. Dendritic cell surface marker expression and cytokine production upon stimulation were analyzed to evaluate the function of rLZE3. Neutralizing antibody capacities were evaluated using focus reduction neutralization tests after immunization. To investigate the protective immunity in immunized mice, serum samples collected from immunized mice were adoptively transferred into AG129 mice, and then viremia levels and survival times were examined after ZV challenge. RESULTS: rLZE3 alone but not rZE3 alone efficiently activated dendritic cells in vitro and was taken up by dendritic cells in vivo. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with rLZE3 alone (without exogenous adjuvant) could induce ZV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, serum samples obtained from rLZE3-immunized mice provided protection as indicated by a reduction in viremia levels and prolongation of survival times after ZV challenge. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rLZE3 is an excellent vaccine candidate and has great potential that should be evaluated in further preclinical studies.","Chen, Mei-Yu; Chai, Kit Man; Chiang, Chen-Yi; Wu, Chiao-Chieh; Yu, Guann-Yi; Liu, Shih-Jen; Chen, Hsin-Wei",J Biomed Sci,182,1

The comorbidities (autoimmune and miscellaneous) and iatrogenic complications were compared between early and late onset, and in good and poor outcome groups. Out of 81 patients with MG, 48 patients had early and 33 late onset. In 71 (88%) patients, comorbidities were present and were autoimmune in 8 (10%) and miscellaneous in all the patients (88%). Iatrogenic complications were present in 54 (67%) patients. Thymectomy was done in 19 patients; 16 had thymoma and 3 thymic hyperplasia. Myasthenic crisis occurred in 28 patients; 5 (18%) had autoimmune and all had miscellaneous comorbidities. The patients with poor outcome had ≥ 2 comorbidities, myasthenic crisis, leukocytosis, elevated serum bilirubin and creatinine, and increased number of hospital admissions (P < 0.05). Myasthenia gravis is associated with comorbidities in majority of patients especially in late onset group, and more than two comorbidities are related to poor outcome.","Misra, Usha K.; Kalita, Jayantee; Singh, Varun K.; Kumar, Surendra",Acta Neurol Belg,182,1

There is a growing catalog of related assessments, publications and reviews that display the direct and indirect role of intellectual capital in business success and profitability. Despite the bourgeoning literature, studies have not yet unleashed the influence of each dimension of intellectual capital; human capital, structural capital and customer capital on SMEs' efficiency with financial resources as a moderator. The present study fills the gap and assesses if financial resources strengthen the paths between the dimensions of intellectual capital and SMEs' efficiency. A survey method was used and collected evidence from 264 Chinese SMEs. The findings exhibit that human capital directly enhances SMEs' efficiency but the presence of financial resources as a moderator weakens the influence. However, social capital and customer capital do not directly improve SMEs' efficiency but financial resources reinforce the paths social and customer capital and SMEs efficiency. This research recommends that owners and managers of SMEs need to use their financial resources complementary with structural and customer capital while human capital should be used exclusively.","Li, Guowei; Luo, Zhe; Anwar, Muhammad; Lu, Yuqiu; Wang, Xiantao; Liu, Xuening",PLoS One,182,17

To protect these rights and ensure rule of law, migration authorities are commonly required to assess the age of asylum seekers who lack reliable documentation, including through various medical methods. However, many healthcare professionals and other commentators consider medical age assessment to be ethically problematic. This paper presents a simplified and amended account of the main findings of a recent ethical analysis of medical age assessment in the asylum process commissioned by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. A number of ethical challenges related to conflicting goals, equality and fairness, autonomy and informed consent, privacy and integrity, and professional values and roles are identified and analysed. It is concluded that most of these challenges can be met, but that this requires a system where the assessment is sufficiently accurate and where adequate safeguards are in place. Two important ethical questions are found to warrant further analysis. The first is whether asylum seekers’ consent to the procedure can be considered genuinely voluntary. The second is whether and how medical age assessments could affect negative public attitudes towards asylum seekers or discriminatory societal views more generally.","Malmqvist, Erik; Furberg, Elisabeth; Sandman, Lars",Int J Legal Med,182,22

In a large number of cases, claims by asylum seekers of being below 18 years were not trusted by Swedish authorities. To handle the situation, the Swedish national board of forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket, RMV) was assigned by the government to create a centralized system for medical age assessments. RMV introduced a procedure including two biological age indicators; x-ray of the third molars and magnetic resonance imaging of the distal femoral epiphysis. In 2017, a total of 9617 males and 337 females were subjected to this procedure. No validation study for the procedure was however published, and the observed number of cases with different maturity combinations in teeth and femur were unexpected given the claims originally made by RMV. We present a general stochastic model enabling us to study which combinations of age indicator model parameters and age population profiles are consistent with the observed 2017 data for males. We find that, contrary to some RMV claims, maturity of the femur, as observed by RMV, appears on average well before maturity of teeth. According to our estimates, approximately 15% of the tested males were children. These children had an approximate 33% risk of being classified as adults. The corresponding risk for an adult to be misclassified as a child was approximately 7%. We determine uncertainties and ranges of estimates under reasonable perturbations of the prior.","Mostad, Petter; Tamsen, Fredrik",Int J Legal Med,182,22

While research has focused on measuring receptors or ligands independently as biomarkers, very little attention has been given to measuring ligand-receptor complexes, in part, due to the limited availability of suitable technologies to do such measurements. This has led to underappreciation of ligand-receptor complexes as biomarkers in disease, including in cancer. In this commentary, the potential role of ligand-receptor complexes and their importance as biomarkers in cancer is discussed. We also describe a novel RNA aptamer-based technology, designated as ligand-receptor complex-binding aptamers (LIRECAP), that can provide precise measurement of the ligand occupancy of receptors and has potential use as a biomarker discovery platform. ABSTRACT: Molecular complexes, such as ligand–receptor complexes, are vital for both health and disease and can be shed into the circulation in soluble form. Relatively little is known about the biology of soluble ligand–receptor complexes. The functional importance of such complexes and their potential use as clinical biomarkers in diagnosis and therapy remains underappreciated. Most traditional technologies used to study ligand–receptor complexes measure the individual levels of soluble ligands or receptors rather than the complexes themselves. The fraction of receptors occupied by ligand, and the potential clinical relevance of such information, has been largely overlooked. Here, we review the biological significance of soluble ligand–receptor complexes with a specific focus on their potential as biomarkers of cancer and other inflammatory diseases. In addition, we discuss a novel RNA aptamer-based technology, designated ligand–receptor complex-binding aptamers (LIRECAP), that can provide precise measurement of the fraction of a soluble receptor occupied by its ligand. The potential applicability of the LIRECAP technology as a biomarker discovery platform is also described.","Veeramani, Suresh; Weiner, George J.",Cancers (Basel),182,31

In the present study, bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) and chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) were cultured from a Leghorn line (Ghs6) and Fayoumi line (M15.2), which are inbred chicken lines relatively susceptible and resistant to various diseases, respectively. The cells were treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and, subsequently, mRNA expression of 20 chicken HDPs was analyzed before and after the stimulation. At homeostasis, many genes differed between the chicken lines, with the Fayoumi line having significantly higher expression (p < 0.05) than the Leghorn line: AvBD1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 in BMCs; CATH1, CATH3, and GNLY in CEFs; and AvDB5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 in both BMCs and CEFs. After LPS treatment, the expression of AvBD1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, CATH1, and CATHB1 was significantly upregulated in BMCs, but no genes changed expression in CEFs. After poly(I:C) treatment, AvBD2, 11, 12, 13, CATHB1 and LEAP2 increased in both cell types; CATH2 only increased in BMCs; and AvBD3, 6, 9, 14, CATH1, CATH3, and GNLY only increased in CEFs. In addition, AvBD7, AvBD14, CATH1, CATH2, GNLY, and LEAP2 showed line-specific expression dependent upon cell type (BMC and CEF) and stimulant (LPS and poly(I:C)). The characterization of mRNA expression patterns of chicken HDPs in the present study suggests that their functions may be associated with multiple types of disease resistance in chickens.","Jang, Hyun-Jun; Monson, Melissa; Kaiser, Michael; Lamont, Susan J",Genes (Basel),182,1

Molecular pathological studies on TAAD can aid in understanding the disease comprehensively and can provide insights into new diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we defined the molecular pathology of TAAD by performing transcriptome sequencing of human ascending aortic tissues. Pathway analysis revealed that activated inflammation, cell death and smooth muscle cell degeneration are the main pathological changes in aortic dissection. However, autophagy is considered to be one of the most important biological processes, regulating inflammatory reactions and degenerative changes. Therefore, we focused on the pathological role of autophagy in aortic dissection and identified 10 autophagy-regulated hub genes, which are all upregulated in TAAD. These results indicate that exaggerated autophagy participates in the pathological process of aortic dissection and may provide new insight for further basic research on TAAD.","Zhou, Zeyi; Liu, Yan; Zhu, Xiyu; Tang, Xinlong; Wang, Yali; Wang, Junxia; Xu, Can; Wang, Dongjin; Du, Jie; Zhou, Qing",Genes (Basel),182,1

We previously reported that DC-SIGN mediated H5N1 influenza A virus (AIVs) infection, however, the important DC-SIGN interaction with N-glycosylation sites remain unknown. This study aims to identify the optimal DC-SIGN interacting N-glycosylation sites in HA proteins of H5N1-AIVs. Results from NetNGlyc program analyzed the H5 hemagglutinin sequences of isolates during 2004–2020, revealing that seven and two conserved N-glycosylation sites were detected in HA1 and HA2 domain, respectively. A lentivirus pseudotyped A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 envelope (H5N1-PVs) was generated which displayed an abundance of HA5 proteins on the virions via immuno-electron microscope observation. Further, H5N1-PVs or reverse-genetics (H5N1-RG) strains carrying a serial N-glycosylated mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis assay. Human recombinant DC-SIGN (rDC-SIGN) coated ELISA showed that H5N1-PVs bound to DC-SIGN, however, mutation on the N27Q, N39Q, and N181Q significantly reduced this binding (p < 0.05). Infectivity and capture assay demonstrated that N27Q and N39Q mutations significantly ameliorated DC-SIGN mediated H5N1 infection. Furthermore, combined mutations (N27Q&N39Q) significantly waned the interaction on either H5N1-PVs or -RG infection in cis and in trans (p < 0.01). This study concludes that N27 and N39 are two essential N-glycosylation contributing to DC-SIGN mediating H5N1 infection.","Yang, Zih-Syuan; Huang, Szu-Wei; Wang, Wen-Hung; Lin, Chih-Yen; Wang, Chu-Feng; Urbina, Aspiro Nayim; Thitithanyanont, Arunee; Tseng, Sung-Pin; Lu, Po-Liang; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Wang, Sheng-Fan",Int J Mol Sci,182,1

RNF40 encodes a polypeptide of 1001 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 113,678 Da. RNF40 and its paralog RNF20 form a stable heterodimer complex that can monoubiquitylate histone H2B at lysine 120 as well as other nonhistone proteins. Cancer is a major public health problem and the second leading cause of death. Through its protein ubiquitylation activity, RNF40 acts as a tumor suppressor or oncogene to play major epigenetic roles in cancer development, progression, and metastasis, highlighting the essential function of RNF40 and the importance of studying it. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about RNF40 gene structure and the role of RNF40 in histone H2B monoubiquitylation, DNA damage repair, apoptosis, cancer development, and metastasis. We also underscore challenges in applying this information to cancer prognosis and prevention and highlight the urgent need for additional investigations of RNF40 as a potential target for cancer therapeutics.","Fu, Junjiang; Liao, Li; Balaji, Kyathegowdanadoddi Srinivasa; Wei, Chunli; Kim, Jaehoon; Peng, Jiangzhou",Oncogene,182,1

This study aims to evaluate whether left VAC can predict stroke volume (SV) response to norepinephrine (NE) in septic shock patients. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted in an intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. We recruited septic shock patients who had persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and required NE to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg. Those patients in whom the target MAP was not reached after NE infusion were ineligible. Echocardiographic variables were measured before (baseline) and after NE infusion. SV responder was defined by a ≥ 15% increase in SV after NE infusion. RESULTS: Of 34 septic shock patients included, 19 (56%) were SV responders. Before NE infusion, SV responders had a lower Ees (1.13 ± 0.24 mmHg/mL versus 1.50 ± 0.46 mmHg/mL, P = 0.005) and a higher Ea/Ees ratio (1.47 ± 0.40 versus 1.02 ± 0.30, P = 0.001) than non-responders, and Ea in SV responders was comparable to that in non-responders (1.62 ± 0.36 mmHg/mL versus 1.43 ± 0.28 mmHg/mL, P = 0.092). NE significantly increased Ea and Ees in both groups. The Ea/Ees ratio was normalized by NE administration in SV responders but unchanged in non-responders. The baseline Ea/Ees ratio was positively correlated with NE-induced SV increases (r = 0.688, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the baseline Ea/Ees ratio was a predictor of SV increases induced by NE (odd ratio 0.008, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.000 to 0.293), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.816 (95% CI: 0.646 to 0.927).

Cross-sectional evaluative study based on a survey of key program informants deployed in 29 public health services in the country, as well as individual interviews and focus groups with key actors and experts. The evaluation was focused on the relevance and impact of mhGAP on the provision of mental health services and on the implementation of the program. RESULTS. The participants gave a positive evaluation of the progressive implementation of mhGAP in Chile. In particular: 1) They reported having better tools for detecting, diagnosing, and treating common disorders, and efficient referral strategies; (2) They rated all modules as important, the most relevant being self-harm/suicide (x¯ = 4.77) and mental and behavioral disorders in children and adolescents (x¯ = 4.58); (3) They favorably assessed the National Mental Health Day training courses and the subsequent courses repeated at the local level, indicating that these courses contributed to successful implementation of mhGAP; (4) They agreed on the need to incorporate new actors, strengthen certain aspects, and expand information on the program. CONCLUSIONS. The implementation of mhGAP in Chile is an emblematic example of learning supported by the development of community mental health and family health, among other factors. These accomplishments offer a unique opportunity to continue advancing the implementation of this program in the country and to implement this experience in other contexts in Latin America and the Caribbean.","Sapag, Jaime C.; Álvarez Huenchulaf, Cinthia; Campos, Álvaro; Corona, Francisca; Pereira, Milena; Véliz, Verónica; Soto-Brandt, Gonzalo; Irarrazaval, Matias; Gómez, Mauricio; Abaakouk, Zohra",Rev Panam Salud Publica,182,1

This information may determine the health-seeking behavior of an individual and may delay medical attention. Little is known regarding the quality of patient information on appendicitis on the internet, as this has not been previously studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify the quality of information regarding appendicitis on websites intended for the public. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of information on appendicitis available online using the following 4 search terms in google: “appendicitis,” “appendix,” “appendectomy,” and “appendicectomy”. The top 100 websites of each search term were assessed using the validated Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool (score 0-36). RESULTS: A total of 119 websites met the eligibility criteria for evaluation. The overall median EQIP score for all websites was 20 (IQR 18-22). More than half the websites originated from the USA (65/119, 54.6%), and 45.4% (54/119) of all websites originated from hospitals, although 43% (23/54) of these did not mention qualitative risks from surgery. Incidence rates were only provided for complications and mortality in 12.6% (15/119) and 3.3% (4/119) of all websites, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of the quality and readability of websites concerning appendicitis by the EQIP tool indicates that most sites online were of poor credibility, with minimal information regarding complication rates and mortality. To improve education and awareness of appendicitis, there is an immediate need for more informative and patient-centered websites that are more compatible with international quality standards.","Ghani, Shahi; Fan, Ka Siu; Fan, Ka Hay; Lenti, Lorenzo; Raptis, Dimitri",J Med Internet Res,182,1

However, self-reflection is not habitual or instinctive, and reflection assignments are often met with resistance from students. While written reflections are popular, other self-reflection mediums should be investigated. INNOVATION: Flipgrid by Microsoft, an online video response tool, was used in an elective course for self-reflection and student engagement. To assess the impact of Flipgrid on the student experience in the course, two cohorts of students were evaluated. Overall 96% of respondents reported satisfaction with Flipgrid as an educational tool, however engagement was not significantly increased over the use of written reflection. IMPLICATIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that Flipgrid appears to have potential as a self-reflection tool, but may not be a “magic-bullet” to increase student engagement. Recommendations and considerations for implementing Flipgrid into a course to facilitate student engagement are provided.","Kiles, Tyler M.; Vishenchuk, Julia; Hohmeier, Kenneth C.",Innov Pharm,182,1

Cationic nanoparticles deliver tumor-associated antigens to dendritic cells and induce immune activation, resulting in strong antigen-specific cellular immune responses, as shown for a wide variety of vaccine candidates. In this review, we discuss the relation between the cationic nature of nanoparticles and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Multiple types of lipid- and polymer-based cationic nanoparticulate cancer vaccines with various antigen types (e.g., mRNA, DNA, peptides and proteins) and adjuvants are described. Furthermore, we focus on the types of cationic nanoparticles used for T-cell induction, especially in the context of therapeutic cancer vaccination. We discuss different cationic nanoparticulate vaccines, molecular mechanisms of adjuvanticity and biodistribution profiles upon administration via different routes. Finally, we discuss the perspectives of cationic nanoparticulate vaccines for improving immunotherapy of cancer.","Heuts, Jeroen; Jiskoot, Wim; Ossendorp, Ferry; van der Maaden, Koen",Pharmaceutics,182,33

However, its pathogenesis is poorly understood and specific therapies are not available. Experimental and clinical studies have indicated that alveolar fibrin deposition serves a pathological role in acute lung injuries. The present study investigated whether pulmonary fibrin deposition occurs in a TRALI mouse model and the possible mechanisms underlying this deposition. The TRALI model was established by priming male Balb/c mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 18 h prior to injection of an anti-major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) antibody. Untreated mice and mice administered LPS plus isotype antibody served as controls. At 2 h after TRALI induction, blood and lung tissue were collected. Disease characteristics were assessed based on lung tissue histology, inflammatory responses and alterations in the alveolar-capillary barrier. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect pulmonary fibrin deposition, platelets and fibrin-platelet interactions. Levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TATc), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), coagulation factor activity and fibrin degradation product (FDP) in lung tissue homogenates were measured. Severe lung injury, increased inflammatory responses and a damaged alveolar-capillary barrier in the LPS-primed, anti-MHC-I antibody-administered mice indicated that the TRALI model was successfully established. Fibrin deposition, fibrin-platelet interactions and platelets accumulation in the lungs of mouse models were clearly promoted. Additionally, levels of TATc, coagulation factor V (FV), TFPI and PAI-1 were elevated, whereas FDP level was decreased in TRALI mice. In conclusion, both impaired fibrinolysis and enhanced coagulation, which might be induced by boosted FV activity, increased pulmonary platelets accumulation and enhanced fibrin-platelet interactions and contributed to pulmonary fibrin deposition in TRALI mice. The results provided a therapeutic rationale to target abnormalities in either coagulation or fibrinolysis pathways for antibody-mediated TRALI.","Yu, Yunhong; Jiang, Peng; Sun, Pan; Su, Na; Lin, Fangzhao",Mol Med Rep,182,8

METHODS: We combined information from Manitoba Cancer registry and Census data to obtain an age-sex adjusted relative risk (IRR) of GC incidence. We geocoded the IRR to the 96 regional health authority districts (RHADs) using the postal code conversion file (PCCF). Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal Poisson regression models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Adjusting for the effect of socio-economic score index (SESI), Indigenous, and immigrant population, 25 districts with high overall GC risk were identified. One unit increase in SESI was associated with reduced risk of cardia GC (CGC) by 14% (IRR = 0.859; 95% CI: 0.780–0.947) and the risk of non-cardia GC (NCGC) by approximately 10% (IRR = 0.898; 95% CI: 0.812–0.995); 1% increase in regional Indigenous population proportion reduced the risk of CGC by 1.4% (IRR = 0.986; 95% CI: 0.978–0.994). In the analysis stratified by sex, one unit increase in SESI reduced the risk of CGC among women by 26.2% (IRR = 0.738; 95% CI: 0.618–0.879), and a 1% increase in Indigenous population proportion reduced the risk of CGC among women by 1.9% (IRR = 0.981; 95% CI: 0.966–0.996). CONCLUSION: Our results support a significant association between SESI and NCGC. We report regional variation of GC IRR and a varying temporal pattern across the RHADs. These results could be used to prioritize interventions for regions with high and progressive risk of GC.","Fakanye, Oluwagbenga; Singh, Harminder; Desautels, Danielle; Torabi, Mahmoud",PLoS One,182,8

Twenty children on dialysis intended to perform a 12-week graded community-based exercise program. Exercise capacity and fatigue level were studied; muscle force and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training. In conclusion, exercise training is difficult to perform in children with ESRD and is not always feasible in real-life situations for many children with ESRD.","van Bergen, Monique; Takken, Tim; Engelbert, Raoul; Groothoff, Jaap; Nauta, Jeroen; van Hoeck, Koen; Helders, Paul; Lilien, Marc",Pediatr Nephrol,182,1

A comprehensive literature review tracked by a discussion with industry and academic experts recognized 20 barriers. Based on three widely acclaimed statistical techniques, hybrid AHP-TOPSIS (Analytical Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and ISM (Interpretative Structural Modeling), critical psychological barriers have been investigated. A group of 8 experts from industry and academia with at least 10 years of experience was consulted for AHP and ISM techniques. Whereas TOPSIS was conducted by 443 operational-level users, including managers and supervisors of different functional areas of the manufacturing industry located in Pakistan. The findings reveal that ‘Fear of job losses’, ‘Fear of data loss/Risk of security breaches, ‘Lack of advanced & continued education of employees’ and ‘Lack of standards and reference architecture’, with highest importance weights, emerged as the most prominent psychological barriers in developing economies. Then the interrelations among these barriers resulted in a four-layered structural model. The driver barriers identified in the final model advocate that development in ‘advanced & continued education of employees’, ‘standards & reference architecture’ and ‘minimization of fear of job & data loss’ can expedite the adoption of industry 4.0 (i4.0) technologies. The study uniquely develops hierarchical relationships among the psychological barriers for adopting i4.0 in the manufacturing context using AHP-TOPSIS and ISM techniques.

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) data registry from 2017 to 2018. All patients with primary elective Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) procedures were included. The primary outcome was to characterize the timing of postoperative complications for RYGB and SG. RESULTS: A total of 316,314 patients were identified with 237,066 (74.9%) in the SG cohort and 79,248 (25.1%) in the RYGB cohort. Early complications included myocardial infarction (4.7 ± 6.4 days), cardiac arrest (6.4 ± 8.5 days), pneumonia (6.9 ± 6.9 days), progressive renal insufficiency (8.1 ± 8.1 days), and acute renal failure (8.2 ± 7.6 days). Late complications included Clostridioides difficile infection (11.3 ± 7.8 days), organ space infections (11.7 ± 7.9 days), deep incisional infections (12.4 ± 6.6 days), superficial incisional infections (13.2 ± 6.9 days), and urinary tract infections (14.0 ± 8.4 days). SG patients were more likely to be diagnosed later than RYGB patients with regard to superficial incisional infections (14.0 ± 7.4 days vs 12.5 ± 6.3 days; p = 0.002), organ space infections (12.6 ± 7.8 days vs 10.8 ± 7.9 days; p = 0.001), acute renal failure (9.3 ± 8.1 days vs 6.8 ± 6.8 days; p = 0.03), and pulmonary embolism (13.7 ± 7.5 days vs 11.3 ± 8.0 days; p = 0.003). No significant difference in timing was observed for any other complication by procedures. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that significant differences in timing exist between complications and that these differences also vary by surgical procedure.

The Western Ghats is one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots and, like many such areas of high biodiversity, is under significant pressure from anthropogenic landscape change. The current study sought to quantify mammalian species richness using ensemble models of the distributions of a sample of species extant in the Western Ghats and to explore its association with KFDV outbreaks, as well as the modifying effects of deforestation on this association. Species richness was quantified as a composite of individual species' distributions, as derived from ensembles of boosted regression tree, random forest, and generalised additive models. Species richness was further adjusted for the potential biotic constraints of sympatric species. Both species richness and forest loss demonstrated strong positive associations with KFDV outbreaks, however forest loss substantially modified the association between species richness and outbreaks. High species richness was associated with increased KFDV risk but only in areas of low forest loss. In contrast, lower species richness was associated with increased KFDV risk in areas of greater forest loss. This relationship persisted when species richness was adjusted for biotic constraints at the taluk-level. In addition, the taluk-level species abundances of three monkey species (Macaca radiata, Semnopithecus hypoleucus, and Semnopithecus priam) were also associated with outbreaks. These results suggest that increased monitoring of wildlife in areas of significant habitat fragmentation may add considerably to critical knowledge gaps in KFDV epidemiology and infection ecology and should be incorporated into novel One Health surveillance development for the region. In addition, the inclusion of some primate species as sentinels of KFDV circulation into general wildlife surveillance architecture may add further value.","Walsh, Michael G.; Bhat, Rashmi; Nagarajan-Radha, Venkatesh; Narayanan, Prakash; Vyas, Navya; Sawleshwarkar, Shailendra; Mukhopadhyay, Chiranjay",One Health,182,1

At present, no studies have comprehensively evaluated the genetic and epigenetic alterations induced by pesticides; therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify modifications in gene miRNA expression and DNA methylation useful for the prediction of pesticide exposure. For this purpose, an integrated analysis of gene expression, microRNA expression, and DNA methylation datasets obtained from the GEO DataSets database was performed to identify putative genes, microRNAs, and DNA methylation hotspots associated with pesticide exposure and responsible for the development of different diseases. In addition, DIANA-miRPath, STRING, and GO Panther prediction tools were used to establish the functional role of the putative biomarkers identified.

In this study, we tested the ability of liposomal delivery of miR-203 to reverse aspects of breast cancer pathogenesis using breast cancer and EMT cell lines. We show that translationally relevant methods for increasing miR-203 abundance within a target tissue affects cellular properties associated with cancer progression. While stable miR-203 expression suppresses LASP1 and survivin, nanoliposomal delivery suppresses BMI1, indicating that suppression of distinct mRNA target profiles can lead to loss of cancer cell migration.","Song, Shuxuan; Johnson, Kelsey S.; Lujan, Henry; Pradhan, Sahar H.; Sayes, Christie M.; Taube, Joseph H.",Noncoding RNA,182,1

Cardiomyocyte senescence is considered to be a key factor in the development of DOX-related cardiomyopathy. Complement component 5a (C5a) and the C5a receptor (C5aR) have been reported to play a key role in the process of cellular senescence. However, to the best of our knowledge, the exact role of C5a and C5aR in cellular senescence in the heart remains largely unknown. Reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR and western blot assays were used to analyze the expression levels of C5a and C5aR in H9c2 embryonic rat cardiomyocytes and AC16 human cardiomyocyte-like cells. The cells were treated with DOX and a C5aR antagonist (C5aRA). The expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ was determined using ELISA and western blotting. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also measured using ELISA. Cellular senescence was determined using senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and by analyzing the protein expression levels of p53, p16, p21 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). The expression levels of C5a and C5aR were found to be upregulated during the DOX-induced senescence of H9c2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes. Treatment with C5aRA downregulated TNF-α and IFN-γ expression, in addition to ROS levels. Furthermore, C5aRA prevented DOX-induced cellular senescence and decreased the levels of positive SA-β-gal staining in H9c2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes, in addition to downregulating the expression levels of p53, p16, p21 and IGFBP3. C5aRA also increased the telomere length and telomerase activity in H9c2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes following DOX stimulation. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that C5a and C5aR may play a key role in cardiomyocyte senescence, and treatment with C5aRA may be an effective method for preventing DOX-induced cardiomyocyte aging.","Wen, Yahui; Shen, Feiyan; Wu, Haibin",Exp Ther Med,182,1

This mitonuclear disruption may cause severe cellular stress in mismatched individuals. Gene expression changes and alternative splicing (AS) are two important transcriptional regulations to respond to environmental or cellular stresses. We previously identified a naturally introgressed population in the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis). Individuals from this population belong to R. a. himalayanus and share almost identical nuclear genetic background; however, some of them had mtDNA from another subspecies (R. a. macrurus). With this unique natural system, we examined gene expression changes in six tissues between five mitonuclear mismatched and five matched individuals. A small number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analysis revealed that most DEGs were related to immune response although some may be involved in response to oxidative stress. In contrast, we identified extensive AS events and alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) between mismatched and matched individuals. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that multiple ASGs were directly or indirectly associated with energy production in mitochondria which is vital for survival of organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the role of AS in responding to cellular stress caused by mitonuclear mismatch in natural populations. Our results suggest that AS may play a more important role than gene expression regulation in responding to severe environmental or cellular stresses.","Chen, Wenli; Mao, Xiuguang",Ecol Evol,182,1

Although controlled dielectric breakdown (CDB) is the most accessible method for a single nanopore fabrication, it is still necessary to improve the fabrication efficiency and avoid the generation of multiple nanopores. In this work, we treated the SiNx membranes in the air–plasma before the CDB process, which shortened the time-to-pore-formation by orders of magnitude. λ-DNA translocation experiments validated the functionality of the pore and substantiated the presence of only a single pore on the membrane. Our fabricated pore could also be successfully used to detect short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments. Using to ionic current signals, ssDNA fragments with different lengths could be clearly distinguished. These results will provide a valuable reference for the nanopore fabrication and DNA analysis.","Zhang, Yin; Ma, Dexian; Gu, Zengdao; Zhan, Lijian; Sha, Jingjie",Nanomaterials (Basel),182,1

From January to March 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 297 Syrian Arab and Kurdish participants and aged 18–30 years old. It was found that participants coming from Syrian urban areas or who completed an education above secondary level have higher overall knowledge on SRH issues. Only a total of 148 out of the 297 participants (49.8%) knew a health facility in Bourj Hammoud that provides SRH services and among them 36.4% did not know which type of services are available there. The Syrian refugee young women’s access to SRH services is inadequate due to different obstacles. The overall knowledge level on different SRH topics is limited.

However, alongside considerable enthusiasm, we and others have highlighted a lack of standardized approaches for score disclosure. Here, we review the landscape of polygenic score reporting and describe a generalizable approach for development of a polygenic score disclosure tool for coronary artery disease. METHODS: We assembled a working group of clinicians, geneticists, data visualization specialists, and software developers. The group reviewed existing polygenic score reports and then designed a two-page mock report for coronary artery disease. We then conducted a qualitative user-experience study with this report using an interview guide focused on comprehension, experience, and attitudes. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for themes identification to inform report revision. RESULTS: Review of nine existing polygenic score reports from commercial and academic groups demonstrated significant heterogeneity, reinforcing the need for additional efforts to study and standardize score disclosure. Using a newly developed mock score report, we conducted interviews with ten adult individuals (50% females, 70% without prior genetic testing experience, age range 20–70 years) recruited via an online platform. We identified three themes from interviews: (1) visual elements, such as color and simple graphics, enable participants to interpret, relate to, and contextualize their polygenic score, (2) word-based descriptions of risk and polygenic scores presented as percentiles were the best recognized and understood, (3) participants had varying levels of interest in understanding complex genomic information and therefore would benefit from additional resources that can adapt to their individual needs in real time. In response to user feedback, colors used for communicating risk were modified to minimize unintended color associations and odds ratios were removed. All 10 participants expressed interest in receiving a polygenic score report based on their personal genomic information. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe a generalizable approach to develop a polygenic score report understandable by potential patients. Although additional studies are needed across a wider spectrum of patient populations, these results are likely to inform ongoing efforts related to polygenic score disclosure within clinical practice.

We assessed the probability of target attainment and compared efficacy outcomes from ASPECT-NP in participants with augmented renal clearance (ARC) versus those with normal renal function. METHODS: Baseline renal function was categorized as normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80–130 mL/min) or ARC (creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min). Population pharmacokinetic models informed Monte Carlo simulations to assess probability of target attainment in plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid. Outcomes included 28-day all-cause mortality and clinical cure and per-participant microbiologic cure rates at the test-of-cure visit. RESULTS: A > 99% and > 80% probability of target attainment was demonstrated for ceftolozane and tazobactam, respectively, in simulated plasma and epithelial lining fluid. Within treatment arms, 28-day all-cause mortality rates in participants with normal renal function (C/T, n = 131; meropenem, n = 123) and ARC (C/T, n = 96; meropenem, n = 113) were comparable (data comparisons presented as rate; treatment difference [95% CI]) (C/T: normal renal function, 17.6%; ARC, 17.7%; 0.2 [− 9.6 to 10.6]; meropenem: normal renal function, 20.3%; ARC, 17.7%; − 2.6 [− 12.6 to 7.5]). Clinical cure rates at test-of-cure were also comparable across renal function groups within treatment arms (C/T: normal renal function, 57.3%; ARC, 59.4%; − 2.1 [− 14.8 to 10.8]; meropenem: normal renal function, 59.3%; ARC, 57.5%; 1.8 [− 10.6 to 14.2]). Per-participant microbiologic cure rates at test-of-cure were consistent across renal function groups within treatment arms (C/T: normal renal function, 72.2% [n/N = 70/97]; ARC, 71.4% [n/N = 55/77]; 0.7 [− 12.4 to 14.2]; meropenem: normal renal function, 75.0% [n/N = 66/88]; ARC, 70.0% [n/N = 49/70]; 5.0 [− 8.7 to 19.0]). CONCLUSIONS: C/T and meropenem resulted in 28-day all-cause mortality, clinical cure, and microbiologic cure rates that were comparable between participants with ARC or normal renal function. In conjunction with high probability of target attainment, these results confirm that C/T (3 g) every 8 h is appropriate in patients with HABP/VABP and ARC.

In preclinical studies in rats, IV BCV dosed twice weekly for up to 29 days was not associated with gastrointestinal (GI), hematopoietic, hepatic, or renal toxicity. This study evaluated the safety and PK of IV BCV in healthy subjects. METHODS: In this double-blind study, subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive IV BCV or placebo in sequential single ascending dose cohorts (Table 1). Plasma PK samples were collected over 7 days and assayed by HPLC-MS. Plasma BCV PK parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis and dose proportionality was assessed. Safety assessments were collected over 14 days. RESULTS: Forty healthy male subjects (18–46 years, 83% White) were enrolled and completed the study. Plasma BCV Cmax and AUC∞ increased in proportion to dose (Table 1). AEs and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations were dose- and infusion duration-related (Table 1). GI AEs were mild. All AEs and ALT elevations were transient and no serious AEs occurred. CONCLUSION: Single doses of BCV 10–50 mg administered as a 2h IV infusion were well tolerated and not associated with significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities. BCV IV 10 mg and BCV IV 50 mg achieved geometric mean plasma BCV AUC∞ similar to and 4.5-fold, respectively, values achieved with BCV oral 100 mg tablets (Cmax = 251 ng/mL and AUC∞ = 1394 ng hours/mL).

METHODS: The study was organized in three phases: an environmental scan to describe current research activity in BC; a consultation to identify needs, gaps and opportunities with those conducting research (key informants) and the end users of research results (stakeholders); and a prioritization of the research needs emerging from the consultation. RESULTS: Analysis and synthesis of the consultation data resulted in the identification of nine research themes, which were prioritized in the following order: efficacy and cost-benefit, disease patterns, emerging infectious disease, immunology and vaccines, disease-specific research, health promotion and communications, safe food and water, knowledge translation research and genomics. Six capacity-building themes were also identified: attraction and retention, education and training, collaboration and networks, funding, dissemination of findings, and public health input, surveillance, informatics and databases. INTERPRETATION: The findings were helpful in developing a multi-disciplinary, multi-level infectious disease research agenda linking researchers in universities, hospitals and public health institutions with practitioners and policy-makers in British Columbia’s public health system.

One possible strategy for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis is the oral administration of rotavirus specific immunoglobulin. We utilized a mouse model of rotavirus infection to examine the efficacy of rotavirus antibody for the prevention of symptomatic rotavirus diarrhea. This model consists of the feeding of seronegative infant mice a predetermined amount of murine rotavirus and antibody and then assaying the animals for intestinal antigen excretion, liquid colonic contents, and immune response. We found that mouse serum containing homologous antibodies to murine rotavirus completely protected animals from symptomatic infection and viral shedding while non-immune serum provided no protection. Neither immune nor non-immune mouse milk offered any protection from infection. In the case of heterologous sources of sera obtained from animals experimentally infected with human or bovine rotaviruses, and antibodies derived from the yolks of eggs obtained from chickens immunized with rotaviruses full protection was provided from symptomatic disease. Non-immune sera and immune human milk did not protect the animal from infection. The majority of the animals treated with effective specific immunoglobulin preparations developed a rotavirus systemic antibody response. These studies indicate that homologous and heterologous sources of rotavirus antibodies can provide protection from rotavirus diarrhea and may allow for active immunity to occur.","Losonsky, Genevieve A; Eiden, Joseph; Vonderfecht, Steve; Yolken, Robert",Pediatr Res,182,1

Such viruses are identified as “biohazard-level 4” agents and are treated at the highest level of infection protection with strict isolation measures. At least 14 patients with Ebola disease were transported to Europe and the United States (11 patients) for hospital treatment during the African epidemic in 2014. There were no secondary spread of VHF import cases in Europe and the United States from 1999 until the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Then there were three cases of nosocomial spread to personnel in hospitals, two in the United States and one in Spain, despite alleged use of strict containment routines. This indicates a high risk of spread of infection through intensive treatment and handling of very sick persons with VHF like Ebola. In most cases vaccines are not available or specific antiviral drugs. Therefore, infection control must be based on a proper infection protection.

Throughout history, those caring for the injured, dying and dead put themselves at risk of harm, infection or contamination. Recent events include the 2014–2016 infectious outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and the targeting of health facilities in the conflict in Syria. Decisions by HCWs to care for others in the face of such risks have been lauded as heroic whether undertaken for personal moral reasons or in response to an ethical duty to care. However, some have questioned whether such a duty to care is ethically obligatory in the face of some CBRNE events. Ethical analysis of the SARS outbreak found that additional ethical reflection was needed on HCWs’ obligations during CBRNE events. The ethical arguments used to justify the duty to care are reviewed in this chapter. However, other duties exist for HCWs which may conflict with the duty to care. The World Health Organization’s guidance on ethics in pandemics notes that the duty to provide care in pandemics is not unlimited, and that employers and governments have reciprocal obligations to provide training and protective equipment to HCWs during CBRNE. Empirical research raises questions about whether health care organisations are adequately prepared for CBRNE, particularly for the ethical decision-making that will be required. Rather than taking a regulatory or legal approach to this issue, this chapter will argue that the ethical virtues of courage and volunteerism should be fostered in HCW training. In keeping with a virtue ethics approach, leadership takes on an important role in ethical decision-making, as well as praising those who respond to CBRNE by caring for others in spite of the personal risks and their conflicting obligations.","O’Mathúna, Dónal P.","Ethics and Law for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear & Explosive Crises",182,17

There is certainly no doubt that genetic differences impact on the risk of developing or dying from infection. Obvious but rare examples include selective immunoglobulin deficiencies, complement deficiencies, and neutrophil function abnormalities. Genetic factors may also be protective, such as with sickle cell trait and malaria or mutations conferring resistance to human immunodeficiency virus infection. Much more subtle differences in immune responses are now being described, usually as the result of one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a gene. Rather than causing the failure of production of a protein or the production of a nonfunctional protein, SNPs are usually associated with changes in the rate of transcription, producing a much less severe phenotype than the classical examples of genetic defects mentioned above. It is now being appreciated that for many complex diseases, such as sepsis, the ultimate phenotype is the result of the interaction of genetic differences across many loci, not the dominant effect of a few key mutations. As seen in Fig. 3.1, since the mid 1990s, an increasing body of literature has focused on the role that gene polymorphisms in key inflammatory genes play in sepsis. Indeed, with advances in knowledge of the human genome, greater understanding of the inflammatory response, and the development of high throughput genotyping technologies, so many genetic associations have been described that discussion of each one is well beyond the scope of this chapter. I will however summarize those findings that have been reported by multiple groups, as well as give an overview of the major groups of genes that have been implicated in genetic predisposition to sepsis and its adverse outcomes.","Waterer, Grant W.",Sepsis,182,31

Label-free detection of different bioanalytes such as enzymes, viruses, microorganisms, and blood groups through mass-sensitive transducers has gained considerable importance in the development of modern biosensors. Analyte molecules interact with the surface of sensitive layer coated on these devices and as a result of this interaction, the frequency change is determined, which provides quantitative information about the mass of analyte. One of the most vital elements of these detection systems is to design selective sensor coatings through control surface structuring at nanoscale. Molecular imprinting has proven to be a highly suitable technique to generate selective surfaces that are capable of detecting different analytes, quantitatively and qualitatively as well. The tailor-made synthetic antibody cavities are rigid and stable, which are not immediately collapsed upon analyte interaction; moreover, the different bioanalytes do not undergo any phase change and maintain their original identity during analysis.

Severe forms tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly, since their immune competence is eroded by immaturity and immune senescence, respectively. The main etiologic agents differ according to patient age and geographic area. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3) are the most important pathogens in children, whereas influenza viruses are the leading cause of fatal pneumonia in the elderly. Effective vaccines are available against some of these organisms. However, there are still many agents against which vaccines are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal. To tackle this problem, empiric approaches are now being systematically replaced by rational vaccine design. This is facilitated by the growing knowledge in the fields of immunology, microbial pathogenesis and host response to infection, as well as by the availability of sophisticated strategies for antigen selection, potent immune modulators and efficient antigen delivery systems. Thus, a new generation of vaccines with improved safety and efficacy profiles compared to old and new agents is emerging. In this chapter, an overview is provided about currently available and new vaccination concepts.","Becker, Pablo D.; Guzmán, Carlos A.",Community-Acquired Pneumonia,182,1

Als Teil der angeborenen Abwehr ist es jederzeit verfügbar und somit bereits in der Präimmunphase von unschätzbarem Wert, bevor es zur Bereitstellung spezifischer Antikörper und T-Lymphozyten kommt. Zu seinen Effektorfunktionen zählen neben der lytischen Zerstörung pathogener Mikroorganismen die Beseitigung von Immunkomplexen, die Opsonisierung nicht nur von Krankheitserregern, sondern auch von autoantigenem Material für eine effiziente Phagozytose sowie die Rekrutierung und Aktivierung von Entzündungszellen. Darüber hinaus moduliert das Komplementsystem aber auch die Antwort des erworbenen Immunsystems. Außerdem wird in zunehmendem Maße die Rolle des Komplementsystems in so unterschiedlichen biologischen Prozessen wie der Hämatopoese, Fortpflanzung und der Organregeneration deutlich, so dass die Vorstellung von Komplement als reinem Abwehrsystem erweitert werden muss zu einem mit vielen biologischen Funktionen vernetzten und steuernden System zur Aufrechterhaltung der Homöostase. Etwa 5 % aller Plasmaproteine sind Komplementfaktoren, die zum überwiegenden Teil in der Leber und durch Makrophagen synthetisiert werden.

In 1990, Romania inherited a functional and quite efficient epidemiological surveillance system from the former communist regime, based on pyramidal and autocratic principles where the state control was absolute. In 2001, the assessment conducted by WHO/Europe showed many unsatisfactory elements of the remaining epidemiological surveillance system for communicable diseases, with a lack of procedures, poor microbiology laboratory capacities, and overlapping responsibilities. The lack of a coordinating body was evident, especially during bioterrorist threats following 9/11 attacks in New York. In 2003 and 2004, the PHARE Project offered an important opportunity for Romania to improve the Romanian System of Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases. At the end of this project many of the technical capacities had been improved, specialized trainings of epidemiologists and microbiologists were carried out, and a coordinating body of the epidemiological surveillance network was established [1]. Furthermore, a National Plan of Action was approved by the Minister of Health with the declared objective to improve the system in order to comply with EU standards. At present, the National Institute of Public Health hosts the National Center for Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control which coordinates the epidemiological network and serves as the Romanian focal point for international institutions such as WHO and ECDC. Each year, comprehensive reports regarding surveillance in Romania of many communicable diseases are published, including diseases potentially related to bioterrorism. Until now, no evidence of a bioterrorism event has been registered in Romania.","Rafila, Alexandru; Pitigoi, Daniela",Biopreparedness and Public Health,182,17

This is intuitively useful for generalization, especially in Named-Entity Recognition where it is crucial to detect mentions never seen during training. However, standard English benchmarks overestimate the importance of lexical over contextual features because of an unrealistic lexical overlap between train and test mentions. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art contextualized embeddings by separating mentions by novelty and with out-of-domain evaluation. We show that they are particularly beneficial for unseen mentions detection, especially out-of-domain. For models trained on CoNLL03, language model contextualization leads to a +1.2% maximal relative micro-F1 score increase in-domain against +13% out-of-domain on the WNUT dataset (The code is available at https://github.com/btaille/contener).","Taillé, Bruno; Guigue, Vincent; Gallinari, Patrick",Advances in Information Retrieval,182,17

In such networks, entities may share common or similar attributes and may be connected by paths through multiple attribute modalities. In this work, we present an approach that uses semantically meaningful, bimodal random walks on real-world heterogeneous networks to extract correlations between nodes and bring together nodes with shared or similar attributes. An attention-based mechanism is used to combine multiple attribute-specific representations in a late fusion setup. We focus on a real-world network formed by restaurants and their shared attributes and evaluate performance on predicting the number of reviews a restaurant receives, a strong proxy for popularity. Our results demonstrate the rich expressiveness of such representations in predicting review volume and the ability of an attention-based model to selectively combine individual representations for maximum predictive power on the chosen downstream task.","Sharma, Ujjwal; Rudinac, Stevan; Worring, Marcel; Demmers, Joris; van Dolen, Willemijn",Advances in Information Retrieval,182,1

Recent studies suggested that BCG, the only licensed vaccine against M. tuberculosis, may fail to induce T‐cell responses in the lung mucosa and may therefore not protect against pulmonary TB. A decrease in TB mortality may be achieved by enhancing immunity in the lung. The present study evaluated the induction of antigen‐specific immunity in the lung by intranasal (i.n.) delivery of the lipoprotein I (OprI) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. OprI has shown to be a Toll‐like receptor 2/4 agonist that, when given subcutaneously, induces Type‐1 immune responses against heterologous antigens. Here, a fusion of OprI to Ag85A of Mtb (OprI‐Ag85A) was used as a subunit vaccine in homologous prime‐boost immunizations. In addition, OprI‐Ag85A was combined with an Ag85A‐encoding DNA vaccine (Ag85A DNA) or with BCG in heterologous prime‐boost vaccinations. Intranasal and parenteral delivery with OprI‐Ag85A elicited comparable T‐cell responses in the spleen; in addition, i.n. delivery elicited specific T‐cell responses in the lung lymph nodes (LLNs). Intramuscular delivery of Ag85A DNA induced significant systemic Th1 immune responses. Intranasal boosting with OprI‐Ag85A enhanced this response and in addition induced an antigen‐specific IFN‐γ response in LLN. OprI may therefore be an efficient adjuvant for mucosal boosting. We continue to evaluate the protection induced by OprI‐based prime‐boost vaccinations against pulmonary TB. Results on the immunogenicity and protection against intravenous Mtb H37Rv infection will be presented.","Gartner, T.; Baeten, M.; De Baetselier, P.; Huygen, K.; Revets, H.",Scand J Immunol,182,1

Cell culture allows looking at cells in their entirety from the outside before examining the intricacy of their component parts. Cells are counted in order to seed stock cultures with a known number of viable cells, to determine cell propagation rates, and to determine viability in a cell culture. Most vertebrate cell lines die after a finite number of divisions in cell culture, although rare immortal variant cells arise spontaneously in culture and can be maintained indefinitely as cell lines. DNA cloning and genetic engineering have given techniques that enable isolating specific genes, redesigning them, and inserting them back into cells. This technology has revolutionized the study of living cells. Eukaryotic cell lines are being developed with indefinite replication ability to express at least some of the differentiated properties of their cell of origin and to not necessarily cause tumors if injected into animals.","George, V.G.; Hierholzer, J.C.; Ades, E.W.",Virology Methods Manual,182,1

The infection has been declared as a pandemic by the world health organization (WHO) in March 2020. Health care professionals in endoscopy are at high risk of infection by novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from inhalation of droplets, conjunctival contact, feces, and touch contamination. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is considered to be a high-risk aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and the live virus has been found in patient stool. Flexible endoscopes when contaminated have been considered as the vector for transmission of infections. Infections related to the side viewing endoscopes and endoscopic ultrasound scopes are more frequent than upper GI scope and colonoscopes. Stratifying patients needing endoscopy and deferral of elective procedures will help to decrease the virus spread. Planning and revision of workflows is necessary for safety of patient and staff and to successfully provide infection prevention and control measures, for this a “three zones and two passages” concept should be followed. Manual cleaning followed by high-level disinfection (HLD), effectively eliminates nearly all microorganisms from endoscopes during reprocessing. Transmission of viral infections during endoscopy is quite rare and, it is usually the result of noncompliance from the essential steps of reprocessing. Reuse of any disposable GI endoscopic device is strongly discouraged. Environmental decontamination is essential to reduce the risk of fomite transmission. Noncritical environmental surfaces frequently touched by hands (e.g., bedside tables and bed rails) and endoscopy furniture and floor should be considered heavily contaminated in patients with intermediate or high risk of COVID-19 and should be thoroughly disinfected at the end of each procedure. If available, negative pressure rooms are preferred for endoscopy, as has been advised by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Staff involved in reprocessing and the cleaning of endoscopy rooms should utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 mask. Reprocessing staff should undergo necessary training and ongoing annual assessment of competency.","Rai, Praveer",,182,1

METHODS: For this prospective, cross-sectional study, 44 CQ/HCQ patients and 25 age-matched controls underwent multimodal retinal imaging including QAF (488 nm) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in addition to the recommended CQ/HCQ screening procedures. Custom written FIJI plugins enabled detailed QAF analysis and correlation with retinal thickness and comparison to the healthy controls. RESULTS: Out of 44 patients, 29 (mean age 43.5 ± 12.2, range 22–59 years) exposed to CQ/HCQ (mean cumulative dose 724.2 ± 610.4 g, median 608.0 g, range 18.6–2171.0 g) met eligibility criteria. Four of these 29 patients had bull's-eye maculopathy (BEM). Mean QAF values were significantly higher in CQ/HCQ patients than in healthy controls. QAF increase started early after treatment onset, remained high even years after treatment cessation, and was not accompanied by pathologies in the other screening methods, including retinal thicknesses (except in BEM patients). CONCLUSIONS: QAF might be a useful tool in retinal imaging and in verifying systemic CQ/HCQ intake. The early onset and preserved high levels of QAF parallel findings of CQ deposition in the retina in animal models. Whether QAF can be used as a screening tool to detect early CQ/HCQ related maculopathy is the subject of long-term ongoing studies. TRANSLATION RELEVANCE: Experimental QAF imaging in systemic CQ/HCQ therapy monitoring might be a useful tool to indicate the drug or its metabolites and to detect metabolic retinal changes.","Reichel, Clara; Berlin, Andreas; Radun, Victoria; Tarau, Ioana-Sandra; Hillenkamp, Jost; Kleefeldt, Nikolai; Sloan, Kenneth R.; Ach, Thomas",Transl Vis Sci Technol,182,1

Previous findings have suggested a relationship between infection with Schistosoma spp. and alterations in the liver and spleen of infected animals. Recent reports have shown the regulatory role of noncoding RNAs, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), in different biological processes. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in the mouse liver and spleen during Schistosoma japonicum infection. METHODS: In this study, we identified and investigated lncRNAs using standard RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The biological functions of the altered expression of lncRNAs and their target genes were predicted using bioinformatics. Ten dysregulated lncRNAs were selected randomly and validated in reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) experiments. RESULTS: Our study identified 29,845 and 33,788 lncRNAs from the liver and spleen, respectively, of which 212 were novel lncRNAs. We observed that 759 and 789 of the lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the respective organs. The RT-qPCR results correlated well with the sequencing data. In the liver, 657 differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to target 2548 protein-coding genes, whereas in the spleen 660 differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to target 2673 protein-coding genes. Moreover, functional annotation showed that the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were associated with cellular processes, metabolic processes, and binding, and were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, the cell cycle, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and pathways in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that numerous lncRNAs were differentially expressed in S. japonicum-infected liver and spleen compared to control liver and spleen; this suggested that lncRNAs may be involved in pathogenesis in the liver and spleen during S. japonicum infection.

The introduction of “Nakamoto style” consensus, based on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, put forth a somewhat different flavor of BA, showing that even a majority of corrupted parties can be tolerated as long as the majority of the computation resources remain at honest hands. This assumption on honest majority of some resource was also extended to other resources such as stake, space, etc., upon which blockchains achieving Nakamoto-style consensus were built that violated the [Formula: see text] bound in terms of number of party corruptions. The above state of affairs begs the question of whether the seeming mismatch is due to different goals and models, or whether the resource-restricting paradigm can be generically used to circumvent the n/3 lower bound. In this work we study this question and formally demonstrate how the above paradigm changes the rules of the game in cryptographic definitions. First, we abstract the core properties that the resource-restricting paradigm offers by means of a functionality wrapper, in the UC framework, which when applied to a standard point-to-point network restricts the ability (of the adversary) to send new messages. We show that such a wrapped network can be implemented using the resource-restricting paradigm—concretely, using PoWs and honest majority of computing power—and that the traditional [Formula: see text] impossibility results fail when the parties have access to such a network. Our construction is in the fresh Common Reference String (CRS) model—i.e., it assumes a CRS which becomes available to the parties at the same time as to the adversary. We then present constructions for BA and MPC, which given access to such a network tolerate [Formula: see text] corruptions without assuming a private correlated randomness setup. We also show how to remove the freshness assumption from the CRS by leveraging the power of a random oracle. Our MPC protocol achieves the standard notion of MPC security, where parties might have dedicated roles, as is for example the case in Oblivious Transfer protocols. This is in contrast to existing solutions basing MPC on PoWs, which associate roles to pseudonyms but do not link these pseudonyms with the actual parties.","Garay, Juan; Kiayias, Aggelos; Ostrovsky, Rafail M.; Panagiotakos, Giorgos; Zikas, Vassilis",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,182,1

However, a recent Cochrane review (2) identified no community pharmacy services focused on mental health. AIM: We aimed to pilot a mental health support service, in community pharmacy: Advancing Mental Health Provision in Pharmacy (AMPLIPHY) to assess its feasibility and potential benefit METHODS: The AMPLIPHY service was codesigned through a workshop involving people with lived experience, pharmacists and researchers. The resultant programme is a series of consultations, beginning at the presentation of the qualifying prescription for an antidepressant, after a further 1–2 weeks and then as further prescriptions are presented, up to 3 months. People are eligible to enter the service if they are newly prescribed antidepressants for depression or anxiety, or have a change in medication, dose or quantity. Pharmacists and their teams identified people who met this criterion and invited them to participate. The service was intended to be patient-led, with the pharmacist helping the patient to define tangible aims and/or outcomes that they wanted to focus on, and providing sign-posting where required. Following brief one-day training, the pilot ran across ten pharmacies in Greater Manchester from November 2019 through March 2020. We triangulated results from: a) quantitative analysis of consultation data; b) content analysis of consultation records; and c) template analysis of semi-structured interviews with participating pharmacists at the start and end of the service. We aimed to obtain feedback from people on exit from the AMPLIPHY service, but this was curtailed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Consultations were recorded via the Pharmoutcomes system (a,b) and interviews were recorded and transcribed, with NVivo used to manage the interview dataset (c). RESULTS: Seventy-six patients participated in the service, across 9 of the 10 pharmacies. Seventy-five percent of patients had just one consultation. The median age was 39 (IQR 28–47) and 62% of patients were women. Most patients entered the service due to new prescription of antidepressant (74%), 17% due to a change in dose and the remainder due to change in medication or quantity. Sertraline was the most commonly prescribed medication (46%). The content analysis is indicating that consultations centred around one of five areas: health (n=31), lifestyle (n=62), medication (n=45), support (n=37) and patient’s descriptions of their feelings (n=31). CONCLUSION: AMPLIPHY was accessed by a range of people, mainly on initiation of a new antidepressant. Parallels might be drawn with the New Medicines Service in England, but this does not currently extend to antidepressants. Consultations were not restricted to health and medication, but extended to other social and lifestyle aspects thus indicated that participants felt comfortable to disclose their personal situations to the pharmacist. This could support tailored interactions. However, more work is warranted to understand why most patients did not attend multiple consultations, and the immediate/ long-term impact from the patient’s perspective. REFERENCES: 1. NHS.

Depending on the academic calendar schedule, some schools were interrupted in the middle of anatomy teaching while others had more lead time to prepare but schools suddenly faced an imposed demand for a transition to distance learning. SUNY Downstate had its anatomy education interrupted due to the Covid‐19 shut down. To gap the previous laboratory experience of students and complete the semester anatomy curriculum, a series of dissected abdominal videos were created and distributed to all first‐year medical students (n=208). The video‐based curriculum and the current student experience taking anatomy without cadaveric dissections were assessed via pre/post‐tests and a five‐question survey. A paired single tailed t‐test comparing student responses (n=164) in the pre‐ versus post‐test was statistically significant (P < 0.002) while 92% of students (n=136) reported that their previous time dissecting prepared them to learn through videos without the benefit of hands‐on dissection. Icahn School of Medicine adopted digital Grant's Dissector utilizing their accompanying narrated videos. Faculty voiced over the narration, however, permitting emphasis of material, directing pacing of course, and tying content to lecture and physical exams. Complete anatomy was used to augment the experience, with 3D virtual dissections and enhance the visualization of the structures, however the videos remained as the driver of content delivery. Weill Cornell Medicine created, and customized anatomy prosected material videotaping the show and tell sessions integrating powerpoint slides to tie in lecture content and clinical correlates. Results from all three schools highlight the technical success of implementing an anatomy video‐based curriculum in response to COVID‐19. Survey findings describe a unique cohort of students who were compelled to participate in a video‐based curriculum after having learned anatomy in a donor body laboratory environment and student performance on summative exams in general equaled or exceeded scores from previous years. Overall, anatomy education through videos, digital platforms, and apps can offer a reliable stop‐gap solution in the absence of traditional cadaveric dissection in a short‐term, provisional model. However, the experience of learning anatomy from a human body in laboratory is irreplaceable and the future now seems to point to a combination of these modalities, and others, such as virtual reality or augmented reality, yet to be adapted and customized to our educational settings.","Griepp, Daniel; Sajan, Abin; Lee, Jason; Curcio, Daniella; Mtui, Estomih; Marquez, Samuel",FASEB J,182,1

Additionally, a specially designed oral image acquisition device was developed to perform image acquisition of maxillary and mandibular teeth. Two evaluation metrics, namely, tooth disease and NPDT classifications, were examined using 610 compounded and 5251 tooth images annotated by an experienced dentist with a Doctor of Dental Surgery and another dentist with a Doctor of Dental Medicine. In the tooth disease and NPDT classifications, the proposed system showed accuracies greater than 96% and 89%, respectively.

We lack an effective vaccine and understanding of what constitutes protective immunity against TB to inform rational vaccine design. Moreover, treatment of TB requires prolonged use of multi-drug regimens and is complicated by problems of compliance and drug resistance. While most Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli are quickly killed by the drugs, the prolonged course of treatment is required to clear persistent drug-tolerant subpopulations. Mtb’s differential sensitivity to drugs is, at least in part, determined by the interaction between the bacilli and different host macrophage populations. Therefore, to design better treatment regimens for TB, we need to understand and modulate the heterogeneity and divergent responses that Mtb bacilli exhibit within macrophages. However, developing drugs de-novo is a long and expensive process. An alternative approach to expedite the development of new TB treatments is to repurpose existing drugs that were developed for other therapeutic purposes if they also possess anti-tuberculosis activity. There is growing interest in the use of immune modulators to supplement current anti-TB drugs by enhancing the host’s antimycobacterial responses. Ion channel blocking agents are among the most promising of the host-directed therapeutics. Some ion channel blockers also interfere with the activity of mycobacterial efflux pumps. In this review, we discuss some of the ion channel blockers that have shown promise as potential anti-TB agents.","Mitini-Nkhoma, Steven C.; Chimbayo, Elizabeth T.; Mzinza, David T.; Mhango, David V.; Chirambo, Aaron P.; Mandalasi, Christine; Lakudzala, Agness E.; Tembo, Dumizulu L.; Jambo, Kondwani C.; Mwandumba, Henry C.",Front Immunol,182,1

Since Btk is also involved in specific pathways of platelet activation, BTKi might be considered to target platelet GPVI/GPIb-mediated atherothrombosis and platelet FcγRIIA-dependent immune disorders. However, BTKi treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies is frequently associated with mild bleeding events caused possibly by off-target inhibition of Tec. Here, we compared the platelet effects of two novel BTKi that exhibit a high (remibrutinib) or low (rilzabrutinib) selectivity for Btk over Tec. Methods and Results: Remibrutinib and rilzabrutinib were pre-incubated with anticoagulated blood. Platelet aggregation and in vitro bleeding time (closure time) were studied by multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) and platelet-function analyzer-200 (PFA-200), respectively. Both BTKi inhibited atherosclerotic plaque-stimulated GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation, remibrutinib being more potent (IC(50) = 0.03 μM) than rilzabrutinib (IC(50) = 0.16 μM). Concentrations of remibrutinib (0.1 μM) and rilzabrutinib (0.5 μM), >80% inhibitory for plaque-induced aggregation, also significantly suppressed (>90%) the Btk-dependent pathways of platelet aggregation upon GPVI, von Willebrand factor/GPIb and FcγRIIA activation stimulated by low collagen concentrations, ristocetin and antibody cross-linking, respectively. Both BTKi did not inhibit aggregation stimulated by ADP, TRAP-6 or arachidonic acid. Remibrutinib (0.1 μM) only slightly prolonged closure time and significantly less than rilzabrutinib (0.5 μM). Conclusion: Remibrutinib and rilzabrutinib inhibit Btk-dependent pathways of platelet aggregation upon GPVI, VWF/GPIb, and FcγRIIA activation. Remibrutinib being more potent and showing a better profile of inhibition of Btk-dependent platelet activation vs. hemostatic impairment than rilzabrutinib may be considered for further development as an antiplatelet drug.","Duan, Rundan; Goldmann, Luise; Brandl, Richard; Spannagl, Michael; Weber, Christian; Siess, Wolfgang; von Hundelshausen, Philipp",Front Cardiovasc Med,182,11

After the application of immunosuppressants (IS), renal allograft recipients could reach a state called accommodation which means they are neither rejected nor infected. This study aimed to describe the details of this immune accommodation and reveal a novel mechanism of IS on immune cell subpopulations. Methods: We analyzed multiple cell subgroups and their gene expression of peripheral T, B, myeloid, and NK cells from renal allograft recipients with accommodation and healthy control (HC) by single-cell transcriptomics sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. Results: A total of 8,272 cells were isolated and sequenced from three individuals, including 2,758 cells from HC, 2,550 cells from ESRD patient, and 2,964 cells from KTx patient, as well as 396 immune response–related genes were detected during sequencing. 5 T-cell, 4 NK-cell, 5 myeloid, and 4 B-cell clusters were defined. Among them, a B-cell subset (CD19(+)IGLC3(low)IGKC(high)TCL1A(-)CD127(+)) of renal transplant recipients with accommodation was significantly lower than that of HC and verified by flow cytometry, and this B-cell subset showed an activated potential because of its high expression of CD127. Furthermore, we found that IL32 might be the key cytokine to induce the differentiation of this B-cell cluster. Conclusion: We found a novel B-cell subset (CD19(+)IGLC3(low)IGKC(high)TCL1A(-)CD127(+)) which was inhibited and decreased in renal allograft recipients with accommodation.

In this study, we exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to 5- or 50-mM ethanol and performed transcriptomics to investigate the systemic effects of ethanol. While these concentrations of ethanol did not significantly affect HUVEC viability, 5-mM ethanol significantly upregulated and downregulated 59 and 73 genes, respectively, whereas 50-mM ethanol significantly upregulated and downregulated 50 and 80 genes, respectively. Totally, 37 genes were shared by the two concentrations of ethanol. The most significantly altered gene ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway after 5-mM ethanol treatment were nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676) and Herpes simplex virus 1 infection (ko05168), respectively, whereas the most significantly altered GO term and KEGG pathway by 50-mM ethanol treatment were aryl sulfotransferase activity (GO:0004062) and chemical carcinogenesis (ko05204).

60847,60847,60847,Case Report: Bowel Occlusion Following the Use of Barbed Sutures in Abdominal Surgery. A Single-Center Experience and Literature Review.,14.105014,8.545403,2021,"PURPOSE Although the intensive care unit (ICU) diary has been proposed as a tool for preventing psychiatric symptoms in survivors of critical illness, relatives and health care providers may benefit from it too. This study aims to summarize the current qualitative evidence on families' and health care professionals' experiences of writing in and reading the ICU diaries. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, OVID, Embase, and EBSCOhost from inception to February 2021, and included all the studies that presented any qualitative finding regarding relatives' and health care providers' experiences of writing in and reading an ICU diary. We used modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) for quality assessment. A thematic synthesis approach was used to analyze and synthesize the qualitative data. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies were analyzed (15 including family members and 13 including health care professionals). For family members, the ICU diary is an important source of medical information, provides a way for them to register their presence at patient's bedside and express their feelings, and contributes to humanizing the ICU staff. This impression is shared by relatives of patients who did not survive critical illness. Health care providers believe the diary is beneficial for themselves and others; however, they are concerned with possible negative impressions from patients and family that could lead to judicial problems. They also remark on several obstacles they face when constructing the diaries (workload, creativity, and environment for writing), which can make it a distressful process. CONCLUSION This qualitative synthesis shows that family members and health care professionals consider the ICU diary a valuable intervention. It also brings evidence to challenges faced during diary writing, which should be carefully approached in order to reduce the stress associated with this process.","Brandao Barreto, Bruna; Luz, Mariana; do Amaral Lopes, Selma Alves Valente; Rosa, Regis Goulart; Gusmao-Flores, Dimitri",Intensive care medicine,182,1

Objectives The objectives were to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating efficacy, safety and satisfaction of medical abortion at ≥ 12 weeks' gestation. Data sources We searched PubMed, Popline, Embase, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from January 2008 to May 2017. Study eligibility participants and interventions We included RCTs on medical abortion at ≥ 12 weeks' gestation using mifepristone and/or misoprostol. We excluded studies with spontaneous abortion, fetal demise and mechanical cervical ripening and those not reporting ongoing pregnancy (OP). Study appraisal and synthesis methods After extracting prespecified data and assessing risk of bias in accordance with the Cochrane handbook, we used Revman5 software to combine data and GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results We included 43 of the 1894 references identified. Combination mifepristone-misoprostol had lower rates of OP [risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.35] vs. misoprostol only. A 24-h interval between mifepristone and misoprostol had lower OP rate at 24 h than simultaneous dosing (RR 3.13, 95% CI 1.23-7.94). Every 3-h dosing had lower OP rate at 48 h (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17-0.88). Limitations Direct comparisons of buccal misoprostol to sublingual or vaginal routes after mifepristone were limited. Evidence from clinical trials on how to best manage women with prior uterine incisions was lacking. Conclusion Our analysis supports the use of mifepristone 200 mg 1 to 2 days before misoprostol 400 mcg vaginally every 3 h at ≥ 12 weeks' gestation. Implications Where available, providers should use mifepristone plus misoprostol for second-trimester medical abortion. Vaginal misoprostol appears to be most efficacious with fewest side effects, but sublingual and buccal routes are also acceptable.","Whitehouse, Katherine; Brant, Ashley; Fonhus, Marita Sporstol; Lavelanet, Antonella; Ganatra, Bela",Contraception: X,182,13

This study aimed at reviewing the published literature in Ethiopia to estimate the prevalence of MRPs and to summarize associated factors. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Google databases from inception to April 2020. Articles that addressed MRPs were eligible for inclusion. Article screening, data extraction, and study quality analysis were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies targeting specific disease condition were considered as specific, while the remaining were nonspecific. The prevalence of MRPs was then computed in medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), while associated factors were summarized in a table. Of the thirty-two studies included in this review, the majority of them (n = 24) targeted MRPs, while the remaining studies (n = 8) investigated adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Studies varied in the study design, study population, and definition of MRPs and ADRs used. The overall median prevalence was 70.8% (IQR = 61.0-80.2) with a range of 16.0% to 88.7%. The median prevalence of MRPs in specific and nonspecific patients was 71.2% (IQR = 60.7-71.2) and 69.3% (IQR = 60.7-82.0), respectively. In addition, a median of 36.6% (IQR = 10.0-85.7) of patients experienced ADRs. Indication-related and effectiveness-related MRPs were commonly reported in both specific and nonspecific patients, while noncompliance MRPs were more prevalent among specific patients than nonspecific patients. Increasing age, presence of co-morbidity, and an increasing number of drugs were the commonly identified contributing factors of MRPs. The review showed that more than two-thirds of the study participants developed MRPs. Hence, an integrated approach should be designed to improve the optimal use of pharmacotherapy to reduce the burden of MRPs. Further, future research should be undertaken to prepare cost-effective and efficient prevention mechanisms to reduce or halt the development of MRPs.","Kefale, Belayneh; Degu, Amsalu; Tegegne, Gobezie T",Pharmacology research & perspectives,182,1

Because periodontal treatment reduces inflammation in oral tissues, some hypothesize it may positively affect systemic outcomes by reducing inflammation in the body. A significant number of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) have evaluated the effect of periodontal treatment on systemic outcomes. However, inconsistent findings and questionable methodological rigor make drawing conclusions difficult. We conducted a systematic review of reviews that studied the effect of nonsurgical periodontal treatment on systemic disease outcomes. We report on outcomes evaluated, categorizing them as biomarkers, and surrogate or clinical endpoints. In addition, we used A MeaSurement Tool to Access systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) to evaluate the methodological quality of the reviews. Of the 52 studies included in our review, 21 focused on diabetes, 15 on adverse birth outcomes, 8 on cardiovascular disease, 3 each on obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, and 2 on chronic kidney disease. Across all studies, surrogate endpoints predominated as outcomes, followed by biomarkers and, rarely, actual disease endpoints. Ninety-two percent of studies had ""low"" or ""critically low"" AMSTAR 2 confidence ratings. Criteria not met most frequently included advance registration of the protocol, justification for excluding individual studies, risk of bias from individual studies being included in the review, and appropriateness of meta-analytical methods. There is a dearth of robust evidence on whether nonsurgical periodontal treatment improves systemic disease outcomes. Future reviews should adhere more closely to methodological guidelines for conducting and reporting SRs/MAs than has been the case to date. Beyond improved reviews, additional rigorous research on whether periodontal treatment affects systemic health is needed. We highlight the potential of large-scale databases containing matched medical and dental record data to inform and complement future clinical research studying the effect of periodontal treatment on systemic outcomes.","Taylor, H L; Rahurkar, S; Treat, T J; Thyvalikakath, T P; Schleyer, T K",Journal of dental research,182,1

METHODS A total of 120 patients who underwent LRYGB or LSG from 2011 to 2013 were enrolled and followed-up for 5 years. Changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), percent weight loss (%WL), and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were recorded. RESULT %WL and %EWL were similar between two procedures at 1 year following operation. In patients who underwent LSG, %WL and %EWL were 24.6 ± 1.3% and 61.9 ± 3.5%, respectively, and in LRYGB were 30.4 ± 1.3% and 79.4 ± 3.6%, respectively, 5 years after surgery. Weight regain was 32.0% in LSG and 9.3% in LRYGB after 5 years. The remission rate of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was 70%, 54%, and 100%, respectively, after 5 years of surgery. CONCLUSION Comparing the 5-year success rate of these two techniques, LRYGB seems to be superior to LSG, with lower weight regain and higher weight loss. The short- and long-term effects of two procedures on remission of comorbidities were comparable.","Toolabi, Karamollah; Sarkardeh, Maryam; Vasigh, Mahtab; Golzarand, Mahdieh; Vezvaei, Payam; Kooshki, Javad",Obesity surgery,182,4

Weight loss strategies that easily can be integrated into daily life are needed, but knowledge about how TRE affects daily life is lacking. This study examined how individuals having overweight or obesity at high risk of type 2 diabetes performed TRE in daily life, with a focus on how the timing of eating changed the organisation and rhythms of daily activities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants enrolled in a randomised controlled trial studying the effect of a 12-week TRE intervention focusing on a self-selected daily 10-hour window between 6 am and 8 pm. Seventeen participants from the intervention group were interviewed at baseline and end of intervention, and data were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants found TRE simple and appealing due to the unrestricted dietary intake. In general, participants did not change their food preferences and continued to eat three main daily meals. However, participants had to increase their awareness of the time of day, reshuffle ordinary daily activities and plan their intake more carefully. Two participants reported fully adherence every day, whereas all other participants reported one to several episodes of intake outside their window during the 12 weeks. Social evening activities and collective rhythms were largest barriers. Our findings suggest that TRE interventions would benefit from a broader perspective on daily life and an expanded view of families and friends as joint units of intervention. TRE interventions should consider individuals' daily rhythms and help them develop practical solutions to integrating new eating practices.","Bjerre, Natasja; Holm, Lotte; Quist, Jonas Salling; Færch, Kristine; Hempler, Nana Folmann",Appetite,182,0

However, clinical features, which can differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19, are not clear. We therefore examined the key clinical features of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. This study included 60 COVID-19 patients and 100 non-COVID-19 patients, diagnosed by PCR, and no significant differences in the age and sex were seen between the two groups. The frequencies of fatigue, loose stool, diarrhea, nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, taste dysfunction, underlying hyperlipidemia, and the prescription of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than those in non-COVID-19 patients. The counts of leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils and the levels of chloride and calcium in blood of COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than those of non-COVID-19 patients. The frequencies of atypical lymphocytes and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and potassium were significantly higher in COVID-19 than those in non-COVID-19. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in COVID-19 patients was significantly lower than that in non-COVID-19 patients, when we compared CRP levels among patients with elevated CRP. This study is the first to indicate that electrolyte levels and the frequency of atypical lymphocytes in COVID-19 are significantly different from those in non-COVID-19. Fatigue, loose stool, diarrhea, nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, and taste dysfunction were the key symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, hyperlipidemia and ARB may be risk factors of COVID-19. In conclusion, leucocytes, leucocyte fractions, CRP, LDH, and electrolytes are useful indicators for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Nakanishi, Hiroki; Suzuki, Motohiko; Maeda, Hiroyoshi; Nakamura, Yoshitaka; Ikegami, Yosuke; Takenaka, Yuya; Mori, Yusuke; Hasuo, Takahiro; Hasegawa, Chihiro",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,182,1

METHODS Patients with imaging both before and at least 3 months after gastric bypass were analyzed. Hepatic duct was measured at the level of the porta hepatis to determine interval changes. RESULTS Thirty-three patients had postoperative imaging at least 3 months following gastric bypass. Mean hepatic duct diameter was 5.2 ± 2 and 7.1 ± 2.6 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients with prior cholecystectomy had hepatic duct diameters of 7.9 ± 1.3 and 9.5 ± 3.5 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p = 0.3). Patients who had not previously undergone cholecystectomy had hepatic duct diameters of 4.3 ± 1.1 and 6.4 ± 1.8 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.01).

METHODS Ebscohost, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science were searched. Eligible studies included controlled interventions with active parent involvement, at least one intervention strategy and outcome measure for unhealthy foods ≥3 months from baseline.

Although the size, composition, complexity, and functions encoded by their genomes are remarkably diverse, all viruses rely absolutely on the protein synthesis machinery of their host cells. Lacking their own translational apparatus, they must recruit cellular ribosomes in order to translate viral mRNAs and produce the protein products required for their replication. In addition, there are other constraints on viral protein production. Crucially, host innate defenses and stress responses capable of inactivating the translation machinery must be effectively neutralized. Furthermore, the limited coding capacity of the viral genome needs to be used optimally.

Most methods include diffusion and perfusion parameters as image-based parameters but do not include any spatial information although these parameters are spatially dependent, e.g. different perfusion properties in white and gray brain matter. This study aims to investigate if including spatial features improves the accuracy of multi-parametric tissue outcome prediction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Acute and follow-up multi-center MRI datasets of 99 patients were available for this study. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost machine learning models were trained and tested using acute MR diffusion and perfusion features and known follow-up lesions. Different combinations of atlas coordinates and lesion probability maps were included as spatial information. The stroke lesion predictions were compared to the true tissue outcomes using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the Dice metric. RESULTS The statistical analysis revealed that including spatial features significantly improves the tissue outcome prediction. Overall, the XGBoost and random forest models performed best in every setting and achieved state-of-the-art results regarding both metrics with similar improvements achieved including Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space coordinates or voxel-wise lesion probabilities.

The purpose of this study was to determine reliability and the physiologic response of the 6-minute push test (6MPT) in youth with SB who self-propel a wheelchair. METHODS In this reliability and observational study, a sample of 53 youth with SB (5-19 years old; mean age = 13 years 7 months; 32 boys and 21 girls) who used a wheelchair performed 2 exercise tests: the 6MPT and shuttle ride test. Heart rate, minute ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, and oxygen consumption were measured using a calibrated mobile gas analysis system and a heart rate monitor. For reliability, ICCs, standard error of measurement, smallest detectable change for total covered distance, minute work, and heart rate were calculated. Physiologic response during the 6MPT was expressed as percentage of maximal values achieved during the shuttle ride test. RESULTS The ICCs for total distance and minute work were excellent (0.95 and 0.97, respectively), and the ICC for heart rate was good (0.81). The physiologic response during the 6MPT was 85% to 89% of maximal values, except for minute ventilation (70.6%).

We hypothesised that a reduction in TM occurs with increasing age. This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at Yonsei University Gangnam Severance Hospital between January 2015 and June 2019. We randomly included 250 eyes of 125 patients who underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The distance from the scleral spur to Schwalbe's line in patients with normal open anterior chamber angle was measured using AS-OCT. Results were stratified based on patients' age group-≤40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years. Thereafter, the results were compared among the age groups. The mean TM height of the patients was 770.929 ± 76.776 μm. TM height was 853.188 ± 94.117 μm in patients aged ≤40 years; it was 815.309 ± 75.723, 798.115 ± 66.040, 770.942 ± 52.774, 726.716 ± 63.979, and 715.968 ± 63.403 μm in patients aged 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years, respectively. The TM height tended to decrease with increasing age (P < 0.001). TM height was significantly shorter in older patients than in younger ones. Therefore, TM height may change with age and may contribute to increased glaucoma risk and prevalence.","Choi, Wungrak; Bae, Hyoung Won; Cho, Hyuna; Kim, Eun Woo; Kim, Chan Yun; Seong, Gong Je",Scientific reports,182,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 on hospital workers and how it was affected by the characteristics of the hospital, gender, age, job and work environment. METHODS In late June 2009, soon after the pandemic had ended in Kobe city, Japan, a questionnaire was distributed consisting of questions on sociodemographic characteristics, 19 stress-related questions and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to all 3635 employees at three core general hospitals in Kobe. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the 19 stress-related questions, and this produced four factors for evaluation (anxiety about infection, exhaustion, workload, and feeling of being protected). Multiple regression models were used to evaluate the association of personal characteristics with each score of the four factors and the IES. RESULTS Valid answers were received from 1625 employees. Workers at a hospital with intense liaison psychiatric services felt less psychological impact. Workers at a hospital that provided staff with information about the pandemic less frequently, felt unprotected. Workers in work environments that had a high risk of infection felt more anxious and more exhausted. The total IES score was higher in workers in high-risk work environments. CONCLUSIONS It is important for hospitals to protect hospital workers during a pandemic and to rapidly share information about the pandemic. Liaison psychiatric services can help to reduce the impact of the pandemic on hospital workers.","Matsuishi, Kunitaka; Kawazoe, Ayako; Imai, Hissei; Ito, Atsushi; Mouri, Kentaro; Kitamura, Noboru; Miyake, Keiko; Mino, Koichi; Isobe, Masanori; Takamiya, Shizuo; Hitokoto, Hidefumi; Mita, Tatsuo",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,182,1

While MMN recorded at the scalp is generated by a distributed network of temporofrontal neural sources, the primary contributing sources and the dynamic interactions among sources underlying MMN impairments in schizophrenia have not been previously characterized. METHODS A novel data-driven analytic framework was applied to large cohorts of healthy comparison subjects (n = 449) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 589) to identify the independent contributing sources of MMN, characterize the patterns of effective connectivity underlying reduced MMN in patients, and explore the clinical significance of these abnormal source dynamics in schizophrenia. RESULTS A network of 11 independent contributing sources underlying MMN distributed across temporofrontal cortices was identified. Orderly shifts in peak source activity were detected in a steplike manner, starting at temporal structures and progressing across frontal brain regions. MMN reduction in patients was predominantly associated with reduced contributions from 3 frontal midline sources: orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and middle cingulate cortices. Patients showed increased connectivity from temporal to prefrontal regions in conjunction with decreased cross-hemispheric connectivity to prefrontal regions. The decreased connectivity strength of precentral to prefrontal regions in patients with schizophrenia was associated with greater severity of negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Alterations in the dynamic interactions among temporofrontal sources underlie MMN abnormalities in schizophrenia. These results advance our understanding of the neural substrates and temporal dynamics of normal and impaired information processing with novel applications for translatable biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders.","Koshiyama, Daisuke; Miyakoshi, Makoto; Joshi, Yash B; Molina, Juan L; Tanaka-Koshiyama, Kumiko; Sprock, Joyce; Braff, David L; Swerdlow, Neal R; Light, Gregory A",Biological psychiatry.

Strong and weak TMS was delivered via single- and paired- (3-ms and 100-ms inter-stimulus interval) pulses on the same day and different days. All stimuli were delivered during isometric contractions of the knee extensors at 20% of maximal voluntary force. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) were assessed in quadriceps femoris muscles. Relative (intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) and absolute (standard error of measurement, SEM) reliability and variability (coefficient of variation) were assessed. MEPs elicited by strong and weak single-pulse TMS had excellent relative reliability in all muscles as did weak short-interval and strong long-interval paired-pulse TMS (all ICC>0.75). Conversely, relative reliability of strong short-interval and weak long-interval paired-pulse TMS was lower (ICC: 0.34-0.83 and 0.22-0.97, respectively). MEP size variability was lower (P<0.05) and SEM comparable or lower in strong compared to weak TMS conditions. These results suggest single- and paired-pulse TMS at both strong and weak intensities are generally reliable in the knee extensors. Strong (or both strong and weak) single-pulse TMS is recommended. The results indicate using weak test pulses for short-interval and strong test pulses for long-interval paired-pulse TMS are recommended.","Temesi, John; Ly, Sandy N; Millet, Guillaume Y",Journal of the neurological sciences,182,12

RECENT FINDINGS Risk assessment tools can assist surgeons and other healthcare providers in identifying the benefit-risk ratio of surgical candidates. These tools gather demographic, medical history, and other pertinent patient-reported measures to calculate a probability utilizing regression or machine learning statistical foundations. Currently, much is still unknown about the use of these tools to predict quality of life, disability, and other factors following spine surgery. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines that identified risk assessment tools that utilized patient-reported outcome measures as part of the calculation. From 8128 identified studies, 13 articles met inclusion criteria and were accepted into this review. The range of c-index values reported in the studies was between 0.63 and 0.84, indicating fair to excellent model performance. Post-surgical patient-reported outcomes were identified in the following categories (n = total number of predictive models): return to work (n = 3), pain (n = 9), physical functioning and disability (n = 5), quality of life (QOL) (n = 6), and psychosocial disposition (n = 2). Our review has synthesized the available evidence on risk assessment tools for predicting patient-centered outcomes in patients undergoing spine surgery and described their findings and clinical utility.","White, Hannah J; Bradley, Jensyn; Hadgis, Nicholas; Wittke, Emily; Piland, Brett; Tuttle, Brandi; Erickson, Melissa; Horn, Maggie E",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,182,1

Histone acetylation constitutes part of the ""histone code,"" which regulates chromosome compaction and various DNA processes, such as gene expression, recombination, and DNA replication. In bacteria, nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs) are responsible these functions, in that they organize and compact the chromosome, and regulate some DNA processes. The highly conserved, DNABII family of proteins are considered functional homologs of eukaryotic histones, despite having no sequence or structural conservation. Within the past decade, a growing interest in Nε-lysine acetylation led to the discovery that hundreds of bacterial proteins are acetylated with diverse cellular functions, in direct contrast to the original thought that this was a rare phenomenon. Similarly, other previously undiscovered bacterial PTMs, like serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, have also been characterized. In this review, the various PTMs that were discovered among DNABII family proteins, specifically HU orthologs, from large-scale proteomic studies will be discussed. The functional significance of these modifications and the enzymes involved will also be addressed.

During the IFN antiviral response, ns2 cleaves 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A), a key mediator of RNase L activation, thereby subverting the activation of RNase L and evading host innate immunity. However, the mechanism of 2-5A cleavage by ns2 remains unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of the MHV ns2 PDE domain and demonstrate a PDE fold similar to that of the cellular protein, a kinase anchoring protein 7 central domain (AKAP7(CD)) and rotavirus VP3 carboxy-terminal domain. The structure displays a pair of strictly conserved HxT/Sx motifs and forms a deep, positively charged catalytic groove with β-sheets and an arginine-containing loop.

Objective To evaluate the in vitro efficacy of PVP-I nasal antiseptic for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 at clinically significant contact times of 15 and 30 seconds. Interventions The SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain, virus stock was tested against nasal antiseptic solutions consisting of aqueous PVP-I as the sole active ingredient. Povidone-iodine was tested at diluted concentrations of 0.5%, 1.25%, and 2.5% and compared with controls. The test solutions and virus were incubated at mean (SD) room temperature of 22 (2) °C for time periods of 15 and 30 seconds. Design and Setting This controlled in vitro laboratory research study used 3 different concentrations of study solution and ethanol, 70%, as a positive control on test media infected with SARS-CoV-2. Test media without virus were added to 2 tubes of the compounds to serve as toxicity and neutralization controls. Ethanol, 70%, was tested in parallel as a positive control and water only as a negative control. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome measurement was the log reduction value after 15 seconds and 30 seconds of given treatment. Surviving virus from each sample was quantified by standard end point dilution assay, and the log reduction value of each compound was compared with the negative (water) control. Results Povidone-iodine nasal antiseptics at concentrations (0.5%, 1.25%, and 2.5%) completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 15 seconds of contact as measured by log reduction value of greater than 3 log10 of the 50% cell culture infectious dose of the virus. The ethanol, 70%, positive control did not completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 after 15 seconds of contact. The nasal antiseptics tested performed better than the standard positive control routinely used for in vitro assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents at a contact time of 15 seconds. No cytotoxic effects on cells were observed after contact with each of the nasal antiseptics tested. Conclusions and Relevance Povidone-iodine nasal antiseptic solutions at concentrations as low as 0.5% rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at contact times as short as 15 seconds. Intranasal use of PVP-I has demonstrated safety at concentrations of 1.25% and below and may play an adjunctive role in mitigating viral transmission beyond personal protective equipment.","Frank, Samantha; Brown, Seth M; Capriotti, Joseph A; Westover, Jonna B; Pelletier, Jesse S; Tessema, Belachew",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,182,1

Even less is known about the possible differences in the executive functioning of OABD and older adults with unipolar depression (OADEP). METHODS After excluding acutely ill patients, the executive functioning of OABD was compared to that of OADEP and healthy controls (n = 22, n = 20, n = 22; respectively). Cognitive insight, a sub-domain of executive functioning, was operationalized as the discrepancy between the participants' self-reported cognitive functioning and appraisals that were made by their care partners. To complement the cognitive profiling, the groups were compared in information processing speed, verbal memory, and visual-spatial memory. RESULTS OABD were impaired in several cognitive domains compared to healthy controls, most prominently in executive functioning and memory. OABD had poorer executive functioning and visual-spatial memory than OADEP. The findings also tentatively point toward intact cognitive insight among OABD, while OADEP seem to have a heightened level of awareness of their cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS OABD have a unique profile of cognitive impairment compared to OADEP. It is characterized by a more severe cognitive impairment, accompanied by relatively intact cognitive insight. The findings may help clarify the cognitive profile of OABD and assist in the development of cognitive rehabilitation programs tailored to their needs. They should, however, be considered preliminary and await further research.","Omer, Elad; Braw, Yoram; Amiaz, Revital; Ravona-Springer, Ramit",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,182,30

The sicker the patient, the higher the threat to the nutritional and micronutrient status will be. In addition many patients start the ICU stay with an altered nutritional status, which requires assessment upon admission. The nutritional needs vary among patients as well as during hospitalization, as the metabolic response changes over time. The shock and acute organ failure result in a metabolic shift towards intense catabolism: the endogenous glucose production aiming at ensuring the basal ATP production starts immediately, and occurs at the expense of the lean body mass using amino acids for neoglucogenesis. Later, the stabilization and recovery phases are characterized by higher energy and substrate needs. Indirect calorimetry is the only tool enabling determination of the metabolic level. When and how should feeding be started? Recent research shows that the route does not matter much with equipoise between enteral and parenteral nutrition as long as overfeeding is avoided. As micronutrients are an integral part of metabolism and antioxidant defenses, their delivery must be ensured: while needs are well defined for healthy subjects, needs in illness remain poorly defined. Parenteral nutrition, that contains only macro-substrates, requires the daily prescription of multi-micronutrient complements to qualify as total PN. Achievement of goals requires a minimal monitoring, consisting in the daily verification of energy and protein goal delivery achievement, and daily follow up of blood glucose and phosphate levels determination and insulin requirements.

Among these, radiofrequency ablation has gained widespread consideration. Optimal image-guidance offers precise anatomical information, helps to position interventional devices, and allows for differentiation between already-treated and remaining tumor tissue. Patient safety and complete ablation of the entire tumor are the overriding objectives of tumor ablation. These may be achieved most elegantly with magnetic resonance (MR)-guided therapy, where monitoring can be performed based on precise soft-tissue imaging and additional components, such as diffusion-weighted imaging and temperature mapping. New MR scanner types and newly developed sequence techniques have enabled MR-guided intervention to move beyond the experimental phase.

Patients given a RAG score of GREEN (86%) meant no urgent requirement for a face-to-face consultation and AMBER (8%) patients required treatment that was deemed nonurgent. However, 3% of patients received a RED rating as they required urgent input. CONCLUSION Through these virtual clinics, the pediatric team was able to reach 208 patients and provided advice and reassurance. The need for face-to-face appointment was eliminated for 11% of patients who were discharged to their local dental practitioners, thereby reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19.","Viswanathan, Asvitha; Patel, Nikita; Vaidyanathan, Mina; Bhujel, Nabina",The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association,182,1

The up-regulation of EZH2 is associated with advanced PCa and poor prognosis, making it a promising therapeutic target. However, the EZH2 inhibitors-based treatment is basically ineffective against PCa, which limits its clinical application. METHODS Microarray data (GSE107779) from LNCaP cells treated with either siRNA against EZH2 or a EZH2 inhibitor EPZ6438 was analyzed by Limma R package. Western blot, real-time PCR and luciferase reporter assays were used to determine the EZH2-SOX9-TNFRSF11A axis and the activity of NF-κB signaling in PCa cells. CCK-8 assay was used to determine the viability of PCa cells following various treatments. RESULTS Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 leads to feedback activation of NF-κB signaling in PCa cells. EZH2-dependent SOX9 expression regulates the activation of NF-κB signaling. TNFRSF11A, also known as receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), is a downstream target of SOX9 in PCa cells. SOX9 recognizes two putative SOX9 response elements in the promoter region of TNFRSF11A gene to drive TNFRSF11A expression and downstream NF-κB signaling activation. Suppression of the NF-κB signaling by either TNFRSF11A silencing or BAY11-7082 treatment rendered PCa cells to EZH2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION Collectively, our finding reveals a EZH2-SOX9-TNFRSF11A axis in the regulation of activity of NF-κB signaling in PCa cells and suggests that a combination of EZH2 inhibitors and BAY11-7082 would be an effective approach for the treatment of PCa patients in the future.","Jin, Mengyuan; Duan, Jiachen; Liu, Wei; Ji, Jing; Liu, Bin; Zhang, Mingzhi",Cancer cell international,182,1

Variation in host response may influence the pathogenesis and disease severity. We evaluated global gene expression profiles to better understand the systemic host response to acute RSV bronchiolitis in infants and young children. METHODS Patients (age ≤ 24 months) who were clinically diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis and who had a positive rapid test for RSV assay were recruited from the Texas Children's Hospital emergency department. Global gene expression of peripheral whole blood cells were analyzed in 21 cases and 37 age-matched healthy controls. Transcripts exhibiting significant upregulation and downregulation as a result of RSV infection were identified and confirmed in a subset of samples using RNA sequencing. The potential pathways affected were analyzed. RESULTS Blood was obtained from patients with acute RSV bronchiolitis (mean age 6 months). Of these, 43% were admitted to the hospital, 52% were given intravenous fluids and 24% received oxygen. Highly significant expression differences were detected in a discovery cohort of White infants (N = 33) and validated in an independent group of African-American infants (N = 19). Individuals with mild disease (N = 15) could not be distinguished from subjects with clinically moderate disease (N = 5).

Hence, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate whether the presence of an MP component has equal prognostic power as the MP predominant subtype. METHODS Literature retrieval was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases until December 23, 2019. Eligible studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included studies were divided into two subgroups, the MP component subgroup and the MP predominant subgroup, according to the proportion of the MP pattern to analyse the effect of this pattern on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from each study. Review Manager 5.3 was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS Finally, 10 studies, including a total of 4934 lung ADC patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated a significantly worse pooled DFS (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.20-2.21) and OS (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.96) in the subgroup of MP predominant subtype patients. The pooled DFS (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.85) and OS (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.46-3.52) were also poor in the subgroup of patients with the presence of an MP component. CONCLUSIONS Both the presence of an MP component and the MP predominant subtype are related to poor DFS and OS after lung ADC resection and represent adverse prognostic factor for lung ADC patients. However, there are some limitations in this meta-analysis, and quantitative stratification based on the proportion of the MP component is needed to explore its effect on prognosis of lung ADC patients in the future.","Wang, Wei; Hu, Zaoxiu; Zhao, Jie; Huang, Yunchao; Rao, Sunyin; Yang, Jichen; Xiao, Shouyong; Cao, Run; Ye, Lianhua",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,182,33

Estimates of morbidity and mortality amongst homeless populations is limited due to the lack of recording of housing status across health datasets. The aim of this study is to: (i) identify a homelessness e-cohort by linking routine health data in Wales, and (ii) explore whether a period of reported past homelessness, places this population at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. METHODS Homelessness identified through linkage across primary, secondary care and substance misuse datasets in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Mortality was examined through linkage to the Office for National Statistics mortality data. RESULTS E-cohort of 15 472 individuals with lived experience of homelessness identified. Of those, 21 individuals died between February and July 2020 involving coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Those with lived experience of homelessness had increased mortality from many causes including accidents, liver diseases and suicides. CONCLUSION Linking multiple routine datasets provides a more comprehensive dataset of a marginalized population, including individuals who are not included in government homeless statistics. Application of the cohort demonstrated that individuals with lived experience of homelessness have increased mortality involving COVID-19 and other causes. The underlying reasons, health needs and causes of death warrant further exploration.","Song, Jiao; Grey, Charlotte N B; Davies, Alisha R",Journal of public health,182,19

Black individuals also have increased risk of worse outcomesassociated with social determinants of health including socioeconomic factors such as income, education and employment. This narrative review included studies originally spanning a period of approximately one decade (December 2009-December 2019) from online databases and with subsequent updates though June 2020. The findings to date suggest pervasive inequities across common conditions and injuries in PM&R for this group compared to other racial/ethnic groups. We found health disparities across several domains for Black persons with stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, hip/knee osteoarthritis and fractures, as well as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Although more research is needed, some contributing factors include low access to rehabilitation care, fewer referrals, lower utilization rates, perceived bias, and more self-reliance, even after adjusting for hospitalcharacteristics, age, disease severity, and relevant socioeconomic variables. Some studies found that Black individuals were less likely to receive care that was concordant with clinical guidelinesas per the reported literature.Our review highlights many gaps in the literature on racial disparities that are particularly notable in cardiac, pulmonary, and critical care rehabilitation. Clinicians, researchers, and policy makers should therefore consider race and ethnicity as important factors as we strive to optimize rehabilitation care for an increasingly diverse US population.

The major aim of our work was to evaluate the ability of CoVs to enter the central nervous system (CNS) through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Using the highly hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), its attenuated variant, 51.6-MHV3, which shows low tropism for endothelial cells, and the weakly hepatotropic MHV-A59 strain from the murine coronavirus group, we investigated the virus-induced dysfunctions of BBB in vivo and in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) in vitro. We report here a MHV strain-specific ability to cross the BBB during acute infection according to their virulence for liver. Brain invasion was observed only in MHV3-infected mice and correlated with enhanced BBB permeability associated with decreased expression of zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1), VE-cadherin, and occludin, but not claudin-5, in the brain or in cultured BMECs. BBB breakdown in MHV3 infection was not related to production of barrier-dysregulating inflammatory cytokines or chemokines by infected BMECs but rather to a downregulation of barrier protective beta interferon (IFN-β) production. Our findings highlight the importance of IFN-β production by infected BMECs in preserving BBB function and preventing access of blood-borne infectious viruses to the brain. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect several mammals, including humans, and are associated with respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or neurological diseases. There is some evidence that suggest that human respiratory CoVs may show neuroinvasive properties. Indeed, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the CoVs OC43 and 229E were found in the brains of SARS patients and multiple sclerosis patients, respectively. These findings suggest that hematogenously spread CoVs may gain access to the CNS at the BBB level. Herein we report for the first time that CoVs exhibit the ability to cross the BBB according to strain virulence. BBB invasion by CoVs correlates with virus-induced disruption of tight junctions on BMECs, leading to BBB dysfunction and enhanced permeability. We provide evidence that production of IFN-β by BMECs during CoV infection may prevent BBB breakdown and brain viral invasion.","Bleau, Christian; Filliol, Aveline; Samson, Michel; Lamontagne, Lucie",Journal of virology,182,31

This study demonstrates the relationship between the manifestation of COVID-19 and the presence of chronic miasmatic disease, based on the works of Samuel Hahnemann. The reaction of the individual who previously presented chronic miasmatic disease, when in contact with the stimulus of the epidemic disease, depends on the type of response that the organism was generating in the face of the pre-existing situation: if it is an intense reaction and greater than that which the stimulus of COVID-19 can generate, this individual will not develop the severe form of the epidemic disease; if the reaction is less than that generated by COVID-19, more intense symptoms may appear. Understanding that the presence of a chronic miasmatic disease interferes with the manifestation of COVID-19, which may have repercussions on other organs, can change how one must act on the treatment, as this can alter the individual's health status.","da Costa Fujino, Fernanda Maria Simões; Olandim, Ana Amélia Campos Claro; Barnabé, Vagner Doja; Coggan, Jennifer Anne; Benites, Nilson Roberti",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,182,16

We aimed to design a computable phenotyping strategy to detect acute respiratory distress syndrome in electronic health records of critically ill patients. DESIGN This is a retrospective cohort study. Using a near real-time copy of the electronic health record, we developed a computable phenotyping strategy to detect acute respiratory distress syndrome based on the Berlin definition. SETTING Twenty multidisciplinary ICUs in Mayo Clinic Health System. SUBJECTS The phenotyping strategy was applied to 196,487 consecutive admissions from year 2009 to 2019. INTERVENTIONS The acute respiratory distress syndrome cohort generated by this novel strategy was compared with the acute respiratory distress syndrome cohort documented by clinicians during the same period. The sensitivity and specificity of the phenotyping strategy were calculated in randomly selected patient cohort (50 patients) using the results from manual medical record review as gold standard. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among the patients who did not have acute respiratory distress syndrome documented, the computable phenotyping strategy identified 3,169 adult patients who met the Berlin definition, 676 patients (21.3%) were classified to have severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao2/Fio2 ratio ≤ 100), 1,535 patients (48.4%) had moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (100 < Pao2/Fio2 ratio ≤ 200), and 958 patients (30.2%) had mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (200 < Pao2/Fio2 ratio ≤ 300). The phenotyping strategy achieved a sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 96.9%, positive predictive value of 94.4%, and negative predictive value of 96.9% in a randomly selected patient cohort. The clinicians documented acute respiratory distress syndrome in 1,257 adult patients during the study period. The clinician documentation rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 28.4%. Compared with the clinicians' documentation, the phenotyping strategy identified a cohort that had higher acuity and complexity of illness suggested by higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (9 vs 7; p < 0.0001), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score (76 vs 63; p < 0.0001), higher rate of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (99.1% vs 71.8%; p < 0.0001), higher ICU mortality (20.6% vs 16.8%; p < 0.0001), and longer ICU length of stay (5.1 vs 4.2 d; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Our rule-based computable phenotyping strategy can accurately detect acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients in the setting of high clinical complexity. This strategy can be applied to enhance early recognition of acute respiratory distress syndrome and to facilitate best-care delivery and clinical research in acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Li, Heyi; Odeyemi, Yewande E; Weister, Timothy J; Liu, Chang; Chalmers, Sarah J; Lal, Amos; Song, Xuan; Gajic, Ognjen; Kashyap, Rahul",Critical care explorations,182,1

It is defined as coronary ischaemia due to reversal flow from the LIMA to the left subclavian artery (SA) when a proximal left SA stenosis is present. In practice, the entire clinical spectrum of ischaemic heart disease, ranging from asymptomatic patients to acute myocardial infarction, may be encountered. Case summary Three cases of CSSS recently detected at our hospital are being described. Two patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome, so diagnosis was suspected based on coronary angiography findings, as retrograde blood flow from LIMA to the distal SA was present. Myocardial ischaemia was documented by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in one case. The third patient was asymptomatic and CSSS was suspected during physical examination and confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Endovascular intervention with balloon-expandable stent implantation of the stenotic SA was performed by vascular surgeons in all patients. No periprocedural complications occurred, and complete resolution of symptoms was achieved. Discussion In CSSS, subclavian angiography is the standard diagnostic test. However, other diagnostic techniques may be valuable to better clarify this challenging diagnosis. In the herein small series, the usefulness of a multimodality imaging approach including Doppler ultrasound, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and CT is well demonstrated. Furthermore, this study endorses the safety and utility of endovascular treatment in different clinical scenarios, including asymptomatic patients.","Real, Carlos; Vivas, David; Martínez, Isaac; Ferrando-Castagnetto, Federico; Reina, Julio; Nava-Muñoz, Ángel; Serrano, Javier; Vilacosta, Isidre",European heart journal.

Intense research efforts are now focusing on defining viral characteristics that confer a growth advantage, pathogenicity, or cell adaptability in order to better understand the PEDV life cycle and identify suitable targets for antiviral or vaccine development. Here, we report a unique phenomenon of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) cleavage by the PEDV-encoded 3C-like protease (3Cpro) during infection. The identification of the 3Cpro cleavage site at the C terminus of N supported previous observations that PEDV 3Cpro showed a substrate requirement slightly different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3Cpro and revealed a greater flexibility in its substrate recognition site. This cleavage motif is present in the majority of cell culture-adapted PEDV strains but is missing in emerging field isolates. Remarkably, reverse-genetics-derived cell culture-adapted PEDVAVCT12 harboring uncleavable N displayed growth retardation in Vero E6-APN cells compared to the wild-type virus. These observations altogether shed new light on the investigation and characterization of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein and its possible link to cell culture adaptation. IMPORTANCE Recurrent PEDV outbreaks have resulted in enormous economic losses to swine industries worldwide. To gain the upper hand in combating this disease, it is necessary to understand how this virus replicates and evades host immunity. Characterization of viral proteins provides important clues to mechanisms by which viruses survive and spread. Here, we characterized an intriguing phenomenon in which the nucleocapsids of some PEDV strains are proteolytically processed by the virally encoded main protease. Growth retardation in recombinant PEDV carrying uncleavable N suggests a replication advantage provided by the cleavage event, at least in the cell culture system. These findings may direct us to a more complete understanding of PEDV replication and pathogenicity.","Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Jengarn, Juggragarn; Wanitchang, Asawin; Jongkaewwattana, Anan",Journal of virology,182,6

It is largely committed by male against their female intimate partner. This is often associated with the region's unique social and cultural norms which subordinate women throughout their lives. IPV is an ongoing concern in Bhutan. The country's age-old traditions and customs are closely related to culture of silence among women experiencing IPV. This study examined women's responses to intimate partner violence (IPV) in Bhutan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore sensitising concepts such as how and when women recognised IPV and how they responded to it. Fifteen women who had sought supportive services at the institution `RENEW' (Respect, Educate, Nurture, Empower Women) as a result of IPV participated in the interview. The Trans-theoretical model of behaviour change (TTM) was used as a theoretical framework to understand women's cognitive, affective and behavioural change processes. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify the patterns of women's responses. From the analysis, women's experiences of IPV and their responses were located within the four stages of change, including contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance. Women used nine traditional processes of change among which consciousness raising and helping relationships were critical and appeared across all four stages of change. This study provides important insights of Bhutanese women's cognitive and behavioural responses to IPV. The appearance of consciousness raising and helping relationships across all the stages of change represents a potential opportunity for intervention to initiate and promote changes in women's response to IPV in the early stages.","Choden, Phuntsho; Armstrong, Kerry; Sendall, Marguerite C",Journal of interpersonal violence,182,1

METHODS The clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated in the Second People' Hospital of Fuyang City from January 20th to February 18th in 2020 were retrospective analyzed, including the demographic and epidemiological date, vital signs and hematology indexes, etc. on admission. Patients were divided into the normal type (set as normal group) and severe/critical type (set as severe group) according to the COVID-19 treatment plan classification standard published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The differences between two groups were compared, and the variables with statistical significance were incorporated in the multivariate binary unconditional Logistic regression analysis to screen the risk factors of severe/critical type. Risk factors were summarized to establish an early warning model, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was carried out to evaluate the significance of the early warning model in the screening of critically COVID-19.

(1) Compared with normal group, patients in severe group were older, and with higher proportion of basic diseases, higher body mass index (BMI), higher incidence of tachypnea, persistent high fever, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 0.95, while the white blood cell count (WBC), CD4+T lymphocyte, CD8+T lymphocyte, lymphocyte count (LYM) were decreased obviously, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid a protein (SAA), and CT showed higher incidence of multi-pulmonary lobe lesions. There were no significant differences of gender, travel history from Wuhan, smoking history, shock index (SI) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio between the two groups. (2) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years old [odds ratio (OR) = 1.620, P = 0.031], combined with underlying diseases (OR = 1.521, P = 0.044), persistent high fever (OR = 2.469, P = 0.014), WBC < 2.0×109/L and/or LYM < 0.4×109/L (OR = 3.079, P = 0.006), pulmonary multilobar lesions (OR = 1.367, P = 0.047), and IL-6 ≥ 30 ng/L (OR = 2.426, P = 0.010) were the risk factors of severe/critical COVID-19. (3) The OR value corresponding to each risk factors were scored by rounding. Two points were scored for age ≥ 60 years old, with underlying diseases, persistent high fever and IL-6 ≥ 30 ng/L, 3 points for WBC < 2.0×109/L and/or LYM < 0.4×109/L, 1 point for pulmonary multilobar lesions, and totally calculated as early warning model scores. The early warning model score of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the normal group (9.33±2.79 vs. 5.04±2.38, t = 9.010, P = 0.001). (4) The ROC curve analysis showed the area under ROC curve (AUC) of early warning model on the early screening of severe/critical patients in COVID-19 was 0.944, and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.903-0.985; and the sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 72.0% respectively while the cut-off was 6.5. CONCLUSIONS There are many differences between severe/critical and mild COVID-19 patients. The establishment of early warning model could help to screen severe/critical patients at an early stage, with certain significance for guiding treatment.","Xu, Jing; Zhao, Fengde; Han, Mingfeng; Ma, Lei; Zhang, Ting",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,182,31

However, most studies have either focused on identifying risk loci or performing unbiased screens without a focus on protective variation in AD. Here, we provide a review of known protective variants in AD and their putative mechanisms of action. Additionally, we recommend strategies for finding new protective variants. Recent findings Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies have identified both common and rare protective variants associated with AD. These include variants in or near APP, APOE, PLCG2, MS4A, MAPT-KANSL1, RAB10, ABCA1, CCL11, SORL1, NOCT, SCL24A4-RIN3, CASS4, EPHA1, SPPL2A, and NFIC. Summary There are very few protective variants with functional evidence and a derived allele with a frequency below 20%. Additional fine mapping and multi-omic studies are needed to further validate and characterize known variants as well as specialized genome-wide scans to identify novel variants.","Andrews, Shea J; Fulton-Howard, Brian; Goate, Alison",Current genetic medicine reports,182,16

This preliminary study compared a new barbed absorbable thread for gastrointestinal sutures with monofil suture material in a cadaver model. METHODS In this study, mechanical experiments were performed in 20 recently deceased individuals. Incisions were made in the small intestine, colon, and stomach, and then sutures were created with the V-Loc closure device and monofil suture material. Intestinal bursting pressure was measured by inserting a balloon and slowly filling it with air until there was a dehiscence, or wall or suture rupture. RESULTS The bursting pressures differed significantly between the two sutures in the small intestine, showing the advantage of the V-Loc closure device, which had a mean bursting pressure of 116.2 mmHg compared with 110 mmHg for the monofil suture (p = 0.003). The mean bursting pressure did not differ significantly between the two sutures in the colon and the stomach. The mean bursting pressures for the V-Loc closure device were 141.3 mmHg (stomach) and 137.2 mmHg (colon) compared with the monofil suture material bursting pressures of 133 mmHg (stomach) and 134.8 mmHg (colon). CONCLUSIONS Because the bursting strength of the sutures created with monofil suture material differs significantly from that of the V-Loc closure device, the V-Loc suture material should be used for gastrointestinal sutures. Although the two sutures did not differ significantly in the colon or the stomach, the V-Loc closure device should be used for these as well because its advantages may overrule those of the monofil suture. No knot tying is required, and the operating time can be shorter. Especially for laparoscopic surgery, the V-Loc closure device is recommended.","Nemecek, Elena; Negrin, Lukas; Beran, Claudia; Nemecek, Romina; Hollinsky, Christian",Surgical endoscopy,182,31

Histologic and biochemical characterization of biopsied wound tissue, which is currently the only reliable method for wound assessment, is invasive, complex to interpret, and slow. Here we demonstrate the use of Raman microspectroscopy coupled with multivariate spectral analysis as a simple, noninvasive method to biochemically characterize healing wounds in mice and to accurately identify different phases of healing of wounds at different time-points. Raman spectra were collected from ""splinted"" full thickness dermal wounds in mice at 4 time-points (0, 1, 5, and 7 days) corresponding to different phases of wound healing, as verified by histopathology. Spectra were deconvolved using multivariate factor analysis (MFA) into 3 ""factor score spectra"" (that act as spectral signatures for different stages of healing) that were successfully correlated with spectra of prominent pure wound bed constituents (i.e., collagen, lipids, fibrin, fibronectin, etc.) using non-negative least squares (NNLS) fitting. We show that the factor loadings (weights) of spectra that belonged to wounds at different time-points provide a quantitative measure of wound healing progress in terms of key parameters such as inflammation and granulation. Wounds at similar stages of healing were characterized by clusters of loading values and slowly healing wounds among them were successfully identified as ""outliers"". Overall, our results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used as a noninvasive technique to provide insight into the status of normally healing and slow-to-heal wounds and that it may find use as a complementary tool for real-time, in situ biochemical characterization in wound healing studies and clinical diagnosis.","Jain, Rishabh; Calderon, Diego; Kierski, Patricia R; Schurr, Michael J; Czuprynski, Charles J; Murphy, Christopher J; McAnulty, Jonathan F; Abbott, Nicholas L",Analytical chemistry,182,1

We aimed to directly compare efficacy and safety of a high-dose (In.Pact™) vs. low-dose (Ranger™) DCB with nominal paclitaxel densities of 3.5 vs. 2.0 μg/mm2. METHODS AND RESULTS Within a prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority, clinical trial 414 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions (Rutherford classification 2-4) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to endovascular treatment with either high- or low-dose DCB after stratification for lesion length. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints comprised primary patency and freedom from major adverse events (i.e. device and procedure-related deaths through 1 month, major amputations, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months). We set a non-inferiority margin of -10% at 12 months. Total occlusions were observed frequently (>40%) and provisional stenting was performed in every fourth intervention. Non-inferiority was determined for both primary efficacy and safety endpoints at 12 months. Primary patency was 81.5% in the high-dose and 83.0% in low-dose DCB group {difference: 1.5% [lower bound of the 90% two-sided confidence interval (CI) -5.2%]; Pnon-inferiority < 0.01}. Freedom from major adverse events was determined in 92.6% in high-dose and in 91.0% in low-dose DCB group [difference -1.6% (lower bound of the 90% two-sided CI -6.5%); Pnon-inferiority < 0.01]. Overall death rate was low (2.0%) and no major amputation occurred. CONCLUSION Two DCBs with different coating characteristics exhibited comparable results with excellent effectiveness and safety through 12 months for femoropopliteal interventions including a wide range of lesion lengths.

Recently, we have provided evidence of viscerally-mediated sweating alterations in humans during exercise brought about by warm and cool fluid ingestion. In the present study, we characterize the modification of shivering and whole-body thermal sensation during cold stress following the administration of a graded thermal stimuli delivered to the stomach via fluid ingestion at 52, 37, 22 and 7°C. Despite no differences in core and skin temperature, fluid ingestion at 52°C rapidly decreased shivering and sensations of cold compared to 37°C, whereas fluid ingestion at 22 and 7°C led to equivalent increases in these responses. Warm and cold fluid ingestion independently modifies cold defence thermoeffector responses, supporting the presence of visceral thermoreceptors in humans. However, the cold-defence thermoeffector response patterns differed from previously identified hot-defence thermoeffectors. ABSTRACT Sudomotor activity is modified by both warm and cold fluid ingestion during heat stress, independently of differences in core and skin temperatures, suggesting independent viscerally-mediated modification of thermoeffectors. The present study aimed to determine whether visceral thermoreceptors modify shivering responses to cold stress. Ten males (mean ± SD: age 27 ± 5 years; height 1.73 ± 0.06 m, weight 78.4 ± 10.7 kg) underwent whole-body cooling via a water perfusion suit at 5°C, on four occasions, to induce a steady-state shivering response, at which point two aliquots of 1.5 ml kg-1 (SML) and 3.0 ml kg-1 (LRG), separated by 20 min, of water at 7, 22, 37 or 52°C were ingested. Rectal, mean skin and mean body temperature (Tb ), electromyographic activity (EMG), metabolic rate (M) and whole-body thermal sensation on a visual analogue scale (WBTS) ranging from 0 mm (very cold) to 200 mm (very hot) were all measured throughout. Tb was not different between all fluid temperatures following SML fluid ingestion (7°C: 35.7 ± 0.5°C; 22°C: 35.6 ± 0.5°C; 37°C: 35.5 ± 0.4°C; 52°C: 35.5 ± 0.4°C; P = 0.27) or LRG fluid ingestion (7°C: 35.3 ± 0.6°C; 22°C: 35.3 ± 0.5°C; 37°C: 35.2 ± 0.5°C; 52°C: 35.3 ± 0.5°C; P = 0.99). With SML fluid ingestion, greater metabolic rates and cooler thermal sensations were observed with ingestion at 7°C (M: 179 ± 55 W, WBTS: 29 ± 21 mm) compared to 52°C (M: 164 ± 34 W, WBTS: 51 ± 28 mm; all P < 0.05). With LRG ingestion, compared to shivering and thermal sensations with ingestion at 37°C (M: 215 ± 47 W, EMG: 3.9 ± 2.5% MVC, WBTS: 33 ± 2 mm), values were different (all P < 0.05) following ingestion at 7°C (M: 269 ± 77 W, EMG: 5.5 ± 0.9% MVC, WBTS: 14 ± 12 mm), 22°C (M: 270 ± 86 W, EMG: 5.6 ± 1.0% MVC, WBTS: 18 ± 19 mm) and 52°C (M: 179 ± 34 W, EMG: 3.3 ± 2.1% MVC, WBTS: 53 ± 28 mm). In conclusion, fluid ingestion at 52°C decreased shivering and the sensation of coolness, whereas fluid ingestion at 22 and 7°C increased shivering and sensations of coolness to similar levels, independently of core and skin temperature.","Morris, Nathan B; Filingeri, Davide; Halaki, Mark; Jay, Ollie",The Journal of physiology,182,7

In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the intrinsic noise and mRNA levels for elucidating the transcriptional bursting kinetics in mouse embryonic stem cells. Informatics analyses and functional assays revealed that transcriptional bursting kinetics was regulated by a combination of promoter- and gene body-binding proteins, including the polycomb repressive complex 2 and transcription elongation factors. Furthermore, large-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based screening identified that the Akt/MAPK signaling pathway regulated bursting kinetics by modulating transcription elongation efficiency. These results uncovered the key molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting and cell-to-cell gene expression noise in mammalian cells.","Ochiai, Hiroshi; Hayashi, Tetsutaro; Umeda, Mana; Yoshimura, Mika; Harada, Akihito; Shimizu, Yukiko; Nakano, Kenta; Saitoh, Noriko; Liu, Zhe; Yamamoto, Takashi; Okamura, Tadashi; Ohkawa, Yasuyuki; Kimura, Hiroshi; Nikaido, Itoshi",Science advances,182,1

This study aimed to examine the value of the Appleby procedure, in current individualized treatment approaches, and to define its possible therapeutic impact for patients with LAPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS 20 consecutive patients who underwent SDP with resection of the celiac axis between January 2005 and December 2018 were identified from a prospectively collected database and were matched with 20 patients experiencing SDP without resection of the celiac axis. Both perioperative parameters, as well as the overall postoperative course, were evaluated. RESULTS The rate of perioperative complications in both groups was comparable (p=0.744). The rate of severe type C postoperative pancreatic haemorrhages (PPH) was significantly lower in patients with resection of the celiac axis compared to those without (p=0.035). CONCLUSION The Appleby procedure may be considered as a safe and feasible treatment option with favorably fewer postoperative severe bleeding complications. Besides surgical expertise, such procedures, however, require an experienced interventional radiologist and should thus only be performed in high-volume centers.","Malinka, Thomas; Timmermann, Lea; Klein, Fritz; Geisel, Dominik; Pratschke, Johann; Bahra, Marcus",Anticancer research,182,12

Methods: We elicited motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary motor evoked potentials (CMEPs) in the biceps brachii using magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex and electrical stimulation of corticospinal axons during arm cycling at six different power outputs (i.e., 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 W) and two stimulation intensities (i.e., weak vs. strong). Results: In general, biceps brachii MEP and CMEP amplitudes (normalized to maximal M-wave (Mmax)) followed a similar pattern of modulation with increases in cycling intensity at both stimulation strengths. Specifically, MEP and CMEP amplitudes increased up until ~150 W and ~100 W when the weak and strong stimulations were used, respectively. Further increases in cycling intensity revealed no changes on MEP or CMEP amplitudes for either stimulation strength. Conclusions: In general, MEPs and CMEPs changed in a similar manner, suggesting that increases and subsequent plateaus in overall excitability are likely mediated by spinal factors. Interestingly, however, MEP amplitudes were disproportionately larger than CMEP amplitudes as power output increased, despite being initially matched in amplitude, particularly with strong stimulation. This suggests that supraspinal excitability is enhanced to a larger degree than spinal excitability as the power output of arm cycling increases.","Lockyer, Evan J; Hosel, Katarina; Nippard, Anna P; Button, Duane C; Power, Kevin E",Brain sciences,182,6

In this study, the impact of soil application of nutrients combined with foliar spray of macro- and micro-nutrients on the incidence of HLB and the phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacterial microbiome was investigated in Gannan Navel Orange orchard from 2015 to 2018. Compared with the control (T1), the yield of Gannan Navel Orange in all other treatments applied with macro- and micro-nutrients increased significantly in 2018 (by 20.5%-45.8%), but not in the first two years (2016-17). Among treatments, Ca + Mg + B application in soil (T2) showed the highest yield and lowest HLB incidence. According to the PCR results, CLas was negative in T2 but positive in the control, which directly proved HLB incidence was reduced with Ca + Mg + B application in soil. Moreover, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to characterize rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbial communities. Results showed that microbial biodiversity was increased and microbial community structure was altered in T2 treatment, of which the beneficial bacteria were enriched in phyllosphere and rhizosphere. The results of PICRUSt showed that in T2 treatment, rhizosphere microbe contained more membrane transport (ABC transporters) genes, while, carbohydrate metabolism genes were enriched in the control rhizosphere due to HLB obstruct the photosynthetic metabolite transport. In summary, results indicated that macro- and micro-nutrients application improved the yield of Gannan Navel Orange and soil application of Ca + Mg + B reduced HLB incidence by altering microbial community structure and increasing microbial biodiversity.

The Fleischner Society has recommended chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting cases with high risk for disease progression, for triaging suspected patients with moderate-to-severe illness, and to eliminate false negatives in areas with high pre-test probability or limited resources. Although CXR is less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. Literature search was performed using PubMed. RESULTS A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features is associated with worse disease outcome. Recognition of these features on CXR will improve accuracy and speed of diagnosing COVID-19 patients.","Chan, Wai Yee; Hamid, Marlina Tanty Ramli; Gowdh, Nadia Fareeda Muhammad; Rahmat, Kartini; Yaakup, Nur Adura; Chai, Chee Shee",Current medical imaging,182,1

It also outlines considerations that need to be made before moving forward regarding communication, collaboration, and culture. The pandemic has created opportunities for pharmacy educators to take instructional risks and attempt new didactic and experiential teaching methods and assessment strategies. Working remotely has not only altered pharmacy education, but also scholarship and service. Conducting a broad range of collaborations with accelerated timelines to address COVID-19 has in some instances forged new relationships both between and within universities and focused faculty members on grantsmanship and writing. Faculty governance and administrative leadership have been focused on solving challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in a collaborative, transparent approach guided by faculty bylaws. Programs have found ways to use these changes to their advantage while advancing the mission of the Academy, which can contribute to changing the culture of how we interact and care about each other with the hope that the positive changes made have an enduring and meaningful impact for years to come.","Medina, Melissa S; Melchert, Russell B; Stowe, Cindy D",American journal of pharmaceutical education,182,15

The goal of the prone team was to reduce workload on intensive care teams, standardize the proning process, mitigate pressure injuries and turning-related adverse events, and ensure prone team safety. METHODS Staff were trained using a hybrid learning model focused on prone-positioning techniques, pressure injury prevention, and turning-related adverse events. RESULTS No adverse events occurred to patients or members of the prone ream. The prone team mitigated pressure injuries using prevention strategies. The prone team and intensive care unit staff were highly satisfied with their experience. CONCLUSION The prone team provided support for critically ill patients, and team members reported feeling supported and empowered. Intensive care unit staff were highly satisfied with the prone team.","Miguel, Karen; Snydeman, Colleen; Capasso, Virginia; Walsh, Mary Ann; Murphy, John; Wang, Xianghong Sean",AACN advanced critical care,182,1

During the development of situated visualizations, evaluating visualizations is a core requirement. However, performing such evaluations is intrinsically hard as the real scenarios are safety-critical or expensive to test. To overcome these issues, researchers and practitioners adapt classical approaches from ubiquitous computing and use surrogate empirical methods such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) prototypes, or merely online demonstrations. This approach's primary assumption is that meaningful insights can also be gained from different, usually cheaper and less cumbersome empirical methods. Nevertheless, recent efforts in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community have found evidence against this assumption, which would impede the use of surrogate empirical methods. Currently, these insights rely on a single investigation of four interactive objects. The goal of this work is to investigate if these prior findings also hold for situated visualizations. Therefore, we first created a scenario where situated visualizations support users in do-it-yourself (DIY) tasks such as crafting and assembly. We then set up five empirical study methods to evaluate the four tasks using an online survey, as well as VR, AR, laboratory, and in-situ studies. Using this study design, we conducted a new study with 60 participants. Our results show that the situated visualizations we investigated in this study are not prone to the same dependency on the empirical method, as found in previous work. Our study provides the first evidence that analyzing situated visualizations through different empirical (surrogate) methods might lead to comparable results.","Weiss, Maximilian; Angerbauer, Katrin; Voit, Alexandra; Schwarzl, Magdalena; Sedlmair, Michael; Mayer, Sven",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,182,1

Retrospective studies are an important tool to study rare diseases, manifestations and outcomes. Findings of these studies can form the basis on which prospective studies are planned. Retrospective studies however have several limitations owing to their design. Since they depend on review of charts that were originally not designed to collect data for research, some information is bound to be missing. Selection and recall biases also affect the results and reasons for differences in treatment between patients and lost follow ups can often not be ascertained and may lead to bias. Readers need to critically evaluate the methods and carefully interpret the results of retrospective studies before they put them to practice.

However, there is a relative paucity of data regarding postoperative pain scores in rural Indian populations following SILC. Also, data pertaining to the applicability of SILC in rural Indian population are scant. METHODS In the present randomized control trial, pain scores after SILC and CLC were evaluated. Sixty patients with gallstone disease were randomly assigned to one of two groups with 30 patients each: the CLC group and the SILC group. Postoperative pain scores were recorded on the visual analog scale at 8 hours, 24 hours and 7 days after surgery. RESULTS The patients were comparable with respect to age, sex and BMI. Operative time was longer for the SILC group (47.73 ± 5.57 min vs 69.53 ± 8.96 min; P < 0.0001).The pain scores were similar in both groups at 8 hours (3.61 ± 0.41 vs 3.50 ± 0.51; P = 0.36) and 24 hours (3.30 ± 0.59 vs 3.20 ± 0.40; P = 0.44) postoperatively. On day 7, the SILC group had lower pain scores than the CLC group (2.56 ± 0.56 vs 1.16 ± 0.37; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION There was no distinct advantage to SILC with regard to immediate postoperative pain.

METHODS The records of 12 patients who experienced thyroid nodule rupture after RFA at four Korean thyroid centers between March 2010 and July 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data evaluated included baseline patient characteristics, treatment methods, initial presenting symptoms, imaging features, treatment, and prognosis. RESULTS The most common symptoms of post-RFA nodule rupture were sudden neck bulging and pain. Based on imaging features, the localization of nodule rupture was classified into three types: anterior, posterolateral, and medial types. The anterior type is the most often, followed by posterolateral and medial type. Eight patients recovered completely after conservative treatment. Four patients who did not improve with conservative management required invasive procedures, including incision and drainage or aspiration. CONCLUSION Thyroid nodule rupture after RFA can be classified into three types based on its localization: anterior, posterolateral, and medial types. Because majority of thyroid nodule ruptures after RFA can be managed conservatively, familiarity with these imaging features is essential in avoiding unnecessary imaging workup or invasive procedures.","Chung, Sae Rom; Baek, Jung Hwan; Sung, Jin Yong; Ryu, Ji Hwa; Jung, So Lyung",Endocrinology and metabolism,182,19

Before a large multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the impact of preventing desaturations on perioperative outcomes, the authors undertook a randomized prospective, parallel-arm, multicenter feasibility RCT to determine whether an intervention algorithm could prevent desaturations. METHODS Eight Canadian sites randomized 201 patients between April 2012 and October 2013. The primary outcome was the success rate of reversing cerebral desaturations below 10% relative to baseline in the intervention group. Anesthesiologists were blinded to the cerebral saturation values in the control group. Intensive care unit personnel were blinded to cerebral saturation values for both groups. Secondary outcomes included the area under the curve of cerebral desaturation load, enrolment rates, and a 30-day follow-up for adverse events. RESULTS Cerebral desaturations occurred in 71 (70%) of the 102 intervention group patients and 56 (57%) of the 99 control group patients (P = 0.04). Reversal was successful in 69 (97%) of the intervention group patients. The mean cerebral desaturation load (SD) in the operating room was smaller for intervention group patients compared with control group patients (104 [217] %.min vs. 398 [869] %.min, mean difference, -294; 95% CI, -562 to -26; P = 0.03). This was also true in the intensive care unit (P = 0.02). There were no differences in adverse events between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Study sites were successful in reversal of desaturation, patient recruitment, randomization, and follow-up in cardiac surgery, supporting the feasibility of conducting a large multicenter RCT.","Deschamps, Alain; Hall, Richard; Grocott, Hilary; Mazer, C David; Choi, Peter T; Turgeon, Alexis F; de Medicis, Etienne; Bussières, Jean S; Hudson, Christopher; Syed, Summer; Seal, Doug; Herd, Stuart; Lambert, Jean; Denault, André; Deschamps, Alain; Mutch, Alan; Turgeon, Alexis; Denault, Andre; Todd, Andrea; Jerath, Angela; Fayad, Ashraf; Finnegan, Barry; Kent, Blaine; Kennedy, Brent; Cuthbertson, Brian H; Kavanagh, Brian; Warriner, Brian; MacAdams, Charles; Lehmann, Christian; Fudorow, Christine; McCartney, Colin; McIsaac, Dan; Dubois, Daniel; Campbell, David; Mazer, David; Neilpovitz, David; Rosen, David; Cheng, Davy; Drapeau, Dennis; Dillane, Derek; Tran, Diem; Mckeen, Dolores; Wijeysundera, Duminda; Jacobsohn, Eric; Couture, Etienne; Alam, Fahad; Abdallah, Faraj; Ralley, Fiona E; Chung, Frances; Lellouche, Francois; Dobson, Gary; Germain, Genevieve; Djaiani, George; Gilron, Ian; Hare, Gregory; Bryson, Gregory; Clarke, Hance; McDonald, Heather; Roman-Smith, Helen; Yang, Homer; Douketis, James; Paul, James; Beaubien, Jean; Bussières, Jean; Pridham, Jeremy; Armstrong, J N; Parlow, Joel; Murkin, John; Gamble, Jonathan; Duttchen, Kaylene; Karkouti, Keyvan; Turner, Kim; Baghirzada, Leyla; Szabo, Linda; Lalu, Manoj; Wasowicz, Marcin; Bautista, Michael; Jacka, Michael; Murphy, Michael; Schmidt, Michael; Verret, Michaël; Perrault, Michel-Antoine; Beaudet, Nicolas; Buckley, Norman; Choi, Peter; MacDougall, Peter; Jones, Philip; Drolet, Pierre; Beaulieu, Pierre; Taneja, Ravi; Martin, Rene; George, Ronald; Chun, Rosa; McMullen, Sarah; Beattie, Scott; Sampson, Sonia; Choi, Stephen; Kowalski, Stephen; McCluskey, Stuart; Boet, Sylvain; Ramsay, Tim; Saha, Tarit; Mutter, Thomas; Chowdhury, Tumul; Uppal, Vishal; Mckay, William",Anesthesiology,182,9

Despite increasing improvements in disease management, a huge medical need still exists as its relentless progression cannot be delayed by current treatments. Therefore, scientists, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies are hunting new drugs with 'disease-modifying' properties. AREAS COVERED This review concentrates on new therapeutics - excluding cell and gene therapies - under investigation for PD with 'disease-modifying' potential. This is a global, comprehensive picture of the current innovative drug pipeline, where the main preclinical and clinical data available are provided. Drug candidates presented include α-synuclein modulating agents, neuroprotective agents and neuroinflammation modulators, kinase modulators, neurotrophic factors, and drugs acting on emerging targets. EXPERT OPINION There is excitement for agents with 'disease-modifying' properties and the authors found more than 130 assets, not including cell and gene therapies under investigation - most of them still in preclinical development - meaning that the science is progressing multiple, diverse new opportunities. Many limitations hamper the successful development of these drug candidates such as the translational accuracy of preclinical models, the current clinical development paradigm as well as the lack of biomarkers to be used in diagnosis and therapy management.","Colombo, Daniele; Pnevmatikou, Paraskevi; Melloni, Elsa; Keywood, Charlotte",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,182,30

Controversial data suggesting women are less likely to receive the device regardless of the greater benefit. The aim of this review is to assess sex differences in the implantation rate, clinical effectiveness, and safety of patients receiving CRT devices. METHODS We will conduct a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science to identify cohort studies that meet our eligibility criteria. Title and full text screening will be conducted in duplicate independently. Eligible studies report clinical effectiveness or safety of patients receiving CRT device while providing sex-disaggregated data. Implantation rate will be extracted from the baseline characteristics tables of the studies. The effectiveness outcomes include the following: all-cause death, hospitalization, peak oxygen consumption (pVO2), quality of life (QoL), 6-min walk test, NYHA class reduction, LVEF, and heart failure hospitalization. The complication outcomes include the following: contrast-induced nephropathy, pneumothorax, pocket-related hematoma, pericardial tamponade, phrenic nerve stimulation, device infection, death, pulmonary edema, electrical storm, cardiogenic shock, and hypotension requiring resuscitation. Description of included studies will be reported in detail and outcomes will be meta-analyzed and presented using forest plots when feasible. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) by two review authors independently. GRADE approach will be used to assess the certainty of evidence. DISCUSSION The aim of this review is to determine the presence of differences in CRT implantation between women and men as well as differences in clinical effectiveness and safety of CRT after device implantation. Results from this systematic review will provide important insights into sex differences in CRT devices that could contribute to the development of sex-specific recommendations and inform policy.

Crosstalk between the oncogenic RTKs hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are involved in tumor resistance to RTK-targeted therapies. Methods: In a relevant renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient derived xenograft (PDX) model, we use zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled anti-RTKs antibodies (immunoPET) onartuzumab, panitumumab, and trastuzumab to monitor MET, EGFR, and HER2 protein levels, respectively, during treatment with agents to which the model was resistant (cetuximab) or sensitive (INC280 and trametinib). Results: Cetuximab treatment resulted in continued tumor growth, as well as an increase in all RTK protein levels at the tumor in vivo on immunoPET, and ex vivo at the cellular level. Conversely, following dual MET/MEK inhibition, tumor growth was significantly blunted, and corresponded with a decrease in RTK levels. Conclusion: These data show the utility of RTK-targeted immunoPET to annotate RTK changes in protein expression and inform tumor response to targeted therapies.","Pereira, Patricia M R; Norfleet, Jalen; Lewis, Jason S; Escorcia, Freddy E","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",182,12

METHODS Twenty-one males participated in this cross-over-trial. Interventions twice daily were oxycodone (10 mg), tapentadol (50 mg) and placebo for 14 days. Tonic pain was induced on day 1, 4 and 14 by immersing the hand in 2 °C water for 120 s. Electroencephalography was recorded during test pain at baseline and after 14 days. Spectral analysis and source localization were investigated in predefined frequency bands. RESULTS A decreased perception of pain on day 4 persisted throughout the 14 days compared to baseline (p < 0.006). Oxycodone decreased the electroencephalography spectral power in the delta and theta bands and increased power in the alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 bands (p < 0.03). Tapentadol increased spectral power in the alpha1 band (p < 0.001). Source localization revealed that oxycodone decreased activity of the temporal and limbic region in the delta band, and frontal lobe in the alpha2 and beta1 bands, whereas tapentadol decreased alpha1 band activity in the temporal lobe compared to placebo. CONCLUSION Oxycodone and tapentadol reduced pain perception and changed the central processing of tonic pain. SIGNIFICANCE Different mechanisms of action were involved, where oxycodone affected cortical structures more than tapentadol.","Nedergaard, Rasmus Bach; Hansen, Tine Maria; Nissen, Thomas Dahl; Mark, Esben Bolvig; Brock, Christina; Drewes, Asbjørn Mohr",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,182,31

The recently defined HSP110, in particular, exhibits strong protein binding affinity and is capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of protein antigens remarkably more than other HSP family members. In our previous study, we verified that murine HSP110 (mHSP110) significantly enhanced the immune response of a C57BL/6 mouse model to the H-2(d)-restricted human papillomavirus (HPV) E749-57 epitope (short peptide spanning the 49th to 57th amino acid residues in the E7 protein). To determine whether HSP110 similarly enhances the immunogenicity of human epitope peptides, we used the HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model to investigate the efficacy of the mHSP110 chaperone molecule as an immunoadjuvant of the human HLA-A2-restricted HPV16 E711-20 epitope vaccine. Results showed that mHSP110 efficiently formed a noncovalently bound complex with the E711-20 epitope. The mHSP110-E711-20 complex induced epitope-specific splenocyte proliferation and E711-20-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion. Importantly, cytotoxic T lymphocytes primed by the mHSP110-E711-20 complex exerted strong cytolytic effects on target T2 cells pulsed with the E711-20 peptide or TC-1 cells transfected with the HLA-A2 gene. In addition, the mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicited stronger ex vivo and in vivo antitumor responses than either emulsified complete Freund's adjuvant or HSP70-chaperoned E711-20 peptide. These collective data suggest that HSP110 is a promising immunomodulator candidate for peptide-based human cancer vaccines, such as for the HLA-A2-restricted E711-20 epitope.","Ding, Zhenzhen; Ou, Rongying; Ni, Bing; Tang, Jun; Xu, Yunsheng",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,182,29

These patients, therefore, require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to their usual treatment schedules. Their disease can also be associated with significant burden, and they necessitate life-long and regular access to therapy, and regular follow-up consultations and hospital visits. The current COVID-19 pandemic is therefore presenting many challenges for these patients, their families, and health-care professionals. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of the reported COVID-19 cases in the literature in patients with certain benign hematological disorders including thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophilia, immune thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and aplastic anemia. The review also outlines some recommendations on how to manage these patients if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. To review the literature on benign hematological disorders and COVID-19, a bibliographic search was performed using PubMed for articles published between January 2020 and June 2020. EXPERT OPINION International efforts must be made to continue reporting and better understanding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients and accordingly develop a set of recommendations to optimize the treatment of future infected patients.","Noun, Peter; Ibrahim, Ahmad; Hodroj, Mohammad Hassan; Bou-Fakhredin, Rayan; Taher, Ali T",Expert review of hematology,182,26

However, studies and models trained on specific themed communities are often difficult to apply to different social media platforms and related outcomes. A deep learning framework using thematic structures from Reddit and Twitter can have distinct advantages for studying alcohol abuse, particularly among the youth in the United States. OBJECTIVE This study proposes a new deep learning pipeline that uses thematic structures to identify alcohol-related content across different platforms. We apply our method on Twitter to determine the association of the prevalence of alcohol-related tweets with alcohol-related outcomes reported from the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, Centers for Disease Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, county health rankings, and the National Industry Classification System. METHODS The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers neural network learned to classify 1,302,524 Reddit posts as either alcohol-related or control subreddits. The trained model identified 24 alcohol-related hashtags from an unlabeled data set of 843,769 random tweets. Querying alcohol-related hashtags identified 25,558,846 alcohol-related tweets, including 790,544 location-specific (geotagged) tweets. We calculated the correlation between the prevalence of alcohol-related tweets and alcohol-related outcomes, controlling for confounding effects of age, sex, income, education, and self-reported race, as recorded by the 2013-2018 American Community Survey. RESULTS Significant associations were observed: between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and alcohol consumption (P=.01) and heavy drinking (P=.005) but not binge drinking (P=.37), self-reported at the metropolitan-micropolitan statistical area level; between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and self-reported excessive drinking behavior (P=.03) but not motor vehicle fatalities involving alcohol (P=.21); between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and the number of breweries (P<.001), wineries (P<.001), and beer, wine, and liquor stores (P<.001) but not drinking places (P=.23), per capita at the US county and county-equivalent level; and between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and all gallons of ethanol consumed (P<.001), as well as ethanol consumed from wine (P<.001) and liquor (P=.01) sources but not beer (P=.63), at the US state level. CONCLUSIONS Here, we present a novel natural language processing pipeline developed using Reddit's alcohol-related subreddits that identify highly specific alcohol-related Twitter hashtags. The prevalence of identified hashtags contains interpretable information about alcohol consumption at both coarse (eg, US state) and fine-grained (eg, metropolitan-micropolitan statistical area level and county) geographical designations. This approach can expand research and deep learning interventions on alcohol abuse and other behavioral health outcomes.","Ricard, Benjamin Joseph; Hassanpour, Saeed",Journal of medical Internet research,182,20

First, I differentiate genetic screening from the moral objections commonly associated with eugenics on the basis of the primary motive for screening (avoidance of suffering) and the preservation of voluntary choice. To lay the groundwork for ethical discussion, I explain the basics of beta thalassemia biochemistry and screening and the clinical picture of beta thalassemia major. I then elaborate on a specific example of the challenges of beta thalassemia major in Cyprus before moving on to the case of Vietnam and discuss the improbability of treatment for this disorder in Vietnam and therefore, the extensive suffering that it causes the Vietnamese people. This leads to my argument that a beta thalassemia screening in Vietnam would hold up the ethical principle of nonmaleficence and also preserves and enhances reproductive choice. I then propose that Vietnam's successful COVID-19 response can be used as a roadmap for beta thalassemia screening.","Riquier, Mai-Tram",Developing world bioethics,182,5

Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) might increase the screening numbers among patients unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy. This registry trial aimed to document and determine the CCE indications, findings, complications, and adverse events in outpatient practices and clinics throughout Germany. Methods Patients undergoing CCE between 2010 and 2015 were enrolled in this prospective multicenter registry trial at six German centers. Patient demographics, outcomes, and complications were evaluated. Results A total of 161 patients were included. Of the CCE evaluations, 111 (68.9%) were considered successful. Pathological findings in the colon (n=92, 60.1%) and in the remaining gastrointestinal tract (n=38, 24.8%) were recorded. The main finding was the presence of polyps (n=52, 32.3%). Furthermore, five carcinomas (3.1%) were detected and histologically confirmed later. Adequate bowel cleanliness was more likely to be achieved in the outpatient setting (p<0.0001). Interestingly, 85 patients (55.6%) chose to undergo CCE based on personal motivation. Conclusions CCE seems to be a reliable and safe endoscopic tool for screening for CRC and detecting other diseases. Its patient acceptance and feasibility seems to be high, especially in the outpatient setting.","Hausmann, Johannes; Tal, Andrea; Gomer, Artur; Philipper, Michael; Moog, Gero; Hohn, Horst; Hesselbarth, Norbert; Plass, Harald; Albert, Jörg; Finkelmeier, Fabian",Clinical endoscopy,182,1

Stability constants for the β-cyclodextrin complex ranged from 14,800 to 46,000 M-1, and the binding enthalpies were between -23.2 and -10.4 kJ/mole. Compared to water, the stability constant in seven carboxylic acid buffers (citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, malic acid and tartaric acid) was reduced. All seven buffers exhibited a competitive mechanism. Binding constants for the interaction between β-cyclodextrin and buffers ranged from 4 to 44 M-1, and binding enthalpies were in the range -19 to -11 kJ/mole. There was a relation between the chemical structures of the buffers and their ability to bind to cyclodextrin. All seven buffers had a carbon chain longer than three carbons. Hydroxyl groups on the carbon chain decreased the binding affinity. 1H and ROESY NMR spectroscopy supported inclusion of the citric acid into the cyclodextrin cavity, although the results for succinic and maleic acids were ambiguous. The results demonstrated that some buffers can interact with cyclodextrin complexes, and careful considerations are necessary when choosing a buffer for cyclodextrin research.","Samuelsen, Lisa; Holm, René; Schönbeck, Christian",International journal of pharmaceutics,182,1

Here, we fitted the contrast response function to psychometric orientation discrimination data while also varying attention demand during maintenance to investigate: (1) whether VSTM load effects on perception are mediated by a modulation of the contrast threshold, consistent with contrast gain accounts, or by the function asymptote (1 lapse rate), consistent with response gain accounts; and (2) whether the VSTM load effects on the contrast response function depend on the availability of attentional resources. We manipulated VSTM load via the number of items in the memory set in a color and location VSTM task and assessed the contrast response function for an orientation discrimination task during maintenance. Attention demand was varied through spatial cuing of the orientation stimulus. Higher VSTM load increased the estimated contrast threshold of the contrast response function without affecting the estimated asymptote, but only when the discrimination task demanded attention. When attentional demand was reduced (in the cued conditions), the VSTM load effects on the contrast threshold were eliminated. The results suggest that VSTM load reduces perceptual sensitivity by increasing contrast thresholds, suggestive of a contrast gain modulation mechanism, as long as the perceptual discrimination task demands attention. These findings support recent claims that attentional resources are shared between perception and VSTM maintenance processes.","Konstantinou, Nikos; Lavie, Nilli",Journal of vision,182,11

OBJECTIVE Our objective was to compare the levels of major milk allergens in uncooked and baked muffins using monoclonal immunoassays and IgE antibody binding before and after baking. METHODS Uncooked and baked muffins were prepared using recipes from Mount Sinai and Imperial College. Allergen levels were compared by ELISA for Bos d 5 (β-lactoglobulin) and Bos d 11 (β-casein). IgE reactivity was assessed using sera from milk-sensitised donors in direct binding and inhibition ELISA. RESULTS Bos d 5 was reduced from 680µg/g in uncooked muffin mix to 0.17µg/g in baked muffins, representing a >99% decrease after baking. Conversely, Bos d 11 levels in baked muffin remained high and only decreased by 30% from a mean of 4249µg/g in uncooked muffin mix to 2961µg/g when baked (~181mg Bos d 11 per muffin). Baked muffins retained ~70% of the IgE binding to uncooked muffin mix. Baked muffin extract inhibited IgE binding to uncooked muffin mix by up to 80%, demonstrating retention of in vitro IgE reactivity. CONCLUSIONS & CLINICAL RELEVANCE High levels of Bos d 11 in baked muffins pose a risk for adverse reactions, especially in patients who have high anti-casein IgE antibodies.","Hindley, James P; Oliver, Maria A; Thorpe, Cathy; Cullinane, Angharad; Wuenschmann, Sabina; Chapman, Martin D",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,182,16

This SPA Port Camera device integrates the monitor, laparoscopic camera, and light source into an inexpensive, portable cannula port. The device uses a 2-channel SPA port inserted through an umbilical incision, similar to traditional SPA. After insertion into a channel, the device deploys a small camera module and LED lamp in vivo. An integrated, on-patient LCD provides the view of the surgical site. The design intent of the port camera is to enhance SPA by (a) reducing the size of the SPA port through the elimination of the dedicated laparoscope channel; (b) reducing equipment cost by integrating an inexpensive CMOS sensor and LED lamp at the port tip; (c) eliminating the need for an assistant who operates the laparoscope; and (d) mechanically coupling the camera, tool port, and on-patient LCD screen. The effectiveness of the device was evaluated by comparing the video performance with a leading industry laparoscope and by performing a user evaluation study and live porcine surgery with the device. Effectiveness of the device was mixed. Overall video system performance of the device is better than an industry standard high-definition laparoscope, implying that significant cost savings over a traditional system are possible. Participant study results suggest that simulated laparoscopic tasks are as efficient with the SPA Port Camera as they are with a typical SPA configuration. However, live surgery revealed several shortcomings of the SPA Port Camera.","Terry, Benjamin S; Schoen, Jonathan; Mills, Zachary; Rentschler, Mark E",Surgical innovation,182,22

This capability satisfies investigators' first priority in crime scene investigations, which is determining if a stain is blood. This thread spray method explores the use of evidentiary fabric threads for rapid determination of hemoglobin directly from whole blood within textiles without prior extraction steps. The multiplicity of information that can be derived from the thread spray MS method distinguishes it from the current presumptive Bluestar® method, by enabling the detection of hemoglobin (both α- and β-chains), the heme co-factor and lipids all from a single blood sample. Lipid composition was found to differ for blood samples originating from human, canine, and horse species. The robustness of the thread spray MS method as a forensic analytical platform was evaluated in three ways: (1) its successful applicability to samples previously tested by the Bluestar® presumptive method, offering a confirmatory test without prior sample pre-treatment, (2) successful detection of heme from previously washed fabrics, which demonstrated the unprecedented sensitivity of the thread spray method, and (3) the ability to analyze samples stored under ambient conditions for up to 30 days. These results attest to the potential capabilities of the thread spray MS platform in forensic serology, and its application for direct analysis of evidentiary garments, which confer the advantages of rapid analysis and the reduction of the false positive and negative identification rates for blood on textiles.","Jackson, Sierra; Frey, Benjamin S; Bates, Maia N; Swiner, Devin J; Badu-Tawiah, Abraham K",The Analyst,182,28

Total pancreatectomy retains the challenges of uncinate process dissection and digestive reconstruction, but avoids the risk of pancreatic fistula, and could be a suitable operation to highlight the advantages of robotic assistance in pancreatic resections. METHODS Eleven laparoscopic robot-assisted total pancreatectomies (LRATP) were compared to 11 case-matched open total pancreatectomies. All operations were performed by one surgeon during the same period of time. Robotic assistance was employed in half of the patients, based on robot availability at the time of surgery. Variables examined included age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, estimated blood loss, need for blood transfusions, operative time, tumor type, tumor size, number of examined lymph nodes, margin status, post-operative complications, 90-day or in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate. RESULTS No LRATP was converted to conventional laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopy or open surgery despite two patients (18.1 %) required vein resection and reconstruction. LRATP was associated with longer mean operative time (600 vs. 469 min; p = 0.014) but decreased mean blood loss (220 vs. 705; p = 0.004) than open surgery. Post-operative complications occurred in similar percentages after LRATP and open surgery. Complications occurring in most patients (5/7) after LRATP were of mild severity (Clavien-Dindo grade I and II). One patient required repeat laparoscopic surgery after LRATP, to drain a fluid collection not amenable to percutaneous catheter drainage. One further patient from the open group required repeat surgery because of bleeding. No patient had margin positive resection, and the mean number of examined lymph nodes was 45 after LRATP and 36 after open surgery. CONCLUSIONS LRATP is feasible in selected patients, but further experience is needed to draw final conclusions.","Boggi, Ugo; Palladino, Simona; Massimetti, Gabriele; Vistoli, Fabio; Caniglia, Fabio; De Lio, Nelide; Perrone, Vittorio; Barbarello, Linda; Belluomini, Mario; Signori, Stefano; Amorese, Gabriella; Mosca, Franco",Surgical endoscopy,182,16

Many older adults live with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), and complex health issues, which adversely affect their day-to-day functioning and overall quality of life. As a result, they frequently rely on the support of friend and/or family caregivers. Caregivers of older adults with MCC often face challenges to their own well-being and also require support. Currently, not enough is known about the health and social care needs of older adults with MCC and the needs of their caregivers or how best to identify and meet these needs. This study will examine and synthesise the literature on the needs of older adults with MCC and those of their caregivers, and identify gaps in evidence and directions for further research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature using the updated Arksey and O'Malley framework. The literature will be identified using a multidatabase and grey literature search strategy developed by a health sciences librarian. Papers, reports and other materials addressing the health and social care needs of older adults and their friend/family caregivers will be included. Search results will be screened, independently, by two reviewers, and data will be abstracted from included literature and charted in duplicate.

Interacting with the pathogen membranes might produce visible changes in shape or cell wall damage. Previously, we showed that the peptides produced by Lactobacillus plantarum UTNGt2, Lactobacillus plantarum UTNCys5-4, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis UTNGt28 exhibit a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens in vitro. In this study, their possible mode of action against the commensal microorganism Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ATCC51741 was investigated. The target membrane permeability was determined by detection of beta-galactosidase release from ONPG (o-nitro-phenyl-L-D-galactoside) substrate and changes in the whole protein profile indicating that the peptide extracts destroy the membrane integrity and may induce breaks in membrane proteins to some extent. The release of aromatic molecules such as DNA/RNA was detected after the interaction of Salmonella with the peptide extract. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) micrographs depicted at least four simultaneous secondary events after the peptide extract treatment underlying their antimicrobial actions, including morphological alterations of the membrane. Spheroplast and filament formation, vacuolation, and DNA relaxation were identified as the principal events from the Gt2 and Cys5-4 peptide extracts, while Gt28 induced the formation of ghost cells by release of cytoplasmic content, filaments, and separation of cell envelope layers. Gel retarding assays indicate that the Gt2 and Gt28 peptide extracts are clearly binding the Salmonella DNA, while Cys5-4 partially interacted with Salmonella genomic DNA. These results increased our knowledge about the inhibitory mechanism employed by several peptide extracts from native lactic acid bacteria against Salmonella. Further, we shall develop peptide-based formulation and evaluate their biocontrol effect in the food chains.","Tenea, Gabriela N",BioMed research international,182,7

Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","Woodfield, J; Brennan, P M; Statham, Pfx; Stone, J; Hoeritzauer, I",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,182,1

Thus, as the creation and translation of effective COVID-19 vaccines continues at an unprecedented speed, the development of fast and effective methods to measure neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will become increasingly important to determine long-term protection against infection for both previously infected and immunized individuals. This paper describes a high-throughput protocol using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum from patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19. The use of a replicating pseudotyped virus eliminates the necessity for a containment level 3 facility required for SARS-CoV-2 handling, making this protocol accessible to virtually any containment level 2 lab.

Host genetic variation is thought to contribute to individual differences in susceptibility and symptom manifestation. Here, we analyze pneumonia data from the UK Biobank (14,780 cases and 439,096 controls) and FinnGen (9980 cases and 86,519 controls) and perform a genomewide association study meta-analysis. We use gene-based tests, colocalization, genetic correlation, latent causal variable (LCV) and polygenic prediction in an independent Australian sample (N = 5595) to draw insights into the etiology of pneumonia risk. We identify two independent loci on chromosome 15 (lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2009746 and rs76474922) to be associated with pneumonia (p < 5e-8). Gene-based tests revealed 18 genes in chromosomes 15, 16 and 9, including IL127, PBX3, ApoB receptor (APOBR) and smoking related genes CHRNA3/5, statistically associated with pneumonia. We observed genetic correlations between pneumonia and cardiorespiratory, psychiatric and inflammatory related traits. LCV analysis suggests a strong genetic causal relationship with cardiovascular health phenotypes. Polygenic risk scores for pneumonia significantly predicted self-reported pneumonia in an independent sample, albeit with a small effect size (OR = 1.11 95% CI [1.04, 1.19], p < .05). Sensitivity analyses suggested the associations in chromosome 15 are mediated by smoking history, but the associations in chromosomes 16 and 9, and polygenic prediction were robust to adjustment for smoking. Altogether, our results highlight common genetic variants, genes and potential pathways that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to pneumonia, and advance our understanding of the genetic factors underlying heterogeneity in respiratory medical outcomes.","Campos, Adrian I; Kho, Pik; Vazquez-Prada, Karla X; García-Marín, Luis M; Martin, Nicholas G; Cuéllar-Partida, Gabriel; Rentería, Miguel E",Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,182,31

After 2003, the canine virus was carried by infected greyhounds to various parts of the United States and then became established in several large animal shelters, where it has continued to circulate. To better understand the evolution of CIV since its emergence, and particularly its microevolution in spatially restricted populations, we examined multiple gene segments of CIV from dogs resident in two large animal shelters in New York City during the period 2006 to 2009. In particular, we focused on viruses circulating in the two shelters in 2008 and 2009, which we found shared a common ancestor. While viruses in each shelter were generally monophyletic, we observed some gene flow between them. These shelter sequences were compared to earlier CIV isolates. The shelter viruses differed in 1 to 6 amino acids in each gene segment compared to viruses isolated in Florida between 2003 and 2005 and in Colorado in 2006 and 2008. A comparison of the sequences of equine and canine viruses revealed amino acid replacements that distinguished the viruses from the two hosts, but no clear evidence of positive selection indicative of host adaptation was detected, suggesting that any host range adaptation in CIV occurred early in the emergence of this virus or even before it transferred to dogs.","Hayward, Jessica J; Dubovi, Edward J; Scarlett, Janet M; Janeczko, Stephanie; Holmes, Edward C; Parrish, Colin R",Journal of virology,182,8

However, the feasibility of pre-procedural stent size estimation using QISS MRA would merit investigation. PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility of QISS MRA for pre-procedural stent size estimation in PAD patients compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA). STUDY TYPE Retrospective. SUBJECTS Thirty-three PAD patients (68 ± 9 years, 18 men, 15 women). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE Two-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession QISS MRA at 1.5 T and 3 T. ASSESSMENT All patients received QISS MRA and CTA of the lower extremity run-off followed by interventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Stenotic lesion length and diameter were quantified (AMF and AVS with 3 and 13 years of experience in cardiovascular imaging, respectively) to estimate the dimensions of the stent necessary to restore blood flow in the treated arteries. Measured dimensions were adjusted to the closest stent size available. STATISTICAL TESTS The Friedman test with subsequent pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the estimated stent dimensions between QISS MRA, CTA, and the physical stent size used for intervention. Intra-class correlation (ICC) analysis was performed to assess inter-reader agreement. Significant differences were considered at P < 0.05. RESULTS No significant difference was observed between estimated stent diameter by QISS MRA or CTA compared to physical stent diameter (8.9 ± 2.9 mm, 8.8 ± 3.0 mm, and 8.8 ± 3.8 mm, respectively; χ2 = 1.45, P = 0.483). There was a significant underestimation of stent length for both QISS MRA and CTA, compared to physical stent length (45.8 ± 27.8 mm, 46.4 ± 29.3 mm, and 50.4 ± 34.0 mm, respectively; χ2 = 11.96) which could be corrected when measurements were adjusted to the next available stent length (χ2 = 2.38, P = 0.303). Inter-reader assessment showed good to excellent agreement between the readers (all ICC ≥0.81).

CSDH patients are often elderly and have several comorbidities. We evaluated our experience with transradial access (TRA) for MMA embolization using predominantly Onyx under conscious sedation. METHODS Data for consecutive patients who underwent transradial MMA embolization for CSDH during a 2-year period (2018-2019) were analyzed from a single-center, prospectively-maintained database. Patient demographics, comorbidities, ambulatory times, subdural hematoma resorption status, and guide catheter type were recorded. Conversion to femoral access and complication rates were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Forty-six patients (mean age, 71.7±14.4 years) were included in this study. Mean CSDH size was 14±5.5 mm. Most (91.3%) TRA embolizations were performed with 6-French 0.071-inch Benchmark guide catheters (Penumbra). MMA embolization was successful in 44 patients (95.7%) (including two cases of TRA conversion). Twenty-one (48%) patients had a severe Charlson Comorbidity Index (>5). Symptomatic improvement was noted in 39 of 44 patients (88.6%). Mean length of stay was 4±3 days. Patients were ambulated immediately postprocedure. At mean follow-up (8±4 weeks), 86.4% of patients had complete or partial CSDH resolution. Persistent use of antiplatelet agents after the procedure was associated with failed or minimal CSDH resorption (5 of 6, 83.3% vs 9 of 38 23.7% with complete or near-complete resolution; P=0.009). CONCLUSION Transradial Onyx MMA embolization under conscious sedation is safe and effective for CSDH treatment. TRA may be especially useful in elderly patients with numerous comorbidities.","Rajah, Gary B; Waqas, Muhammad; Dossani, Rimal H; Vakharia, Kunal; Gong, Andrew D; Rho, Kyungduk; Housley, Steven B; Rai, Hamid H; Chin, Felix; Tso, Michael K; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,182,1

A group of educators deployed a virtual curriculum utilizing telemedicine and electronic health record (EHR) technologies. METHODS Nine students participated in a formal curriculum of high-value critical care medicine topics designed to meet the learning objectives of the in-person experience. Students obtained patient histories and directed physical examinations virtually via telemedicine. They followed assigned patients, submitted clinical documentation, and practiced electronic order entry using a non-production EHR copy. At conclusion these students completed the same evaluation used for ""in-person"" CCM rotations earlier in the year. RESULTS Students rated the virtual rotation comparably to the traditional rotation in most evaluated criteria. Lower rated areas included ""perform minor procedures"", ""patient counseling"", and ""interprofessional experiences"". Students' narrative responses specifically noted strengths of the ""student focus"" and the ability to practice in an EHR copy. DISCUSSION Students and preceptors generally found that the virtual curriculum provided adequate educational opportunities. Certain areas were clearly lacking, as expected. Students felt the dedication of the faculty to the students' educational needs was the most important factor contributing to the success of the program. The results suggest several ways telemedicine and EHR technologies might enhance clinical medical education in the future. CONCLUSION This methodology was successful in providing elements of a CCM rotation experience. This technology could prove efficacious for primary care rotations where in-person training is not feasible due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Shoemaker, Margrit M; Lippold, Cassiopia; Schreiber, Richard; Levy, Bruce",International journal of medical informatics,182,31

Study Objective The main objective of this study was to assess the real number of available and readily freeable beds (""bed surge capacity"") and the availability of emergency operating rooms (OR) in a maximum emergency using a theoretical simulation. Patients and Methods The proportion of dismissible patients in four areas (Medical Area, Surgical Area, Sub-intensive Care Units, Intensive Care Units) and three emergency OR was assessed at 2 and 24 hours after a simulated maximum emergency. Four scenarios were modeled. Hospitalization and surgical capacities were assessed on weekdays and holidays. The creation of new beds was presumed by the possibility of moving patients to a lower level of care than that provided at the time of detection, of dislocation of patients to a discharge room, with care transferred to lower-intensity hospitals, rehabilitation, or discharge facilities. The Phase 1 table-top simulations were conducted during the weekday morning hours. In particular, the 24-hour table-top simulations of a hypothetical event lasted about 150 minutes compared to those conducted at 2 hours, which were found to be longer (about 195 minutes). Phase 2 was conducted on two public holidays and a quick response time was observed within the first 40 minutes of the start of the test (about 45% of departments). Results The availability of simulated beds was greater than that indicated in the maximum emergency plans (which was based solely on the census of beds). Patients admitted to Intensive Care and The Sub-Intensive Area may be more difficult to move than those in low-intensity care. The availability of emergency OR was not problematic. Age influenced the possibility of remitting/transferring patients. Conclusion Simulation in advance of a maximum emergency is helpful in designing an efficient response plan.","Ceresa, Iride Francesca; Savioli, Gabriele; Angeli, Valentina; Novelli, Viola; Muzzi, Alba; Grugnetti, Giuseppina; Cobianchi, Lorenzo; Manzoni, Federica; Klersy, Catherine; Lago, Paolo; Marchese, Pierantonio; Marena, Carlo; Ricevuti, Giovanni; Bressan, Maria Antonietta",Open access emergency medicine : OAEM,182,24

Argus II is the only visual implant with FDA approval, with more than 300 users worldwide. Argus II stimulation is based on a grayscale image coming from a head-mounted visible-light camera. Normally, the 11°×19° field of view of the Argus II user is full of objects that may elicit similar phosphenes. The prosthesis cannot meaningfully convey so much visual information, and the percept is reduced to an ambiguous impression of light. This study is aimed at investigating the efficacy of simplifying the video input in real-time using a heat-sensitive camera. Data were acquired from four Argus II users in 5 stationary tasks with either hot objects or human targets as stimuli. All tasks were of m-alternative forced choice design where precisely one of the m≥2 response alternatives was defined to be ""correct"" by the experimenter. To compare performance with heat-sensitive and normal cameras across all tasks, regardless of m, we used an extension of signal detection theory to latent variables, estimating person ability and item difficulty in d' units. Results demonstrate that subject performance was significantly better across all tasks with the thermal camera compared to the regular Argus II camera.

This study used the new nociception level (NOL) index to compare the nociceptive response induced by GVL or MAC during laryngoscopy with or without intubation. METHODS Patients underwent two laryngoscopies at four-minute intervals (L1, L2), one with GVL and the other with MAC (first randomization). A third laryngoscopy (L3) followed by tracheal intubation was performed four minutes after L2 (GVL or MAC, second randomization). Nociception was quantitatively assessed by NOL and standard hemodynamic parameters (heart rate [HR] and mean arterial pressure). For the crossover design, blade comparisons accounted for sequence and blade type. A possible carryover effect between laryngoscopies was assessed. RESULTS In the 50 patients randomized, there was no carryover effect from one laryngoscopy to the next for all analyzed parameters. Nociception level index peak values were higher with MAC than GVL. Analysis of ΔNOL showed a lower nociceptive response with GVL for L1+L2 combined. Mean peak NOL values were significantly higher after L3+intubation than after L1+L2, for both GVL and MAC groups. Analysis of ΔHR values did not show a significant difference between GVL and MAC for any laryngoscopy. CONCLUSION Laryngoscopy alone with GVL induces less nociception than with MAC. The NOL was more sensitive than HR at detecting nociceptive responses to MAC vs GVL. Additionally, and irrespective of which technique/blade was used, the combination of laryngoscopy + tracheal intubation produced a much greater nociceptive response than the laryngoscopy alone.

We examined the beneficial role AI can play in noninvasively grading vascular access aneurysms to reduce high-morbidity events, such as rupture, in ESRD patients on hemodialysis. METHODS Our AI instrument noninvasively examines and grades aneurysms in both arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous grafts. Aneurysm stages were adjudicated by 3 vascular specialists, based on a grading system that focuses on actions that need to be taken. Our automatic classification of aneurysms builds on 2 components: (a) the use of smartphone technology to capture aneurysm appearance and (b) the analysis of these images using a cloud-based convolutional neural network (CNN). RESULTS There was a high degree of correlation between our noninvasive AI instrument and the results of the adjudication by the vascular experts. Our results indicate that CNN can automatically classify aneurysms. We achieved a >90% classification accuracy in the validation images. CONCLUSION This is the first quality improvement project to show that an AI instrument can reliably grade vascular access aneurysms in a noninvasive way, allowing rapid assessments to be made on patients who would otherwise be at risk for highly morbid events. Moreover, these AI-assisted assessments can be made without having to schedule separate appointments and potentially even via telehealth.","Krackov, Warren; Sor, Murat; Razdan, Rishi; Zheng, Hanjie; Kotanko, Peter",Blood purification,182,16

For this purpose, an amalgamated binary admixture (ABA) is proposed by assimilating shredded face mask (FM) waste, which is posing serious environmental concerns these days, with a cementitious waste material, i.e., silica fume (SF). However, for such ABA, the optimization of mix design is desirable because an excessive amount of one component could disturb the required balance. To address this issue, response surface methodology (RSM) is used in the current study, which is a strong technique used during the process of production to develop, improve, and optimize product inputs. Several experiments are designed and conducted to evaluate mechanical responses, i.e., unconfined compressive strength (qu), brittleness index (IB), deformability index (ID), and California bearing ratio (CBR) value, of treated fat clay by varying mix designs of ABA. Based on the test results, mathematical models are developed which are found to be statistically valid to predict the subjected responses using SF and FM as inputs. Afterward, an optimized mix design is determined by integrating developed models with a desirability function model and setting maximization of strength and ductility as the optimization goals. An ABA having 7.9% SF and 1.2% FM is observed to provide the highest strength and ductility for multiple applications, i.e., road and buildings, with desirability factor close to unity; responses of which are also validated by performing tests. Furthermore, analysis of cleaning aspect shows that the use of optimized ABA in place of cement for subgrade improvement of 1 km two-lane road could avoid CO2 emission of around 79,032 kg of C, save 42,720 kWh and 1174.8 GJ of electrical and thermal energy, respectively, and clean 43 Mg of FM waste; however, astute protocols of COVID-19 FM waste handling and disinfection are needed to be established and followed.","Rehman, Zia Ur; Khalid, Usama",Environmental science and pollution research international,182,33

Combining LAGB with gastric plication (LAGB-P) may increase weight loss compared to LAGB alone. METHODS In this study, we report our short-term experience with this novel technique and compare the data for the first 42 consecutive patients with the data for LAGB alone and LSG. Forty-two morbidly obese patients underwent LAGB-P and were followed for 12 months. Operative complications, weight loss, and late complications were followed and compared with matched groups of LAGB alone and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The setting was a university hospital in Taiwan. RESULTS The study consisted of 42 patients, specifically 21 males and 21 females with an average age of 32.6±9.7 years (range 18 to 58) and a mean body mass index of 40.7±6.1 kg/m2 (range 31.5 to 56.4). The mean operation time was 141.9±24.8 minutes (range 105 to 190), and the mean hospital stay was 2.3±1.9 days. Two (4.8%) major complications were encountered and resolved by laparoscopic revision surgery. There was 1 (2.4%) major complication in the LSG group and none in the LAGB group. The operation time for LAGB-P was longer than for LAGB and LSG (75.6±17.9 and 110.5±22.3 minutes; P<.001). The mean body mass index of the LAGB-P group decreased from 40.7 to 29.4 kg/m2 at 1 year after surgery, with an excess weight loss of 62.6%. This result is similar to the 67.2% excess weight loss in the LSG group, but is higher than the 31.7% excess weight loss of the LAGB group. At follow-up, revision surgery was required in 2 (4.8%) patients in the LAGBP group, none (0%) in the LAGB group, and 1 (2.4%) in the LSG group. More patients in the LSG group still required proton pump inhibitor treatment at 1 year after surgery than the other 2 groups CONCLUSION By combining LAGB with gastric plication, LAGB-P can augment the weight loss of LAGB and is similar to LSG but may increase risk.","Lee, Wei-Jei; Lee, Kuo-Ting; Ser, Kong-Han; Chen, Jung-Chien; Tsou, Ju-Juin; Lee, Yi-Chih",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,182,24

A number of recent studies have evaluated the filtration efficiency and pressure differential (an indicator of breathability) of various, widely available materials that the general public can use to make face masks at home. In this review, we summarize those studies to provide guidance for both the public to select the best materials for face masks and for future researchers to rigorously evaluate and report on mask material testing. Of the tested fabric materials and material combinations with adequate breathability, most single and multilayer combinations had a filtration efficiency of <30%. Most studies evaluating commonly available mask materials did not follow standard methods that would facilitate comparison across studies, and materials were often described with too few details to allow consumers to purchase equivalent materials to make their own masks. To improve the usability of future study results, researchers should use standard methods and report material characteristics in detail.","Kwong, Laura H; Wilson, Rob; Kumar, Shailabh; Crider, Yoshika Susan; Reyes Sanchez, Yasmin; Rempel, David; Pillarisetti, Ajay",ACS nano,182,6

BACKGROUND In the PLATO trial, patients assigned to ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel and who underwent CABG had significantly lower total and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS In the 1,261 patients with CABG performed within 7 days after stopping study drug, reviewers blinded to treatment assignment classified causes of death into subcategories of vascular and nonvascular, and specifically identified bleeding or infection events that either caused or subsequently contributed to death. RESULTS Numerically more vascular deaths occurred in the clopidogrel versus the ticagrelor group related to myocardial infarction (14 vs. 10), heart failure (9 vs. 6), arrhythmia or sudden death (9 vs. 3), and bleeding, including hemorrhagic stroke (7 vs. 2). Clopidogrel was also associated with an excess of nonvascular deaths related to infection (8 vs. 2). Among factors directly causing or contributing to death, bleeding and infections were more common in the clopidogrel group compared with the ticagrelor group (infections: 16 vs. 6, p < 0.05, and bleeding: 27 vs. 9, p < 0.01, for clopidogrel and ticagrelor, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The mortality reduction with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel following CABG in the PLATO trial was associated with fewer deaths from cardiovascular, bleeding, and infection complications.

Methods This study was retrospectively performed at five university teaching hospitals between 1st January 2018 and 31th March 2020. Routine molecular testing using for multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods was conducted on the respiratory viruses. We assessed the demographics, laboratory findings, and treatment of patients infected with coronavirus. Results There were 807 coronavirus-infected patients from 24,311 patients with respiratory virus PCR test admitted to five hospitals over 27 months. All-cause mortality rates of patients admitted for seasonal HCoV disease were 3.1% in all patients and 10.8% in patients aged ≥18 years. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed in patients aged ≥18 years. After adjusting for other clinical variables, general weakness symptoms [hazard ratio (HR), 2.651; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.147-6.125, P=0.023], National Early Warning Score (NEWS) ≥2 (HR, 5.485; 95% CI, 1.261-23.858, P=0.023), and coronavirus subtype OC43 (HR, 2.500; 95% CI, 1.060-5.897, P=0.036) were significantly associated with death from coronavirus. Conclusions Coronavirus infection can reveal a higher mortality rate in patients of ≥18 than those of <18 years, thus, adult patients require more careful treatment. Furthermore, in adult patients, the factors associated with death from coronavirus include general weakness symptoms, NEWS higher than 2, and OC43 subtype.","Kim, Taehee; Choi, Hayoung; Shin, Tae Rim; Ko, Yousang; Park, Yong Bum; Kim, Hwan Il; Jang, Seung Hun; Jung, Ki Suck; Kim, Youlim; Lee, Myung Goo; Chung, Soojie; Kim, Cheol-Hong; Hyun, In Gyu; Sim, Yun Su",Journal of thoracic disease,182,1

Molecular mechanisms driving norovirus evolution are the accumulation of point mutations and recombination. Intragenotypic recombination has long been postulated to be a driving force of GII.4 noroviruses, the predominant genotype circulating in humans for over two decades. Increasingly, emergence and re-emergence of different intragenotype recombinants have been reported. The number and types of norovirus recombinants remained undefined until the 2007 Journal of General Virology research article 'Norovirus recombination' reported an assembly of 20 hitherto unclassified intergenotypic norovirus recombinant types. In the intervening decade, a host of novel recombinants has been analysed. New recombination breakpoints have been described, in vitro and in vivo studies supplement in silico analyses, and advances have been made in analysing factors driving norovirus recombination. This work presents a timely overview of these data and focuses on important aspects of norovirus recombination and its role in norovirus molecular evolution. An overview of intergenogroup, intergenotype, intragenotype and 'obligatory' norovirus recombinants as detected via in silico methods in the field is provided, enlarging the scope of intergenotypic recombinant types to 80 in total, and notably including three intergenogroup recombinants.

They function as hub molecules at the crossroad of different signaling pathways for the induction of interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines, as well as of antiviral and immunomodulatory genes even in an IFN-independent manner. By regulating the development and activity of immune cells, IRFs also function as a bridge between innate and adaptive responses.

We investigated why RESs between AVA premotor interneurons and A-type cholinergic motoneurons (A-MNs) in Caenorhabditis elegans escape circuit conduct junctional currents (I j) only in the antidromic direction. These RESs consist of UNC-7 innexin in AVA and UNC-9 innexin in A-MNs. UNC-7 has multiple isoforms differing in the length and sequence of the amino terminus. In a heterologous expression system, only one UNC-7 isoform, UNC-7b, can form heterotypic gap junctions (GJs) with UNC-9 that strongly favor I j in the UNC-9 to UNC-7 direction. Knockout of unc-7b alone almost eliminated the I j, whereas AVA-specific expression of UNC-7b substantially rescued the coupling defect of unc-7 mutant. Neutralizing charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus abolished the rectification property of UNC-7b/UNC-9 GJs. Our results suggest that the rectification property results from electrostatic interactions between charged residues in UNC-7b amino terminus.","Shui, Yuan; Liu, Ping; Zhan, Haiying; Chen, Bojun; Wang, Zhao-Wen",Science advances,182,1

Recombination signal-binding protein Jκ (RBP-J)-mediated Notch signaling regulates macrophage development and phenotype. Here, using bleomycin-induced fibrosis model combined with myeloid-specific RBP-J disruption (RBP-JcKO ) mouse, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in macrophages during PF. Compared with the control, RBP-JcKO mice exhibited alleviated lung fibrosis as manifested by reduced collagen deposition and inflammation, and decreased TGF-β production. FACS analysis suggested that decreased Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs might make the major contribution to attenuated fibrogenesis in RBP-JcKO mice, probably by reduced inflammatory factor release and enhanced matrix metalloproteinases expression. Using clodronate-mediated macrophage depletion in RBP-JckO mice, we demonstrated that embryonic-derived AMs play negligible role in lung fibrosis, which was further supported by adoptive transfer experiments. Moreover, on CCR2 knockout background, the effect of RBP-J deficiency on fibrogenesis was not elicited, suggesting that Notch regulated monocyte-derived AMs. Co-culture experiment showed that monocyte-derived AMs from RBP-JcKO mice exhibit reduced myofibroblast activation due to decreased TGF-β secretion. In conclusion, monocyte-derived Ly6clo MHCIIhi AMs, which are regulated by RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling, play an essential role in lung fibrosis.","Zhang, Ni; Yang, Kui; Bai, Jian; Yi, Jing; Gao, Chunchen; Zhao, Junlong; Liang, Shiqian; Wei, Tiaoxia; Feng, Lei; Song, Liqiang; Han, Hua; Qin, Hongyan",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,182,1

Cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain protein (CISH), a suppressor of cytokine signaling, controls interleukin-2 signaling. METHODS Using a case-control design, we tested for an association between CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to major infectious diseases (bacteremia, tuberculosis, and severe malaria) in blood samples from 8402 persons in Gambia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Malawi, and Vietnam. We had previously tested 20 other immune-related genes in one or more of these sample collections. RESULTS We observed associations between variant alleles of multiple CISH polymorphisms and increased susceptibility to each infectious disease in each of the study populations. When all five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (at positions -639, -292, -163, +1320, and +3415 [all relative to CISH]) within the CISH-associated locus were considered together in a multiple-SNP score, we found an association between CISH genetic variants and susceptibility to bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis (P=3.8x10(-11) for all comparisons), with -292 accounting for most of the association signal (P=4.58x10(-7)). Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells obtained from adult subjects carrying the -292 variant, as compared with wild-type cells, showed a muted response to the stimulation of interleukin-2 production--that is, 25 to 40% less CISH expression. CONCLUSIONS Variants of CISH are associated with susceptibility to diseases caused by diverse infectious pathogens, suggesting that negative regulators of cytokine signaling have a role in immunity against various infectious diseases. The overall risk of one of these infectious diseases was increased by at least 18% among persons carrying the variant CISH alleles.","Khor, Chiea C; Vannberg, Fredrik O; Chapman, Stephen J; Guo, Haiyan; Wong, Sunny H; Walley, Andrew J; Vukcevic, Damjan; Rautanen, Anna; Mills, Tara C; Chang, Kwok-Chiu; Kam, Kai-Man; Crampin, Amelia C; Ngwira, Bagrey; Leung, Chi-Chiu; Tam, Cheuk-Ming; Chan, Chiu-Yeung; Sung, Joseph J Y; Yew, Wing-Wai; Toh, Kai-Yee; Tay, Stacey K H; Kwiatkowski, Dominic; Lienhardt, Christian; Hien, Tran-Tinh; Day, Nicholas P; Peshu, Nobert; Marsh, Kevin; Maitland, Kathryn; Scott, J Anthony; Williams, Thomas N; Berkley, James A; Floyd, Sian; Tang, Nelson L S; Fine, Paul E M; Goh, Denise L M; Hill, Adrian V S",The New England journal of medicine,182,31

METHODS The aim of the study was to determine if increased UA during labour is associated with an increased risk of either short- or long-term neurological injury in term neonates, or with neonatal proxy measures of intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the following terms: uterine activity, excessive uterine activity, XSUA, uterine hyperstimulation, and tachysystole. Any study that analysed the relationship between UA during term labour and neurological outcomes/selected proxy neurological outcomes was eligible for inclusion. Outcomes from individual studies were reported in tables and presented descriptively with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and means with standard deviations for continuous outcomes. Where group numbers were provided, ORs and their CIs were calculated according to Altman. MAIN RESULTS Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies featured umbilical artery pH as an individual outcome. Umbilical artery base excess and Apgar scores were both reported as individual outcomes in four studies. No study examined long term neurodevelopmental outcomes and only one study reported on encephalopathy as an outcome. The evidence for a relationship between UA and adverse infant outcomes was inconsistent. The reported estimated effect size varied from non-existent to clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence that increased UA may be a non-specific predictor of depressed neurological function in the newborn, but it is inconsistent and insufficient to support the conclusion that an association generally exists.","Reynolds, Adam J; Geary, Michael P; Hayes, Breda C",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,182,1

METHODS Viral occurrence was evaluated by molecular methods in polyp, turbinate mucosa, and pre- and postoperative scraping specimens from 35 consecutive patients at different time points in relation to FESS. RESULTS Overall, 21 patients (60%) were positive to at least one virus in at least one specimen; in particular, 12.1% of all specimens for HHV-6 (3/35 polyps, 11/31 turbinates, 1 presurgical scraping) and 10.5% for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (8/35 polyps, 3/31 turbinates, 1/29 pre- and 1/29 postsurgical scraping), followed by CMV and HSV-1 (both 1.6%; 1/35 polyps, 1/29 postsurgical scraping and 2/35 polyps, respectively). EBV positivity tended to be higher in polyps, as well as HHV-6 in adjacent healthy turbinate mucosa, although no significant association was found. Only one preoperative cytological specimen was positive to parainfluenza virus-1. CONCLUSION No association between the development of nasal polyps, herpesviruses and CARVs seems to exist. However, the higher EBV frequency in polyps could suggest a causative role or persistence in the inflammatory lymphoid tissue.","Costa, Cristina; Garzaro, Massimiliano; Boggio, Valeria; Sidoti, Francesca; Simeone, Salvatore; Raimondo, Luca; Cavallo, Giovanni Patrick; Pecorari, Giancarlo; Cavallo, Rossana",Intervirology,182,7

Pigs are often used as surgical models in translational research; however, reports of tissue reactions to both suture materials in pigs are limited. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and histologic responses of skin incisions closed with a subcuticular technique using glycomer 631 and lactomer 9-1 in pigs. RESULTS Skin incisions on 17 pigs were closed with glycomer 631 and lactomer 9-1, and a clinical reactive score (CRS) including erythema, swelling, discharge and dehiscence was calculated on postoperative days 7 and 14. Subcuticular tissue reaction was assessed histologically on postoperative day 14 (the presence of extravascular neutrophils, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, bacterial colonies and the overall severity of the inflammatory response to the suture material), and the cumulative score of the variables was calculated as an aggregate tissue irritation score (ATIS). Tissue samples were examined for suture extrusion and evaluated microbiologically. The clinical reactive score did not differ between the suture materials. Only one ATIS variable, namely the overall severity of the inflammatory response, was lower (p = 0.029) when glycomer 631 was used. Suture extrusion was found in 10/17 of the incisions closed by glycomer 631 and in 7/13 of the incisions closed by lactomer 9-1. Trueperella pyogenes was isolated from the skin and from the area of tissue reaction in six pigs. CONCLUSIONS No difference in CRS between the suture materials was observed, and thus both materials may be used for the subcuticular technique in pigs. Glycomer 631 induced less tissue reaction only in terms of the overall severity of the inflammatory response. Suture extrusion was observed in more than 50% of incisions regardless of the suture material, possibly due to a large amount of suture material in the wound. Trueperella pyogenes was the only pathogen isolated from the tissue surrounding the suture material.","Plavec, Tanja; Švara, Tanja; Zdovc, Irena; Gombač, Mitja; Damjanovska, Marija; Stopar Pintarič, Tatjana; Cvetko, Erika; Seliškar, Alenka",BMC veterinary research,182,5

Studies have suggested that these comorbidities also are related to erythrocyte factors linked to increased blood viscosity in microcirculation such as erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte deformability. Increased blood viscosity in microcirculation can lead to a decrease in oxygenation and nutrition of tissues. Therefore erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte deformability may be involved in covid-19 severity, leading to tissue hypoxia and a decrease of drug concentration in affected organs. If this relationship is demonstrated, erythrocytes factors can be used to monitor treatments for improve microcirculatory fluidity that may decrease covid-19 severity. Lifestyle improvement and treatments such as vitamin D and estrogens supplementation are some possible approaches to improve microcirculation and covid-19 prevention and treatment.","Farber, Paulo Luiz",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,182,7

Transthoracic esophagectomy is the preferred surgical approach worldwide allowing for en-bloc resection of the tumor with the surrounding lymph nodes. However, the percentage of cardiopulmonary complications associated with the transthoracic approach is high (50 to 70%).Recent studies have shown that robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (RATE) is at least equivalent to the open transthoracic approach for esophageal cancer in terms of short-term oncological outcomes. RATE was accompanied with reduced blood loss, shorter ICU stay and improved lymph node retrieval compared with open esophagectomy, and the pulmonary complication rate, hospital stay and perioperative mortality were comparable. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy, risks, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of RATE as an alternative to open transthoracic esophagectomy for treatment of esophageal cancer. METHODS/DESIGN This is an investigator-initiated and investigator-driven monocenter randomized controlled parallel-group, superiority trial. All adult patients (age ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years) with histologically proven, surgically resectable (cT1-4a, N0-3, M0) esophageal carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus and with European Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1 or 2 will be assessed for eligibility and included after obtaining informed consent. Patients (n = 112) with resectable esophageal cancer are randomized in the outpatient department to either RATE (n = 56) or open three-stage transthoracic esophageal resection (n = 56). The primary outcome of this study is the percentage of overall complications (grade 2 and higher) as stated by the modified Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. DISCUSSION This is the first randomized controlled trial designed to compare RATE with open transthoracic esophagectomy as surgical treatment for resectable esophageal cancer. If our hypothesis is proven correct, RATE will result in a lower percentage of postoperative complications, lower blood loss, and shorter hospital stay, but with at least similar oncologic outcomes and better postoperative quality of life compared with open transthoracic esophagectomy. The study started in January 2012. Follow-up will be 5 years. Short-term results will be analyzed and published after discharge of the last randomized patient.

The deposition of beta amyloid leads to vascular fragility due to degeneration of vessel walls, formation of microaneurysms particularly in cortical blood vessels and fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis. The Congo red positive amyloid deposits are biochemically similar to the material comprising senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Recurrent or multiple simultaneous hemorrhages particularly in older patients should raise the suspicion of CAA. Gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive, non-invasive technique for identifying even very small hemorrhages and superficial siderosis, which may cause transient symptoms in CAA. There is also a correlation between CAA, microbleeding and cognitive decline. Inflammatory variants of CAA must be suspected whenever patients present with progressive dementia, headache and multifocal symptoms in association with CAA findings in MRI. Histopathologically, a distinction is made between CAA-related inflammation (CAA-ri) with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and amyloid beta-related angiitis (ABRA) with histological detection of transmural vasculitis. Inflammatory variants should be treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.","Berlit, P; Keyvani, K; Krämer, M; Weber, R",Der Nervenarzt,182,26

METHODS Female patients undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to receive isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane anaesthesia. After induction, anaesthesia was maintained by the volatile agent at 1 minimum alveolar concentration and supplemented with remifentanil infusion. BIS values were recorded during 1 h surgical anaesthesia after a 15 min equilibrium phase. RESULTS Time-averaged BIS value during the study period was significantly lower in the desflurane group (n = 29) than the sevoflurane group (n = 27) (37.0 ± 4.9 vs 41.5 ± 5.9). Duration of deep hypnosis (BIS < 40) was significantly longer in the desflurane group than the sevoflurane group (40.2 ± 20.7 vs 24.3 ± 22.5 min). There were no significant differences in any parameter between the isoflurane group (n = 27) and any other group. CONCLUSIONS Desflurane produces a greater hypnotic effect than sevoflurane during equipotent anaesthesia. Management of volatile anaesthesia using predetermined minimum alveolar concentration targets can lead to an unnecessarily long duration of deep hypnosis.","Kim, Jin-Kyoung; Kim, Duk-Kyung; Lee, Myeong-Jin",The Journal of international medical research,182,16

They include hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) caused mostly by bacteria, fungi, and particles containing animal proteins, and immunotoxic diseases such as organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) and byssinosis, caused mostly by bacterial and fungal toxins. The two most probable scenarios of possible interrelations between these three comorbidities (CM) and COVID-19 are: 1) 'Triggering' - when infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe CM after bioaerosol exposure; 2) 'Reverse triggering' when exposure to bioaerosol exacerbates a symptomless or mild course of COVID-19, and evokes a severe disease. The occupations mostly endangered by COVID-19 as the result of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosol, or to other bioaerosols which may exacerbate this disease, include: health care workers, social workers, breeders of fur animals, slaughterhouse workers, workers engaged in the processing and selling of seafood, and probably also agricultural workers, mainly in the developing countries. The authors present a hypothesis for the origin of the present pandemic. It assumes that a mild form of the present SARS-CoV-2 that is supposedly circulating among the Chinese population in the eastern part of the country, mutated under the influence of as yet unknown factor(s) present in the Chinese seafood markets, probably component(s) of bioaerosols, into the virulent and highly contagious form, known as the present SARS-CoV-2, under a scenario similar to that the authors have named 'Reverse triggering'.","Dutkiewicz, Jacek; Mackiewicz, Barbara; Lemieszek, Marta Kinga",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,182,1

A hand-sewn anastomosis (HSA) and circular-stapled anastomosis (CSA) are both common techniques. We hypothesized that the CSA was associated with a greater incidence of anastomotic complications. As a secondary aim, we sought to determine if weight loss varied by technique. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of patients who underwent primary LRYGB at the Medical College of Wisconsin from January 2010 to December 2011. Procedures were performed by one of 2 surgeons, each with a preferred gastrojejunostomy technique. Clinical information and patient outcomes were followed up to one year. RESULTS A total of 190 patients underwent LRYGB during the study interval. The majority of patients underwent HSA. Forty-one of 190 (21.6%) patients experienced one or more complications. Most complications were Clavien Classification Grade III and were experienced within 30 days of surgery in 3 (2.2%) HSA patients and 6 (10.9%) CSA patients (P = .02). Anastomotic complications occurred more frequently with the CSA technique (marginal ulcer 5.5% CSA versus .7% HSA; P = .04 and stenosis 16.4% CSA versus 3% HSA; P = .01). There were no gastrojejunostomy leaks in this series. Operative time was significantly longer in HSA patients (204 minutes HSA versus 166 minutes CSA; P<.01), but length of hospital stay did not differ. Weight loss at 12 months was similar between techniques (69.4% percent excess BMI lost (EBMIL) HSA versus 76.6% EBMIL CSA; P = .11). No patients were lost to follow-up at 30 days. Thirty-five patients (19%) were lost to follow-up by one year. CONCLUSION The CSA technique of gastrojejunostomy in gastric bypass is associated with a higher rate of nonlife threatening anastomotic complications than the HSA technique. Operative times are significantly longer for HSA, but length of hospital stay (LOS) and long-term weight loss are equivalent.","Lois, Alex W; Frelich, Matthew J; Goldblatt, Matthew I; Wallace, James R; Gould, Jon C",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,182,19

In this experimental study, adhesions against absorbable and non-absorbable fixation methods were compared. METHODS Six commercially available fixation methods were placed intraperitoneally in rats with a small pore polypropylene mesh coated on one side with ePTFE (Intramesh T1(®)). Two non-absorbable fixation methods: Prolene(®) (polypropylene) sutures and Protack(®) (titanium) tackers. Four absorbable methods: Vicryl(®) sutures (polyglactin), Absorbatack(®) and Permasorb(®) tackers (both mixes of lactic and glycolic acids) and Tisseel Duo(®) (fibrin glue). Adhesions and histology were studied at 7 and 90 days follow-up. In addition, fixation methods were placed without mesh, in order to study the reaction to the fixation method per se. RESULTS No adhesion formation, but also inadequate mesh fixation was found with Tisseel Duo(®), which had been completely resorbed at 7 days follow-up. Vicryl(®) sutures could no longer be detected at 90 days follow-up and were associated with a favorable adhesion profile. All other fixation methods were still intact 90 days after implantation. When placed without mesh, adhesion formation was significantly less than placed with a mesh (18 vs. 93 %, P < 0.001). Without mesh, adhesions were worst with Permasorb(®) tackers. CONCLUSIONS Absorbable fixation methods such as polyglactin sutures and fibrin glue show a favorable adhesion profile compared to longer-term absorbable or non-absorbable fixation methods. However, before using fibrin glue as a single fixation method more research is required.","Schreinemacher, M H F; van Barneveld, K W Y; Peeters, E; Miserez, M; Gijbels, M J J; Greve, J-W M; Bouvy, N D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,182,14

The purpose of our study was to determine whether long-tract fistulas (>4 cm) correlated with successful closure. METHODS All patients undergoing transsphincteric cryptoglandular fistula repair with anal fistula plugs were enrolled in a prospective database. Patients with Crohn's disease were excluded. Fistula tract length was measured intraoperatively by subtracting the remaining plug length from the original plug size. All procedures used standardized techniques and postoperative care pathways. The primary outcome was complete fistula closure assessed through both postoperative outpatient visits and a follow-up telephone questionnaire. RESULTS Forty-one patients with 42 fistula tracks were enrolled over a 39-month period. Complete closure was achieved in 18 of 42 (43%) fistulas at a mean follow-up of 25 months. Closure was not associated with gender, age, tract location, duration of seton, or length of follow-up. Successful closure was significantly associated with increased tract length, because fistulas longer than 4 cm were nearly 3 times more likely to heal compared with shorter fistulas ((14/23, 61%) vs (4/19, 21%), P = .004; relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI 1.14-7.03). CONCLUSIONS Anal fistula plug repair of cryptoglandular anorectal fistulas is more successful for long-tract fistulas. Although the overall success is modest, limiting surgical indications to fistulas exceeding 4 cm may maximize benefits of the plug technique.","McGee, Michael F; Champagne, Bradley J; Stulberg, Jonah J; Reynolds, Harry; Marderstein, Eric; Delaney, Conor P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,182,1

In 4 patients with secondary hepatic malignancies who underwent repeated whole-body scintigraphy up to 5 hours after injection of 99mTc-MAA, a marked change in LSF was observed. It appears that tracer degradation leads to an important overestimation of LSF at later time points. An overestimation of LSF can lead to dose reduction or canceling of the planned 90Y-microspheres treatment.

The development of effective safety technologies to protect all occupants requires high quality data from a range of biomechanical test subjects representative of the population at risk. Here we sought to quantify the demographic characteristics of the volunteers and post-mortem human subjects (PMHSs) used to create the available biomechanical data for the human neck during automotive impacts. A systematic literature and database search was conducted to identify kinematic data that could be used to characterize the neck response to inertial loading or direct head/body impacts. We compiled the sex, age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) for 999 volunteers and 110 PMHSs exposed to 5,431 impacts extracted from 63 published studies and three databases, and then compared the distributions of these parameters to reference data drawn from the neck-injured, fatally-injured, and general populations. We found that the neck biomechanical data were biased toward males, the volunteer data were younger, and the PMHS data were older than the reference populations. Other smaller biases were also noted, particularly within female distributions, in the height, weight, and BMI distributions relative to the neck-injured populations. It is vital to increase the diversity of volunteer and cadaveric test subjects in future studies in order to fill the gaps in the current neck biomechanical data.

RESULTS The non-intubated group had shorter postoperative in-hospital stay than the control group (4 days [IQR, 4 - 6] vs 5 days [IQR, 5 - 8], 95% CI 0 - 2; P = 0.013). When compared to the control group, the incidence of emergence delirium (odds ratio [OR] 3.39, 95% CI 1.01 - 11.41; P = 0.043), emergence time, duration in the PACU, time to first eating food, first out-of-bed activity, pain score and consumption of sufentanil (at 6 and 12 hours after surgery) were decreased in the intervention group. In contrast, the incidence of airway complications was higher in the control than the intervention group (27.6% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.037). There was no statistical significance in the occurrence of PONV, pneumothorax and other complications between two groups.

METHODS Two hundred and thirty-nine liver lesions in 109 patients underwent percutaneous RFA under ultrasound for HCC from January 2008 to December 2010. Within these patients, 13 lesions in 12 patients who developed local tumor progression in the follow-up period of at least 8 months were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging obtained before and after RFA was used for creating fused images on a workstation. Ablative margins were assessed using only axial images, and with fused images. RESULTS The ablative margin was assessed as sufficient in all 13 lesions using side-by-side axial images; however, all lesions were assessed as insufficient with fused imaging evaluation. The reason for the discrepancy of the assessment results were differences in the respiratory dislocation of the liver in the pre- and post-RFA images in eight lesions (61.5%), and rotational displacement of the liver and the torso in five (38.5%). The site of local tumor recurrence relative to the HCC lesion was craniocaudal in 12 lesions, dorsoventral in seven and lateral in seven. In all lesions, the site of local tumor recurrence was congruent with the area of the thinnest ablative margin. CONCLUSION Assessment of ablative margin with fused imaging revealed insufficiency of ablation previously evaluated as sufficient with conventional axial imaging. Fused imaging evaluation has proved to be an accurate and useful tool for the assessment of RFA margins.","Tomonari, Akiko; Tsuji, Kunihiko; Yamazaki, Hajime; Aoki, Hironori; Kang, Jong-Hon; Kodama, Yoshihisa; Sakurai, Yasuo; Maguchi, Hiroyuki",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,182,1

Intensive care units (ICUs) may be an underused setting for public health surveillance. This study investigates the electronic Record for Intensive Care (eRIC), an electronic clinical information and management system being developed for New South Wales ICUs, and its surveillance opportunity offerings. METHODS The surveillance benefits being introduced by the eRIC were evaluated through consultation with stakeholders and the eRIC program team. The consultation process involved providing stakeholders with background information about the eRIC system. Based on the consultation, a draft data and information model for surveillance was developed. The model was evaluated using guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS Population health stakeholders confirmed that the eRIC offers an appealing surveillance data source for pathogens and other hazards causing severe illness. Suggested application of the surveillance included, for known hazards, seasonal and pandemic influenza, enterovirus 71, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli 0104:H4 and parechovirus. The proposed surveillance model uses syndromic rather than specific-cause surveillance. It may offer greater timeliness and sensitivity than relying on reporting of diagnoses of specific pathogens. Five syndromes derived from clinical pathways in the eRIC are proposed: severe acute respiratory disease, severe acute neurological disease, sepsis or septicaemia, jaundice or hepatitis, and acute renal failure. CONCLUSION New intensive care clinical information systems offer a largely untapped resource for continuous, mainstream, rapid ICU surveillance of severe illness. A continuous, mainstream, rapid ICU surveillance facility that will readily adapt to emergency situations would be a valuable resource for protecting population health. This study establishes a firm basis on which ICU surveillance can be developed.","Norton, Sophie; Cordery, Damien V; Abbenbroek, Brett J; Ryan, Angela C; Muscatello, David J",Public health research & practice,182,1

We conducted systematic reviews of the evidence base for effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures: isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures, workplace measures/closures, and avoiding crowding. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of these measures was obtained largely from observational studies and simulation studies. Voluntary isolation at home might be a more feasible social distancing measure, and pandemic plans should consider how to facilitate this measure.

However, the risk factors and a method to predict the prognosis of posttransplantation CNS IIDDs are not available. This retrospective study first reviewed data from 4532 patients who received haplo-HSCT during 2008-2019 in our center, and 184 patients (4.1%) with IIDDs after haplo-HSCT were identified. Grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (p < 0.001) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (p = 0.009) were identified as risk factors for developing IIDDs after haplo-HSCT. We then divided the 184 IIDD patients into a derivation cohort and validation cohort due to transplantation time to develop and validate a model for predicting the prognosis of IIDDs. In the multivariate analysis of the derivation cohort, four candidate predictors were entered into the final prognostic model: cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, IgG synthesis (IgG-syn) and spinal cord lesions. The prognostic model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.864 (95% CI: 0.803-0.925) in the internal validation cohort and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.806-0.931) in the external validation cohort. The calibration plots showed a high agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes. Decision curve analysis indicated that IIDD patients could benefit from the clinical application of the prognostic model.

In the context of NVS, the authors provide an overview of the real and potential impacts of NVS policies on Earth systems and offer suggestions as to how new sustainability paradigms may assist with reviewing and revising NVS mandates and facilitating stakeholder engagement. Opportunities are proposed for the World Organisation for Animal Health to contribute to the global debate on the role of aquatic and terrestrial animal agriculture and wildlife in sustainable development. In addition, the paper suggests that a wider debate is required in relation to recent significant increases in domestic animal populations and PBs. Intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration are required to achieve the transformation of the framework in which NVS operate. While such transformations cannot be driven by the veterinary profession alone, veterinarians have proven very effective operators in the One Health arena.

The number of devices needed to treat an aneurysm is uncertain and is the subject of vigorous debate. The purpose of this study was to compare rates of complications, aneurysm occlusion, and outcome in patients treated with a single-versus-multiple Pipeline Embolization Devices. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred seventy-eight patients were treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device at our institution. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a single-device group (n = 126) and a multiple-device group (n = 52). RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to baseline characteristics except for age and aneurysm size (higher with multiple Pipeline Embolization Devices). Complications occurred more frequently with multiple (15%) versus a single device (5%, P = .03). In multivariate analysis, the use of multiple devices independently predicted complications. A similar proportion of patients achieved adequate aneurysm obliteration at follow-up in the single-device (84%) and the multiple-device groups (87%, P = .8). In multivariate analysis, age and follow-up time predicted obliteration. At follow-up, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with a single device (97%) achieved a favorable outcome compared with those treated with multiple devices (89%, P = .03). In multivariate analysis, there was a strong trend for the use of a single device to predict favorable outcomes (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with a single Pipeline Embolization Device provides similar occlusion rates with less complications and better overall outcomes. These findings suggest that a single Pipeline Embolization Device is sufficient for treatment of most intracranial aneurysms.","Chalouhi, N; Tjoumakaris, S; Phillips, J L H; Starke, R M; Hasan, D; Wu, C; Zanaty, M; Kung, D; Gonzalez, L F; Rosenwasser, R; Jabbour, P",AJNR.

STUDY DESIGN In vivo experimental study. ANIMALS Fresh male Beagle cadavers (n=5). METHODS Surgery was performed by a single veterinary surgeon. Dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency and 15° reverse Trendelenburg position. The surgical procedure was performed with four 5 mm entry ports and a 5 mm 30° telescope. The cholecystoduodenostomy technique included dissection, incision of the gallbladder, and lavage, followed by gallbladder transposition over the duodenum, incision of the duodenum, and anastomosis. The latter was performed with a 4-0 barbed self-locking suture (V-Loc® 180). Subsequently, a leak test was performed by submerging the anastomosis in saline and insufflating air into the duodenum through a catheter. Total operative time and completion times for each procedural step were recorded. RESULTS The median total operative time was 151 minutes (range, 129-159). One conversion to open surgery occurred because of vascular hemorrhage. The 3 longest intraoperative steps were posterior wall anastomosis, gallbladder dissection, and anterior wall anastomosis. Intraoperative anastomotic leakage sites were identified in 3 of 5 dogs. Leaks were managed by placement of a single reinforcing conventional intracorporeal suture, which was adequate to obtain a watertight anastomosis.

We devised a compartmental model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies with a main focus on mass testing. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries, and the number of COVID-19-inflicted deaths. We assumed that COVID-19 survivors are immune (e.g., mutations are not considered) and that the virus is primarily passed on by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. The model parameters have been chosen in a plausible range based on information found in the literature, but it is easily adaptable, i.e., these values can be replaced by updated information any time. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in different scenarios. Social distancing or mass testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared with a situation without mitigation. We found that mass testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. It is of high practical relevance that a relationship between testing frequency and the effective reproduction number of the virus can be provided. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economic costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we quantify the theoretical limit of contact tracing and by how much the effect of testing is enhanced, if applied to sub-populations with increased exposure risk or prevalence.","Gorji, Hossein; Arnoldini, Markus; Jenny, David; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Jenny, Patrick",Swiss medical weekly,182,17

We report a series of feasible procedures to selectively recover the four metals (Li, Ni, Mn, and Co) using a combination of hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgyical processes. Firstly, oxalic acid is used to dissolve Li and precipitate the other three metals in oxalate forms. It is found that under the optimal condition, about 98% of the Li is dissolved, and on average 93% of the other three metals are transformed to precipitated oxalates. The oxalates are then transformed to NiO·Mn2O3·Co3O4 by being calcinated at 723 K under atmospheric environment. The selective recovery of NiO·Mn2O3·Co3O4 can be achieved by using H2SO4 under three different conditions. The first step is to use H2SO4 to selectively dissolve CoO from the Co3O4. Then the combination of H2SO4 and ultrasound is adopted to dissolve NiO, during which the ultrasound destroys the surficial oxide film on the NiO. Afterwards, the Mn2O3 is transformed to MnO2 and Mn2+ in heated H2SO4. The Co, Ni and Mn ions are dissolved in a sequence, which facilitates their separation and recovery. As the main components of the final residual solids, Co2O3 and MnO2 present in distinctly different sizes and shapes, which are beneficial for their separation and direct usage.","He, Hongping; Feng, Junli; Gao, Xiaofeng; Fei, Xunchang",Chemosphere,182,1

METHODS Eighteen pigs, on mechanical ventilation for 76 h, with P. aeruginosa pneumonia were randomized to be tracheally suctioned via the KIMVENT* closed-suctioning system (control group) or a novel closed-suctioning system (treatment group), designed to remove tracheal tube biofilm through saline jets and an inflatable balloon. Upon autopsy, two tracheal tube hemi-sections were dissected for confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Biofilm area, maximal and minimal thickness were computed. Biofilm stage was assessed. RESULTS Sixteen animals were included in the final analysis. In the treatment and control group, the mean (sd) pulmonary burden was 3.34 (1.28) and 4.17 (1.09) log cfu gr(-1), respectively (P=0.18).

The effect of water clusters was compared to carbon dioxide clusters, along with the effect of using pure water clusters compared to mixed water and carbon dioxide clusters. A signal increase was found when using pure water clusters. However, when analyzing cells, a more substantial signal increase was found in positive ion mode when the water clusters also contained carbon dioxide, suggesting that additional reactions are in play. The effects of using a water primary ion beam on a more complex sample were investigated by analyzing brain tissue from an Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse model. The results indicate that the ToF-SIMS results are approaching those from MALDI as ToF-SIMS was able to image lyso-phosphocholine (LPC) lipids, a lipid class that for a long time has eluded detection during SIMS analyses.

This study aimed at investigating the response of SP/hrpZPsph-expressing plants under cadmium stress. Transgenic N. benthamiana lines, homozygous for the SP/hrpZPsph gene, and wild-type plants were exposed to Cd at different stress levels (0, 50, 100, 150 μΜ CdCl2). Plants' response to stress was assessed at germination and at the whole plant level on the basis of physiological and growth parameters, including seed germination percentage, shoot and root length, total chlorophyll content, fresh and dry root weight, as well as overall symptomatology, and Cd content in leaves and roots. At germination phase, significant differences were noted in germination rates and post-germination growth among stress levels, with Cd effects being in most cases analogous to the level applied but also among plant categories. Although seedling growth was adversely affected in all plant categories, especially at high stress level, lines #6 and #9 showed the lowest decrease in root and shoot length over control. The superiority of these lines was further manifested at the whole plant level by the absence of stress-attributed symptoms and the low or zero reduction in chlorophyll content. Interestingly, a differential tissue-specific Cd accumulation pattern was observed in wt- and hrpZPsph-plants, with the former showing an increased Cd content in leaves and the latter retaining Cd in the roots. These data are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms underlying the hrpZPsph-based Cd stress resistance.","Mitsopoulou, Nikoletta; Lakiotis, Kosmas; Golia, Evangelia E; Khah, Ebrahim M; Pavli, Ourania I",Environmental science and pollution research international,182,1

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of drug therapy on the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and major preprint platforms were searched to retrieve articles till 7 April 2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on mortality were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Odds ratios (ORs) and Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS Of 3421 references, six studies were included. Pooled results from retrospective studies revealed that antiviral agents may contribute to survival benefit (OR, 0.42, 95% CI, 0.17-0.99, p=0.048, I2=82.8%), while the RCT found no effects of antiviral agent on mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.45-1.30, p=0.33). Glucocorticoids usage leads to an increased risk of death (OR 2.43, 95% CI, 1.44-4.10, p=0.001, I2=61.9%). Antibiotics intervention did not significantly affect mortality (OR 1.13, 95% CI, 0.67-1.89, p=0.64, I2=0%). Likewise, intravenous immunoglobulin had non-significant effects on mortality (OR 2.66, 95% CI, 0.72-9.89, p=0.14, I2=93.1%). CONCLUSIONS With the varied heterogeneities across interventions, the current evidence indicated a probable survival benefit of antiviral agent usage and a harmful effect of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19. None of antibiotics or intravenous immunoglobulin usage was associated with survival benefit in patients with COVID-19.","Pei, Lei; Zhang, Sheng; Huang, Linxi; Geng, Xuqiang; Ma, Linhao; Jiang, Weiwei; Li, Wenfang; Chen, Dechang",Polish archives of internal medicine,182,12

97355,97355,97355,Collateral status and tissue outcome after intra-arterial therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke.,14.213832,8.492638,2017,"Background Surgical site infection (SSI) is common in colorectal surgery patients and associated with morbidity and mortality. Guidelines recommend preoperative intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis with aerobic and anaerobic coverage to reduce SSI risk. Cephalosporin based prophylaxis (CBP) regimens are recommended as first-line prophylaxis, and non-cephalosporin based are recommended as alternative prophylaxis (AP). We evaluate the efficacy of CBP versus AP in preventing surgical site infections in colorectal surgery patients. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies published between 2005 and 2020 in MEDLINE and Web of Science. Studies were excluded if intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis was not administered, or if oral and intravenous prophylaxis were routinely co-administered. Heterogeneity was reported using the Q-statistic and I2-statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger test for small study effects. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p < 0.05. Results 11 studies met inclusion criteria. AP was not associated with increased SSI risk at 30 days compared to CBP (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91, 1.13; OR < 1 favors AP). There was no effect size variability in subgroup analysis comparing higher-to lower-quality studies (I2 = 99%, P = 0.17). Subgroup analysis by publication year approached a significant difference in effect size between studies published prior to 2014 and later than 2014 (I2 = 99%, P = 0.06). Conclusions Meta-analysis of 11 studies of SSI risk in adult colorectal surgery patients suggest that SSI risk is similar for patients receiving CBP or AP, subgroup analysis of studies published since 2014 suggest increased SSI risk with AP compared to CBP.","Bowder, Alexis N; Yen, Christina F; Bebell, Lisa M; Fernandes, Alisha R",Annals of medicine and surgery,182,5

Aspirin may be effective in preventing a recurrence of venous thromboembolism. METHODS We randomly assigned 822 patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism to receive aspirin, at a dose of 100 mg daily, or placebo for up to 4 years. The primary outcome was a recurrence of venous thromboembolism. RESULTS During a median follow-up period of 37.2 months, venous thromboembolism recurred in 73 of 411 patients assigned to placebo and in 57 of 411 assigned to aspirin (a rate of 6.5% per year vs. 4.8% per year; hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.05; P=0.09). Aspirin reduced the rate of the two prespecified secondary composite outcomes: the rate of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death was reduced by 34% (a rate of 8.0% per year with placebo vs. 5.2% per year with aspirin; hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.92; P=0.01), and the rate of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, or death from any cause was reduced by 33% (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.91; P=0.01). There was no significant between-group difference in the rates of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding episodes (rate of 0.6% per year with placebo vs. 1.1% per year with aspirin, P=0.22) or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS In this study, aspirin, as compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce the rate of recurrence of venous thromboembolism but resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of major vascular events, with improved net clinical benefit. These results substantiate earlier evidence of a therapeutic benefit of aspirin when it is given to patients after initial anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism.

[99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept may be of benefit in OSCC with complex lymphatic drainage patterns and close spatial relation to SLNs. METHODS A prospective within-patient evaluation study was designed to compare [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid for SLN detection. A total of 20 patients with early-stage OSCC were included, who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with both tracers. Both lymphoscintigraphic images of each patient were evaluated for SLN detection and radiotracer distribution at 2-4 h post-injection. RESULTS The injection site's remaining radioactivity was significantly lower for [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (29.9%), compared with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (60.9%; p < 0.001). Radioactive uptake in SLNs was significantly lower for [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (1.95%) compared with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (3.16%; p = 0.010). No significant difference was seen in SLN to injection site ratio in radioactivity between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (0.066) and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (0.054; p = 0.232). A median of 3.0 and 2.5 SLNs were identified with [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.297). Radioactive uptake in higher echelon nodes was not significantly different between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (0.57%) and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (0.86%) (p = 0.052). A median of 2.0 and 2.5 higher echelon nodes was identified with [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.083). CONCLUSION [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept had a higher injection site clearance, but at the same time a lower uptake in the SLN, resulting in an SLN to injection site ratio, which was not significantly different from [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid. The relatively low-radioactive uptake in SLNs of [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept may limit intraoperative detection of SLNs, but can be overcome by a higher injection dose.","den Toom, Inne J; Mahieu, Rutger; van Rooij, Rob; van Es, Robert J J; Hobbelink, Monique G G; Krijger, Gerard C; Tijink, Bernard M; de Keizer, Bart; de Bree, Remco",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,182,19

All companions are required to register their real personal data with 14 days of travel history, occupation, contact history and cluster history. We would like to evaluate the impact of the new regulations to the accompanying and visiting culture in Taiwan, via analyzing the appearance and characteristics of inpatients companions in this period. METHODS Using intelligent technology, we designed a novel system in managing the inpatients companions (InPatients Companions Management System, IPCMS), and the IPCMS was used to collect data about characteristics of inpatients and companions between April 27 and May 3, 2020. The database is built using MySQL software. Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20.0 statistical software were used for data analysis, including the basic data of the companions, differential analysis of companians' gender, person-days and cumulative time, differential analysis of accompaniment-patient relationship, and frequency of accompaniment and cumulative hours. RESULTS During study period, daily inpatient admissions ranged from 2242-2514, the number of companions per day ranged from 2048-2293, and the number of companions for one inpatient is 1-9 per day, with an average of 1.20-1.26. The companions were mostly family members, and most of them were the inpatients' children (32.9%), and spouse (26.13%). More females than males were noted in all categories of companionship with statistical significance. CONCLUSION The data got in this study could be an important basis for the transformation and reform of the companions culture in Taiwan's hospitals, and will also provide a glimpse into the attitudes and culture of companions who have long been ignorant and neglected. The experience gained in our IPCMS could also serve as a reference for other hospitals in Taiwan and worldwide.","Hung, Shih-Hsin; Kuo, Shu-Chen; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Tseng, Kuan-Jui; Sun, Ying-Chou; Ming, Jin-Lain",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,182,1

Up until today (27-5-2020) and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surpassed 4.5 million with more than 307, 500 deaths. Almost all countries have been affected by COVID-19, and resultingly, various drug trials have been conducted, however, a targeted treatment remains to be made accessible to the public. Recently, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) has gained some attention for its discovery as a potential attachment target of COVID-19. Methods We reviewed the most recent evidence regarding ACE2 distribution and action, the binding mechanism of COVID-19 and its correlation to cellular injury, ACE2 polymorphisms and its association to fatal COVID-19 and susceptibility and, finally, current ACE2-based pharmacotherapies against COVID-19. Results Blocking the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) using a specific ligand can prevent COVID-19 from binding, and consequently cellular entry and injury. Comparatively, soluble ACE2, which has a higher affinity to COVID-19, can neutralize COVID-19 without affecting the homeostatic function of naturally occurring ACE2. Lastly, ACE2 mutations and their possible effect on the binding activity of COVID-19 may enable researchers to identify high-risk groups before they become exposed to COVID-19. Conclusion ACE2 represents a promising target to attenuate or prevent COVID-19 associated cellular injury.","Mostafa-Hedeab, Gomaa",Reports of biochemistry & molecular biology,182,0

We report our experience with a pure laparoscopic transvesical method that duplicates the long-standing open transvesical approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven men and three women diagnosed with upper tract transitional cell carcinoma were treated with this procedure. Three intravesical ports were inserted, and pneumovesicum was established at 12 mmHg. Transvesical laparoscopic circumferential detachment of the bladder cuff and en bloc mobilization of the last centimeters of the distal ureter were performed, followed by the closure of the bladder defect. Subsequently, a nephrectomy was performed either laparoscopically or using an open flank approach. RESULTS The median age was 68.5 years. The procedure was completed uneventfully in all cases. The median operating time for distal ureter excision was 82.5 minutes (range 55-120). No complications directly related to the pneumovesicum method were recorded. The median follow-up period was 31 months (range 12-55). During the follow-up period, two patients (20%) died from the disease, and a bladder tumor developed in three cases (30%).

In a dorsal thoracic site, a 1 × 1 cm Adipogel implant was inserted within a subdermal fat layer defect. In a dorsal lumbar site, an Adipogel implant was inserted in a subfascial pocket. Contralateral control defects remained empty. At 8 weeks wound/implant sites were evaluated histologically, immunohistochemically and morphometrically. Identifiable thoracic Adipogel implants lost volume in vivo over 8 weeks. Neovascularization and adipogenesis were evident within implants and adipocyte percentage volume was 33.07 ± 6.55% (mean ± SEM). A comparison of entire cross-sections of thoracic wounds demonstrated a significant increase in total wound fat in Adipogel-implanted wounds (37.19 ± 4.48%, mean ± SEM) compared to control (16.53 ± 4.60%; p = 0.0092), indicating that some Adipogel had been completely converted to normal fat. At the lumbar site, Adipogel also lost volume, appearing flattened, although fat generation and angiogenesis occurred. At both sites macrophage infiltration was mild, whilst many infiltrating cells were PDGFRβ-positive mesenchymal cells. Adipogel is adipogenic and angiogenic and is a promising candidate for subcutaneous fat regeneration; it has the potential to be a valuable adjunct to wound-healing therapy and reconstructive surgery practice.

We evaluated (18)F-FDG microPET as an implant osteomyelitis imaging tool using a Staphylococcus aureus-induced peroperative implant infection in rabbits. METHODS Intramedullary titanium nails were implanted in contaminated and uncontaminated (control) proximal right tibiae of rabbits. Tibiae were quantitatively assessed with microPET for (18)F-FDG uptake before and sequentially at 1, 3, and 6 weeks after surgery. Tracer uptake was assessed in soft tissue and bone in both treatment groups with an additional comparison between the operated and unoperated limb. MicroPET analysis was combined with radiographic assessment and complementary histology of the tibiae. RESULTS At the first postoperative week, the (18)F-FDG uptake in the contaminated implant group was significantly higher than the preoperative measurement, without a significant difference between the contaminated and uncontaminated tibiae. From the third postoperative week onward, (18)F-FDG uptake allowed discrimination between osteomyelitis and postoperative aseptic bone healing, as well as quantification of the infection at distinct locations around the implant. INTERPRETATION (18)F-FDG-based microPET imaging allows differentiation between deep infection and undisturbed wound healing after implantation of a titanium intramedullary nail in this rabbit model. Furthermore, our results indicate that (18)F-FDG PET may provide a tool in human clinical diagnostics and for the evaluation of antimicrobial strategies in animal models of orthopedic implant infection.","Odekerken, Jim C E; Brans, Boudewijn T; Welting, Tim J M; Walenkamp, Geert H I M",Acta orthopaedica,182,1

DESIGN A three-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial. METHODS A total 143 participants with simple and moderate CHD aged 15-24 years were recruited from June 2016 to February 2018. The 12-month programme compared two active intervention groups to a standard-care control group (n = 47). Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL Passport, a mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided with access to the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms along with COOL Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for Congenital Heart Disease and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Taiwan Show-Card Version. RESULTS After 12 months, 103 participants remained; the overall attrition rate was 28%. No significant differences were observed between the groups in any domain of disease knowledge after 6 months or 1 year. Neither active group exhibited significantly greater physical activity intensity than the standard-care control group in any month during the 1 year. CONCLUSION The mHealth-tailored intervention of the COOL programme did not improve disease knowledge or physical activity in young adults with CHD.

The spatial area of SARS was estimated through the risk ratio. Before the pandemic, there were 5,617 cases of SARS, 187 cases/month and 23.8 cases/100 thousand inhabitants, while during the pandemic there were 15,100 cases, 2,516 cases/month and 320.3 cases/100 thousand inhabitants, which represents a 13-fold increase in detection. The following expanded (p < 0,001): the occurrence in elderly people, the collection of samples and the identification of SARS etiological agent with predominance of SARS by COVID-19. Most municipalities experienced a 20-fold higher detection than expected, suggesting a process of virus spread to the hinterlands. The excess risk associate with lower IDHM, the condition of the municipality being the headquarters of the Regional Health and the presence of a highway in the municipality.

This polymorphonuclear leukocyte has a very active metabolism, containing numerous intracellular secretory granules that allow it exerts multiple functions in both health and disease status. Classically, eosinophils have been considered as important immune cells in the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes such as parasitic helminth infections and allergic or pulmonary diseases like asthma, being always associated to a type 2 immune response; furthermore, in the last years, it has been linked to immune response conferring host protection against fungi, bacteria, and viruses, recognizing them through several molecules such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) or retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1)-like receptor (RLR). The immune protection is exerted through multiple mechanisms and properties of these cells. They contain numerous cytoplasmatic granules that release cationic proteins, cytokines, chemokines and other molecules that contribute to their functions. In addition to their competence as effectors cells, its capabilities like antigen-presenting cell allow them to act in multiple situations promoting diverse aspects of the immune response.

METHODS This is a prospective cohort study of SDD after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. Eligibility criteria included age younger than 80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I/II, caretaker for ≥24 hours postoperatively, and surgical start before 1 PM. Perioperative data were obtained through the medical record and direct patient inquiry. A satisfaction survey was administered at the postoperative visit. A historical control group was used to compare outcomes. RESULTS Forty-seven women met the eligibility criteria. Mean age was 62 (±9) years. Most were White (95.7%), were overweight (body mass index, 27.7 ± 5.5 kg/m2), and had stage 3 prolapse (63.8%). Same-day discharge was achieved for 37 patients (78.7%). Patient characteristics of the SDD cohort were similar to the routine-care cohort, with the exception of previous hysterectomy (57.5% vs 100.0%, P < 0.001) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (2 [1-2] vs 2 [1-3], P = 0.002). There were significantly fewer postoperative telephone calls in the SDD cohort but no other differences in health care resource utilization. Adverse events did not differ between groups. The SDD cohort reported high satisfaction and would recommend SDD to family or friends independent of whether or not SDD was achieved (91.9% vs 80.0%, P = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS Nearly 80% of women undergoing minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy on an SDD protocol went home as planned. Compared with routine care, there was no increase in adverse events or postoperative health care resource utilization. Patient satisfaction in the SDD cohort was high.

We aim to retrospectively investigate potential roles of factors, mainly immunologic parameters, in early predicting outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS A total of 1,018 patients confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in our retrospective study from two centers. The data of clinical features, laboratory tests, immunological tests, radiological findings, and outcomes were collected. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to evaluate factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and survival curves were plotted to evaluate the clinical usefulness. RESULTS Compared to the survival patients, the counts of all T lymphocytes subsets were markedly lower in non-survivors(P < 0.001), especially in CD8+ T cells (96.89 vs 203.98 cells/μl, P < 0.001) . Among all tested cytokines, IL-6 elevated most significantly with an upward trend of more than ten times (56.16 vs 5.36 pg/mL, P < 0.001). By a multivariable logistic regression analysis, two immunological indicators were found to be associated with in-hospital mortality, including IL-6 > 20 pg/mL (OR = 9.781; 95%CI, 6.304-15.174; P < 0.001) and CD8+ T cell count < 165 cells/μl (OR = 5.930; 95%CI, 3.677-9.562; P < 0.001), after adjusting confounding factors (age, gender, and underlying diseases). All the patients were divided into four groups according to levels of IL-6 and CD8+ T cells. The group with IL-6 > 20 pg/mL and CD8+ T cell count < 165 cells/μl had more old and male patients, as well as more proportion of patients with comorbidities, ventilation, ICU admission, shock, and death than those of any other group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the ROC curve of the model combining IL-6 (>20 pg/mL) and CD8+ T cell count(<165 cells/μl) displayed more favorable discrimination than that of CURB-65 score (area under curve (AUC) = 0.907 vs 0.843, P < 0.001). Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a good fitting of the model with no statistical significance (P = 0.581). CONCLUSIONS We firstly identify two reliable prognostic indicators, IL-6 (>20 pg/mL) and CD8+ T cell count (<165 cells/μl), which can accurately stratify patients into risk categories and predict mortality of patients with COVID-19. Those two indicators combined may guide clinicians to evaluate patient prognosis and make appropriate decisions.","Luo, Miao; Liu, Jing; Jiang, Weiling; Yue, Shuang; Liu, Huiguo; Wei, Shuang",JCI insight,182,1

Male ceramic workers with silicosis (n = 91) and healthy individuals (n = 47) were recruited for the study. Radiographic abnormalities of pneumoconiosis were classified into three profusion categories (categories 1, 2, and 3), and patients with silicosis, those with category 1, were defined as group 1 and those with category 2 or 3 were defined as group 2. Plasma levels of native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT), disulfide (Ds), IMA, and CAT activities were determined. Pulmonary function tests of groups were compared. NT, TT, and NT/TT ratios were significantly lower in groups 1 and 2 than the control group (p < 0.05). These did not differ between patients with silicosis (groups 1 and 2) and control group (p = 0.421). Ds/NT and Ds/TT ratios were significantly higher in group 2 than the control group (p < 0.05). NT, TT, and Ds did not differ significantly between groups 1 and 2.

The aim of this study is to investigate the behavior of Italian dentists and to analyze their reactions in relation to Sars-CoV-2 pandemic professional restrictive measures. METHODS An online structured survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dental practitioners all over Italy to investigate their behavior and to analyze their reactions in relation to Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20). RESULTS 1109 dentists replied. To assess concerns and psychological responses the sample was divided into two groups based on the number of cases registered in their work area. In the first group were included all the responders working in the Italian regions that had more than 15,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of April 29, 2020. The second group included responders working in the Italian regions that had less than 15,000 confirmed cases. The 45.2% of the respondents showed minimal anxiety, 34.5% showed mild anxiety, 13.9% showed moderate anxiety, while 6.4% showed a score indicative of a severe level of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19-related emergency condition had a highly negative impact on dental practices in Italy. Those who completed the survey reported practice closure or reduction during the lockdown, and a high level of concern about the professional future for all dental practitioners.

CASE PRESENTATION Between 2012 and 2015, seven patients with L- or T-type HD underwent preoperative bowel management by continuous bowel decompression using an ITT during waiting period for curative surgery. Continuous bowel decompression was done using an ITT, a 10-12F flexible dual lumen tube placed through the rectum up to the dilated colon under fluoroscopic guidance and secured to the bilateral buttocks. The ITT tips were located at least in a dilated colon or the cecum if there was no radiographic transitional zone. The ITT was left open for continuous drainage, and its patency was checked by regular suction until the curative operation. The patient status and complications of this preoperative management were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS The median duration of decompression management was 65 (17-137) days. During decompression period, neither abdominal distention, enterocolitis, nor other complications occurred and six patients could stay at home until the curative operation. The weight-for-age Z-score at curative surgery was the same as or higher than that at birth in five patients. ITT replacement was needed three times per patient on an average for accidental ITT removal, ITT stenosis, or ITT hardening. CONCLUSIONS Bowel management by continuous bowel decompression using an ITT is easy, safe, and effective for preoperative management in patients with L- or T-type HD and may permit single-stage surgery rendering colostomy or enterostomy unnecessary.","Mochizuki, Kyoko; Shinkai, Masato; Kitagawa, Norihiko; Take, Hiroshi; Usui, Hidehito; Hosokawa, Takashi; Yamoto, Kaori",Surgical case reports,182,31

In countless approaches worldwide, scientists are using single cell analyses to better understand the significance and variation within different cellular populations, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting has become a major technique for cell isolation in both basic and clinical research. However, majority of available cell sorters are pressurized, droplet-based systems, which apply significant environmental pressure and shear stress to cells during sorting. Recently, the flow cytometry community has become increasingly aware about the potential negative effects this could have on sorted cells and the term ""sorter induced cell stress"" (SICS) has been proposed. However, up to date only a limited number of studies have investigated the effects of cell sorting on cell viability and function. Therefore, solid data on the effects of sheath pressure and nozzle size on survival and function of sorted cells are surprisingly rare. With this in mind, we sorted ""CD4+"" T-cells and ""live"" cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different sort conditions and analyzed their quality before and after sorting in a series of assays. Here we present our findings in reference to cell viability and cell proliferation following sorting on different instruments (BD FACSAria III SORP and BD FACSJazz), utilizing different nozzle sizes (70 to 100 μm) and sheath pressure settings (20 to 70 psi).

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is a lack of proven effective treatments or cures for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-γ, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities. In summary, this study provides a powerful, computational vaccine design platform for rapid development of vaccine candidates (including COVCCF) for effective prevention of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Ubiquitous heterogeneity, here called for poikilosis, is an integral and important property of organisms and in molecules, systems and processes within them. Traditionally, heterogeneity in biology and experiments has been considered as unwanted noise, here poikilosis is shown to be the normal state. Acceptable variation ranges are called as lagom. Non-lagom, variations that are too extensive, have negative effects, which influence interconnected levels and once the variation is large enough cause a disease and can lead even to death. Poikilosis has numerous applications and consequences e.g. for how to design, analyze and report experiments, how to develop and apply prediction and modelling methods, and in diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Poikilosis-aware new and practical definitions are provided for life, death, senescence, disease, and lagom.

METHOD An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population's psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. RESULTS Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms. CONCLUSION The findings might be a matter for serious concern, and considerable attention is required from authorities and policymakers regarding early detection and treatment of these illnesses in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic related mental illness.","Joseph, Royes; Lucca, Jisha M; Alshayban, Dhfer; Alshehry, Yasir A",Journal of infection and public health,182,1

Communication is essential to pediatric cancer care, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has defined 6 functions of communication between patients, family members, and providers, including 1) fostering healing relationships, 2) responding to emotions, 3) exchanging information, 4) making decisions, 5) managing uncertainty, and 6) enabling self-management. Nevertheless, communication needs and practices in LMICs remain incompletely understood. For this review, the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Turning Research Into Practice databases were searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. Searching identified 2988 articles, with 11 added through snowballing. Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, communication functions, enablers, barriers, and additional major themes. This review included work from 17 countries. Most studies (85%) used qualitative methodology; the number of participants ranged from 7 to 304. All 6 of the NCI-defined communication functions were identified in included studies, with rates ranging from 100% of studies for information exchange to 28% of studies for decision making. Communication barriers included cancer misconceptions, stigma, and hierarchy between parents and providers. Provider training and community education facilitated communication. Additional themes included disclosure to children, family dynamics, and the multidisciplinary health care team. In conclusion, all 6 of the communication functions defined by the NCI were applied by pediatric cancer researchers in LMICs. Additional barriers, enablers, and communication themes noted in LMICs deserve further exploration, and a relative paucity of research in comparison with high-income countries highlights the need for further work.","Graetz, Dylan E; Garza, Marcela; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Mack, Jennifer W",Cancer,182,8

It also risks costing health systems the opportunity to make their services more efficient and, over time, more economical. This paper sets out the potential of biomarker testing, the unfolding precision and range of possible diagnosis and prediction, and the many obstacles to adoption. It offers case studies of biomarker testing in breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, thyroid and colon cancers, and derives specific lessons as to the potential and actual use of each of them. It also draws lessons about how to improve access and alignment, and to remedy the data deficiencies that impede development. And it suggests solutions to outstanding issues - notably including funding and the tangled web of obtaining reimbursement or equivalent coverage that Europe's fragmented health system implies. It urges a European evolution towards an initial minimum testing scenario, which would guarantee universal access to a suite of biomarker tests for the currently most common conditions, and, further into the future, to an optimum testing scenario in which a much wider range of biomarker tests would be introduced and become part of a more sophisticated health system articulated around personalised medicine. For exploiting genomics to the full, it argues the need for a new policy framework for Europe. Biomarker testing is not an issue that can be treated in isolation, since the purpose of testing is to improve health. Its use is therefore always closely linked to specific health challenges and needs to be viewed in the broader policy context in the EU and more widely. The paper is the result of extensive engagement with experts and decision makers to develop the framework, and consequently represents a wide consensus of views on how healthcare systems should respond from push and pull factors at local, national and cross-border and EU level. It contains strong views and clear recommendations springing from the convictions of patients, clinicians, academics, medicines authorities, HTA bodies, payers, the diagnostic, pharmaceutical and ICT industries, and national policy makers.","Horgan, Denis; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Conte, Pierfranco; Baldwin, David; Seijo, Luis; Montuenga, Luis M; Paz-Ares, Luis; Garassino, Marina; Penault-Llorca, Frederique; Galli, Fabrizia; Ray-Coquard, Isabelle; Querleu, Denis; Capoluongo, Ettore; Banerjee, Susana; Riegman, Peter; Kerr, Keith; Horbach, Benjamin; Büttner, Reinhard; Van Poppel, Hein; Bjartell, Anders; Codacci-Pisanelli, Giovanni; Westphalen, Benedikt; Calvo, Fabien; Koeva-Balabanova, Jasmina; Hall, Stephen; Paradiso, Angelo; Kalra, Dipak; Cobbaert, Christa; Varea Menendez, Rocio; Maravic, Zorana; Fotaki, Vassiliki; Bennouna, Jaafar; Cauchin, Estelle; Malats, Nuria; Gutiérrez-Ibarluzea, Iñaki; Gannon, Benjamin; Mastris, Ken; Bernini, Chiara; Gallagher, William; Buglioni, Simonetta; Kent, Alastair; Munzone, Elisabetta; Belina, Ivica; Van Meerbeeck, Jan; Duffy, Michael; Sarnowska, Elżbieta; Jagielska, Beata; Mee, Sarah; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Biomedicine hub,182,5

Efforts have been made to find enveloped virus surrogates due to challenges investigating viruses that require biosafety-level 3 or 4 handling. In this study, the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6 was evaluated as a surrogate for enveloped waterborne viruses. The persistence of Phi6 was tested in aqueous conditions chosen based on previously published viral persistence studies. Our results demonstrated that the predicted T90 (time for 90% inactivation) of Phi6 under the 12 evaluated conditions varied from 24 min to 117 days depending on temperature, biological activity, and aqueous media composition. Phi6 persistence was then compared with persistence values from other enveloped viruses reported in the literature. The apparent suitability of Phi6 as an enveloped virus surrogate was dependent on the temperature and composition of the media tested. Of evaluated viruses, 33%, including all conditions considered, had T90 values greater than the 95% confidence interval for Phi6. Ultimately, these results highlight the variability of enveloped virus persistence in the environment and the value of working with the virus of interest for environmental persistence studies.","Aquino de Carvalho, Nathalia; Stachler, Elyse N; Cimabue, Nicole; Bibby, Kyle",Environmental science & technology,182,1

Here, we report a novel closed-system, electrohydrostatically driven master-slave device that was designed and constructed for delivering controlled fluidic stimulations of visceral organs and inner cavities of the human body within the confines of a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The design concept and performance of the device in the MRI environment are described. In addition, the device was applied during a functional MRI (fMRI) investigation of visceral stimulation related to detrusor distention in two representative subjects to verify its feasibility in humans. System evaluation tests demonstrate that the device is MR-compatible with negligible impact on imaging quality [static signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss <2.5% and temporal SNR loss <3.5%], and has an accuracy of 99.68% for flow rate and 99.27% for volume delivery. A precise synchronization of the stimulus delivery with fMRI slice acquisition was achieved by programming the proposed device to detect the 5 V transistor-transistor logic (TTL) trigger signals generated by the MRI scanner. The fMRI data analysis using the general linear model analysis with the standard hemodynamic response function showed increased activations in the network of brain regions that included the insula, anterior and mid-cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices, and thalamus in response to increased distension pressure on viscera. The translation from manually operated devices to an MR-compatible and MR-synchronized device under automatic control represents a useful innovation for clinical neuroimaging studies of human interoception.","Jarrahi, Behnaz; Gassert, Roger; Wanek, Johann; Michels, Lars; Mehnert, Ulrich; Kollias, Spyros S",IEEE journal of translational engineering in health and medicine,182,5

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent LCS or OCS for repair of a complex abdominal wall hernia at a single institution between 2009 and 2011. Charts were reviewed to identify postoperative wound complications. A computed tomographic scan or physical examination was used for the determination of hernia recurrence. Categoric variables were compared using the Fisher exact test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using linear and Cox regression. Recurrence rates were compared using log-rank tests (Kaplan-Meier method). RESULTS A total of 44 patients underwent LCS (n = 18) or OCS (n = 26). There was no statistically significant difference between categoric variables. Multivariate analysis using wound complications as the dependent variable showed a statistically significantly lower rate of wound complications in the LCS group.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective evaluation of 60 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy was conducted. The relationship was evaluated between the vascular morphological parameters and biochemical and hemocytic inflammatory variables of the patients preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. RESULTS Compared to the baseline values, a significant decrease was determined in the carotid intima media thickness at 6, 12, and 18 months (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). The compliance and distensibility values were observed to increase over time (p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). A statistically significant difference was determined in the carotid intima media thickness values according to gender, with males (n:7) measuring 0.618±0.123 mm and females (n:53) measuring 0.506±0.113 mm (p<0.01). When patients were grouped as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≤2.54 (n:41) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio>2.55 (n:19), the increasing neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio values were observed to be in proportion to the carotid intima media thickness, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). When factors affecting the vascular morphology parameters measured at baseline and throughout the study were evaluated with the correlation analysis, there was observed to be a positive correlation between the baseline carotid intima media thickness thickness and neutrophil percentage (r=0.736, p<0.001) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (r=0.676, p<0.001), and between the negative correlation and lymphocyte percentage (r=-0.628, p<0.001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is not only a cosmetic procedure reducing the body mass index values, but it also has a beneficiary effect on vascular morphology, biochemical, and hemocytic parameters.","Baykara, Murat; Yazar, Fatih Mehmet; Cengiz, Emrah; Bülbüloğlu, Ertan",Turkish journal of surgery,182,20

In internal medicine, clinical rounds have always played an important role in education; however, the patient safety content taught at the point of care is not well studied. We studied, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the number and nature of patient safety messages delivered by attending physicians to determine what is taught at the point of care and how well this is recognised and recalled by attending physicians, residents and medical students. METHODS This prospective mixed methods study was conducted on the medicine teaching service. Clinical rounds were audio-recorded. Immediately after rounds, attending physicians, residents and students completed a short survey card identifying the number and type of educational messages they immediately recalled teaching or hearing. Independent t-test was used to compare differences in the number of messages delivered by attendings and recalled by trainees. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences in messages delivered by attending physicians compared with trainees. Recordings were transcribed and analysed qualitatively for patient safety content. RESULTS Trainees recalled more educational messages than attendings recalled teaching in all educational domains. Safety messages comprised 17.5% of educational messages. The average number of patient safety messages recalled per session was 1.08 per attending physicians, 1.84 per resident and 2.50 per student. Residents recalled 56.4% of safety messages delivered; students recalled 76.7% of safety messages. CONCLUSION Patient safety is a focus of teaching during clinical rounds and provides meaningful opportunities to train students and residents to practice safe patient care.","Levine, Diane; Gadivemula, Jaya; Kutaimy, Raya; Kamatam, Srinivasa; Sarvadevabatla, Nagaratna; Lohia, Prateek",BMJ open quality,182,1

Hence, the verification of the authenticity of dairy products is of prime importance. Multiple stable isotopic studies have been undertaken that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for the authentication of foodstuffs. However, the authentication of dairy products for geographic origin has been a challenge due to the complex interactions of geological and climatic drivers. This study applies stable isotope measurements of d2H, d18O, d13C and d15N values from casein to investigate the inherent geo-climatic variation across dairy farms from the South and North Islands of New Zealand. The stable isotopic ratios were measured for casein samples which had been separated from freeze-dried whole milk samples. As uniform feeding and fertilizer practices were applied throughout the sampling period, the subtropical (North Island) and temperate (South Island) climates were reflected in the variation of d13C and d15N. However, highly correlated d2H and d18O (r = 0.62, p = 6.64 × 10-10, a = 0.05) values did not differentiate climatic variation between Islands, but rather topographical locations. The highlight was the strong influence of d15N towards explaining climatic variability, which could be important for further discussion.","Wijenayake, Kavindra; Frew, Russell; McComb, Kiri; Van Hale, Robert; Clarke, Dianne",Molecules,182,1

METHODS Multiple databases were queried to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the merits of colchicine in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable CAD. The pooled relative risk ratio (RR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), its components, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were computed using a random-effect model. RESULTS Ten RCTs comprising a total of 12,761 patients were identified. At a median follow-up of 12 months, there was a significantly lower risk of MACE [RR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-96], ACS (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.96), ischemic stroke (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81), and need for revascularization (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-90) in patients receiving colchicine compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis based on the clinical presentation showed that the significantly lower incidence of MACE and stroke were driven by the patients presenting with ACS. The use of colchicine in patients with stable CAD did not reduce the incidence of MACE (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28-1.09), ACS (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25-1.08), or stroke (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.13). There was no significant difference in the relative risk of cardiac arrest, ACS, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality between the two groups in both ACS and stable CAD populations. The risk of GI adverse events was significantly higher in patients receiving colchicine (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.12-3.95). CONCLUSION In patients presenting with ACS, low-dose colchicine might reduce the incidence of MACE, stroke, and the need for revascularization at long follow-up durations. Colchicine might offer no benefits in reducing the risk of ischemic events in patients with stable angina.","Ullah, Waqas; Haq, Shujaul; Zahid, Salman; Gowda, Smitha Narayana; Ottman, Patrick; Saleem, Sameer; Hamzeh, Ihab; Virani, Salim S; Alam, Mahboob; Fischman, David L","American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",182,1

CLINICAL CASE A 25-year-old male presented with severe right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. Imaging showed a lesion involving the trigeminal nerve with signal characteristics of fat. At surgery the lesion was found to be a fatty infiltration of the nerve itself. Surgery was therefore limited to arachnoid adhesiolysis. The patient remains symptom-free and neurologically intact to date. Correctly identifying these lesions as lipomatosis of nerve rather than lipoma of the cerebellopontine angle make it clear that even partial surgical excision will inevitably result in neurological deficit and should not be attempted.

The search focused on COPD, cycling, and NIRS outcomes. 29 studies (541 COPD participants) were included. Compared to healthy individuals (8 studies), COPD patients at lower cycling workloads had more rapid increases in vastus lateralis (VL) deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb); lower increases in VL total hemoglobin (tHb) and blood flow; and lower muscle tissue saturation (StO2). Heliox and bronchodilators were associated with smaller and slower increases in VL HHb. Heliox increased VL and intercostal blood flow compared to room air and supplemental oxygen in COPD patients (1 study). PFC oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) increased in COPD individuals during cycling in 5 of 8 studies. Individuals with COPD and heart failure demonstrated worse VL and PFC NIRS outcomes compared to patients with only COPD-higher or more rapid increase in VL HHb and no change or decrease in PFC O2Hb. Individuals with COPD present with a mismatch between muscle oxygen delivery and utilization, characterized by more rapid increase in VL HHb, lower muscle O2Hb and lower muscle StO2. PFC O2Hb increases or tends to increase in individuals with COPD during exercise, but this relationship warrants further investigation. NIRS can be used to identify key deoxygenation thresholds during exercise to inform PFC and muscle oxygenation.","Miles, Melissa; Rodrigues, Antenor; Tajali, Shirin; Xiong, Yijun; Orchanian-Cheff, Ani; Reid, W Darlene; Rozenberg, Dmitry",Chronic respiratory disease,182,1

In contrast, breakage occurred in only 3 and occlusion in none in the reinforced group, with the 5 without breakage remaining connected only by the spring coil. Furthermore, in 7 of the reinforced catheters, electric arc-induced thermal damage was observed at the tip of the catheter. A TPA catheter for thoracic surgery should be inserted via the median approach, or it should be inserted after surgery to avoid catheter damage during surgery.","Saeki, Noboru; Sugimoto, Yuki; Mori, Yoko; Kato, Takahiro; Miyoshi, Hirotsugu; Nakamura, Ryuji; Koga, Tomomichi",Journal of anesthesia,182,1

To identify therapeutic targets relevant to COVID-19, we conducted Mendelian randomization analyses, deriving genetic instruments based on transcriptomic and proteomic data for 1,263 actionable proteins that are targeted by approved drugs or in clinical phase of drug development. Using summary statistics from the Host Genetics Initiative and the Million Veteran Program, we studied 7,554 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and >1 million controls. We found significant Mendelian randomization results for three proteins (ACE2, P = 1.6 × 10-6; IFNAR2, P = 9.8 × 10-11 and IL-10RB, P = 2.3 × 10-14) using cis-expression quantitative trait loci genetic instruments that also had strong evidence for colocalization with COVID-19 hospitalization. To disentangle the shared expression quantitative trait loci signal for IL10RB and IFNAR2, we conducted phenome-wide association scans and pathway enrichment analysis, which suggested that IFNAR2 is more likely to play a role in COVID-19 hospitalization.

However, human-induced habitat modification processes threaten the ecological structure of this river basin. Among the GBMK's diverse flora and fauna of this freshwater ecosystem, the endemic Ganges River dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica; GRD) is one of the most charismatic species in this freshwater ecosystem. Though a >50% population size reduction has occurred since 1957, researchers and decision-makers often overlook the persistence (or evolutionary potential) of this species in the highly fragmented GBMK. We define the evolutionary potential as the ability of species/populations to adapt in a changing environment by maintaining their genetic diversity. Here, we review how evolutionary trap mechanisms affect the dynamics and viability of the GRD (hereafter Ganges dolphin) populations after rapid declines in their population size and distribution. We detected six potential trap mechanisms that might affect the Ganges dolphin populations discretely or in combination: (a) habitat modification; (b) occurrence of finite and geographically restricted local populations; (c) ratio of effective to estimate population size; (d) increasing risk of inbreeding depression in genetically isolated groups; (e) at-risk behavioral attributes; and (f) direct fisheries-dolphin interactions. Because evolutionary traps appear most significant during low water season, they adversely affect demographic parameters, which reduce evolutionary potential. These traps have already caused local extirpation events; therefore, we recommend translocation among populations, including restoring and preserving essential habitats as immediate conservation strategies. Integrative evolutionary potential information based on demographic, genetic, and environmental data is still lacking. Thus, we identify gaps in the knowledge and suggest integrative approaches to understand the future of Ganges dolphins in South Asian waterways.","Paudel, Shambhu; Koprowski, John L",Ecology and evolution,182,17

Especially in pediatric populations, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is essential to achieving optimal outcomes. AREAS COVERED The authors review the literature pertaining to the effectiveness of currently available therapies and describe new pharmacotherapies under development, especially for young patients. EXPERT OPINION For pediatric patients with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease, there may be new therapeutic options on the horizon in the form of gene therapy or small molecule glucocerebrosidase chaperones. These have the potential to result in a cure for systemic disease manifestations and/or to reduce the cost and convenience of treatment. For children with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, the challenge of targeting therapy to the central nervous system is being explored through new modalities including brain targeted gene therapy, in-utero therapy, brain-penetrant small molecule chaperones, and other methods that convey enzyme across the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, these are exciting times for both pediatric patients with Gaucher disease and those with other lysosomal storage disorders.","Sam, Richard; Ryan, Emory; Daykin, Emily; Sidransky, Ellen",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,182,8

METHODS Nanoparticle [polyethylenimine (PEI)-Fe3O4]-carried DNA vaccine (PEI-Fe3O4-pRSC-gD-IL-21) or DNA vaccine (pRSC-gD-IL-21) alone were topically versus intramuscularly inoculated into one eye each of mice on days 0, 14 and 28. Three weeks after the final immunization, the specific immune responses and clinical degrees of primary herpes simplex keratitis were evaluated. RESULTS Topical inoculation of nanoparticle-carried DNA vaccine induced mice to generate similar levels of specific HSV-1-neutralizing antibody, IFN-γ and IL-4 in serum and specific killing (cytotoxicity) and proliferative activities of the splenic lymphocytes, but a significantly higher level of secretory IgA in tears compared to those of intramuscular inoculation. More importantly, the mice inoculated topically showed a significantly decreased herpes simplex keratitis severity than the mice inoculated intramuscularly after HSV-1 challenge on the corneas of the mice. CONCLUSIONS Topical inoculation of nanoparticle-carried DNA vaccine elicits a stronger specific local immune response and more effectively inhibits herpes simplex keratitis as compared to intramuscular inoculation in an HSV-1 ocular challenge mouse model. Thus, topical administration may be a promising inoculating route for the nanoparticle-carried DNA vaccine to prevent corneal infections.","Hu, Kai; Malla, Tejsu; Zhai, Yujia; Dong, Lili; Tang, Ru",Ophthalmic research,182,22

METHODS A mixed-methods pilot study was performed, enrolling all patients who received an ICU diary in an Italian ICU during the study period. RESULTS Study results are presented in 2 sections: (1) diary evaluation and content themes and (2) follow-up program results. Sixty-six patients were assessed for eligibility. Diary administration was possible in 31 patients (47%). The overall diary entries, in 31 analyzed diaries, were 1331, with a median of 25 entries (interquartile range, 16-57 entries) for each diary. Participants' relatives and friends wrote a median of 1.2 (0.3-1.6), and nurses wrote 1.1 (0.8-1.2). Other ICU staff wrote a total of 24 entries (2%). Follow-up results revealed low incidence of delirium detected in only 1 patient at the 7-day visit (3%). The median value of PTSS-10 (Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms) score was 12 (3.5-12) at the 7-day visit, 6 (1.5-12) at 3 months' telephone interview, and 12 (1.5-17) at 6 months' visit. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first Italian report about the introduction of an ICU diary. The diaries were easily implemented in our clinical practice as a ""low-cost"" initiative. In our study, nurses and participants' relatives and friends wrote a similar number of entries in each analyzed diary. This project could be effective in reducing survivors' delirium and post-traumatic stress disorder and in implementing mutual understanding between clinical staff and relatives during ICU stay.","Iannuzzi, Luigi; Villa, Silvia; Vimercati, Simona; Villa, Marta; Pisetti, Carmen Francesca; Viganò, Giulia; Fumagalli, Roberto; Rona, Roberto; Lucchini, Alberto",Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,182,1

Today, many such traditions are still alive in the folk medical practices of local people. Investigation of botanical folk medicines used in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections led us to study Castanea sativa (European Chestnut) for its potential antibacterial activity. Here, we report the quorum sensing inhibitory activity of refined and chemically characterized European Chestnut leaf extracts, rich in oleanene and ursene derivatives (pentacyclic triterpenes), against all Staphylococcus aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) alleles. We present layers of evidence of agr blocking activity (IC50 1.56-25 μg mL-1), as measured in toxin outputs, reporter assays hemolytic activity, cytotoxicity studies, and an in vivo abscess model. We demonstrate the extract's lack of cytotoxicity to human keratinocytes and murine skin, as well as lack of growth inhibitory activity against S. aureus and a panel of skin commensals. Lastly, we demonstrate that serial passaging of the extract does not result in acquisition of resistance to the quorum quenching composition. In conclusion, through disruption of quorum sensing in the absence of growth inhibition, this study provides insight into the role that non-biocide inhibitors of virulence may play in future antibiotic therapies.","Quave, Cassandra L; Lyles, James T; Kavanaugh, Jeffery S; Nelson, Kate; Parlet, Corey P; Crosby, Heidi A; Heilmann, Kristopher P; Horswill, Alexander R",PloS one,182,12

METHODS Prospective surveillance was conducted in 8 hospitals from January 1 to April 30, 2005. All hospitalized patients less than 18 years of age were eligible, except for patients housed in standard newborn nurseries or psychiatric units. Infection control professionals reviewed laboratory reports, conducted ward rounds, and reviewed medical records to identify case patients. Descriptive analyses were completed, as well. RESULTS A total of 96 case patients were identified; 52 (54%) were male, and 48 (50%) were aged 1 year or less. Seventy-two patients (75%) had chronic medical conditions. Respiratory viruses accounted for 72 (71%) of 101 pathogens identified, and RSV was the virus most frequently identified. Of these 96 patients, 9 (9%) died, and 3 (3%) of the deaths were related to the patient's HA-FRI. The mean incidence rate was 0.97 infections/1,000 patient-days (range, 0.29-1.50 infections/1,000 patient-days). Only 2 (15%) of 13 influenza vaccine-eligible children who acquired influenza while hospitalized were reported to have been vaccinated, but influenza vaccination status was unknown for most children. However, 4 (80%) of 5 RSV prophylaxis-eligible children who had healthcare-acquired RSV infection had received immunoprophylaxis with anti-RSV monoclonal antibody. CONCLUSIONS HA-FRI is mainly caused by viruses such as RSV, and it primarily affects children under 1 year of age and those with chronic medical conditions.","Vayalumkal, Joseph V; Gravel, Denise; Moore, Dorothy; Matlow, Anne",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,182,1

This study aims to determine the relationship between soluble ST2 (sST2), a profibrotic biomarker, and AF recurrence after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS AF patients referred for RFCA were consecutively included from October 2017 to May 2019. Baseline characteristics were collected, and sST2 levels were determined before ablation. Left atrial substrate mapping was performed after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation under sinus rhythm, and substrate was modified in low-voltage zones. A second procedure was recommended under recurrence. RESULTS 258 patients (146 males, average age 61.0 ± 8.8) were included. After a medium follow-up of 13.5 months, 52 patients (20.2%) had recurrence and received a second procedure. Preoperative sST2 level in patients with recurrence was significantly higher than that in patients without (31.3 ng/ml vs. 20.3 ng/ml, p < 0.001). In those undergoing second ablation, sST2 level in patients with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping was significantly higher than that in patients without (43.0 ng/ml vs. 22.1 ng/ml, p < 0.001). An sST2 level over 26.9 ng/ml could predict AF recurrence with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75.9%. Multiple logistic analysis showed that sST2 level was an independent predictor of AF recurrence with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS S: sST2 level was associated with new abnormalities during endocardial mapping and recurrence of AF after ablation. It might have significance in choosing treatment strategies for AF.

RECENT FINDINGS The hedonic pathway interacts with the obesogenic environment to override homeostatic mechanisms to cause increase in body weight. Weight gain sustained over time leads to ""upward setting"" of defended level of body-fat mass. There are neurobiological and phenotypic similarities and differences between hedonic pathways triggered by food compared with other addictive substances, and the entity of food addiction remains controversial. Treatment for obesity including pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery impacts on neural pathways governing appetite and hedonic control of food intake. The food addiction model may also have significant impact on public health policy, regulation of certain foods, and weight stigma and bias. Recent rapid progress in delineation of food hedonic pathways advances our understanding of obesity and facilitates development of effective treatment measures against the disease.","Lee, Phong Ching; Dixon, John B",Current obesity reports,182,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A structured search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases of patients undergoing embolization for hemarthrosis. Demographic data, clinical history, angiographic findings, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and tabulated. RESULTS The search identified 97 unique titles of which 15 were deemed relevant comprising 78 patients with coagulopathies undergoing 93 embolization procedures. Mean follow-up time was 29 months (range 3-116.5). In the 29 patients who underwent arthroplasty prior to embolization for hemarthrosis, there were 11 bleeding recurrences (37.9%). Of these patients who experienced recurrences, 10 underwent repeat embolization as coagulation factor replacement was not sufficient to address the re-bleeding. In the 49 patients with bleeding diatheses who underwent embolization for hemarthrosis with no history of prior arthroplasty, there were 11 recurrences (22.4%) and 4 of these patients underwent repeat embolization with favorable results. There were four major procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION Transarterial embolization is safe and effective in addressing recurrent hemarthrosis in patients with bleeding diatheses with or without a history of arthroplasty of the affected joint.","Shanmugasundaram, Srinidhi; Chandra, Vishnu; Kolber, Marcin; Kumar, Abhishek; Contractor, Sohail; Shukla, Pratik A",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,182,7

However, it is important to consider indications and comorbidities for which warfarin is still the preferred anticoagulant. This review aims to capture these clinical scenarios in which warfarin may still be preferred over DOACs. METHODS We undertook a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database. Key search terms were based on DOAC clinical trial exclusion criteria, as well as indications and conditions in which the use of DOACs for anticoagulation has suggested harm. Society guidelines and tertiary literature were used to inform expert opinion where necessary. Studies were included if they investigated the use of DOACs or warfarin in the identified indications or conditions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Currently, evidence for the use of warfarin over DOACs for anticoagulation is strongest for patients with prosthetic valves, antiphospholipid syndrome, or a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. For several clinical situations, including mitral stenosis, obesity, altered gastrointestinal anatomy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, renal or hepatic impairment, and left ventricular thrombus, evidence is lacking but may eventually support the use of DOACs. Depending on indication and condition, appropriateness of DOAC use may vary by agent. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION New evidence continues to support new indications and conditions in which DOACs may be appropriate to use for anticoagulation. There are key clinical scenarios, however, in which emerging literature continues to support warfarin as the preferred anticoagulant.","Wadsworth, Daniel; Sullivan, Emma; Jacky, Thomas; Sprague, Taylor; Feinman, Hannah; Kim, Jennifer",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,182,1

At the same time, Latinx children in high-income countries have been disproportionately affected by obesity. Public health and medical experts have called for greater focus on multi-sector approaches to obesity prevention, including policy, systems, and environmental strategies, but current evidence for effective intervention strategies among Latinx children is lacking. Several systematic reviews have investigated obesity prevention interventions in Latinx children in the United States and in Latin America, including our own review, but these are now a decade old. Thus, an updated review of existing interventions is needed. To address this gap, we will conduct a systematic review and summary of interventions for obesity prevention among Latinx children published over the past 10 years. The objective of this paper is to outline the protocol for conducting the systematic review and possible meta-analysis. METHODS We will conduct a literature search using PubMed, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Google Scholar databases for studies of interventions to prevent obesity in Latinx children ages birth to 18 years of age. To meet our definition of an intervention, we will include study designs that evaluate the either the efficacy or effectiveness of obesity prevention interventions, including randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and non-randomized interventions with a control or comparison group. We will exclude interventions that aimed to treat rather than prevent overweight or obesity. Interventions may take place in any country or setting. The primary outcome of interest will be child overweight or obesity, measured as adiposity, body mass, or similar anthropometric measures. We will assess risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized and non-randomized studies, as appropriate. We may conduct meta-analyses if studies with comparable exposure and outcome variables are available. DISCUSSION This protocol paper establishes a methodology for a future systemic review of obesity prevention interventions in Latinx children. A systematic review of this topic will provide an important update to the literature regarding interventions to prevent obesity in Latinx child populations globally over the past decade. Review results will be relevant to stakeholders across multiple sectors engaged in childhood obesity prevention among Latinx children.

The open reading frame 1 (ORF1) protein of HEV encodes nonstructural polyprotein with putative domains for methyltransferase, cysteine protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is not yet known whether ORF1 functions as a single protein with multiple domains or is processed to form separate functional units. On the basis of amino acid conserved motifs, HEV helicase has been grouped into helicase superfamily 1 (SF-1). In order to examine the RNA helicase activity of the NTPase/helicase domain of HEV, the region (amino acids 960 to 1204) was cloned and expressed as histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli (HEV Hel) and purified. HEV Hel exhibited NTPase and RNA unwinding activities. Enzyme hydrolyzed all rNTPs efficiently, dATP and dCTP with moderate efficiency, while it showed less hydrolysis of dGTP and dTTP. Enzyme showed unwinding of only RNA duplexes with 5' overhangs showing 5'-to-3' polarity. We also expressed and purified two HEV Hel mutants. Helicase mutant I, with substitution in the nucleotide-binding motif I (GKS to GAS), showed 30% ATPase activity. Helicase mutant II, with substitutions in the Mg(2+) binding motif II (DEAP to AAAP), showed 50% ATPase activity. Both mutants completely lost ability to unwind RNA duplexes with 5' overhangs.

Objective To investigate the presence of sinonasal manifestations at the onset of COVID-19 to achieve an earlier diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalized or discharged from a single referral center. Patients who were unable to answer (intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased) or unreachable by telephone were excluded. Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and 3 refused. Exposures Sinonasal manifestations reported before COVID-19 diagnosis were studied with a validated questionnaire: Italian Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (I-SNOT-22). If reduction of taste and/or smell was documented by item 5 of the I-SNOT-22, further inquiries were made to score them separately on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no problem and 5 indicating problem as bad as it can be.

Results Among the 204 patients enrolled (110 [53.9%] male; mean [SD] age, 52.6 [14.4] years), the median I-SNOT-22 total score was 21 (range, 0-73). I-SNOT-22 identified 116 patients (56.9%) with reduction of taste and/or smell, 113 (55.4%) with taste reduction (median score, 5; range, 2-5), and 85 (41.7%) with smell reduction (median score, 5; range, 1-5). Eighty-two patients (40.2%) reported both. Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7%), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3%). Only 12 patients (14.8%) with severe taste reduction and 12 patients (16.7%) with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. Severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female vs male patients (odds ratios, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.76-5.67] vs 2.58 [95% CI, 1.43-4.65]) and middle-aged vs younger patients (effect sizes, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78] vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.55-1.15]). No significant association was observed between smoking habits and severe reduction of taste (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.53-1.71) and/or smell (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this telephone survey study suggest that reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of COVID-19. Nasal obstruction was not commonly present at the onset of the disease in this study. The general practitioner may play a pivotal role in identifying potential COVID-19 in patients at an early stage if taste and/or smell alterations manifest and in suggesting quarantine before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.","Mercante, Giuseppe; Ferreli, Fabio; De Virgilio, Armando; Gaino, Francesca; Di Bari, Matteo; Colombo, Giovanni; Russo, Elena; Costantino, Andrea; Pirola, Francesca; Cugini, Giovanni; Malvezzi, Luca; Morenghi, Emanuela; Azzolini, Elena; Lagioia, Michele; Spriano, Giuseppe",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,182,1

Method Voice samples from 20 individuals were recorded after transmission via telepractice platforms. Twenty experienced clinicians (10 speech-language pathologists, 10 laryngologists) evaluated the samples for dysphonia percepts (overall severity, roughness, breathiness, and strain) using a modified Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice. Reliability was calculated as the mean of squared differences between repeated ratings (intrarater agreement), and between individual and group mean ratings (interrater agreement). Repeated measures analyses of variance were constructed to measure effects of transmission condition (e.g., original recording, WebEx, Zoom), dysphonia percept, and their interaction on intrarater agreement, interrater agreement, and average ratings. Significant effects were evaluated with post hoc Tukey's tests. Results There were significant effects of transmission condition, percept, and their interaction on average ratings, and a significant effect of percept on interrater agreement. Post hoc testing revealed statistically, but not clinically, significant differences in average roughness ratings across transmission conditions, and significant differences in interrater agreement for several percepts. Overall severity had the highest agreement and strain had the lowest. Conclusion Telepractice transmission does not substantially reduce reliability or accuracy of auditory-perceptual voice evaluations by experienced clinicians.","Dahl, Kimberly L; Weerathunge, Hasini R; Buckley, Daniel P; Dolling, Anton S; Díaz-Cádiz, Manuel; Tracy, Lauren F; Stepp, Cara E",American journal of speech-language pathology,182,1

Neuroimaging studies of reward-modulated inhibitory control can identify potential objective markers of impairment and may deepen our understanding of why probands engage in costly behaviors leading to adverse outcomes. The study aimed to identify reward-modulated inhibitory control neural circuitries, their association with ADHD symptoms, and real-world implications of a decreased capacity to engage in reward-modulated inhibitory control. METHODS A total of 106 adults (90% male) with rigorous childhood diagnoses of ADHD were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging during the Monetary Incentive Go/NoGo task. Adulthood symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity based on self- and informant report were assessed. The number of lifetime attempts taken to quit smoking were also assessed as an exemplar real-world outcome. RESULTS Hyperactivity/impulsivity was negatively associated with activation in the pallidum and primary motor cortex when inhibiting a previously rewarded Go stimulus that yielded a small immediate reward in order to obtain a larger reward later on. Reduced recruitment of the pallidal-thalamic-motor circuit mediated the negative association between hyperactivity/impulsivity and reward-modulated inhibitory control accuracy. Reduced pallidum activation, in response to reward-modulated inhibitory control, was also associated with more attempts made to successfully quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS Probands with persistent hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms have alterations in brain regions that calculate the value of inhibiting an action that yields an immediate reward in order to obtain delayed larger rewards. This deficit results in poor inhibitory control on basic tasks and during real-world behaviors that rely on similar processes.","Jones, Neil P; Versace, Amelia; Lindstrom, Rachel; Wilson, Tracey K; Gnagy, Elizabeth M; Pelham, William E; Molina, Brooke S G; Ladouceur, Cecile D",Biological psychiatry.

METHODOLOGY We included 28 COVID-19 patients admitted to Nantong Third Hospital from January 23 to February 26, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory parameters were obtained from each patient. RESULTS The vast majority (71.4%) of confirmed COVID-19 patients were brought in from outside of the city, and all others had contact history with these confirmed cases. The median age of patients was 50 years old and half had underlying diseases. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (96.4%), cough (67.9%), and chilly (28.6%), and 75.0% patients had two or more symptoms. Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein levels, and reduced absolute counts of total lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subsets were observed among the patients. The vast majority (85.7%) of patients showed bilateral or unilateral pneumonia, and three symptomatic patients and one asymptomatic case did not show abnormalities in their CT image. Among the 28 admitted patients, 24 were discharged as of February 26, 2020, with an average hospital stay of 14.96 (±4.27) days, which was not significantly associated with the interval between the onset of symptoms and admission. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of specific antiviral drugs or a vaccine, quarantine or isolation is the most effective intervention strategy for preventing the spread of the virus.

One of the postulated mechanisms for this high fatality rate is the possible abundance of ACE type 2 receptor in the cardiovascular system that strongly binds with the spike protein of COVID-19 and helps internalise into the cell resulting in acute cardiac injury (ACI). More than 7% of cases with COVID-19 are reported to have this type of ACI. A tenfold rise in mortality has been observed in patients with COVID-19 who experience a rise in high-sensitivity (hs)-troponin. All most half of the patients who died of COVID-19 had a rise in hs-troponin. More than 15% of cases with COVID-19 experienced different types of arrhythmias. All these statistics denote how important cardiovascular pathology is in patients with COVID-19.

NAVA has been increasingly used for critically ill patients, but it has not been evaluated during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). We designed a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of using NAVA during SBTs, and to compare the breathing pattern and patient-ventilator asynchrony of NAVA with Pressure Support (PSV) during SBTs. METHODS We conducted a crossover trial in the ICU of a university hospital in Brazil and included mechanically ventilated patients considered ready to undergo an SBT on the day of the study. Patients underwent two SBTs in randomized order: 30 min in PSV of 5 cmH2O or NAVA titrated to generate equivalent peak airway pressure (Paw), with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. The ICU team, blinded to ventilatory mode, evaluated whether patients passed each SBT. We captured flow, Paw and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) from the ventilator and used it to calculate respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), and EAdi. Detection of asynchrony events used waveform analysis and we calculated the asynchrony index as the number of asynchrony events divided by the number of neural cycles. RESULTS We included 20 patients in the study. All patients passed the SBT in PSV, and three failed the SBT in NAVA. Five patients were reintubated and the extubation failure rate was 25% (95% CI 9-49%). Respiratory parameters were similar in the two modes: VT = 6.1 (5.5-6.5) mL/Kg in NAVA vs. 5.5 (4.8-6.1) mL/Kg in PSV (p = 0.076) and RR = 27 (17-30) rpm in NAVA vs. 26 (20-30) rpm in PSV, p = 0.55. NAVA reduced AI, with a median of 11.5% (4.2-19.7) compared to 24.3% (6.3-34.3) in PSV (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS NAVA reduces patient-ventilator asynchrony index and generates a respiratory pattern similar to PSV during SBTs. Patients considered ready for mechanical ventilation liberation may be submitted to an SBT in NAVA using the same objective criteria used for SBTs in PSV.

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, this work addressed the behavior of 2019-nCoV in two aspects: the binding affinity of its receptor binding domain (RBD) with ACE2, and its potential conformation preferences in its unbound state. The results showed that the RBD of 2019-nCov bound much stronger with ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV due to a better organized hydrogen bond network between the former pair with most of the residues at the contact interface sharing the responsibility to hold the pair tightly. This is in contrast to the case of SARS-CoV, which strongly relied on the residues at the ends of the cleft. In its unbound state, the RBD of 2019-nCoV was found to fold part of its receptor binding motif (RBM) into a helical conformation and flip into a concave to minimize its contact with the external environment. This has the biological implication that the virus may achieve higher translational motion in the condensed phase and have a higher chance of survival by avoiding capture by the immune system before reaching its target receptor.","Liu, Ziyi; Xia, Miaoren; Chai, Zhifang; Wang, Dongqi",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,182,1

We used holographic microscopy to image swimming cells of different Leishmania mexicana life cycle stages in three dimensions. We find that the human-infective (metacyclic promastigote) forms display 'run and tumble' behaviour in the absence of stimulus, reminiscent of bacterial motion, and that they specifically modify swimming direction and speed to target host immune cells in response to a macrophage-derived stimulus. Non-infective (procyclic promastigote) cells swim more slowly, along meandering helical paths.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five large animal ARDS models of sheep were established by intravenous injection of Lipopolysaccharide. ASD was made under general anesthesia and VA-ECMO was simulated by extracorporeal circulation machine. The oxygenation of peripheral blood, systemic circulation, and cardiac function were observed under conditions of closed and opened ASD, and the significance of ASD shunt in improving cardiopulmonary function was evaluated. RESULTS With ASD closed, the atrial shunts disappeared, the peripheral artery pressure of oxygen(PaO2): 141.2±21.4mmHg, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2): 353.0±53.5, the mean blood pressure (MAP): 49.3±13.5 mmHg, the heart was full; with ASD opened, the left-to-right shunt was observed, PaO2: 169.3±18.9mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 423.3±47.3, MAP: 68.2±16.1 mmHg, the range of cardiac motion significantly increased, heart beat was powerful, and systemic circulation significantly improved. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences between opened and closed ASD (P < .01). CONCLUSION ASD plus VA-ECMO is an effective method for the treatment of ARDS combined with LVD, which is the main cause of death in severe COVID-19 patients. However, further clinical validation is needed.","Diao, Liwei; Yang, Yingjie; Zhang, Baoquan; Shi, Qizhong; Fan, Hongzhe; Liu, Jie; Li, Yangyang; Wu, Benqing; Wu, Yibin; Qiu, Haiyi; Li, Wenbin",The heart surgery forum,182,1

To determine the mechanism of action of the most active anticonvulsant compounds (3, 4, 6, 9), their influence on the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels as well as GABA transporter (GAT) was assessed. The most promising compound 3-(3-methylthiophen-2-yl)-1-(3-morpholinopropyl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione hydrochloride (4) showed higher ED50 value than those of the reference drugs: valproic acid (VPA) and ethosuximide (ETX) (62.14 mg/kg vs. 252.7 mg/kg (VPA) in the MES test, and 75.59 mg/kg vs. 130.6 mg/kg (VPA) and 221.7 mg/kg (ETX) in the 6 Hz test, respectively). Moreover, in vitro studies of compound 4 showed moderate but balanced inhibition of the neuronal voltage-sensitive sodium (site 2) and L-type calcium channels. Additionally, the antinociceptive activity of the most active compounds (3, 4, 6, 9) was also evaluated in the hot plate test and writhing tests, and their hepatotoxic properties in HepG2 cells were also investigated. To determine the possible mechanism of the analgesic effect of compounds 3, 6, and 9, the affinity for the TRPV1 receptor was investigated.","Góra, Małgorzata; Czopek, Anna; Rapacz, Anna; Dziubina, Anna; Głuch-Lutwin, Monika; Mordyl, Barbara; Obniska, Jolanta",International journal of molecular sciences,182,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic the question arises if laparoscopy, as an aerosol forming procedure, poses a potential risk for viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers. Methods. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE. Articles reporting information regarding COVID-19 or other relevant viruses and laparoscopy, surgical smoke, aerosols and viral transmission were included. Results. Although aerosols produced during laparoscopy do not originate from the respiratory tract, the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, research did show SARS-CoV-2 to be present in other body fluids. The transmission risk via this route is however considered very low. As previous research showed potential viral transmission during laparoscopy for viruses that spread through contaminated body fluids, there might be a potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during laparoscopy, albeit considered very small. Conclusion. Due to the small risk compared to widely known benefits of laparoscopy, there is no reason to replace laparoscopy by laparotomy due to COVID-19 infection. To avoid the potential small risk of viral transmission, additional safety measures are advised.","Tummers, Fokkedien Hmp; Draaisma, Werner A; Demirkiran, Ahmet; Brouwer, Tammo A; Lagerveld, Brunolf W; van Schrojenstein Lantman, Esther S; Spijkers, Klaartje; Coppus, Sjors Fpj; Jansen, Frank Willem",Surgical innovation,182,7

In rural regions, where the majority of the population reside, empirical treatment guidelines derived from central urban hospitals are often of limited relevance. In these settings, relatively untrained health workers deliver care, often without any laboratory diagnostic support. In this paper, our aim was to model the impact on mortality from febrile illness of using point-of-care C-reactive protein testing to inform the decision to prescribe antibiotics and regional surveillance data to inform antibiotic selection, rooted in the real-world context of rural Savannakhet province, southern Laos. Methods: Our model simulates 100 scenarios with varying quarterly incidence of six key pathogens known to be prevalent in rural Laos. In the simulations, community health workers either prescribe antibiotics in-line with current practice as documented in health facilities in rural Laos, or with the aid of the two interventions. We provide cost-effectiveness estimates for each strategy alone and then for an integrated approach using both interventions. Results: We find that each strategy alone is predicted to be highly cost-effective, and that the combined approach is predicted to result in the biggest reduction in mortality (averting a predicted 510 deaths per year in rural Savannakhet, a 28% reduction compared to standard practice) and is highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of just $66 per disability-adjusted life year averted. Conclusions: Substantial seasonal variation in the predicted optimal empirical antibiotic treatment for febrile illness highlights the benefits of up-to-date information on regional causes of fever. In this modelling analysis, an integrated system incorporating point-of-care host biomarker testing and regional surveillance data appears highly cost-effective, and may warrant piloting in a real-life setting.","Chandna, Arjun; White, Lisa J; Pongvongsa, Tiengkham; Mayxay, Mayfong; Newton, Paul N; Day, Nicholas P J; Lubell, Yoel",Wellcome open research,182,1

Its safety profile and costeffectiveness are well-documented. Scientists have found that chloroquine has in vitro activity against novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, chloroquine has been adopted in the Protocol for Managing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) (Version 7) issued by China National Health Commission for clinically managing COVID-19. OBJECT This review will focus on the antiviral mechanism, effectiveness and safety, dosage and DDIs of chloroquine, for the purpose to provide evidence-based support for rational use of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. Method：Use the search terms 'chloroquine' linked with 'effectiveness', 'safety', 'mechanism', 'drug-drug interaction (DDIs)' or other terms respectively to search relevant literature through PubMed. RESULT After searching, we found literature about antivirus mechanism, dosage, DDIs of chloroquine. However, studies of effectiveness and safety on chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 for the general and geriatric patients are not enough. CONCLUSION According to literature reports, chloroquine has been proved to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in vitro and the potential mechanism of chloroquine in vivo. Pharmacokinetic characteristics and DDIs study are helpful to guide rational drug use in general and geriatric patients. Although there have been reports of successful clinical application of chloroquine in treatment COVID-19，more clinical test data are still needed to prove its effectiveness and safety.","Yao, Xueting; Hou, Zhe; Cui, Cheng; Zhang, Miao; Tu, Siqi; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Dongyang",Current drug metabolism,182,1

Intraoperative detection of bile leakage is challenging, and concomitant blood oozing can mask the presence of bile. Intraductal dye injection [methylene blue or indocyanine green (ICG)] is a validated technique to detect bile leakage. However, this method is time-consuming, particularly in the laparoscopic setting. A novel narrow band imaging (NBI) modality (SPECTRA-A; Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) allows easy discrimination of the presence of bile, which appears in clear orange, by image processing. The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate SPECTRA-A ability to detect bile leakage. METHODS Twelve laparoscopic partial hepatectomies were performed in seven pigs. The common bile duct was clipped distally and dissected, and a catheter was inserted and secured with a suture or a clip. Liver dissection was achieved with an ultrasonic cutting device. Dissection surfaces were checked by frequently switching on the SPECTRA filter to identify the presence of bile leakage. Intraductal ICG injection through the catheter was performed to confirm SPECTRA findings. RESULTS Three active bile leakages were obtained out of 12 hepatectomies and successfully detected intraoperatively by the SPECTRA. There was complete concordance between NBI and ICG fluorescence detection. No active leaks were found in the remaining cases with both techniques. The leaking area identified was sutured, and SPECTRA was used to assess the success of the repair. CONCLUSIONS The SPECTRA laparoscopic image processing system allows for rapid detection of bile leaks following hepatectomy without any contrast injection.","Diana, Michele; Usmaan, Hameed; Legnèr, Andras; Yu-Yin, Liu; D'Urso, Antonio; Halvax, Peter; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Pessaux, Patrick; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,182,2

Preoperative physical examination revealed an approximately 5 cm × 2 cm scab on the craniolateral portion of the left antebrachium. The cat was anesthetized for the neuter using an injectable anesthesia protocol. After castration, the wound area on the antebrachium was clipped, copiously lavaged and the wound edges were surgically debrided. Injectable antibiotics and analgesic management were instituted. The wound was conservatively managed using sugar bandaging and antibiotic dressings until the progression of healing plateaued. Procedures for closing the defect were explored, and it was decided that a single-pedicle hinge flap would be ideal. The procedure was performed on the mobile veterinary unit and managed postoperatively with pain control and biweekly bandage changes. After 3 weeks, the single-pedicle hinge flap was released to create a skin graft, which successfully filled the defect. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION Single-pedicle hinge flaps performed in feline patients have been minimally reported. This case report serves to provide detailed information on the surgical procedure and aftercare required for a successful outcome. Furthermore, this procedure was performed by a shelter medicine team in a mobile veterinary unit with no specialty equipment or instruments.

We describe our experience with human cadaveric courses for taTME delivered in two countries. METHOD Four fresh human cadaveric workshops conducted in Oxford, UK, in 2015 and two in Chicago, USA, in 2013-2014, trained a total of 52 surgeons. Parameters of operative performance for each delegate were recorded. Previous surgical experience and uptake of taTME in the surgeons' clinical setting were surveyed. RESULTS Forty-seven taTME cases were performed on cadaveric models. Participating surgeons had previous experience in laparoscopic TME surgery and transanal approaches but limited taTME exposure. The purse-string remained occluded throughout in 93% of UK and 60% of US cases. Operative timings for key procedural steps were similar between the two countries with a mean time from start of circumferential dissection to peritoneal entry of 79.5 min (range 25-155). 96% of surgeons dissected transanally to a level S2 or above. The TME specimen quality was complete or near complete in 81%, with improvements noted between the first and second procedure performed. 81% of surgeons surveyed are currently performing taTME in their local hospitals. CONCLUSION Fresh-frozen cadavers provide excellent teaching models for complex pelvic surgery. A structured training curriculum including reading material, dry-lab purse-string practice and postcourse mentorship will provide surgeons with a more complete training package and ongoing support, to ultimately ensure the safe introduction of taTME in the clinical setting.","Penna, M; Whiteford, M; Hompes, R; Sylla, P",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,182,27

To date, there is no description of a fluorophore, which can be simultaneously used for non-invasive, near-infrared fluorescence-based (NIRF) visualization of different structures and perfusion evaluation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate IRDye® 800BK for the simultaneous assessment of bowel perfusion, lymphography, ureter and bile duct delineation. METHODS Six pigs received a 0.15 mg/kg dye as a single bolus intravenous injection (IV). With the FLER (fluorescence-based enhanced reality) software, fluorescence intensity (FI) of 5 regions of interest (ROI) in an ischemic bowel loop was measured along with the time to reach the FI peak, and capillary lactate was measured from the same ROI, followed by the assessment of the ureters and bile ducts for a maximal duration of 180 min after dye administration. In 3 animals, the procedure was initiated via gastroscopic injection of a 0.6 mg (1 mg/mL) dye in the gastric submucosa followed by lymphography in a NIRF setting. RESULTS Excellent visualization of the ureters and bowel perfusion was obtained under NIRF imaging. Additionally, the bile duct and gastric lymph ducts and nodes were visualized. A positive correlation was found between the time to peak FI in the ischemic bowel loop and the corresponding capillary lactate levels (rho 0.59, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION In this study, we successfully demonstrated the simultaneous multipurpose IRDye® 800BK applicability during laparoscopic surgery. This fluorophore has the potential to become a powerful and versatile image-guided surgery tool.","Al-Taher, Mahdi; Barberio, Manuel; Felli, Eric; Agnus, Vincent; Ashoka, Anila Hoskere; Gioux, Sylvain; Klymchenko, Andrey; Bouvy, Nicole; Stassen, Laurents; Marescaux, Jacques; Diana, Michele",Surgical endoscopy,182,1

Inadequate intraoperative cerebral oxygen supply is one of the inciting causes of POCD. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices monitor cerebral oxygen saturation continuously and can help to guide intraoperative patient management. The aim of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the NIRS-based clinical algorithm during spinal neurosurgery and to find out whether it can influence postoperative cognitive performance. Materials and Methods: Thirty four patients scheduled for spinal neurosurgery were randomized into a study group (n = 23) and a control group (n = 11). We monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) throughout surgery, using a NIRS device (INVOS 4100). If rScO2 dropped bilaterally or unilaterally by more than 20% from baseline values, or under an absolute value of 50%, the NIRS-based algorithm was initiated in the study group. In the control group, rScO2 was monitored blindly. To evaluate cognitive function, Montreal-Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale was used in both groups before and after the surgery. Results: In the study group, rScO2 dropped below the threshold in three patients and the NIRS-based algorithm was activated. Firstly, we verified correct positioning of the head; secondly, we increased mean systemic arterial pressure in the three patients by injecting repeated intravenous bolus doses of Ephedrine, ultimately resulting in an rScO2 increase above the approved threshold level. None of the three patients showed POCD. In the control group, one patient showed a drop in rScO2 of 34% from baseline and presented with a POCD. RScO2 drop occurred with other stable intraoperative measurements. Conclusions: A significant rScO2 drop may occur during spinal surgery in prone position despite other intraoperative measurements remaining stable, allowing it to stay otherwise unrecognized. Use of the NIRS-based clinical algorithm can help to avoid POCD in patients after spinal surgery.","Murniece, Sniedze; Soehle, Martin; Vanags, Indulis; Mamaja, Biruta",Medicina,182,1

Yet to our knowledge, no study has compared the antibacterial efficacy of a large collection of hand sanitizers. Using zone of growth inhibition and kill curve assays, we assessed the performance of 46 commercially available hand sanitizers that were obtained from national chain big-box stores, gasoline stations, pharmacies, and boutiques for antibacterial activity toward prototypical Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial pathogens. Results revealed substantial variability in the efficacy of many sanitizers evaluated. Formulations following World Health Organization-recommended ingredients (80% ethanol or 75% isopropyl alcohol) or those including benzalkonium chloride as the active principal ingredient displayed excellent antibacterial activity, whereas others exhibited modest or poor activity in the assays performed. Results also revealed that E. coli was generally more susceptible to most sanitizers in comparison to S. aureus and that there was significant strain-to-strain variability in hand sanitizer antimicrobial efficacy regardless of the organism evaluated. Further, tests of a subset of hand sanitizers toward severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) revealed no direct correlation between antibacterial and antiviral performance, with all ethyl alcohol formulations performing equally well and displaying improved activity in comparison to benzalkonium chloride-containing sanitizer. Taken together, these results indicate that there is likely to be substantial variability in the antimicrobial performance of commercially available hand sanitizers, particularly toward bacterial pathogens, and a need to evaluate the efficacy of sanitizers under development.IMPORTANCE In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hand hygiene has taken on a prominent role in efforts to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection, which has led to a radical increase in the number and types of hand sanitizers manufactured to meet public demand. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated or compared the antimicrobial performance of hand sanitizers that are being produced under COVID-19 emergency authorization.

METHODS Four different platforms for automatic lung segmentation based on convolutional neural network (CNN), region-growing technique and atlas-based algorithm were considered. The platforms were tested using CT images of 55 COVID-19 patients with severe lung impairment. Four radiologists assessed the segmentations using a 5-point qualitative score (QS). For each CT series, a manually revised reference segmentation (RS) was obtained. Histogram-based quantitative metrics (QM) were calculated from CT histogram using lung segmentationsfrom all platforms and RS. Dice index (DI) and differences of QMs (ΔQMs) were calculated between RS and other segmentations. RESULTS Highest QS and lower ΔQMs values were associated to the CNN algorithm. However, only 45% CNN segmentations were judged to need no or only minimal corrections, and in only 17 cases (31%), automatic segmentations provided RS without manual corrections. Median values of the DI for the four algorithms ranged from 0.993 to 0.904. Significant differences for all QMs calculated between automatic segmentations and RS were found both when data were pooled together and stratified according to QS, indicating a relationship between qualitative and quantitative measurements. The most unstable QM was the histogram 90th percentile, with median ΔQMs values ranging from 10HU and 158HU between different algorithms. CONCLUSIONS None of tested algorithms provided fully reliable segmentation. Segmentation accuracy impacts differently on different quantitative metrics, and each of them should be individually evaluated according to the purpose of subsequent analyses.","Berta, L; Rizzetto, F; De Mattia, C; Lizio, D; Felisi, M; Colombo, P E; Carrazza, S; Gelmini, S; Bianchi, L; Artioli, D; Travaglini, F; Vanzulli, A; Torresin, A",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics,182,1

It is known that following activation, key tyrosines are phosphorylated in the intracytoplasmic domains of WC1 molecules and that the cells fail to respond when WC1 is knocked down or, as shown here, when physically separated from the TCR. Based on these results we hypothesized that the colocalization of WC1 and TCR will occur following cellular activation thereby allowing signaling to ensue. We evaluated the spatio-temporal dynamics of their interaction using imaging flow cytometry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. We found that in quiescent γδ T cells both WC1 and TCR existed in separate and spatially stable protein domains (protein islands) but after activation using Leptospira, our model system, that they concatenated. The association between WC1 and TCR was close enough for fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Prior to concatenating with the WC1 co-receptor, γδ T cells had clustering of TCR-CD3 complexes and exclusion of CD45. γδ T cells may individually express more than one variant of the WC1 family of molecules and we found that individual WC1 variants are clustered in separate protein islands in quiescent cells. However, the islands containing different variants merged following cell activation and before merging with the TCR islands. While WC1 was previously shown to bind Leptospira in solution, here we showed that Leptospira bound WC1 proteins on the surface of γδ T cells and that this could be blocked by anti-WC1 antibodies. In conclusion, γδ TCR, WC1 and Leptospira interact directly on the γδ T cell surface, further supporting the role of WC1 in γδ T cell pathogen recognition and cellular activation.","Gillespie, Alexandria; Gervasi, Maria Gracia; Sathiyaseelan, Thillainayagam; Connelley, Timothy; Telfer, Janice C; Baldwin, Cynthia L",Frontiers in immunology,182,17

In general, the development of objective, fast, and accurate automatic methods for LUS data evaluation is still at an early stage. This is particularly true for COVID- 19 diagnostic. In this paper, we propose an automatic and unsupervised method for the detection and localization of the pleural line in LUS data based on the Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi Algorithm. The pleural line localization step is followed by a supervised classification procedure based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classifier evaluates the healthiness level of a patient and, if present, the severity of the pathology, i.e., the score value for each image of a given LUS acquisition. The experiments performed on a variety of LUS data acquired in Italian hospitals with both linear and convex probes highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method. The average overall accuracy in detecting the pleura is 84% and 94% for convex and linear probes, respectively. The accuracy of the SVM classification in correctly evaluating the severity of COVID-19 related pleural line alterations is about 88% and 94% for convex and linear probes, respectively. The results as well as the visualization of the detected pleural line and the predicted score chart, provide a significant support to medical staff for further evaluating the patient condition.","Carrer, Leonardo; Donini, Elena; Marinelli, Daniele; Zanetti, Massimo; Mento, Federico; Torri, Elena; Smargiassi, Andrea; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Soldati, Gino; Demi, Libertario; Bovolo, Francesca; Bruzzone, Lorenzo","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",182,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study comprised 75 individuals aged 18 to 65. The main group included 40 patients with a diagnosis of dental periimplantitis (ICD K 10.2). A comparison group (n=20) included patients after dental implantation without postoperative complications. The control group (n=25) consisted of individuals without dental pathology. Cathepsin K (CTSK) (Human) ELISA Kit (Cloud-Clone Corp., USA) was used to determine the concentration of cathepsin K by the enzyme immunoassay in the gingival or peri-implant fluid. RESULTS The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid in the patients of the control group was 1.7±0.3 pmol/l, in the comparison group the concentration of the studied biomarker corresponded to 2.3±0.4 pmol/l. In the main group, the concentration of cathepsin K in the exudate of peri-implantation pockets increased 2.8 times (p<0.05) and corresponded to 4.9±0.5 pmol/l. The concentration of cathepsin K in the gingival fluid normally did not depend on age and gender, which increased the independence of the osteomarker for characterizing the osteoresorbent process in the peri-implantation area. After dental implantation, an excess of cathepsin K concentration above the level of 2.7 pmol/l with a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.5% and a specificity of 83.7% suggests a high risk of developing peri-implantitis. CONCLUSION The concentration of cathepsin K may be seen as valuable marker for local inflammatory and destructive processes in the contents of the peri-implantation area.","Zorina, O A; Amkhadova, M A; Boriskina, O A; Aleskerov, E Sh; Polyakov, V M",Stomatologiia,182,25

Reviews have described respiratory illnesses of DS in childhood, but few have looked across the lifespan. Retrospective chart review of patients in our DS program with clinical encounters for respiratory illnesses from 2011 to 2020 was completed. Eighteen percent of clinical encounters were due to respiratory illnesses. Of these, 120 were seen in the emergency department, 88 were admitted, and 21 were seen in urgent care. Common comorbidities included congenital heart disease, asthma, and dysphagia. Admission was common for children under the age of 5 years and adults over the age of 45 years. Admitted patients were more likely to have history of pneumonia and chronic lung disease. Of admitted patients, 77% required supplemental oxygen and 46% required intensive care unit admission. Our findings highlight that respiratory illnesses are a common cause of healthcare utilization among patients with DS, particularly early in childhood and later in life. Patients were seen predominately in outpatient settings; when an inpatient setting was needed, they frequently required higher levels of care. With our findings, clinicians can stratify patients most at risk for respiratory infections and provide targeted monitoring.","Blake, Jasmine M; Estrada Gomez, Daniela; Skotko, Brian G; Torres, Amy; Santoro, Stephanie L",American journal of medical genetics.

We present an alternative technique for women: the laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal IPOM. METHODS Before surgery, all patients underwent a gynecological examination. The patients agreed to IPOM repair via a transvaginal approach, and written informed consent for surgery was obtained. Pneumoperitoneum was established with a Veress needle at the umbilicus. This access was subsequently dilated to 5 mm (VersaStep), and a 5-mm laparoscope was inserted. Under laparoscopic view, the transvaginal trocars (12-mm VersaStep and 5-mm flexible accesses) were safely inserted after lifting the uterus with a uterus manipulator. After preparation of the falciform ligament, the ligamentum teres and the preperitoneal fat, a lightweight composite mesh was introduced through the transvaginal access and fixed with absorbable tacks using the double-crown technique. RESULTS From September 2011 to December 2012, we performed six laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal IPOM procedures (one epigastric, three umbilical, two combined epigastric and umbilical hernias; all were primary hernias). In the initial phase, only patients with small or medium primary abdominal wall hernia were selected (max. 3 cm diameter). Median hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-6 days). One minor complication occurred perioperatively (second-degree skin burn to the labia majora). At 1-year follow-up, we identified one recurrence in a high-risk patient with a body mass index higher than 35 kg/m(2). No infection and no mortality were observed. CONCLUSION Although no final conclusion can be made regarding the presumed non-inferiority of this technique in terms of recurrence and mesh infection compared with traditional laparoscopic IPOM, laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal IPOM is a feasible alternative to treat abdominal wall hernias.","Descloux, Alexandre; Pohle, Sebastian; Nocito, Antonio; Keerl, Andreas",Surgical endoscopy,182,1

A SARS-CoV-2 okozta megbetegedés (COVID-19) a cikk megírásáig a világon több mint 82 millió embert érintett, a halálos áldozatok száma 1,8 millió (2,2%). Hazánkban eddig 300 000 feletti esetszámot regisztráltak, a cikk megjelenésének idején már várhatóan több mint 10 000 halottal (3%). Habár a megbetegedésnek oki gyógyszeres terápiája egyelőre nincs, egyes antivirális szerek és a rekonvaleszcens plazma alkalmazása a tapasztalatok szerint csökkentik a vírusterhelést, és ezzel hozzájárulnak a beteg gyógyulásához. Az eddig példa nélküli epidemiológiai rendelkezések nem tudták megállítani, csak lelassítani a betegség terjedését, ezért a megelőzés tűnik az egyetlen, a közeljövőben tömegek számára is elérhető megoldásnak. A jelen cikk nem egy virológiai vagy biotechnológiai szakmunka, sokkal inkább egy összefoglaló házi- és általános orvosok számára, amely ismerteti a jelenleg engedélyezett, illetve a közeljövőben forgalomba kerülő védőoltások előnyeit és hátrányait a COVID-19 tágabb kontextusában. Írásunkban bemutatjuk a leggyakoribb álhíreket, rémhíreket is, valamint ezek cáfolatát is annak érdekében, hogy kollégáink felkészültebben tudják betegeiket informálni, valamint segíteni a vakcináció fontosságával kapcsolatos döntéshozatalt. Egy járvány megfékezésének legkézenfekvőbb módja a társadalmi szintű védettség megvalósítása. A nyájimmunitás kialakulása nélkül nagy valószínűséggel e jelenlegi pandémia sem állítható meg. Amennyiben egyéni és társadalmi szinten is vissza szeretnénk térni a vírus előtti életünkhöz, újra élvezve az akadálytalan áru- és kereskedelmi forgalom jelentette előnyöket, akkor a tömeges oltás tűnik a leghatékonyabb eszköznek ennek eléréséhez. A fertőző betegségek számának és mortalitásának a 20. században tapasztalt jelentős csökkenése egyértelműen a társadalmi szintű átoltottságnak, valamint a higiénés körülmények javulásának köszönhető. Az oltás ugyan önkéntes, de felvételének kérdése pandémiás helyzetben valószínűleg nemcsak egyéni döntés, de társadalmi felelősségvállalás kérdése is. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(8): 283-292. Summary. Out of more than 82 million people worldwide, 1.8 million (2.2%) succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). In 2020, more than 300 000 cases were registered in Hungary, and by the time of publication of this article, the death toll would probably exceed 10 000 (3%). Currently no causative drug therapy is available, however, observational evidence suggests that certain antivirals and the use of convalescent plasma may change the disease course. The unprecedented, strict epidemiological provisions managed to slow down the spread of the disease though they could not stop it. It seems that prevention remains the only readily available option to beat COVID-19. This is not a virology or biotechnology paper, but an unbiased review for general practitioners, aiming to summarize the advantages/disadvantages of the (emergency) authorized and soon-to-be-launched vaccines in the wider context of COVID-19. We also intended to address and debunk the most common misconceptions, aiming to help both doctors and patients to make a fact-based, informed decision about vaccination. Herd immunity is paramount to combat COVID pandemic. Without population-level vaccination, we are unlikely to regain the quality of life, the freedom of travel and the unrestricted economy/commerce we enjoyed before. It is obvious that the significant reduction in morbity/mortality of infectious diseases in the 20th century was achieved through advancements in vaccinology and improved hygiene. Albeit voluntary, vaccination in a pandemic situation is probably not only an individual decision, but social responsibility as well.

Sprague-Dawley, Fischer 344, and Brown-Norway male rats were maintained on a high-fat, or regular diet for 24 weeks. Liver tissue was collected at 4, 12, and 24 weeks to assess global small molecule metabolite changes using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. The results of the global metabolomics analysis revealed significant changes based on both age and diet within all three strains. Principal component analysis revealed that the influence of diet caused a greater variation in significantly changing metabolites than that of age for the Brown Norway and Fisher 344 strains, whereas diet had the greatest influence in the Sprague Dawley strain only at the 4-week time point. As expected, metabolites involved in lipid metabolism were changed in the animals maintained on a high fat diet compared to the regular diet. There were also significant changes observed in the concentration of Tri carboxylic acid cycle intermediates that were extracted from the liver of all three strains based on diet. The results of this study showed that a high fat diet caused significant liver and metabolic changes compared to a regular diet in multiple rat strains. The inbred Fisher 344 and Brown Norway rats were more metabolically sensitive to the diet changes than outbred Sprague Dawley strain. The study also showed that age, as was the case for Sprague Dawley, is an important variable to consider when assessing metabolic changes.","Boyce, Greg; Shoeb, Mohammad; Kodali, Vamsi; Meighan, Terence; Roberts, Jenny R; Erdely, Aaron; Kashon, Michael; Antonini, James M",PloS one,182,16

Point prevalence rates and confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated for current and ever use of ENDS in each state capital, and the profile of ENDS users were described. Prevalence of lifetime use was estimated at 6.7% (95%CI: 6.13-7.27) and current use at 2.32% (95%CI: 1.97-2.68). A total of 2.4 million individuals had used ENDS any time in life, and 835,000 were currently using them. Approximately 80% of persons who had used ENDS were 18 to 34 years-old. Prevalence rates for daily use and dual use in individuals aged 18 to 24 years were nearly 10 times than prevalence in the older age groups. More than half of individuals who had ever used ENDS were never smokers. The proportion of women and individuals with high educational level were higher in the group of young people who only used ENDS than among those who only smoked conventional cigarettes. ENDS users also presented a higher proportion of binge drinking. Our findings are opposite to the tobacco industry's argument that the target public for ENDS is adult smokers. Considering that groups purportedly less prone to using conventional cigarettes are experiencing initiation with ENDS, our findings call attention to the possible negative impact of the dissemination of ENDS on Brazil's successful experience in the fight against tobacco.","Bertoni, Neilane; Szklo, André Salém",Cadernos de saude publica,182,1

BACKGROUND Synthetic vaccines can cause production of neutralizing antibodies only in case if short peptides form the same secondary structure as fragments of full-length proteins. The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm was designed to check stability of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils using several propensity scales obtained during analysis of 1730 3D structures of proteins. OBJECTIVE The algorithm has been tested in the three peptides known to keep the secondary structure of the corresponding fragments of full-length proteins: the NY25 peptide from the Influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin, the SF23 peptide from the diphtheria toxin, the NQ21 peptide from the HIV1 gp120; as well as in the CC36 peptide from the human major prion protein. METHOD Affine chromatography for antibodies against peptides accompanied by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to check the predictions of the algorithm. RESULT Immunological experiments showed that all abovementioned peptides are more or less immunogenic in rabbits. The fact that antibodies against the NY25, the SF23, and the NQ21 form stable complexes with corresponding full-length proteins has been confirmed by affine chromatography.

MWA is a recently introduced thermal needle ablation treatment modality with theoretical advantages compared with radiofrequency ablation, such as greater intratumoral temperatures, lack of a grounding pad, and superior convection profile. However, experience has been limited in the human kidney. METHODS Ten patients with a single, solid-enhancing renal tumor from June 2008 to November 2008 received laparoscopic or computed tomography-guided percutaneous MWA at a tertiary referral center with ≥14 months of follow-up. MWA was performed using the Valleylab Evident, 915-MHz MWA system at 45 W with intraoperative biopsy before ablation, and peripheral fiberoptic thermometry to determine the treatment endpoints. The patients were followed up with contrast-enhanced computed tomography at 1 month, 6 months to 1 year, and annually to monitor for tumor recurrence. RESULTS The follow-up duration for the 6 male and 4 female patients (mean tumor size 3.65 cm, range 2.0-5.5; mean age 69.8 years) was 17.9 months. The recurrence rate, defined by persistent enhancement, was 38% (3 of 8). The intraoperative and postoperative complication rate was 20% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS MWA resulted in poor oncologic outcomes with a significant complication rate at an intermediate level of follow-up. However, MWA has promising theoretical advantages and should not be discarded. Additional studies should be considered to better understand the microwave-tissue interaction and treatment endpoints for different size renal masses before widespread use.","Castle, Scott M; Salas, Nelson; Leveillee, Raymond J",Urology,182,27

Antibody potential to target extracellular MT and its mechanism was tested in vitro. Biopsies of patients with active colitis showed infiltration of MT-positive cells in a pattern that correlated with the grade of inflammation. MT knockout mice displayed less severe acute dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis compared to congenic wild-type mice based on survival, weight loss, colon length, histological inflammation and leukocyte infiltration. Chronic DSS-colitis confirmed that Mt1 and Mt2 gene disruption enhances clinical outcome. Blockade of extracellular MT with antibodies reduced F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration in DSS- and trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-colitis, with a tendency towards a better outcome. Whole-body single-photon emission computer tomography of mice injected with radioactive anti-MT antibodies showed antibody accumulation in the colon during colitis and clearance during recovery. Necrotic and not apoptotic cell death resulted in western blot MT detection in HT29 cell supernatant. In a Boyden chamber migration assay, leukocyte attraction towards the necrotic cell supernatant could be abolished with anti-MT antibody, indicating the chemotactic potential of endogenous released MT. Our results show that human colitis is associated with infiltration of MT-positive inflammatory cells. Since antibody blockade of extracellular MT can reduce colitis in mice, MT may act as a danger signal and may represent a novel target for reducing leukocyte infiltration and inflammation in IBD patients.","Devisscher, Lindsey; Hindryckx, Pieter; Lynes, Michael A; Waeytens, Anouk; Cuvelier, Claude; De Vos, Filip; Vanhove, Christian; Vos, Martine De; Laukens, Debby",The Journal of pathology,182,27

Pulse oximetry (PO) can be used to detect hypoxemia, but its application in low-income countries has been limited, and its feasibility in the routine assessment of young infants (aged 0-59 days) has not been previously studied. The aim of this study was to characterize the operational feasibility and parent/guardian acceptability of incorporating PO into the routine clinical assessment of young infants in a primary care setting in a low-income country. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of 862 visits by 529 infants at two primary care clinics in Karachi, Pakistan (March to June, 2013). After clinical assessment, oxygen saturation (Sp02) was measured by a handheld PO device (Rad-5v, Masimo Corporation) according to a standardized protocol. Performance time (PT) was the time between sensor placement and attainment of an acceptable PO reading (i.e., stable SpO2 + 1% for at least 10 s, heart rate displayed, and adequate signal indicators). PT included the time for one repeat attempt at a different anatomical site if the first attempt did not yield an acceptable reading within 1 min. Parent/guardian acceptability of PO was based on a questionnaire and unprompted comments about the procedure. All infants underwent physician assessment. RESULTS Acceptable PO readings were obtained in ≤ 1 and ≤ 5 min at 94.4% and 99.8% of visits, respectively (n = 862). Median PT was 42 s (interquartile range 37; 50). Parents/guardians overwhelmingly accepted PO (99.6% overall satisfaction, n = 528 first visits). Of 10 infants with at least one visit with Sp02 <92% on a first PO attempt, 3 did not have a significant acute illness on physician assessment. There were no PO-related adverse events. DISCUSSION Using a commercially available handheld pulse oximeter, acceptable Sp02 measurements were obtained in nearly all infants in under 1 minute. The procedure was readily integrated into existing assessment pathways and parents/guardians had positive views of the technology. CONCLUSIONS When incorporated into routine clinical assessment of young infants at primary care clinics in a low-income country, PO was feasible and acceptable to parents/guardians. Future research is needed to determine if the introduction of routine PO screening of young infants will improve outcomes in low-resource settings.","Emdin, Connor A; Mir, Fatima; Sultana, Shazia; Kazi, A M; Zaidi, Anita K M; Dimitris, Michelle C; Roth, Daniel E",BMC pediatrics,182,26

In general, choroidal metastases respond favorably to systemic therapy targeted toward the primary neoplasm. In patients with choroidal metastasis of ALK rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), targeted therapy using Alk inhibitors gradually replaced radiotherapy as the best treatment. Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitors. Here we describe 2 clinical cases of patients with choroidal metastasis of ALK rearranged NSCLC who received Alectinib as first-line therapy achieving disease control and quality of life improvement. PATIENTS CONCERNS In case report 1, 62-year-old man presented with scintillated scotomas at the level of the right eye; in case report 2, 69-year-old man presented with respiratory distress, persistent cough resistant to medical therapy, pain, and blurred vision. DIAGNOSES In case report 1, fundus and ultrasonographic examination showed circumscribed choroid thickening with dome-like appearance compatible with repetitive lesion. Computed tomographic/y (CT) showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodular formations and adenocarcinoma of the lung was diagnosed by a transbronchial biopsy.In case report 2, CT showed a primary lesion of 36 × 27 mm in the middle lobe with bilateral lung metastases and lymphadenopathies. Multiple hepatic metastases and minor suspicious bone repetitions. A liver biopsy made a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma compatible with pulmonary primitiveness. An ocular fluoroangiography evidenced a left choroidal metastasis. INTERVENTIONS Case report 1, 2, medical treatment with Alectinib 1200 mg/day was initiated. OUTCOMES In case report 1, a few days after beginning the treatment, both systemic symptoms like respiratory distress and low vision were palliated. Reassessment by CT confirmed treatment response. In case report 2, clinically, visus disorders had already improved 2 weeks after beginning treatment. CT showed pulmonary, nodal, and hepatic response. Stability of bone metastases occurred after 2 months. In addition, ocular ultrasonography documented the regression of previously reported lesions confirmed treatment response. LESSONS Alectinib works very well in intracranial metastases and is assumed to be so on the ocular ones as well, with benefit for the patient in quality of life.","Gozzi, Elisa; Angelini, Francesco; Rossi, Luigi; Leoni, Valentina; Trenta, Patrizia; Cimino, Giuseppe; Tomao, Silverio",Medicine,182,19

In this study, a mouse model combining disease with syndrome of human coronavirus pneumonia with pestilence attacking the lung syndrome was used to evaluate the effectiveness of Reyanning Mixture to provide animal experimental support for clinical application. Mice were divided into normal group, 229 E infection group, cold-dampness group, cold-dampness+229 E infection group(the model group), Reyanning high and low dose groups. The cold-dampness group, cold-dampness+229 E infection group, two Reyanning groups were given cold and damp stimulation for 7 days. On the 5 th day, the 229 E infection group, cold-dampness+229 E infection group, and two Reyanning groups were infected with HCoV-229 E virus. Reyanning was administered for 3 days, starting from the day of infection. Blood was collected on the 4 th day and the lung tissue was dissected to calculate the lung index and inhibition rate; flow cytometry was used to detect the percentage of T and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood; RT-PCR was used to detect the nucleic acid virus load in lung tissue; ELISA was used to detect motilin and gastrin in serum, and inflammatory factors TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10 in lung tissue proteins. Reyanning Mixture could reduce the lung index(P<0.01) of coronavirus pneumonia mice with pestilence attacking the lung; it could significantly increase the percentage of CD8~+ T lymphocytes and CD4~+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of model mice(P<0.05, P<0.01). The low dose of Reyanning could effectively increase the percentage of total B lymphocytes(P<0.05), reduce virus load in lung tissue of model mice(P<0.01), reduce the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10 in the lung tissue of model mice(P<0.01), reduce the content of motilin in the serum of model mice(P<0.01). Reyanning Mixture convey a better effect in treating coronavirus pneumonia mice with pestilence attacking the lung. It manifested obvious effects in improving lung lesions, enhancing the gastrointestinal function of mice, improving the autoimmune function of mice, and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors in vivo, which could provide evidences for clinical research.","Bao, Lei; Shi, Yu-Jing; Geng, Zi-Han; Sun, Jing; Zhao, Rong-Hua; DU, Cheng-Qiang; Chu, Ya-Jun; Cui, Xiao-Lan",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,182,1

The good news is that interventions to be tested are not in short supply. Unfortunately, the human and material resources needed to conduct these trials are finite. It is essential that trials be robust and meet enrollment targets and that lower-quality studies not be permitted to displace higher-quality studies, delaying answers to critical questions. Yet, with few exceptions, existing research review bodies and processes are not designed to ensure these conditions are satisfied. To meet this challenge, we offer guidance for research institutions about how to ethically consolidate and prioritize COVID-19 clinical trials, while recognizing that consolidation and prioritization should also take place upstream (among manufacturers and funders) and at a higher level (e.g. nationally). In our proposed three-stage process, trials must first meet threshold criteria. Those that do are evaluated in a second stage to determine whether the institution has sufficient capacity to support all proposed trials. If it does not, the third stage entails evaluating studies against two additional sets of comparative prioritization criteria: those specific to the study and those that aim to advance diversification of an institution's research portfolio. To implement these criteria fairly, we propose that research institutions form COVID-19 research prioritization committees. We briefly discuss some important attributes of these committees, drawing on the authors' experiences at our respective institutions. Although we focus on clinical trials of COVID-19 therapeutics, our guidance should prove useful for other kinds of COVID-19 research, as well as non-pandemic research, which can raise similar challenges due to the scarcity of research resources.","Meyer, Michelle N; Gelinas, Luke; Bierer, Barbara E; Hull, Sara Chandros; Joffe, Steven; Magnus, David; Mohapatra, Seema; Sharp, Richard R; Spector-Bagdady, Kayte; Sugarman, Jeremy; Wilfond, Benjamin S; Lynch, Holly Fernandez",Clinical trials,182,24

Methods As part of an international research, a total of 2583 university students from Istanbul participated in an online survey, which included questions in several domains including their studies and daily life before and after the outbreak, their concerns and worries about the pandemic, their level of knowledge on COVID-19, their views on the policies implemented by the government and their institution, their attitude and practices toward the protective measures. Results Majority of the students reported to suffer from financial adversities due to the outbreak. The closure of residential facilities and the cancellation of face-to-face lectures resulted in the vast majority of the students moving back to their family home. Their daily routines were largely replaced by individual home activities, and social interactions shifted almost totally to digital platforms. They also reported high levels of anxiety and worries concerning a wide range of the possible detrimental outcomes of COVID-19, which were in close association with their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards the disease, as well as their adherence to the policy measures and their satisfaction with the policies of the government. Conclusion These results may help policymakers in better understanding the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on the life of university students, and to develop more comprehensive strategies to address their multifaceted struggles, as well as to improve their compliance with the health measures in the future.","Yorguner, Neşe; Bulut, Necati Serkut; Akvardar, Yıldız",Noro psikiyatri arsivi,182,1

Unfortunately, the mathematical formulation of numerical differentiation is typically ill-posed, and researchers often resort to an ad hoc process for choosing one of many computational methods and its parameters. In this work, we take a principled approach and propose a multi-objective optimization framework for choosing parameters that minimize a loss function to balance the faithfulness and smoothness of the derivative estimate. Our framework has three significant advantages. First, the task of selecting multiple parameters is reduced to choosing a single hyper-parameter. Second, where ground-truth data is unknown, we provide a heuristic for selecting this hyper-parameter based on the power spectrum and temporal resolution of the data. Third, the optimal value of the hyper-parameter is consistent across different differentiation methods, thus our approach unifies vastly different numerical differentiation methods and facilitates unbiased comparison of their results. Finally, we provide an extensive open-source Python library pynumdiff to facilitate easy application to diverse datasets (https://github.com/florisvb/PyNumDiff).","van Breugel, Floris; Kutz, J Nathan; Brunton, Bingni W","IEEE access : practical innovations, open solutions",182,1

METHODOLOGY The study included 153 S. maltophilia strains isolated from clinical samples sent to our hospital laboratory between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2018. The bacteria were identified and their antibiotic sensitivity was determined using the VITEK-2 automated system. PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis): The strains isolated from 34 patient clinical samples and from 1 patient bedcover were taken for PFGE examination. RESULTS The TMP/SXT and levofloxacin sensitivity of 153 S. maltophilia strains was examined. TMP/SXT resistance was determined to be 39% and levofloxacin resistance at 5%. Among 35 S. maltophilia strains, seven genotypes were identified using the PFGE method. While three strains showed a specific genotype profile, the other 32 were determined to consist of four clusters. The cluster rate was therefore 91.4% (32/35). CONCLUSIONS There was a clonal relationship between the vast majority of the 35 S. maltophilia isolates, which suggests that there was a cross-contamination problem in the hospital. One strain (#4) was identified by dendrogram analysis showed a high rate of similarity to the other strains and was determined to be the common source of the cross-contamination.","Çalışkan, Ahmet; Çopur Çicek, Ayşegül; Aydogan Ejder, Nebahat; Karagöz, Alper; Kirişci, Özlem; Kılıç, Selçuk",Journal of infection in developing countries,182,1

METHODS Adult patients older than 18 years presenting with AA were randomized into 3 groups to undergo OA, SLA, and SILA from September 2010 to May 2011. The groups were compared with regard of patient's characteristics, perioperative findings/complications, operative time, pain severity, analgesic requirement, time to oral tolerance and flatus, length of hospital stay, and cosmetic results. RESULTS A total of 75 consecutive patients enrolled in the study. Each group included 25 patients. The groups showed no significant differences in patient's characteristics. The mean operative time was significantly longer in SILA than OA with a mean difference of 7 minutes (P < 0.05). Postoperative pain after OA were significantly higher than SLA and SILA (P < 0.05). The average time to oral tolerance and flatus was significantly higher in OA than the laparoscopic groups with a mean difference of 1 and 2.5 hours (P = 0.04 and 0.023, respectively). The length of hospital stay in SLA and SILA was significantly lower than OA with a mean difference of 0.8 days (P < 0.05). There was no difference in overall complications between the groups. There was no difference between SLA and SILA in terms of surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Either SLA or SILA offer patients faster recovery period with acceptable complications than OA. Hence, laparoscopic approach might be considered as first option in the treatment of AA. However, all 3 techniques provide equivalent clinical outcomes despite the significant findings. Therefore, technique selection is based on surgeon's decision, experience, and availability of laparoscopic instruments.","Sozutek, Alper; Colak, Tahsin; Dirlik, Musa; Ocal, Koray; Turkmenoglu, Ozgur; Dag, Ahmet","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",182,1

However, they are associated with complications like late aneurysmal rupture. Additionally, flow diverters show focal structural decrease in luminal diameter without any intimal hyperplasia. This resembles a ""fish mouth"" when viewed en face. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association between flow diverter fish-mouthing and delayed-type hypersensitivity to its metal constituents. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patient records from our center between May 2010 and November 2015. A total of nine patients had flow diverter fish mouthing. A control group of 25 patients was selected. All study participants underwent prospective patch test to detect hypersensitivity to flow diverter metal constituents. Analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis and Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test variables to predict flow diverter fish mouthing. RESULTS The association between flow diverter fish mouthing and positive patch test was not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, history of allergy and maximum aneurysm size category was associated with flow diverter fish mouthing. This was further confirmed on Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. CONCLUSION The study showed statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and history of contact allergy and a small aneurysmal size. Further large-scale studies are needed to detect a statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and patch test. We recommend early and more frequent follow-up imaging in patients with contact allergy to detect flow diverter fish mouthing and its subsequent evolution.","Kocer, Naci; Mondel, Prabath Kumar; Yamac, Elif; Kavak, Ayse; Kizilkilic, Osman; Islak, Civan",Neuroradiology,182,31

RECENT FINDINGS A small but growing literature documents cases of new onset neuro-ophthalmic disease, in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 have experienced acute onset vision loss, optic neuritis, cranial neuropathies, and Miller Fisher syndrome. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk of cerebrovascular diseases that can impact the visual system. SUMMARY The literature on COVID-19 continues to evolve. Although COVID-19 primarily impacts the respiratory system, there are several reports of new onset neuro-ophthalmic conditions in COVID-infected patients. When patients present with new onset neuro-ophthalmic issues, COVID-19 should be kept on the differential. Testing for COVID-19 should be considered, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are also present. When screening general patients for COVID-19-associated symptoms, frontline physicians can consider including questions about diplopia, eye pain, pain with extraocular movements, decreased vision, gait issues, and other neurologic symptoms. The presence of these symptoms may increase the overall probability of viral infection, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are present. More research is needed to establish a causal relationship between COVID-19 and neuro-ophthalmic disease, and better understand pathogenesis.","Tisdale, Alanna K; Chwalisz, Bart",Current opinion in ophthalmology,182,19

The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society (TASC) II classification and modified Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) runoff score were used for subsequent analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed, and Fisher's exact and chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Results A total of 153 limbs of 122 patients (88.2% male, mean age: 69.1 years) underwent SFA angioplasty with stenting. The overall primary patency rates of TASC II A/B and C/D cases were 77.1% and 31.2%, respectively, at 36 months (P<0.001). The primary patency rates at 36 months using the modified SVS runoff scoring system were 64.6% and 49.8% for the good-to-compromised (≤9 points) and poor (≥10 points) runoff groups, respectively (P=0.011). Conclusion The modified SVS runoff scoring system is effective in predicting primary patency after SFA angioplasty with stenting in patients treated for claudication.","Noh, Byeong Gwan; Park, Young Mok; Choi, Jung Bum; Lee, Byoung Chul; Lee, Sang Su; Jung, Hyuk Jae",Vascular specialist international,182,1

Methods: The experimental method was used. Twelve healthy adult New Zealand long-eared rabbits were divided into normal control group and scar group, with 6 rabbits in each group. The hypertrophic scar model of long-eared rabbit was made according to the literature, and the rats in normal control group were subjected to no disposal. At 60 days after modeling, hematoxylin eosin(HE) staining was used to detect the morphology of skin tissue cells in the two groups. The mRNA expressions of miR-296 and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1) were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Human fibroblasts (HFbs) were divided into psiCHECK-WT-TGF-β1+miR-296 negative control group, psiCHECK-WT-TGF-β1+miR-296 mimic group, psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-β1+miR-296 negative control group, and psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-β1+miR-296 mimic group. And the corresponding sequence were transfected respectively. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase reporter gene detection kit was used to detect the luciferase and renal luciferase expression of miR-296 and TGF-β1 in each group, and the ratio was used to reflect the gene expression level. Two batches of HFbs were used and divided into miR-296 negative control group and miR-296 mimic group, transfecting the corresponding sequence. The first batch of cells were used. At 0 (immediately), 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the cell proliferation was detected by thiazolyl blue method. The second batch of cells were used. At 24 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-β1 and collagen type I was detected by Western blotting. The number of samples in cell experiment was 3. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance factorial design, one-way analysis of variance, independent-samples t test, LSD-t test and Pearson correlation coefficient regression. Results: At 60 days after modeling, Fbs in scar group were hyperplastic and arranged abnormally; Fbs in normal control group were evenly arranged without morphological abnormality. The mRNA expression of miR-296 in scar group(0.652±0.107) was significantly lower than that in normal control group(1.192±0.121, t=5.175, P<0.01). The mRNA expression of TGF-β1 in scar group(1.467±0.065) was significantly higher than that in normal control group(1.105±0.030, t=12.410, P<0.01). Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that there was a negative correlation between the mRNA expression of miR-296 and TGF-β1(F=7.278, P<0.05), and the equation was y=-1.151x+2.066, R2=0.421. At 48 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-β1 luciferase / renal luciferase in psiCHECK-WT-TGF-β1+ miR-296 mimic group was significantly lower than that in psiCHECK-WT-TGF-β1 + miR-296 negative control group(t=35.190, P<0.01). At 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the HFbs proliferation ability in miR-296 mimic group were significantly lower than that in miR-296 negative control group(t=3.275、11.980、10.460、17.260，P<0.05 or P<0.01). At 24 h after transfection, the protein expression of TGF-β1 and type I collagen in negative control group was significantly higher than that in miR-296 mimic group(t=3.758, 29.390, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: miR-296 expression in rabbit hypertrophic scars is down-regulated; miR-296 can inhibit the proliferation of HFbs and the expression of type I collagen by down regulating the expression of TGF-β1.","Guo, B Y; Lin, F; Bai, Z M; Tao, K; Wang, H Y",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,182,12

Metabolic adaptation to a glucose shortage is essential to maintain tumor cell survival because of their high glucose requirement. This study aimed to study the hypothesis that acidosis might promote tumor survival during a glucose shortage and if so, to explore a novel drug targeting metabolic vulnerability to glucose shortage. METHODS Cell survival and bioenergetics metabolism were assessed in lung cancer cell lines. Our in-house small-molecule compounds were screened to identify those that kill cancer cells under low-glucose conditions. Cytotoxicity against non-cancerous cells was also assessed. Tumor growth was evaluated in vivo using a mouse engraft model. RESULTS Acidosis limited the cellular consumption of glucose and ATP, causing tumor cells to enter a metabolically dormant but energetically economic state, which promoted tumor cell survival during glucose deficiency. We identified ESI-09, a previously known exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EAPC) inhibitor, as an anticancer compound that inhibited cancer cells under low-glucose conditions, even when associated with acidosis. Bioenergetic studies showed that independent of EPAC inhibition, ESI-09 was a safer mitochondrial uncoupler than a classical uncoupler and created a futile cycling of mitochondrial respiration leading to decreased ATP production, increased ATP dissipation, and fuel scavenging. Accordingly, ESI-09 exhibited more cytotoxic effects under low-glucose conditions than under normal glucose conditions. ESI-09 was also more effective than actively proliferating cells on quiescent glucose-restricted cells. Cisplatin showed opposite effects. ESI-09 inhibited tumor growth in lung-cancer engraft mice. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the acidosis-induced promotion of tumor survival during glucose shortage and demonstrates that ESI-09 is a novel potent anticancer mitochondrial uncoupler that targets a metabolic vulnerability to glucose shortage even when associated with acidosis. The higher cytotoxicity under lower than normal glucose conditions suggests that ESI-09 is safer than conventional chemotherapy, can target the metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells to low-glucose stress, and is applicable to many cancer cell types.","Maeda, Yuki; Kikuchi, Ryota; Kawagoe, Junichiro; Tsuji, Takao; Koyama, Nobuyuki; Yamaguchi, Kazuhiro; Nakamura, Hiroyuki; Aoshiba, Kazutetsu",Molecular metabolism,182,20

Second, we expect it to act as an up-to-date reference of recent developments related to IQA. Finally, we want it to highlight a non-exhaustive, yet representative set of showcase examples about how to use IQA to shed light in different chemical problems. To accomplish this, we start by providing a brief context to justify the development of IQA as a real space alternative to other existent energy partition schemes of the non-relativistic energy of molecules. We then introduce a self-contained algebraic derivation of the methodological IQA ecosystem as well as an overview of how these formulations vary with the level of theory employed to obtain the molecular wavefunction upon which the IQA procedure relies. Finally, we review the several applications of IQA as examined by different research groups worldwide to investigate a wide variety of chemical problems.","Guevara-Vela, José Manuel; Francisco, Evelio; Rocha-Rinza, Tomás; Martín Pendás, Ángel",Molecules,182,31

Among surgical procedures, the appendectomy is one of those targeted for early adoption of new minimally invasive surgical techniques. To date, however, only a limited number of case series have been reported. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-site laparoscopic appendectomy (SSLA) compared with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA). METHODS The study enrolled 43 patients who consecutively received laparoscopic appendectomy and divided them into SSLA and CLA groups. The clinical characteristics and short-term operative outcomes of these patients were reviewed and compared. RESULTS The 23 patients receiving SSLA did not differ from the 20 patients receiving CLA in terms of clinical characteristics including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), location of appendix, and severity of inflammation. Likewise, operation times and postoperative complication rates did not differ between the two groups. Short-term operative outcomes such as visual analog pain score and hospital stay were not different. The incision was shorter for SSLA (22.9 ± 3.9 mm) than for CLA (29.0 ± 3.0 mm) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results of the current study suggest that SSLA is a feasible surgical alternative to CLA with an equivalent level of safety. The data also suggest that SSLA results in better cosmetic outcomes than CLA. Data from larger research studies are necessary to confirm these results and validate the use of SSLA over CLA.","Cho, Min-Soo; Min, Byung Soh; Hong, Young-Ki; Lee, Woo-Jung",Surgical endoscopy,182,19

However, despite the theoretical advantages of minor wound complications and cosmetic results, SILC usually requires a larger incision, which may increase the incidence of incisional hernias. This study evaluated SILC and standard multiport cholecystectomy with respect to perioperative outcomes, hospital stay, cosmetic results, and postoperative complications, including the 5-year incisional hernia rate. METHODS A cohort study was performed with patients who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery for noncomplicated cholelithiasis at our hospital between July 2009 and June 2011. During the study period, there were 45 nonselected patients who underwent SILC, and these patients were compared with a control group of 140 patients who underwent LC using the standard three-trocar technique during the same period. Both patient groups were comparable in age, gender, BMI and ASA classification. RESULTS The mean follow-up was 58.7 ± 10.9 (range 3-80) months. There were no differences between groups in terms of hospital stay, rate and severity of complications, wound infection, and patient cosmetic satisfaction. However, the operating time (57.8 versus 35.2 min) and long-term incisional hernia rate (13.3% versus 4.7%) were significantly higher in the SILC group. CONCLUSION SILC is associated with a statistically significantly higher long-term incisional hernia rate at the umbilical port site than the standard multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our data show there was no relevant advantage regarding the postoperative course, hospital stay or cosmetic satisfaction. To date, widespread use of SILC cannot be recommended.

METHODS We randomly assigned eligible patients who had received intravenous t-PA within 3 hours after symptom onset to receive additional endovascular therapy or intravenous t-PA alone, in a 2:1 ratio. The primary outcome measure was a modified Rankin scale score of 2 or less (indicating functional independence) at 90 days (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). RESULTS The study was stopped early because of futility after 656 participants had undergone randomization (434 patients to endovascular therapy and 222 to intravenous t-PA alone). The proportion of participants with a modified Rankin score of 2 or less at 90 days did not differ significantly according to treatment (40.8% with endovascular therapy and 38.7% with intravenous t-PA; absolute adjusted difference, 1.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.1 to 9.1, with adjustment for the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score [8-19, indicating moderately severe stroke, or ≥20, indicating severe stroke]), nor were there significant differences for the predefined subgroups of patients with an NIHSS score of 20 or higher (6.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.4 to 18.1) and those with a score of 19 or lower (-1.0 percentage point; 95% CI, -10.8 to 8.8). Findings in the endovascular-therapy and intravenous t-PA groups were similar for mortality at 90 days (19.1% and 21.6%, respectively; P=0.52) and the proportion of patients with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 30 hours after initiation of t-PA (6.2% and 5.9%, respectively; P=0.83).

One study compared quality of life after these 2 procedures and found no difference. The purpose of our study was to re-evaluate the postoperative quality of life in LAGB and SG patients at a military teaching hospital in the United States. METHODS A retrospective review of 108 consecutive laparoscopic restrictive bariatric procedures performed within 15 months at a Department of Defense hospital was conducted. Of these 108 patients, 69 had undergone laparoscopic vertical SG and 39 LAGB. A validated quality of life questionnaire (Bariatric Quality of Life) was conducted a mean of 9.3 ± 3.2 months (range 5-16) postoperatively. The weight loss and standard laboratory parameters were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS The quality of life assessment revealed significantly better scores after SG than after LAGB (66.5 versus 57.9, P = .0002). The excess weight loss and excess body mass index loss at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were significantly greater in the laparoscopic SG group. The patients demonstrated a clear preference over time for SG once it was offered. CONCLUSION Early postoperative quality of life was superior after SG than after LAGB. SG also resulted in superior early excess weight loss. In a practice not constrained by reimbursement, these findings were associated with increased patient choice of SG after it began to be offered.","Alley, Joshua B; Fenton, Stephen J; Harnisch, Michael C; Tapper, Donovan N; Pfluke, Jason M; Peterson, Richard M",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,182,17

Certain patient groups are considered high risk for the development of CD, including, but not limited to, those with chromosomal disorders such as Turner syndrome (TS). Here, we present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis that aims to comprehensively summarise the literature, and quantitatively estimate the weighted strength of the association between TS and CD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 guidelines. We will search PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase databases for relevant articles. Variant and broad search terms will be selected for identifying epidemiological studies reporting on the crude and/or adjusted association between TS and CD. Retrieved citations will be screened, and data from the eligible research reports against specific eligibility criteria will be extracted. We will then assess the risk of bias associated with the eligible studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The overall weighted strength of the pooled association will be quantified using the random-effects model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will use data from published literature; hence, ethical approval will not be needed. The resulting review will be the first to produce a comprehensive synthesis of the strength of the association between TS and CD. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal as well as in local and international conferences and symposiums. Results dissemination would help healthcare providers and policy-makers to make informed decisions regarding the diagnosis and management of CD in high-risk individuals.

Objective To describe the mucocutaneous findings seen in children with MIS-C during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City in 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C. Main Outcomes and Measures Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. The characterization of mucocutaneous features was verified by 2 board-certified pediatric dermatologists. Results Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range, 0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15 years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19 patients (54%). Of the 35 patients, 29 (83%) exhibited mucocutaneous changes, with conjunctival injection (n = 21), palmoplantar erythema (n = 18), lip hyperemia (n = 17), periorbital erythema and edema (n = 7), strawberry tongue (n = 8), and malar erythema (n = 6) being the most common findings. Recognition of mucocutaneous findings occurred a mean of 2.7 days (range, 1-7 days) after the onset of fever. The duration of mucocutaneous findings varied from hours to days (median duration, 5 days [range, 0-11 days]). Neither the presence nor absence of mucocutaneous findings was significantly associated with overall disease severity. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series of hospitalized children with suspected MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide spectrum of mucocutaneous findings was identified.

Healthcare personnels (HCPs) are at high risk of acquiring some emerging infections while caring for patients. We provide a review of risk factors, evidence of infection in HCPs, and prevention strategies with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus disease (Ebola), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza. RECENT FINDINGS HCP-related infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola, and SARS have been reported among 1-27%, 2.5-12%, and 11-57% of total cases, respectively. The case fatality rate of Ebola in HCPs has been reported up to 73%. The WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS were developed in 2004 and used as a template for other emerging diseases preparedness. Risks to HCPs with emerging diseases are related to inappropriate and insufficient infection control measures during an initial encounter, at the beginning of outbreak and with an overwhelming number of patient cases. To date, there are no reports of avian influenza transmission to HCPs from affected cases. SUMMARY Early and rapid detection of suspected infected patients with communicable diseases along with appropriate infection control practice, education, national and global preparedness guidelines would help to prevent disease transmission to HCPs.","Suwantarat, Nuntra; Apisarnthanarak, Anucha",Current opinion in infectious diseases,182,15

The purpose of the present study was to assess the feasibility, sensitivity, accuracy and safety of laparoscopic examination of the uterus for detecting pregnancy at an early stage, and defining the number of fetuses in surviving rat models. Female Wistar rats were subjected to a two-port laparoscopic examination of their uterus from day 6 to day 10 post-coitum (pc). Mean recovery time from anesthesia was 148 ± 66 s. A postoperative 4.0 ± 1.8% body weight loss was restored in 3.9 ± 1.3 days. Uterine bulges suggestive of underlying embryonic vesicles could be detected by day 7 pc with a 0% false-negative diagnosis. Comparison of the number of laparoscopically defined uterine bulges (fetal counts) with litter size revealed a 0% underestimation rate of fetal counts, and a 42.9-87.5% overestimation rate from day 7 to day 10 pc. In conclusion, the present study introduced the laparoscopic examination of the uterus and showed it to be a feasible, reliable and safe method of early pregnancy diagnosis in the laboratory rat by day 7 pc.","Ypsilantis, Petros; Somalou, Paraskevi; Panidou, Eleni; Simopoulos, Constantinos",Laboratory animals,182,5

New geochronologic studies have further constrained the ages of the fossil-bearing beds, and recent investigations on Early Cretaceous tectonic settings have provided much new information for understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of the biota and dispersal pattern of its members. Notably, the occurrence of the Jehol Biota coincides with the initial and peak stages of the North China craton destruction in the Early Cretaceous, and thus the biotic evolution is related to the North China craton destruction. However, it remains largely unknown how the tectonic activities impacted the development of the Jehol Biota in northeast China and other contemporaneous biotas in neighboring areas in East and Central Asia. It is proposed that the Early Cretaceous rift basins migrated eastward in the northern margin of the North China craton and the Great Xing'an Range, and the migration is regarded to have resulted from eastward retreat of the subducting paleo-Pacific plate. The diachronous development of the rift basins led to the lateral variations of stratigraphic sequences and depositional environments, which in turn influenced the spatiotemporal evolution of the Jehol Biota. This study represents an effort to explore the linkage between terrestrial biota evolution and regional tectonics and how plate tectonics constrained the evolution of a terrestrial biota through various surface geological processes.","Zhou, Zhonghe; Meng, Qingren; Zhu, Rixiang; Wang, Min",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,182,16

METHODS The prospective data of 221 patients (183 women, 38 men) who underwent thyroid operation with intraoperative neuromonitoring for exploration of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve were evaluated retrospectively. The surface endotracheal tube-based Medtronic NIM3 (Medtronic, Jacksonville, FL) intraoperative neuromonitoring device was used. The function of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve was evaluated by cricothyroid muscle twitch. Additionally, the contribution of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve to vocal cord adduction was evaluated using electromyographic records. RESULTS A total of 374 (95.2%) of 393 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified; 145 (36.9%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified visually before being stimulated with a probe, and 130 (33.1%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified visually after being identified with a probe. Although 99 (25.2%) external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves were identified with a probe, they were not visualized. Intraoperative neuromonitoring provided meaningful contributions to visual (P = .001) and functional (P = .001) identification of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Positive electromyographic responses were recorded from 257 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves (68.7%). After the patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy were excluded, voice changes were detected in 6 (3.3%) of 184 patients with identified external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves and 3 (20%) of 15 patients in whom at least 1 external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve could not be identified with intraoperative neuromonitoring. CONCLUSION Intraoperative neuromonitoring provided an important contribution to the visual and functional identification of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is a helpful adjunct for identifying the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.","Uludag, Mehmet; Aygun, Nurcihan; Kartal, Kinyas; Besler, Evren; Isgor, Adnan",Surgery,182,19

The Howard Brown Health organization has rapidly expanded to include COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and linkage to resources since the first cases were identified in Chicago, Illinois. COVID-19 is penetrating the most vulnerable networks in the United States; existing inequities are widening as community resources and organizations have had to place services on hold.Here we address several questions that arise as organizations build capacity for contact tracing, including questions involving the potential impact of contact tracing, stakeholders who could be involved, the timing of contact tracing deployment, and the impact potential for digital technology.Contact tracing is critical at later stages of epidemic decline given the potential for isolated outbreaks as larger events, schools, stadiums, and festivals reopen. Local contact tracing efforts can have other indirect benefits with respect to limiting transmission, such as increasing testing rates and addressing structural barriers through provision of life-saving resources and access to crucial social support.

To assess the role of vIRFs during de novo infection, we have utilized the bacterial artificial chromosome clone of wild-type RRV(17577) (WT(BAC) RRV) to generate a recombinant virus with all 8 of the vIRFs deleted (vIRF-ko RRV). The infection of primary rhesus fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with vIRF-ko RRV resulted in earlier and increased induction of type I interferon (IFN) (IFN-α/β) and type II IFN (IFN-γ). Additionally, plasmacytoid dendritic cells maintained higher levels of IFN-α production in PBMC cultures infected with vIRF-ko RRV than in cultures infected with WT(BAC) RRV. Moreover, the nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated IRF-3, which is necessary for the induction of type I IFN, was also inhibited following WT(BAC) RRV infection. These findings demonstrate that during de novo RRV infection, vIRFs are inhibiting the induction of IFN at the transcriptional level, and one potential mechanism for this is the disruption of the activation and localization of IRF-3.","Robinson, Bridget A; Estep, Ryan D; Messaoudi, Ilhem; Rogers, Kelsey S; Wong, Scott W",Journal of virology,182,0

Supportive KC devices may be an important tool clinicians can use to assist parents with KC. In recent years, there has been a rise in the availability of KC devices. However, the use, needs, and preferences for these supportive devices by neonatal clinicians have not been documented. PURPOSE To survey clinicians' use, needs, and preferences of KC supportive devices, and examine whether differences exist based on clinician and organizational characteristics. METHODS A cross-sectional, online survey was sent through neonatal organization Web sites, conferences, and social media. RESULTS Many clinicians (n = 68, 43%; N = 158) facilitated KC with a supportive device, with 81% of devices provided by the clinician's employer. The most important ""Must Have"" feature of a KC device was ""Safety: Reduces patient falls if caregiver sleeps or needs to use hands"" (84% of respondents) followed by washability (82%), and ""immediate, effective access to the baby"" (78%). Clinicians' responses did not differ based on hospital setting, type of unit, KC experience, or experience using a KC device. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE To support safe use of KC devices in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) clinical care, a device must hold the proper KC position consistently, allow immediate access to the infant, and hold the infant in place without the parent's hands to prevent falls. Training is needed to ensure safe device use.

We used wild, habituated chacma baboons to explore two key assumptions of behavioral ecology (i) that observers become a ""neutral"" stimulus and (ii) that habituation is ""equal"" across group members. Using flight initiation distance (FID) methods within a personality paradigm, the behavioral responses of baboons suggested that observers were not perceived as neutral but instead viewed as a high-ranking social threat. Habituation was also not equal across group members, with repeatable individual differences more important than contextual factors (e.g., habitat) in determining the distance at which baboons visually oriented or displaced from observers. A strong correlation between individual visual tolerance and displacement tolerance (i.e., convergent validity) indicated a personality trait.

Disease activity and treatment response may be difficult to assess but unlike adults outcome measures have not been developed in children. METHODS The study was performed in children (0-18 years) at the neuromuscular center of a pediatric hospital over a 3-year period. Patients were recruited prospectively as part of their routine clinical care. Demographic data, diagnosis (JMG/CMS), and the following scales were recorded at each visit: Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America class (MGFA), Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and Pediatric Myasthenia Quality of Life 15(PM-QOL15). RESULTS 33 patients (24 JMG, 9 CMS) were included in the study, 22 had two or more visits. We established known-groups validity of the MGC and PM-QOL15 scores as compared to the MGFA class. To establish concurrent validity, we constructed a ROC curve and calculated threshold values of MGC and PM-QOL15 with optimal sensitivity and specificity for identifying a patient with more severe (MGFA III or higher) disease. Finally, we demonstrated the concordance between the MGC and PM-QOL15 by their statistically significant positive Pearson's and Spearman correlations. DISCUSSION Our study suggests that MGC and PM-QOL15 are important disease outcome measures in pediatric myasthenia that are easy to administer and provide reliable assessment of disease activity in the clinic setting.

A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non-surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis. SEARCH METHODS Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long-term follow-up (≥ 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient-reported quality of life changes. Amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -16.20%, 95% CI -25.87 to -6.53; 1 study, 44 participants); clinical attachment level (CAL) (MD -0.47 mm, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.05; 2 studies, 389 participants); probing pocket depth (PD) (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.18; 2 studies, 389 participants); and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) (MD -8.06%, 95% CI -14.26 to -1.85; 2 studies, 389 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for closed pockets and BOP showed a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) favouring amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP. Metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -12.20%, 95% CI -29.23 to 4.83; 1 study, 22 participants); CAL (MD -1.12 mm, 95% CI -2.24 to 0; 3 studies, 71 participants); PD (MD -1.11 mm, 95% CI -2.84 to 0.61; 2 studies, 47 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -6.90%, 95% CI -22.10 to 8.30; 1 study, 22 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for CAL and PD showed an MICD favouring the MTZ + SRP group. Azithromycin + SRP versus SRP for chronic/aggressive periodontitis: we found no evidence of a difference in percentage of closed pockets (MD 2.50%, 95% CI -10.19 to 15.19; 1 study, 40 participants); CAL (MD -0.59 mm, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.08; 2 studies, 110 participants); PD (MD -0.77 mm, 95% CI -2.33 to 0.79; 2 studies, 110 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -1.28%, 95% CI -4.32 to 1.76; 2 studies, 110 participants) (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Amoxicillin + clavulanate + SRP versus SRP for chronic periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 21 participants for CAL (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.71); PD (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.37); and BOP (MD 0%, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Doxycycline + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 22 participants for CAL (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.11); and PD (MD -1.00 mm, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.22) was of very low certainty, with the doxycycline + SRP group showing an MICD in PD only. Tetracycline + SRP versus SRP for aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL for the tetracycline group (MD -2.30 mm, 95% CI -2.50 to -2.10; 1 study, 26 participants). Clindamycin + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 21 participants of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL (MD -1.70 mm, 95% CI -2.40 to -1.00); and PD (MD -1.80 mm, 95% CI -2.47 to -1.13) favouring clindamycin + SRP. Doxycycline + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: there was very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 27 participants of a difference in long-term CAL (MD 1.10 mm, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84); and PD (MD 1.00 mm, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.70) favouring metronidazole + SRP. Clindamycin + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 26 participants for CAL (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.95); and PD (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.78) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Clindamycin + SRP versus doxycycline + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 23 participants for CAL (MD -0.90 mm, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.18); and PD (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.58 to -0.02) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Most trials testing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and azithromycin reported adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, and metallic taste. No serious adverse events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is very low-certainty evidence (for long-term follow-up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted clearly defining the minimally important clinical difference for the outcomes closed pockets, CAL, PD, and BOP.","Khattri, Shivi; Kumbargere Nagraj, Sumanth; Arora, Ankita; Eachempati, Prashanti; Kusum, Chandan Kumar; Bhat, Kishore G; Johnson, Trevor M; Lodi, Giovanni",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,182,26

The purpose of this study is to use the electronic tongue to design the additives of the 3D printed IDTs to improve palatability. METHODS A binder jet 3D printer was used to prepare IDTs of levetiracetam. A texture analyzer and dissolution apparatus were used to predict the oral dispersion time and in vitro drug release of IDTs, respectively. The palatability of different formulations was investigated using the ASTREE electronic tongue in combination with the design of experiment and a model for masking bitter taste. Human gustatory sensation tests were conducted to further evaluate the credibility of the results. RESULTS The 3D printed tablets exhibited rapid dispersion (<30 s) and drug release (2.5 min > 90%). The electronic tongue had an excellent ability of taste discrimination, and levetiracetam had a good linear sensing performance based on a partial least square regression analysis. The principal component analysis was used to analyze the signal intensities of different formulations and showed that 2% sucralose and 0.5% spearmint flavoring masked the bitterness well and resembled the taste of corresponding placebo. The results of human gustatory sensation test were consistent with the trend of the electronic tongue evaluation. CONCLUSIONS Owing to its objectivity and reproducibility, this technique is suitable for the design and evaluation of palatability in 3D printed IDT development.","Wang, Zengming; Li, Jingru; Hong, Xiaoxuan; Han, Xiaolu; Liu, Boshi; Li, Xianfu; Zhang, Hui; Gao, Jing; Liu, Nan; Gao, Xiang; Zheng, Aiping",Pharmaceutical research,182,8

Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: ""mild"",symbolized as a ""drizzle"" of cytokines, severe as a ""storm"", and critical as a ""hurricane"". In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage. In severe phenotype, resembling a ""cytokine-release syndrome"", SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure. In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.","Bindoli, S; Felicetti, M; Sfriso, P; Doria, A",Experimental biology and medicine,182,16

A systematic query of articles published from January 2010 to July 2018 was performed. The studies were assessed for patient's age, gender, body mass index, disease type, SILS procedure, surgical procedure, incision length, operation time, rates of conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, and rates of reoperation. After an initial review, 11 reports were selected. The surgical techniques and instruments showed wide variation. The mean operation time for SILS tended to be shorter than that for multiport laparoscopic surgery (MLS). The reported rates of conversion to open surgery and postoperative complications were not very different from those reported for MLS. In conclusion, the present review suggests that the SILS technique may be feasible and safe for select patients with CD. However, because we reviewed only a few studies with small sample sizes, prospectively designed trials with a large number of patients are required to clarify the true benefits of SILS for CD.","Maeda, Kiyoshi; Nagahara, Hisashi; Shibutani, Masatsune; Fukuoka, Tatsunari; Inoue, Toru; Ohira, Masaichi",Surgery today,182,6

Therefore, a large single-center database was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy for obese patients by comparing the outcomes of normal-weight and obese patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 608 patients undergoing SILC between May 2009 and May 2015 at Osaka Police Hospital was performed, and the outcomes of obese [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2] and normal-weight patients (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2) were compared. RESULTS Thirty-eight obese patients (mean BMI 32.5 kg/m2) were compared to 362 normal-weight patients (mean BMI 22.0 kg/m2). The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores of the obese patients were significantly higher than those of normal-weight patients. The mean operative times in the normal-weight and the obese groups were 110 min vs. 127 min, respectively (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the bleeding volume and the conversion rate to a different operative procedure. Perioperative complications were seen in 6% (23/362) of the patients in the normal-weight group and 8% (3/38) of the patients in the obese group (p = 0.7). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 4.5 days for the normal-weight group and 4.4 days for the obese group (p = 0.8).

Ablation near portal pedicles and hepatic veins is challenging. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new ablation technique that does not rely on heat and, in animals, appears to be safe and effective when applied near hepatic veins and portal pedicles. This study evaluated the safety and short-term outcomes of IRE to ablate perivascular malignant liver tumors. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of patients treated with IRE between January 1, 2011 and November 2, 2011 was performed. Patients were selected for IRE when resection or thermal ablation was not indicated due to tumor location. Treatment outcomes were classified by local, regional, and systemic recurrence and complications. Local failure was defined as abnormal enhancement at the periphery of an ablation defect on post-procedure contrast imaging. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients had 65 tumors treated. Twenty-two patients (79%) were treated via an open approach and 6 (21%) were treated percutaneously. Median tumor size was 1 cm (range 0.5 to 5 cm). Twenty-five tumors were <1 cm from a major hepatic vein; 16 were <1 cm from a major portal pedicle. Complications included 1 intraoperative arrhythmia and 1 postoperative portal vein thrombosis. Overall morbidity was 3%. There were no treatment-associated mortalities. At median follow-up of 6 months, there was 1 tumor with persistent disease (1.9%) and 3 tumors recurred locally (5.7%). CONCLUSIONS This early analysis of IRE treatment of perivascular malignant hepatic tumors demonstrates safety for treating liver malignancies.

The aim was to explore symptoms of depression and anxiety in young adults over 5 years' follow-up after undergoing MBS. METHODS Beck Depression Inventory-2 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in 62 patients 1, 2, and 5 years after having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 13-18 years of age. Mental health, eating-related problems, and weight outcomes were tested for association with suicidal ideation at the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS At the 5-year follow-up, the mean score for depression was 11.4 (± 12.4), indicating minimal symptoms of depression. The mean score for anxiety was 12.82 (± 11.50), indicating mild anxiety symptoms. Still, several participants reported moderate or severe symptoms of depression (26%) and anxiety (32%). Women reported more symptoms than men (P = 0.03 and 0.04). No significant changes were found in self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety between the 1-year and the 5-year follow-up (P = 0.367 and 0.934). Suicidal ideation was reported by 16% at the 5-year follow-up. Participants reporting suicidal ideation had lost significantly less excess weight than participants without suicidal ideation (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION Five years after adolescent MBS, a substantial minority still struggles with mental health issues, and women are more burdened than men. Our results indicate an association between less optimal weight loss and suicidal ideation 5 years after MBS. The findings emphasize the importance of offering long-term follow-up and mental health treatment several years after MBS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level III, cohort study.

Biocompatible mesh allows for repair of hernias without the donor site morbidity and complications from direct repair under tension. METHODS Over a 6-month period at a Level 1 Trauma centre, four consecutive symptomatic muscle hernias were identified, two in the forearm and two in the lower limb. Three resulted from high-speed motorbike accidents, one from a mining accident. All patients had hernia repair at a minimum of 4 months post accident. A 10 × 15 cm × 1.0 mm sheet of acellular collagen matrix was fashioned to fit as an underlay of the fascia defect. Patients were clinically followed at the 2-, 6-, 12- and 26-week mark. Final phone contact was made 18 months post-operatively. RESULTS All patients were pleased with their cosmetic and functional outcomes. All patients returned to work and sport 3 months after reconstruction. CONCLUSION Symptomatic hernias as a result of trauma can be safely reconstructed with a biological mesh implant.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are adjuncts to education and support self-management optimisation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess which first line technology is most effective. METHODS Electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Web of Science) were systematically searched from 1999 to September 2020. Randomised controlled trials comparing either CSII with MDI or CGM with SMBG in adults with type 1 diabetes were included. Data were extracted in duplicate by two reviewers, and were analysed to assess individual and overall treatment effect measures. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020149915). RESULTS HbA1c was significantly reduced for CGM when compared with SMBG (Cohen's d -0.62 (95% CI -0.79 to -0.45)) and for CSII when compared with MDI (Cohen's d -0.44 (95% CI -0.67 to -0.22)). Rates of severe hypoglycaemia were significantly reduced with CGM compared with SMBG, but did not change for CSII when compared with MDI. Episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis were more likely to occur with CSII than MDI. Both CSII and CGM reduced glucose standard deviation, compared to MDI and SMBG respectively. CONCLUSIONS Both CGM and CSII remain impactful interventions compared to SMBG and MDI but, in adults with type 1 diabetes and in the contexts in which they have been studied, CGM might have a greater positive impact on glycaemic variability and severe hypoglycaemia than CSII, when added to MDI and SMBG. A head-to-head study, including patient reported outcomes, is required to explore these findings further. This article is protected by copyright.

RESEARCH QUESTION Do Japanese health care workers and the general public agree with principles of ventilator allocation developed internationally? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A 4-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess the extent of agreement or disagreement with internationally developed triage principles for rationing mechanical ventilators during pandemics. Questionnaires were distributed in person or online, and generalized linear models were used to analyze quantitative data. Free-text descriptions were qualitatively analyzed, both deductively and inductively, to compare respondent opinions with those described in previous US studies. RESULTS Of 3191 surveys distributed, 1520 were returned. Allocation of resources to maximize survival from current illness (""save the most lives"") was the most popular triage principle, with 95.8% of respondents in agreement. Allocation to ensure a minimum duration of benefit, as determined by predicted post-illness prognosis (""ensure minimum duration of benefit""), and allocation to persons who have experienced fewer life stages (""life cycle"") obtained agreement of 82.2% and 80.1%, respectively. Withdrawal and reallocation of mechanical ventilators to more appropriate patients was supported by 64.4% of respondents. Only 29.4% of respondents supported the principle of first-come, first-served access to ventilators. INTERPRETATION Most respondents supported allocation principles developed internationally and disagreed with the idea of first-come, first-served allocation during resource shortages.

To investigate potential changes in the oligomerization of virion-associated envelope proteins, we performed SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions but without thermal denaturation. This revealed the presence of SDS-resistant trimers of E1 in the context of cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc) as well as in the context of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). The formation of E1 trimers was found to depend on the coexpression of E2. To further understand the origin of E1 trimer formation, we coexpressed in bacteria the transmembrane (TM) domains of E1 (TME1) and E2 (TME2) fused to reporter proteins and analyzed the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As expected for strongly interacting TM domains, TME1-TME2 heterodimers resistant to SDS were observed. These analyses also revealed homodimers and homotrimers of TME1, indicating that such complexes are stable species. The N-terminal segment of TME1 exhibits a highly conserved GxxxG sequence, a motif that is well documented to be involved in intramembrane protein-protein interactions. Single or double mutations of the glycine residues (Gly354 and Gly358) in this motif markedly decreased or abrogated the formation of TME1 homotrimers in bacteria, as well as homotrimers of E1 in both HCVpp and HCVcc systems. A concomitant loss of infectivity was observed, indicating that the trimeric form of E1 is essential for virus infectivity. Taken together, these results indicate that E1E2 heterodimers form trimers on HCV particles, and they support the hypothesis that E1 could be a fusion protein. IMPORTANCE HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 play an essential role in virus entry into liver cells as well as in virion morphogenesis. In infected cells, these two proteins form a complex in which E2 interacts with cellular receptors, whereas the function of E1 remains poorly understood. However, recent structural data suggest that E1 could be the protein responsible for the process of fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Here we investigated the oligomeric state of HCV envelope glycoproteins. We demonstrate that E1 forms functional trimers after virion assembly and that in addition to the requirement for E2, a determinant for this oligomerization is present in a conserved GxxxG motif located within the E1 transmembrane domain. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement of E1E2 heterodimer complexes likely occurs during the assembly of HCV particles to yield a trimeric form of the E1E2 heterodimer. Gaining structural information on this trimer will be helpful for the design of an anti-HCV vaccine.","Falson, Pierre; Bartosch, Birke; Alsaleh, Khaled; Tews, Birke Andrea; Loquet, Antoine; Ciczora, Yann; Riva, Laura; Montigny, Cédric; Montpellier, Claire; Duverlie, Gilles; Pécheur, Eve-Isabelle; le Maire, Marc; Cosset, François-Loïc; Dubuisson, Jean; Penin, François",Journal of virology,182,1

The risk relative to other psychiatric disorders is not established. METHODS We used a federated electronic health records network of 66 million people including over 700,000 with bipolar disorder. We assessed incidence of a first diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and stroke, in patients at least one year after diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Rates were compared to propensity score matched cohorts of subjects with mixed disorders, recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), or schizophrenia. RESULTS Parkinson's disease was commoner in bipolar disorder compared to all three cohorts (odds ratios [OR] ranging from 1.26 to 2.65). Dementia incidence was greater in bipolar disorder than in mixed disorders (OR=1.61) or MDD (OR=1.40), but not different from schizophrenia (OR=0.96). Cerebrovascular disease and stroke were commoner in bipolar disorder than in schizophrenia (OR=1.35) or mixed disorders (OR=1.20) and equivocally raised compared to MDD. Results were robust to a wide range of confounding demographic, diagnostic, and medication risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders. CONCLUSIONS Bipolar disorder confers an elevated risk for developing neurodegenerative disorders and cerebrovascular disease compared to other major adult psychiatric disorders. The results cannot be attributed to recognised confounders. The results are consistent with neuroprogressive views of bipolar disorder.

In view of socio-economic reasons, this patient refused surgical evaluation and further medical interventions. OUTCOMES During 18-month follow up, he received no drug except for regular water intake. Fortunately, his life quality was satisfactory, and no other symptoms emerged except for mild numbness of limbs. LESSONS In univentricular dextrocardia, it is possible to keep a long-term asymptomatic period due to the slow progress of pathophysiology. In this population, regular cardiac function evaluation and avoiding dehydration may help improve the quality of life.","Shen, Lishui; Zhao, Jin; Yuan, Tingting; Li, Mengjie; Cheng, Yun",Medicine,182,1

METHODS Outcomes were compared with predicted outcomes, calculated using the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator, and with outcomes documented in NSQIP for distal pancreatectomy. For illustrative purposes, data are presented as median (mean ± SD). RESULTS Patients who underwent robotic distal pancreatectomy were of age 67 (63 ± 13.4) years with a BMI of 29 (29 ± 6.3) kg/m2, with 49% being women. Operative duration was 242 (265 ± 112.2) minutes and estimated blood loss was 110 (211 ± 233.9) mL. Predicted outcomes were similar to those reported in NSQIP. Our actual outcomes were significantly superior to the predicted outcomes for serious complication, any complication, surgical site infection, sepsis, and length of stay. Compared to NSQIP outcomes, our actual outcomes for serious complication, any complication, surgical site infection, sepsis, and delayed gastric emptying were significantly superior. Twelve percent of operations were converted to ""open."" There were 3 deaths within 30 days, similar to predicted outcomes. Deaths were due to sepsis (2) and respiratory failure (1). CONCLUSION Our patients' predicted outcomes were the same as national outcomes; our patients were not a select group. However, their actual outcomes were like or significantly superior than those predicted by NSQIP or reported in NSQIP. We believe that the robot has the future of distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy.","Rosemurgy, Alexander S; Luberice, Kenneth; Krill, Emily; Castro, Miguel; Espineira, Gabriel Rivera; Sucandy, Iswanto; Ross, Sharona",The American surgeon,182,33

The primary aim of this paper was to assess the alignment of dietary assessment and symptom-reporting capture periods in diet-related studies on IBS or FD in adults. Secondary aims were to compare the degree of alignment, validity of symptom-reporting tools and reported significant associations between food ingestion and symptoms. A five-database systematic literature search resulted in 40 included studies, from which data were extracted and collated. The food/diet and symptom capture periods matched exactly in 60% (n = 24/40) of studies, overlapped in 30% (n = 12/40) of studies and were not aligned in 10% (n = 4/40) of studies. Only 30% (n = 12/40) of studies that reported a significant association between food and global gastrointestinal symptoms used a validated symptom-reporting tool. Of the thirty (75%) studies that reported at least one significant association between individual gastrointestinal symptoms and dietary intake, only four (13%) used a validated symptom tool. Guidelines to ensure that validated symptom-reporting tools are matched with fit-for-purpose dietary assessment methods are needed to minimise discrepancies in the alignment of food and symptom tools, in order to progress functional gastrointestinal disorder research.","Duncanson, Kerith; Burrows, Tracy; Keely, Simon; Potter, Michael; Das, Gayatri; Walker, Marjorie; Talley, Nicholas J",Nutrients,182,20

Mortality is high in COVID pneumonia and it is the highest among the frailest. COVID could be particularly serious in patients with severe acquired brain injury (SABI), such as those with a disorder of consciousness. We here describe a cohort of patients with a disorder of consciousness exposed to SARS-CoV-2 early after their SABI. Materials and methods: The full cohort of 11 patients with SABI hospitalized in March 2020 in the IRCCS Fondazione Don Gnocchi rehabilitation (Milan, Italy) was recruited. Participants received SARS-CoV-2 testing and different clinical and laboratory data were collected. Results: Six patients contracted SARS-CoV-2 and four of them developed the COVID. Of these, one patient had ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan, while the remaining three developed consolidations. No patient died and the overall respiratory involvement was mild, requiring in the worst cases low-flow oxygen. Conclusions: Here we report the clinical course of a cohort of patients with SABI exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The infection spread among patients and caused COVID in some of them. Unexpectedly, COVID was moderate, caused at most mild respiratory distress and did not result in fatalities.","Caronni, Antonio; Liaci, Emanuele; Bianchi, Anna; Viganò, Alessandro; Marenco, Francesco; Comanducci, Angela; Cabrini, Daniela Maria; Meloni, Mario; Alberoni, Margherita; Farina, Elisabetta; Bianco, Mariangela; Galeri, Silvia; Devalle, Guya; Navarro, Jorge",Brain injury,182,12

METHODS To be included, studies had to examine the impact of prolonged sitting lasting < 24 h in apparently healthy males or females of any age. Studies were identified from searches of the MEDLINE, CINAHL and SportDISCUS databases on July 6, 2016. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist; publication bias was assessed via funnel plot. RESULTS Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; of these, 20 were included in the meta-analysis, which compared prolonged sitting to the effects of interrupting sitting with regular activity breaks on postprandial glucose, insulin and triglycerides. When compared to prolonged sitting, regular activity breaks lowered postprandial glucose (d = - 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.50 to - 0.21) and insulin (d = - 0.37, 95% CI - 0.53 to - 0.20), but not triglyceride responses (d = 0.06, 95% CI - 0.15 to 0.26). Subgroup analyses indicated reductions in postprandial triglyceride responses only occurred 12-16 h after the intervention. The magnitude of the reductions in glucose, insulin or triglyceride response was not modified by the intensity of the activity breaks, the macronutrient composition of the test meal, or the age or body mass index of participants. CONCLUSION Prolonged sitting results in moderate elevations in postprandial glucose and insulin responses when compared to sitting interrupted with activity breaks.

The insertion of a bronchoscope into an endotracheal tube (ETT) affects resistance, flow, and alveolar pressure. To improve airway management and ventilation during percutaneous tracheostomy, we developed a double lumen endotracheal tube (DLET). The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the linear constant of the Rohrer equation (K1), the nonlinear constant of the Rohrer equation (K2), the inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance, and ventilatory and airway pressures using the DLET with different standard sized ETTs. METHODS A trachea and lung model was used to compare the DLET to ETTs with 7, 7.5, and 8 mm inner diameters with and without a bronchoscope (4.5 mm external diameter), and 4 and 5 mm inner diameter ventilation tubes (F4, F5) of a translaryngeal tracheostomy. For each device, the pressure drop across the device and the Rohrer equation linear constant (K1) and nonlinear constant (K2) were calculated during a continuous flow of 10-90 L/min, the inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance values were calculated during volume controlled mechanical ventilation, and respiratory airway pressure values were calculated during volume and pressure controlled mechanical ventilation. RESULTS DLET had lower K2, pressure drop, and inspiratory and expiratory airway resistance compared with conventional ETTs plus fiberoptic bronchoscope. Furthermore, during mechanical ventilation, DLET had a lower value of peak pressure, mean pressure, and intrinsic PEEP than the other ETTs plus fiberoptic bronchoscope. CONCLUSIONS Use of the DLET during percutaneous dilational tracheostomy allows fiberoptic bronchoscopy without imposing excessive airway resistance. Reduced tube resistance during this procedure may confer additional safety in what is well known to be a hazardous procedure.","Vargas, Maria; Servillo, Giuseppe; Tessitore, Gaetano; Aloj, Fulvio; Brunetti, Iole; Arditi, Enrico; Salami, Dorino; Kacmarek, Robert M; Pelosi, Paolo",Respiratory care,182,1

When these professionals have experienced suffering and psychological depletion, they have been held accountable for this suffering, adopting an individualistic and reductionist viewpoint focused only on the professional. This approach has become obsolete due to its proven ineffectiveness, especially from an ethics of responsibility and organization viewpoint. CONTEXT The psychological well-being of the healthcare worker (and its opposites: suffering, exhaustion, and disenchantment) is advantageous to the professional's commitment to the institution, to their work performance, and to their personal life. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to reflect on the psychological suffering of the palliative care professional. METHOD We will reflect on the three levels of responsibility that influence such suffering (micro-meso-macro-ethical; worker-environment-institution).

Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. An I-gel was inserted to secure the airway; however, the fitting did not work properly, so the patient was intubated. The operation was completed without any major problems, and the intubated patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.

We aimed at evaluating the impact of vitamin D levels on the biomarkers of acute-phase response, inflammation and glucose metabolism in a large cohort of diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography were included. Diabetes mellitus was defined as previous diagnosis, specific treatment administration (oral drug or insulin), fasting glycaemia > 6.99 mmol/l or HbA1c > 48 mmol/l. Glucose parameters, white blood cells, Neutrophyl-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and vitamin D were measured at admission. Vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON® Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc). RESULTS We included diabetic 1472 patients and 2499 non diabetic patients, that were divided according to vitamin D tertiles. Among diabetic patients, lower levels of vitamin D were associated with female gender, (p=0.02), obesity (p=0.004), active smoking and acute presentation (p<0.001) and with a more atherogenic metabolic profile. The levels of white blood cells, leukocytes subfamilies, and inflammatory parameters significantly correlated with vitamin D levels in both patients with and without diabetes (diabetic: p=0.012 for WBC, p=0.004 for NLR and p<0.001 for MLR and C-reactive protein, non-diabetic: p<0.001 for WBC; NLR, MLR and C reactive protein, respectively). Among diabetic patients, results were confirmed at multivariate analysis with no significant interaction according to glycemic control. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that, among patients with cardiovascular disease, vitamin D deficiency is associated with metabolic dysregulation and with an elevation of cellular and humoral inflammatory parameters, especially among diabetics, although not being dependent from glycaemic control.","Verdoia, Monica; Nardin, Matteo; Rolla, Roberta; Negro, Federica; Gioscia, Rocco; Saghir Afifeh Arraa, Maddalena; Viglione, Filippo; Suryapranata, Harry; Marcolongo, Marco; De Luca, Giuseppe",European journal of clinical investigation,182,24

DESIGN Cross-sectional study of patients with good (excess body mass index lost (EBL) >60%) and poor weight loss response (EBL <50%) >12 months after RYGB and a lean control group matched for age and gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen patients with good weight loss response, 17 patients with poor weight loss response, and eight control subjects were included in the study. Participants underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, indirect calorimetry and a 9 h multiple-meal test with measurements of glucose, insulin, total bile acids (TBA), glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, peptide YY3-36 (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), ghrelin, neurotensin and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) as well as assessment of early dumping and appetite. RESULTS Suppression of hunger was more pronounced in the good than the poor responders in response to the multiple-meal test (P=0.006). In addition, the good responders had a larger release of GLP-1 (P=0.009) and a greater suppression of ghrelin (P=0.037) during the test, whereas the postprandial secretion of CCK was highest in the poor responders (P=0.005). PYY, neurotensin, PP and TBA release did not differ between the RYGB-operated groups. Compared with control subjects, patients had exaggerated release of GLP-1 (P<0.001), PYY (P=0.008), CCK (P=0.010) and neurotensin (P<0.001). Early dumping was comparable in the good and poor responders, but more pronounced than in controlled subjects. Differences in resting energy expenditure between the three groups were entirely explained by differences in body composition. CONCLUSION Favorable meal-induced changes in hunger and gut hormone release in patients with good compared with poor weight loss response support the role of gut hormones in the weight loss after RYGB.","Dirksen, C; Jørgensen, N B; Bojsen-Møller, K N; Kielgast, U; Jacobsen, S H; Clausen, T R; Worm, D; Hartmann, B; Rehfeld, J F; Damgaard, M; Madsen, J L; Madsbad, S; Holst, J J; Hansen, D L",International journal of obesity,182,30

In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), and the time when the number of daily confirmed cases and patients treated in hospital becomes zero. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at the early stage of the outbreak. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Methods: We first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results: Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-early March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. Conclusions: The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.","Wang, Huiwen; Zhang, Yanwen; Lu, Shan; Wang, Shanshan",F1000Research,182,1

Here we identify properties of hypoglossal motor output to the tongue musculature. Tongue motor control is critical to the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea, a common and serious sleep-related breathing disorder. Studies were performed on mice expressing a light sensitive cation channel exclusively on cholinergic neurons (ChAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP). Discrete photostimulations under isoflurane-induced anesthesia from an optical probe positioned above the medullary surface and hypoglossal motor nucleus elicited discrete increases in tongue motor output, with the magnitude of responses dependent on stimulation power (P < 0.001, n = 7) and frequency (P = 0.002, n = 8, with responses to 10 Hz stimulation greater than for 15-25 Hz, P < 0.022). Stimulations during REM sleep elicited significantly reduced responses at powers 3-20 mW compared to non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and wakefulness (each P < 0.05, n = 7). Response thresholds were also greater in REM sleep (10 mW) compared to non-REM and waking (3 to 5 mW, P < 0.05), and the slopes of the regressions between input photostimulation powers and output motor responses were specifically reduced in REM sleep (P < 0.001). This study identifies that variations in photostimulation input produce tunable changes in hypoglossal motor output in-vivo and identifies REM sleep specific suppression of net motor excitability and responsivity.","Aggarwal, Jasmin A; Liu, Wen-Ying; Montandon, Gaspard; Liu, Hattie; Hughes, Stuart W; Horner, Richard L",Scientific reports,182,19

While seizures in the rat lead to more cortical area devoted to simple cortical forelimb movement representations (motor maps) assessed using short-duration intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), the effect of seizures on complex movements derived with long-duration ICMS is unknown. Further, the relationship between motor map expression and motor impairment is not well understood. We used long-duration ICMS in the rat to test the hypothesis that repeated seizure activity (cortical kindling) increases the extent of overlapping cortical representation where multiple forelimb movements are evoked to stimulation. Cortical kindling (n = 7) significantly expanded (100%) forelimb motor maps characterized by a proportional increase in both complex and simple movement representation areas, and significantly increased (285%) overlapping forelimb representation compared to sham-kindled controls (n = 5). In a second experiment, motor maps were derived with long-duration ICMS under acute cortical application of bicuculline (n = 6) to reduce intracortical inhibition or saline control (n = 10). Bicuculline also significantly expanded forelimb motor maps (108%) but without increasing representational overlap. Moreover, expanded map areas in bicuculline rats evoked qualitatively distinct forelimb movements to long-duration, but not short-duration (n = 5), ICMS that were truncated. Our evidence indicates that motor map expansion following repeated experimental seizures is associated with reduced segregation between cortical movement representations that is not entirely due to reduced cortical inhibition but may contribute to interictal motor deficits in some individuals with epilepsy.","Brown, Andrew R; Coughlin, Gerard M; Teskey, G Campbell",Neuroscience,182,7

In recent years, TCoV has been increasingly recognized in North America as an important pathogen of young turkeys, resulting in economic loss due to impaired growth and poor feed conversion. While the epidemiology and pathogenesis of TCoV have been extensively studied, TCoV remains one of the least characterized of the known coronaviruses. Avian and mammalian coronaviruses have been subdivided into distinct antigenic/genotypic groups; however, classification of TCoV has been controversial. Previous studies indicated that TCoV was closely related to bovine coronavirus and other group 2 mammalian coronaviruses, but more recent antigenic and genome sequence analyses contradict these findings and, instead, provide evidence that TCoV is closely related to avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Additionally, experimental studies have indicated that the host range of TCoV, once thought to be restricted to turkeys, includes chickens. These studies have raised additional questions regarding the classification of TCoV; particularly, whether IBV and TCoV are taxonomically distinct viruses, or whether TCoV is merely a variant of IBV. Sequence analyses of TCoV have given credence to the idea that TCoV is a variant of IBV, as these studies have shown that TCoV and IBV are very closely related. However, these studies have been limited to only three TCoV strains and relatively small portions of the TCoV genome. TCoV is readily distinguished from IBV based on antigenic and biological differences, and these differences suggest that TCoV should be considered a distinct virus species. Additional studies will be needed to better define the relationship between TCoV and IBV, and to resolve this taxonomic question. Based on our current understanding, it seems prudent to consider TCoV and IBV as distinct virus species that share a close phylogenetic relationship and together comprise group 3 of the coronavirus major antigenic groups.","Guy, J S",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,182,28

Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for a few antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. However, while heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have been recently isolated from phage display libraries, it is not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response to influenza virus infection or vaccine. Here we report that, following vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing H1 and H3 influenza virus subtypes, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including the pandemic A/California/07/09 H1N1 isolate. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. With the exception of a mAb that bound to the HA globular head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA stem region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with influenza viruses representative of different subtypes. These findings reveal that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.","Corti, Davide; Suguitan, Amorsolo L; Pinna, Debora; Silacci, Chiara; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca M; Vanzetta, Fabrizia; Santos, Celia; Luke, Catherine J; Torres-Velez, Fernando J; Temperton, Nigel J; Weiss, Robin A; Sallusto, Federica; Subbarao, Kanta; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",The Journal of clinical investigation,182,11

METHODS Between March 2016 and January 2019, 66 rectal cancer patients who completed biplane TRUS plus UE and CEUS for preoperative workup and were treated by primary total mesorectal excision (TME) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The accuracy of TRUS plus UE and CEUS in all T staging of rectal cancer was 69.7%. The highest accuracy was achieved in the T3 stage (87.5%), while it was 71.4 and 50.0% in the T1 and T2 stage, respectively. The mean sizes of uT1-T2 lesions and uT3-T4 lesions were 30.0 ± 10.6 mm (range, 10.0-55.0) and 40.2 ± 11.2 mm (range, 14.0-57.0), respectively (p < 0.001). According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to predict pT stages (pT1,2 vs. pT3), the optimal cut-off value of lesions in greatest dimension was 28.5 mm by TRUS with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.769, and the optimal cut-off values of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistive index (RI) were 18.8 cm/sec and 0.645, respectively. The AUCs of PSV and RI were 0.588 and 0.555, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Diagnostic accuracy of TRUS plus UE and CEUS in T staging of rectal cancer does not reach the excellent published study results, especially for patients with early rectal cancer.

Although angiotensin II (AngII)-infused ApoE-/- mice have been widely used to study aortic aneurysm and dissection, early morphofunctional alterations preceding the onset of these conditions remain unknown. The goal of this study was to unveil early morphofunctional changes underlying the onset of aneurysm and dissection. At 3 days post-AngII infusion, suprarenal abdominal aorta presented significant volumetric dilatation and microstructural damage. Ex vivo assessment of vascular reactivity of the suprarenal dissection-prone aorta and its side branches, showed an endothelial and contractile dysfunctions that were severe in the suprarenal aorta, moderate distally, and absent in the side branches, mirroring the susceptibility to dissection of these different vascular segments. Early and specific morphofunctional changes of the suprarenal aorta may contribute to the regional onset of aortic aneurysm and dissection by exacerbating the biomechanical burden arising from its side branches.","Aslanidou, Lydia; Trachet, Bram; Sasset, Linda; Lovric, Goran; Stergiopulos, Nikolaos; Di Lorenzo, Annarita",Journal of vascular research,182,19

Remdesivir is currently being evaluated for clinical efficacy and safety in patients with COVID-19. Objective To describe the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients following treatment with remdesivir at a community hospital. Methods A retrospective review of medical records was conducted in August 2020 for all patients given remdesivir while hospitalized for severe COVID-19 between May 1 and August 19, 2020. A convenience sample of consecutive patients with treatment including remdesivir, antibiotics, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, or a combination of multiple drugs was included in the analysis. Patients receiving remdesivir were administered a 5-day treatment course. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min, those with liver function tests 5 times the normal reference range, and those who were pregnant were excluded from treatment with remdesivir. Differences in between men and women were detected with χ2 and independent samples t tests. The degree to which presenting symptoms influenced patient outcomes was analyzed with a stepwise logistic regression. Results Among the 76 patients who received remdesivir, the mean (95% confidence interval, CI) age was 63 years (59.8-66.2). Thirty-six (47.4%) were men and 40 (52.6%) were women. Forty-nine (64.5%) were white and 27 (35.5%) were nonwhite. The majority of patients (54; 71.1%) had at least 1 comorbid condition, with hypertension being the most common (43; 56.6%). The mean (95% CI) length of stay for patients who received remdesivir was 10.09 days (8.6-11.6) and the mean (95% CI) duration of oxygen therapy was 9.42 days (8.0-10.8). A total of 14 (18.4%) patients given remdesivir were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an mean (95% CI) length of stay of 9.29 days (5.6-13.0). Women administered remdesivir were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (11 [27.5%] vs 3 [8.3%]; P=.031). The mortality rate was 14 patients (18.4%), with no statistically significant difference observed between men (5; 13.9%) and women (9; 22.5%; P=.33). No significant difference was seen amongst sexes for duration of oxygen therapy (men, 8.0 days [6.2-9.8] vs women, 10.76 days [8.8-12.8]; P=.051) or length of stay (men, 8.61 days [6.7-10.5] vs women, 11.43 days [9.3-13.5]; P=.058). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled racial groups (white vs nonwhite) for in-hospital mortality, number admitted to the ICU, days spent in the ICU, duration of oxygen use, or length of stay. Conclusion Remdesivir may show clinical efficacy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in a community setting. Although this was a small-scale study with limited patients, it represents a point of reference for the use of remdesivir at other community hospitals.","Lee, Stephen; Santarelli, Anthony; Caine, Kristen; Schritter, Sarah; Dietrich, Tyson; Ashurst, John",The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,182,1

As irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly correlated with social factors, healthcare disparities are important factors in the sociocultural model of IBS. We used healthcare utilization as a lens to examine potential racial disparities in IBS. METHODS We retrospectively matched 3823 IBS minority patients who self-identified as ""Hispanic,"" ""Black,"" or ""Asian"" to white IBS controls and examined the number of patients with gastroenterology consults, gastroenterology procedures, and IBS-related Primary Care visits within each cohort from 2003 to 2017. KEY RESULTS Minority IBS patients were less likely to receive a gastroenterology consult than white IBS controls. Both Black and Asian IBS patients were more likely to have an IBS-related Primary Care visit than white IBS controls. All 3 minority IBS cohorts received significantly more gastroenterology procedures compared to white IBS controls. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Minority IBS patients are more likely to receive gastroenterology procedures than white IBS patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether increased procedure likelihood in minority IBS patients represents a communication gap between minority patients and their providers or patient preference.","Silvernale, Casey; Kuo, Braden; Staller, Kyle",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,182,28

Following intake of the drug products, gastric and duodenal fluids were aspirated and analyzed for itraconazole concentration, total content and solubilizing capacity. Release of itraconazole from the solid dispersion generated high and metastable supersaturated levels in the stomach, but the dissolved fraction in the duodenum remained extremely low (median 2.5%). After intake of the itraconazole solution, precipitation was limited in the stomach but pronounced in the small intestine. Still, the dissolved fraction of itraconazole in the duodenum (median 38%) appeared much higher than after intake of the solid dispersion, possibly explaining the improved absorption of itraconazole from the solution. As for the solid dispersion, the absorption-enabling ability of the solution appeared mainly related to increased intraluminal concentrations by means of supersaturation. Cyclodextrin-based solubilization of itraconazole occurred only in the case of limited intraluminal dilution, but did not further enhance itraconazole absorption. The obtained data will help to understand critical aspects of supersaturating drug delivery systems and act as direct reference for the optimization of in vitro simulation tools for gastrointestinal drug behavior.","Brouwers, Joachim; Geboers, Sophie; Mols, Raf; Tack, Jan; Augustijns, Patrick",International journal of pharmaceutics,182,19

We hypothesized that initiating stabilization at birth with a high O2 concentration, followed by titration, would improve breathing effort when compared to a low O2 concentration, followed by titration. Methods: In a bi-center randomized controlled trial, infants <30 weeks gestation were stabilized at birth with an initial O2 concentration of 30 or 100%, followed by oxygen titration. Primary outcome was minute volume of spontaneous breathing. We also assessed tidal volumes, mean inspiratory flow rate (MIFR) and respiratory rate with a respiratory function monitor in the first 5 min after birth, and evaluated the duration of mask ventilation in the first 10 min after birth. Pulse oximetry was used to measure heart rate and SpO2 values in the first 10 min. Hypoxemia was defined as SpO2 < 25th percentile and hyperoxemia as SpO2 >95%. 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8iPGF2α) was measured to assess oxidative stress in cord blood and 1 and 24 h after birth. Results: Fifty-two infants were randomized and recordings were obtained in 44 infants (100% O2-group: n = 20, 30% O2-group: n = 24). Minute volumes were significantly higher in the 100% O2-group (146.34 ± 112.68 mL/kg/min) compared to the 30% O2-group (74.43 ± 52.19 mL/kg/min), p = 0.014. Tidal volumes and MIFR were significantly higher in the 100% O2-group, while the duration of mask ventilation given was significantly shorter. Oxygenation in the first 5 min after birth was significantly higher in infants in the 100% O2-group [85 (64-93)%] compared to the 30% O2-group [58 (46-67)%], p < 0.001. The duration of hypoxemia was significantly shorter in the 100% O2-group, while the duration of hyperoxemia was not different between groups. There was no difference in oxidative stress marker 8iPGF2α between the groups. Conclusion: Initiating stabilization of preterm infants at birth with 100% O2 led to higher breathing effort, improved oxygenation, and a shorter duration of mask ventilation as compared to 30% O2, without increasing the risk for hyperoxia or oxidative stress.

Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) can help holistically capture the burden of homelessness, and facilitate the valuation and comparison of interventions designed to address homelessness. OBJECTIVE This study estimated utility values required to compute the QALYs associated with homelessness, and also examined individual-level characteristics that affect these values. RESEARCH DESIGN The study is cross-sectional and derived from a large national survey conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. SUBJECTS A sample of 6607 middle- and low-income adults in the United States. MEASURES A self-completion standard gamble survey was used to estimate utility values associated with homelessness. Linear regression was used to analyze the association between individual-level characteristics and these utility values. RESULTS The study estimated the average utility value associated with homelessness as 43.4% among the study participants. This implies that 1 year of life as a homeless individual is perceived to be equivalent to less than half a year of life as a stably housed individual in good health. The study also found that individuals who have experienced homelessness and financial distress value life as a homeless person considerably less than those who have not had these experiences. CONCLUSIONS The method developed in this study can be used to estimate QALYs in studies evaluating homelessness interventions, thereby establishing the societal value of these interventions and informing policy and budgetary decision-making. Future studies estimating the utility values associated with homelessness in the general population, as well as specific homeless groups, are required to provide more generalizable evidence.","Rajan, Suja S; Tsai, Jack",Medical care,182,19

In physiological conditions, tetraspanins interact with specific partner proteins in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains and regulate their subcellular localizations and function. However, the function of Tspan5 in pathological processes, particularly in cancer biology, and its clinical significance are still unclear. Here, we describe that a high expression of Tspan5 is significantly associated with some clinicopathological features including invasive length, vascular invasion, clinical stage and poor overall survival of HCC patients. Alterations of Tspan5 expression by lentivirus transductions in HCC cells demonstrated that Tspan5 promotes wound healing and cell migration in vitro and tumour metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that Tspan5 promoted cell migration and tumour metastasis by increasing the enzymatic maturation of ADAM10 and activating Notch signalling via the increase of the cleavage of the Notch1 receptor catalysed by the γ-secretase complex. Activation of Notch signalling by Tspan5 was shown to further enhance the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and actin skeleton rearrangement of tumour cells. In clinical HCC samples, Tspan5 expression is strongly correlated with many key molecules acting in Notch signalling and EMT, highlighting the role of Tspan5 in the regulation of Notch signalling, EMT and tumour metastasis of HCC. Our findings provide new insights on the mechanism of tumour metastasis and disease progression of HCC and may facilitate the development of novel clinical intervention strategies against HCC.","Xie, Qian; Guo, Huiling; He, Peirong; Deng, Huan; Gao, Yanjun; Dong, Ningning; Niu, Wenbo; Liu, Tiancai; Li, Ming; Wang, Suihai; Wu, Yingsong; Li, Ji-Liang",Molecular oncology,182,31

Their many distinct lineages fall into ""major"" and ""minor"" groups that use different cell surface receptors to enter host cells. Minor-group rhinoviruses are more immunogenic in laboratory studies, although their patterns of transmission and their cold symptoms are broadly similar to those of the major group. Here we present evolutionary evidence that minor-group viruses are also more immunogenic in humans. A key finding is that rates of amino acid substitutions at exposed sites in the capsid proteins VP2, VP3, and VP1 tend to be elevated in minor-group relative to major-group viruses, while rates at buried sites show no consistent differences. A reanalysis of historical virus watch data also indicates a higher immunogenicity of minor-group viruses, consistent with our findings about evolutionary rates at amino acid positions most directly exposed to immune surveillance. The increased immunogenicity and speed of evolution in minor-group lineages may contribute to the very large numbers of rhinovirus serotypes that coexist while differing in virulence.IMPORTANCE Most colds are caused by rhinoviruses (RVs). Those caused by a subset known as the minor-group members of rhinovirus species A (RV-A) are correlated with the inception and aggravation of asthma in at-risk populations. Genetically, minor-group viruses are similar to major-group RV-A, from which they were derived, although they tend to elicit stronger immune responses. Differences in their rates and patterns of molecular evolution should be highly relevant to their epidemiology. All RV-A strains show high rates of amino acid substitutions in the capsid proteins at exposed sites not previously identified as being immunogenic, and this increase is significantly greater in minor-group viruses. These findings will inform future studies of the recently discovered RV-C, which also appears to exacerbate asthma in adults and children. In addition, these findings draw attention to the difficult problem of explaining the long-term coexistence of many serotypes of major- and minor-group RVs.","Lewis-Rogers, Nicole; Seger, Jon; Adler, Frederick R",Journal of virology,182,24

Since early pioneering contributions, including programs such as LHASA1,7 (with reaction choices at each step made by human operator), the field has progressed greatly and there are now multiple software platforms6,8-13 capable of completely autonomous planning. Still, these programs 'think' only one step at a time and have so far been limited to relatively simple targets whose syntheses could, arguably, be designed by human chemists within minutes and without computer's help. To date, no algorithm has been able to design plausible routes to complex natural products for which significantly more far-sighted, multi-step planning is necessary14,15 and for which one cannot rely on closely related literature precedents.

METHODS The study was conducted in a tertiary-care center. All births were attended by certified nurse-midwives. Low-risk pregnant women at term gestation had intrauterine monitoring attempted during the third stage of labor. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. RESULTS Of the 36 women in the study, 19 had clear contractions recorded, 4 had unclear contractions, and 13 had flat tracings. The IUPC was useful for measuring uterine activity in a small number of women during the third stage of labor. When measured, uterine contractions were variable in strength and frequency. DISCUSSION Intrauterine pressure catheters can be used as a measurement of uterine activity during the third stage of labor and should be considered for future research about third-stage physiology. Further work is needed to determine the best procedure for placement, and IUPC use before expulsion of the placenta will not be useful in all women.

A systematic search identified 16 RCTs that fit the inclusion criteria (n = 1719 participants) in six psychiatric categories: depression, post-disaster stress, antisocial behavior, behavioral deficits in dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to rate the evidence base. Significant clinical benefit was assessed using minimal clinically important differences (MIDs). Due to heterogeneity in participants, multinutrient formulas, outcome measures, and absence of complete data, only the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) category was eligible for meta-analyses.

In survivorship research, these similar, yet different constructs are frequently used interchangeably and multiple instruments are used in to measure them. The lack of clear and consistent conceptualization and measurement can lead to diverse or contradictory interpretations. The purpose of this scoping review was to review, compare, and analyze the current conceptualization and measurements used for FCR, HA, worry, and uncertainty in the breast cancer survivorship literature to improve research and practice. Inclusion Criteria: We considered quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies of breast cancer survivors that examined FCR, HA, worry, or uncertainty in illness as a main topic and included a definition or assessment of the constructs. Methods and Analysis: The six-staged framework was used to guide the scoping review process. Searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were conducted. The principle-based qualitative analysis and simultaneous content analysis procedures were employed to synthesize and map the findings. Findings: After duplicate removal, the search revealed 3,299 articles, of which 82 studies met the inclusion criteria. Several critical attributes overlapped the four constructs, for example, all were triggered by internal somatic and external cues. However, several unique attributes were found (e.g., a sense of loss of security in the body is observed only among survivors experiencing FCR). Overall, findings showed that FCR and uncertainty in illness are more likely to be triggered by cancer-specific factors, while worry and HA have more trait-like in terms of characteristics, theoretical features, and correlates. We found that the measures used to assess each construct were on par with their intended constructs. Eighteen approaches were used to measure FCR, 15 for HA, 8 for worry, and 4 for uncertainty. Conclusion: While consensus on the conceptualization and measurement of the four constructs has not yet been reached, this scoping review identifies key similarities and differences to aid in their selection and measurement. Considering the observed overlap between the four studied constructs, further research delineating the unique attributes for each construct is warranted.","Maheu, Christine; Singh, Mina; Tock, Wing Lam; Eyrenci, Asli; Galica, Jacqueline; Hébert, Maude; Frati, Francesca; Estapé, Tania",Frontiers in psychology,182,1

Previously obtained magnetic resonance angiography was fused with intraoperative noncontrast computed tomography and live 2-dimensional fluoroscopic images. The aneurysm was successfully treated with stent-assisted coil embolization without the use of contrast. RESULTS Neurointervention without contrast was feasible, and although the presented case is one example, the imaging fusion techniques used in this case can substantially decrease the exposure to contrast and subsequent risk of renal injury during intracranial procedures. CONCLUSIONS Further development of and experience with this technique is needed to improve its safety and efficacy.","Munich, Stephan A; Theessen, Heike; Johnson, Andrew K; Lopes, Demetrius K",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,182,16

Galectin-9 is a soluble, secreted lectin that binds to glycoprotein receptors to form galectin-glycoprotein lattices on the cell surface. Whereas galectin-9 binding to specific glycoprotein receptors induces death of CD4 Th1 cells, CD4 Th2 cells are resistant to galectin-9 death due to alternative glycosylation. On Th2 cells, galectin-9 binds cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), increasing retention of PDI on the cell surface and altering the redox status at the plasma membrane. Cell surface PDI regulates integrin function on platelets and also enhances susceptibility of T cells to infection with HIV. We find that galectin-9 binding to PDI on Th2 cells results in increased cell migration through extracellular matrix via β3 integrins, identifying a unique mechanism to regulate T-cell migration. In addition, galectin-9 binding to PDI on T cells potentiates infection with HIV. We identify a mechanism for regulating cell surface redox status via a galectin-glycoprotein lattice, to regulate distinct T-cell functions.","Bi, Shuguang; Hong, Patrick W; Lee, Benhur; Baum, Linda G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,182,16

These structures can sense the environment and play key roles in migration and cell-cell interactions. The growth-retraction cycle of filopodia is a complex process exquisitely regulated by intra- and extra-cellular cues, whose nature remains elusive. Filopodia present wide variation in length, lifetime and growth rate. Here, we investigate the features of filopodia patterns in fixed prostate tumor cells by confocal microscopy. Analysis of almost a thousand filopodia suggests the presence of two different populations: one characterized by a narrow distribution of lengths and the other with a much more variable pattern with very long filopodia. We explore a stochastic model of filopodial growth which takes into account diffusion and reactions involving actin and the regulatory proteins formin and capping, and retrograde flow. Interestingly, we found an inverse dependence between the filopodial length and the retrograde velocity. This result led us to propose that variations in the retrograde velocity could explain the experimental lengths observed for these tumor cells. In this sense, one population involves a wider range of retrograde velocities than the other population, and also includes low values of this velocity. It has been hypothesized that cells would be able to regulate retrograde flow as a mechanism to control filopodial length. Thus, we propound that the experimental filopodia pattern is the result of differential retrograde velocities originated from heterogeneous signaling due to cell-substrate interactions or prior cell-cell contacts.","Senra, Daniela; Páez, Alejandra; Gueron, Geraldine; Bruno, Luciana; Guisoni, Nara",European biophysics journal : EBJ,182,16

However, the immune mechanisms that regulate learning and memory remain poorly understood. Here, we show that noninflammatory interleukin-17 (IL-17) derived from a previously unknown fetal-derived meningeal-resident γδ T cell subset promotes cognition. When tested in classical spatial learning paradigms, mice lacking γδ T cells or IL-17 displayed deficient short-term memory while retaining long-term memory. The plasticity of glutamatergic synapses was reduced in the absence of IL-17, resulting in impaired long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Conversely, IL-17 enhanced glial cell production of brain-derived neurotropic factor, whose exogenous provision rescued the synaptic and behavioral phenotypes of IL-17-deficient animals. Together, our work provides previously unknown clues on the mechanisms that regulate short-term versus long-term memory and on the evolutionary and functional link between the immune and nervous systems.","Ribeiro, Miguel; Brigas, Helena C; Temido-Ferreira, Mariana; Pousinha, Paula A; Regen, Tommy; Santa, Cátia; Coelho, Joana E; Marques-Morgado, Inês; Valente, Cláudia A; Omenetti, Sara; Stockinger, Brigitta; Waisman, Ari; Manadas, Bruno; Lopes, Luísa V; Silva-Santos, Bruno; Ribot, Julie C",Science immunology,182,1

The development of rice varieties with enhanced nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) will require a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of a plant's response to low nitrogen (N) availability. The global expression profiles of root tissues collected from low and high N treatments at different time points in two rice genotypes, Pokkali and Bengal, with contrasting responses to N stress and contrasting root architectures were examined. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Pokkali (indica) was higher than in Bengal (japonica) during low N and early N recovery treatments. Most low N DEGs in both genotypes were downregulated whereas early N recovery DEGs were upregulated. Of these, 148 Pokkali-specific DEGs might contribute to Pokkali's advantage under N stress. These DEGs included transcription factors and transporters and were involved in stress responses, growth and development, regulation, and metabolism. Many DEGs are co-localized with quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to root growth and development, chlorate-resistance, and NUE. Our findings suggest that the superior growth performance of Pokkali under low N conditions could be due to the genetic differences in a diverse set of genes influencing N uptake through the regulation of root architecture.","Subudhi, Prasanta K; Garcia, Richard S; Coronejo, Sapphire; Tapia, Ronald",International journal of molecular sciences,182,19

Since its outbreak in December 2019, the pandemic has spread to more than 200 countries, infected more than 26 million, and claimed the lives of more than 800,000 people. As a disease, COVID-19 can lead to severe and occasionally fatal respiratory problems in humans. Infection with this virus is associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, and muscle aches, and it may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment against this virus. However, the main viral protease has been recently discovered and it is regarded as an appropriate target for antiviral agents in the search for treatment of COVID-19, due to its pivotal role in polyproteins processing during viral replication. AIM Consequently, this study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs against SARA-CoV-2 through a molecular docking study. METHODS AutoDock Vina in PyRx platform was used for docking analysis against the main viral protease (Mpro) (PDB ID 6LU7), and Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp 3.0) was applied for detecting and characterizing cavities, pockets, and channels of this protein structure. RESULTS Results revealed that among the conventional antiviral drugs, the protease inhibitors, lopinavir, amprenavir, indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir, and daclatasvir showed high binding affinity and interacted with amino acid residues of the binding site. CONCLUSION In conclusion, protease inhibitors may be effective potential antiviral agents against Mpro to combat SARSCoV-2.","Mondal, Milon; Sarkar, Chandan; Jamaddar, Sarmin; Khalipha, Abul Bashar Ripon; Islam, Muhammad Torequl; Mahafzah, Azmi; Mubarak, Mohammad S",Infectious disorders drug targets,182,1

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted. One-hundred and five patients with DR were recruited. Self-care agency was assessed by the exercise of self-care agency (ESCA) scale. Depression and anxiety were assessed by the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS-D and HADS-A). Pearson or Spearman correlations were performed to assess the association between self-care agency and depression and anxiety. Stepwise multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the contribution of the sociodemographic and clinical factors to depression and anxiety. RESULTS Thirty-six (34.3%) and 43 (41.1%) patients exhibited depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Only 24 (22.9%) patients showed a high self-care agency. The ESCA total and subscale scores were negatively correlated depressive symptoms (P < 0.05). Self-care skills were negatively correlated with anxiety symptoms (P < 0.05). ESCA total score, rural residence, history of hypertension and visual acuity were associated with depression; self-care skills and diastolic blood pressure were associated with anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Self-care agency negatively correlates with depression and anxiety in patients with DR. Special attention should be paid to patients living in rural areas and/or those having a history of hypertension when assessing depression and anxiety in patients with DR. Future studies are needed to clarify the causal relationship between self-care agency and depression and anxiety.","Zhang, Bo; Wang, Qin; Zhang, Xuancan; Jiang, Li; Li, Lezhi; Liu, Bangshan",BMC ophthalmology,182,20

It is associated with unfavorable outcome after treatment with intravenous thrombolysis and after intra-arterial treatment. Whether hyperglycemia influences the effect of reperfusion treatment is unknown. We assessed whether increased admission serum glucose modifies the effect of intra-arterial treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS We used data from the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). Hyperglycemia was defined as admission serum glucose >7.8 mmol/L. The primary outcome measure was the adjusted common odds ratio for a shift in the direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days, estimated with ordinal logistic regression. Secondary outcome variable was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. We assessed treatment effect modification of hyperglycemia and admission serum glucose levels with multiplicative interaction factors and adjusted for prognostic variables. RESULTS Four hundred eighty-seven patients were included. Mean admission serum glucose was 7.2 mmol/L (SD, 2.2). Fifty-seven of 226 patients (25%) randomized to intra-arterial treatment were hyperglycemic compared with 61 of 261 patients (23%) in the control group. The interaction of either hyperglycemia or admission serum glucose levels and treatment effect on modified Rankin Scale scores was not significant (P=0.67 and P=0.87, respectively).

One of the most debated issues is the risk of complications related to the use of the prosthesis, such as esophageal erosion and postoperative dysphagia. The aim of this study is to present our short-terms results in the treatment of laparoscopic paraesophageal hiatal hernia (LPHH) with a synthetic polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate mesh (Gore Bio A(®)). METHODS From January 2011 to December 2012, 10 patients with large paraesophageal hiatal hernias and hiatal defect over 5 cm were included. Primary simple suture of the crura and additional reinforcement with a Gore Bio A(®) mesh was performed. Hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms recurrence, dysphagia and mesh-related complications were investigated. RESULTS Of the 10 patients undergoing mesh repair, there were 7 women and 3 men with a mean age of 65.5 years. All operations were completed laparoscopically. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, one patient developed a recurrent hiatal hernia (10%). There were no mesh-related complications. CONCLUSIONS The use of Gore Bio A(®) mesh for the laparoscopic repair of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias is safe and with a reasonably low recurrence rate in this short-term study.

We hypothesized that localization and burden of transmural myocardial scar verified by cardiac CT are associated with echocardiographic and clinical response to CRT. METHODS We prospectively included 140 CRT recipients undergoing preimplant cardiac CT. We assessed transmural scar, defined as hypoperfusion involving more than one-half of the myocardial wall in each LV segment using a 17-segment model. Echocardiographic nonresponse was defined as less than 5% absolute improvement in LV ejection fraction at 6 months' follow-up. Clinical nonresponse was defined as 1 or more of the following at 6 months' follow-up: death, heart failure hospitalization, or no improvement in New York Heart Association class and less than 10% increase in 6-minute walk-test distance. RESULTS Higher burden of myocardial scar was associated with echocardiographic nonresponse (adjusted odds ratio, 3.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-8.91; P = 0.045). Scar concordant or adjacent to LV pacing site was associated with echocardiographic nonresponse (adjusted odds ratio, 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-44.27; P = 0.015). No association between scar and clinical nonresponse was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS Higher scar burden and scar in proximity to the LV pacing site assessed by cardiac CT are associated with echocardiographic nonresponse to CRT. Burden and location of scar were not associated with clinical nonresponse. Further large-scale studies are needed to assess the potential association between myocardial scar detected by cardiac CT and clinical CRT outcome.","Fyenbo, Daniel Benjamin; Sommer, Anders; Kühl, J Tobias; Kofoed, Klaus F; Nørgaard, Bjarne L; Kronborg, Mads B; Bouchelouche, Kirsten; Nielsen, Jens C",Journal of computer assisted tomography,182,5

Monitoring of tidal volume (VT) is a key point in the assessment of the efficacy of home mechanical ventilation. OBJECTIVE To assess the reliability of the VT provided by 5 ventilators in a bench test. METHODS Five commercial ventilators from 4 different manufacturers were tested in pressure support mode with the help of a breathing simulator under different conditions of mechanical respiratory pattern, inflation pressure, and intentional leakage. Values provided by the built-in software of each ventilator were compared breath to breath with the VT monitored through an external pneumotachograph. Ten breaths for each condition were compared for every tested situation. RESULTS All tested ventilators underestimated VT (ranges of -21.7 mL to -83.5 mL, which corresponded to -3.6% to -14.7% of the externally measured VT). A direct relationship between leak and underestimation was found in 4 ventilators, with higher underestimations of the VT when the leakage increased, ranging between -2.27% and -5.42% for each 10 L/min increase in the leakage. A ventilator that included an algorithm that computes the pressure loss through the tube as a function of the flow exiting the ventilator had the minimal effect of leaks on the estimation of VT (0.3%). In 3 ventilators the underestimation was also influenced by mechanical pattern (lower underestimation with restrictive, and higher with obstructive). CONCLUSIONS The inclusion of algorithms that calculate the pressure loss as a function of the flow exiting the ventilator in commercial models may increase the reliability of VT estimation.","Luján, Manel; Sogo, Ana; Pomares, Xavier; Monsó, Eduard; Sales, Bernat; Blanch, Lluís",Respiratory care,182,19

No FDA approved vaccine or antiviral is available for the treatment of this infection. Zhavoronkov et al., with their generative chemistry pipeline have generated structures that can be potential novel drug-like inhibitors for COVID-19, provided they are validated. 3C-like protease (3CLP) is a homodimeric cysteine protease that is present in coronaviruses. Interestingly, 3CLP is 96.1% structurally similar between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE To evaluate interaction of generated structures with 3CLP of SARS-CoV (RCSB PDB ID: 4MDS). METHOD Crystal structure of human SARS-CoV with a non-covalent inhibitor with resolution: 1.598 Å was obtained and molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interaction with generated structures. The MM-GBSA and IFD-SP were performed to narrow down to the structures with better binding energy and IFD score. The ADME analysis was performed on top 5 hits and further MD simulation was employed for top 2 hits. RESULTS In XP docking, IFD-SP and molecular dynamic simulation studies, the top 2 hits 32 and 61 showed interaction with key amino acid residue GLU166. The structure 61, also showed interaction with HIS164. These interactions of generated structure 32 and 61, with GLU166 and HIS164 indicates the binding of selected drug within the close proximity of 3CLP. In the MD simulation the protein-ligand complex of 61 and 4MDS was found to be more stable for 10ns. CONCLUSION These identified structures can be further assessed for their antiviral activity to combat SARS-CoV and COVID-19.","Chunduru, Kiran; Sankhe, Runali; Begum, Farmiza; Sodum, Nalini; Kumar, Nitesh; Kishore, Anoop; Shenoy, Rekha R; Rao, C Mallikarjuna; Saravu, Kavitha",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),182,1

An ENGBD was performed as an initial treatment for his cholecystitis. After recovery from the cholecystitis, a SILC was performed using a SILS Port with an additional forceps. Because neither Rouviere's sulcus nor Calot's triangle could be identified with a favorable laparoscopic view, the fundus-first procedure was selected. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 3 after surgery.

The most severe class of PBDs-Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD)-is caused by mutations in peroxin genes that result in both non-functional peroxisomes and mitochondrial dysfunction. It is unclear, however, how defective peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial impairment. In order to understand the molecular basis of this inter-organellar relationship, we investigated the fate of peroxisomal mRNAs and proteins in ZSD model systems. We found that peroxins were still expressed and a subset of them accumulated on the mitochondrial membrane, which resulted in gross mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired mitochondrial metabolic function. We showed that overexpression of ATAD1, a mitochondrial quality control factor, was sufficient to rescue several aspects of mitochondrial function in human ZSD fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that aberrant peroxisomal protein localization is necessary and sufficient for the devastating mitochondrial morphological and metabolic phenotypes in ZSDs.","Nuebel, Esther; Morgan, Jeffrey T; Fogarty, Sarah; Winter, Jacob M; Lettlova, Sandra; Berg, Jordan A; Chen, Yu-Chan; Kidwell, Chelsea U; Maschek, J Alan; Clowers, Katie J; Argyriou, Catherine; Chen, Lingxiao; Wittig, Ilka; Cox, James E; Roh-Johnson, Minna; Braverman, Nancy; Bonkowsky, Joshua; Gygi, Steven P; Rutter, Jared",EMBO reports,182,1

In pythons, nidovirus (recently reclassified as serpentovirus) infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe, often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 serpentovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether this not yet reported wider distribution of lesions is associated with previously unknown serpentoviruses or changes in the serpentovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against serpentovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelia (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel serpentovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing serpentovirus infection associated respiratory or systemic disease did not reveal sequence association to phenotypes, however, functional studies with different strains are needed to confirm this observation. The results indicate that serpentoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated viral systemic spread.IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses (now reclassified as serpentoviruses) have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Serpentoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previous evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Serpentoviruses belong to the same order as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.","Dervas, Eva; Hepojoki, Jussi; Smura, Teemu; Prähauser, Barbara; Windbichler, Katharina; Blümich, Sandra; Ramis, Antonio; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja",Journal of virology,182,1

Limited real-world data on its effectiveness and safety are available from an Italian population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated long-term clinical data from the single-arm PERsistent Sitagliptin Treatment & Outcomes (PERS&O) study, which collected information on 440 patients with TD2 (275 men, 165 women; mean age 64.1 years; disease median duration: 12 years) treated with sitagliptin 'add-on'. For each patient, we estimated the 10-year cardiovascular (CV) risk using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (RE). Drug survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves; repeated measures mixed effects models were used to evaluate the evolution of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and CV risk during sitagliptin treatment. RESULTS At baseline, most patients were overweight or obese (median body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) 30.2); median HbA1c was 8.4%; median fasting plasma glucose: 172 mg/dL; median UKPDS RE score: 24.8%, being higher in men (median 30.2%) than in women (median 17.0%) as expected. Median follow-up from starting sitagliptin treatment was 5.6 years. From Kaplan-Meier curves, the estimated median drug survival was 32.8 months when considering discontinuation for any cause and 58.4 months when considering discontinuation for loss of efficacy. A significant improvement in HbA1c was evident during treatment with sitagliptin (p<0.01): the reduction was rapid (median HbA1c after 4-6 months: 7.5%) and continued at longer follow-up. When comparing patients treated with sitagliptin versus those stopping sitagliptin and switching to another antihyperglycemic drug, we detected a significant difference in the evolution of HbA1c in favor of patients who continued sitagliptin treatment. The UKPDS RE score at 10 years and the BMI significantly improved during treatment with sitagliptin (p<0.001). Adverse events were relatively uncommon. CONCLUSION Patients with T2D treated with sitagliptin achieved an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction in CV risk and did not experience relevant adverse events.","Bossi, Antonio Carlo; De Mori, Valentina; Galeone, Carlotta; Bertola, Davide Pietro; Gaiti, Margherita; Balini, Annalisa; Berzi, Denise; Forloni, Franco; Meregalli, Giancarla; Turati, Federica",BMJ open diabetes research & care,182,16

Previous reports have noted a negative correlation between endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) copy number and exogenous FeLV (exFeLV) infection outcomes in domestic cats. Since felids outside the genus Felis do not harbor enFeLV genomes, we hypothesized absence of enFeLV results in more severe disease consequences in felid species lacking these genomic elements. We infected primary fibroblasts isolated from domestic cats (Felis catus) and pumas (Puma concolor) with FeLV and quantitated proviral and viral antigen loads. Domestic cat enFeLV env and LTR copy numbers were determined for each individual and compared to FeLV viral outcomes. FeLV proviral and antigen levels were also measured in 6 naturally infected domestic cats and 11 naturally infected Florida panthers (P. concolor coryi). We demonstrated that puma fibroblasts are more permissive to FeLV than domestic cat cells, and domestic cat FeLV restriction was highly related to enFeLV-LTR copy number. Terminal tissues from FeLV-infected Florida panthers and domestic cats had similar exFeLV proviral copy numbers, but Florida panther tissues have higher FeLV antigen loads. Our work indicates enFeLV-LTR elements negatively correlates with exogenous FeLV replication. Further, Puma concolor lacking enFeLV are more permissive to FeLV infection than domestic cats, suggesting endogenization can play a beneficial role in mitigating exogenous retroviral infections. Conversely, presence of endogenous retroelements may relate to new host susceptibility during viral spillover events.IMPORTANCE Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) can infect a variety of felid species. Only the primary domestic cat host and related small cat species harbor a related endogenous virus in their genomes. Previous studies noted a negative association between the endogenous virus copy number and exogenous virus infection in domestic cats. This report shows that puma cells, which lack endogenous FeLV, produce more virus more rapidly than domestic cat fibroblasts following cell culture challenge. We document a strong association between domestic cat cell susceptibility and FeLV long terminal repeat (LTR) copy number, similar to observations in natural FeLV infections. Viral replication does not, however, correlate with FeLV env copy number, suggesting this effect is specific to FeLV-LTR elements. This discovery indicates a protective capacity of the endogenous virus against the exogenous form, either via direct interference or indirectly via gene regulation, and may suggest evolutionary outcomes of retroviral endogenization.","Chiu, Elliott S; VandeWoude, Sue",Journal of virology,182,1

In this work, we will review our activity on ultrafast spectroscopy in nanostructures carried out in the recently established EuroFEL Support Laboratory.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-eight follow-up MR FLAIR datasets of ischemic stroke patients with known modified Rankin Scale (mRS) functional outcome after 30 days were used. The infarct regions were segmented and used to calculate the percentage of lesioned voxels in the predefined MNI, Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlas regions as well as using four problem-specific VOIs, which were identified from the database using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping. An overall of 12 SVM classification models for predicting the corresponding mRS score were generated using the lesion overlap values from the different brain region definitions, stroke laterality information, and the optional parameters infarct volume, admission NIHSS, and patient age. RESULTS Leave-one-out cross validations revealed that including information about the stroke location in terms of lesion overlap measurements led to improved mRS prediction results compared to classification models not utilizing the stroke location information. Furthermore, integration of the optional features led to improved mRS prediction results in all cases tested. The problem-specific brain regions and additional integration of the optional features led to the best mRS predictions with a precise multi-value mRS prediction accuracy of 56%, sliding window multi-value mRS prediction accuracy (mRS±1) of 82%, and binary mRS (0-2 vs. 3-5) prediction accuracy of 85%. CONCLUSION Therefore, a graded SVM-based functional stroke outcome prediction using the problem-specific brain regions for lesion overlap quantification leads to promising results but needs to be further validated using an independent database to rule out a potential methodical bias and overfitting effects. The prediction of the graded mRS functional outcome could be a valuable tool if combined with voxel-wise tissue outcome predictions based on multi-parametric datasets acquired at the acute phase.","Forkert, Nils Daniel; Verleger, Tobias; Cheng, Bastian; Thomalla, Götz; Hilgetag, Claus C; Fiehler, Jens",PloS one,182,1

Communicating environmental problems with ""slow impacts"" has long been a challenge for scientists, public health officials, and science communicators, as the time delay for subsequent consequences to become evident dilutes the sense of urgency to act. Fortunately, scientific research and practice in the field of climate change communication has begun to identify best practices to address these challenges. Climate change demonstrates a delay between environmental stressor and impact, and recommended practices for climate change communication illustrate how to explain and motivate action around this complex environmental problem. Climate change communication research provides scientific understanding of how people evaluate risk and scientific information about climate change. We used a qualitative coding approach to review the science communication and climate change communication literature to identify approaches that could be used for nutrients and how they could be applied. Recognizing the differences between climate change and impacts of nutrient pollution, we also explore how environmental problems with delayed impacts demand nuanced strategies for effective communication and public engagement. Applying generalizable approaches to successfully communicate the slow impacts related to nutrient pollution across geographic contexts will help build publics' understanding and urgency to act on comprehensive management of nutrient pollution, thereby increasing protection of coastal and marine environments.","Canfield, Katherine Nicole; Mulvaney, Kate; Merrill, Nathaniel",Frontiers in environmental science,182,5

Two investigators will independently review all titles and abstracts to identify relevant records, screen the full-text articles of potentially admissible records, and systematically extract data from selected articles. We will include studies published in English from 1998 to 2020 describing medical settings that have established formal relationships with community-based DCs (eg, shared medical record) or where DCs practice in medical settings. Data extraction and reporting will be guided by the Proctor Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, which has three domains: clinical intervention, implementation strategies and outcome measurement. Stakeholders from diverse clinical fields will offer feedback on the implications of our findings via a web-based survey. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval will not be obtained for this review of published and publicly accessible data, but will be obtained for the web-based survey. Our results will be disseminated through conference presentations and a peer-reviewed publication. Our findings will inform implementation strategies that support the adoption of chiropractic care within integrated healthcare delivery systems.","Roseen, Eric J; Kasali, Bolanle Aishat; Corcoran, Kelsey; Masselli, Kelsey; Laird, Lance; Saper, Robert B; Alford, Daniel P; Cohen, Ezra; Lisi, Anthony; Atlas, Steven J; Bean, Jonathan F; Evans, Roni; Bussières, André",BMJ open,182,1

Ultrasonic coagulating shears (UCS), vascular staplers, plastic or titanium clips and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing (EBVS) are currently available. We report our experience with an EBVS device, LigaSure™ (Covidien AG), used in division of the ileocolic, middle colic and inferior mesenteric arteries during laparoscopic colorectal resection. METHODS We report the immediate outcome of 802 consecutive unselected patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection performed with use of the LigaSure™ (5 and 10 mm) at our institution over a 5-year period. Operative procedures included right hemicolectomy (n = 180), left hemicolectomy (n = 96), sigmoid colectomy (n = 347) and anterior resection (n = 179). Data were collected from a prospectively maintained cancer database and operative records. The procedures were performed primarily by three consultant surgeons with an interest in laparoscopic colorectal resection. RESULTS Of 802 cases in which the LigaSure™ device was employed to divide major vascular structures, immediate effective vessel sealing was achieved in 99.8% (n = 800). Two patients experienced related adverse events both following division of the inferior mesenteric artery with a 5 mm LigaSure™. Both patients had immediate uncontrolled haemorrhage that required laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Use of the LigaSure™ device to seal and divide the major mesenteric vessels during laparoscopic colorectal resection is very effective, with a high success rate of 99.8%. Caution should be exercised in elderly atherosclerotic patients, particularly when using the 5-mm LigaSure™ device.","Martin, S T; Heeney, A; Pierce, C; O'Connell, P R; Hyland, J M; Winter, Desmond C",Techniques in coloproctology,182,11

Through aqueous hydration of dry, uniform thin-films of amphiphilic polymer and PBF species deposited on Teflon, self-assembled polymersomes are readily generated incorporating the hydrophobic fluorophores in prescribed molar ratios within their membranes. The size-dependent spectral properties of the PBFs allow for ready optical verification ( steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy) of the extent of vesicle membrane loading and enable delineation of intermembranous molecular interactions. The resultant effects of PBF membrane-loading on polymersome thermodynamic and mechanical stability are further assessed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and micropipet aspiration, respectively. We demonstrate that polymersomes can be loaded at up to 10 mol/wt% concentrations, with hydrophobic molecules that possess sizes comparable to those of large pharmaceutical conjugates ( ranging 1.4-5.4 nm in length and = 0.7-5.4 kg mol), without significantly compromising the robust thermodynamic and mechanical stabilities of these synthetic vesicle assemblies. Due to membrane incorporation, hydrophobic encapsulants are effectively prevented from self-aggregation, able to be highly concentrated in aqueous solution, and successfully shielded from deleterious environmental interactions. Together, these studies present a generalized paradigm for the generation of complex multi-functional materials that combine both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents, in mesoscopic dimensions, through cooperative self-assembly.","Ghoroghchian, P Peter; Lin, John J; Brannan, Aaron K; Frail, Paul R; Bates, Frank S; Therien, Michael J; Hammer, Daniel A",Soft matter,182,31

RECENT FINDINGS Brief interventions in primary care have been shown to be a valuable tool in supporting patients to make lifestyle changes. Low carbohydrate diets have been successful in helping patients lose weight.The authors carried out a retrospective observational study based on the electronic records from a single general practitioner surgery with 7,500 patients in Essex, UK. Low carbohydrate dietary advice was given opportunistically to patients with a raised BMI, over an 18 month period, with advice and weights recorded. In total, 774 patients were given low carbohydrate dietary advice. Overall, 1103 kg of weight was lost by 339 patients, there was a median weight loss of 2.5 kg (interquartile range 0.0-6.0 kg) and a mean weight loss of 3.3 kg. SUMMARY There is no published literature available assessing the efficacy of brief interventions of low carbohydrate dietary advice. Our clinic results indicate that this may be an effective weight loss tool in primary care.","Oliver, David; Andrews, Kim","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",182,27

Our aim was to analyse the impact of work environment factors on short-term and long-term SA based on musculoskeletal and psychiatric diagnoses among healthcare workers. METHODS The study sample consisted of healthcare workers (n=12 452) drawn from representative samples of workers aged 16 to 64, who participated in the Swedish Work Environment Surveys (SWES) between 1993 and 2013. The outcomes were either short-term (≤28 days) or long-term (>104 days) SA between 1994 and 2016. HRs and 95% CIs were calculated for the impact of physical and psychosocial working conditions on risk of subsequent short-term or long-term SA for 3 years after participation in SWES. RESULTS Heavy physical work and strenuous work postures showed elevated HRs for short-term and long-term SA compared with those without these work exposures. Similarly, high job demands and low job control each increased the risk for both short-term and long-term SA compared with employees with low job demands and high job control. Low job support increased the risk for short-term SA compared with those with high job support. Working conditions were strongly related to short-term SA due to musculoskeletal diagnoses but not to short-term SA due to psychiatric diagnoses. None of the work characteristics, except strenuous postures, elevated the risk for long-term SA due to psychiatric diagnosis compared with employees without these characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Ergonomic improvements and stress reduction among healthcare workers are likely to reduce the prevalence of SA foremost due to musculoskeletal diagnoses.","Leineweber, Constanze; Marklund, Staffan; Gustafsson, Klas; Helgesson, Magnus",Occupational and environmental medicine,182,20

METHODS Between June 2010 and February 2012, 83 patients with superficial femoral artery in-stent and Rutherford category 2 to 5 ischemia were enrolled at 7 sites participating in this prospective randomized controlled study (RELINE; ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT01108861). The patients were randomized to treatment with either the heparin-bonded Viabahn endoprosthesis (n = 39: 29 men; mean age 67.7 ± 9.8 years) or a standard angioplasty balloon (n = 44: 32 men; mean age 69.0 ± 9.7 years). The primary effectiveness outcome was primary patency at 12 months, defined as no restenosis/occlusion within the target lesion based on duplex ultrasound and no target lesion revascularization. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of serious device-related adverse events within 30 days of the procedure. RESULTS All patients randomized to receive dilation or the Viabahn stent-graft were treated according to their assignment. The technical success was 100% for the Viabahn group and 81.8% for the angioplasty group (p = 0.002) owing to 9 patients requiring a bailout procedure after unsuccessful angioplasty. The 12-month primary patency rates were 74.8% for the Viabahn group and 28.0% for the angioplasty group (p < 0.001). Excluding the 9 angioplasty patients who received bailout stenting, the primary patency for optimal balloon angioplasty was 37.0% (p < 0.001). Three patients experienced device-related adverse events within 30 days: occlusion of the target lesion (Viabahn group), peripheral embolization (angioplasty group), and reocclusion of the target lesion (angioplasty group). CONCLUSION In this study, the treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis with a Viabahn endoprosthesis showed significantly better results than treatment with a standard balloon at 1 year.","Bosiers, Marc; Deloose, Koen; Callaert, Joren; Verbist, Jürgen; Hendriks, Jeroen; Lauwers, Patrick; Schroë, Herman; Lansink, Wouter; Scheinert, Dierk; Schmidt, Andrej; Zeller, Thomas; Beschorner, Ulrich; Noory, Elias; Torsello, Giovanni; Austermann, Martin; Peeters, Patrick",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,182,31

To define the EDI trigger, a previous dataset of 10,000 simulated FMD outbreaks in New Zealand, controlled by the standard stamping-out approach, was re-analysed at various time points between days 11-35 of each response to find threshold values of cumulative detected infected premises (IPs) that indicated upper quartile sized outbreaks and estimated dissemination rate (EDR) values that indicated sustained spread. Both sets of thresholds were then parameterised within the InterSpread Plus modelling framework, such that if either the cumulative IPs or the EDR exceeded the defined thresholds, the EDI trigger would fire. A new series of simulations were then generated. The EDI trigger was like two diagnostic tests interpreted in parallel, with the diagnostic outcome positive if either test was positive at any time point between days 11-35 inclusive. The diagnostic result was then compared to the final size of each outbreak, to see if the outbreak was an upper quartile outbreak in terms of cumulative IPs and / or final duration. The performance of the EDI trigger was then evaluated across the population of outbreaks, and the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) calculated. The Se, Sp, PPV and NPV for predicting large outbreaks were 0.997, 0.513, 0.404 and 0.998 respectively. The study showed that the EDI trigger was very sensitive to detecting large outbreaks, although not all outbreaks predicted to be large were so, whereas outbreaks predicted to be small invariably were small. Therefore, it shows promise as a mechanism that could support an adaptive management approach to FMD control.","Sanson, Robert L; Yu, Zhidong D; Rawdon, Thomas G; van Andel, Mary",Transboundary and emerging diseases,182,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study on data from patients admitted to a COVID hospital in Rome, Italy, between 5 March 2020 and 5 June 2020. A confirmed case was defined as a patient with a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test result, while an unconfirmed case had negative results on repeated swabs. Patients' medical history and clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were collected, and the dataset was used to train a predictive model for COVID-19 severity. RESULTS Data of 198 patients were included in the study. Twenty-eight (14.14%) had mild disease, 62 (31.31%) had moderate disease, 64 (32.32%) had severe disease, and 44 (22.22%) had critical disease. The G2 value assessed the contribution of each collected value to decision tree building. On this basis, SpO2 (%) with a cut point at 92 was chosen for the optimal first split. Therefore, the decision tree was built using values maximizing G2 and LogWorth. After the tree was built, the correspondence between inputs and outcomes was validated. CONCLUSIONS We developed a machine learning-based tool that is easy to understand and apply. It provides good discrimination in stratifying confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 patients with different prognoses in every context.

We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed. Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy. The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized. RESULTS Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread. It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment. Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively. When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised. Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules. Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery. These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk spreading the virus. It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels. A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided. CONCLUSION Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking. Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.","Di Saverio, Salomone; Pata, Francesco; Gallo, Gaetano; Carrano, Francesco; Scorza, Antonella; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Smart, Neil; Spinelli, Antonino; Pellino, Gianluca",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,182,5
146119,146119,146119,Perioperative right ventricular dysfunction.,14.303065,8.472738,2013,"BACKGROUND A full understanding of the mechanisms of action of aldosterone and its interaction with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) allows a theoretical framework to predict the therapeutic potential of MR antagonists (MRAs) in CKD, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. SUMMARY The initial focus on the mechanisms of action of aldosterone was directed primarily on its role in modulating renal excretory function. In contrast, many recent studies have demonstrated a wider and expanded role for aldosterone in modulating inflammation, collagen formation, fibrosis, and necrosis. Increasing evidence has accrued that implicates the pathophysiological overactivation of the MR as a major determinant of progression of CKD. By promoting inflammation and fibrosis, MR overactivation constitutes a pivotal determinant of CKD progression and its associated morbidity and mortality. In accord with this mechanism of action, blockade of the MR is currently being investigated as a novel treatment regimen to slow the progression of CKD. The recently reported FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) study demonstrated that patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who were treated with finerenone (a novel nonsteroidal MRA) manifested a lower risk of a composite primary outcome event compared with patients in the placebo arm (defined as kidney failure, or a sustained decrease of ≥40% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, or death from renal causes). In addition, patients in the finerenone group also manifested a lower risk of a key secondary outcome event (defined as death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure). Key Messages: Based on the success of the FIDELIO-DKD study, future studies should be implemented testing the hypothesis that a wide array of nondiabetic CKD is modulated by overactivation of the MR, and consequently may be amenable to treatment with novel nonsteroidal MRAs. Future studies are encouraged to elucidate the clinical implications of the interplay of nonsteroidal MRAs and the components of the renin-angiotensin cascade. The unique and recently reported interrelationship of fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) and aldosterone may also constitute a propitious subject for future investigation.","Epstein, Murray",American journal of nephrology,182,1

To understand how stay-at-home orders changed mobility patterns and influenced the spread of COVID-19.Methods. I merged 2020 data from the Virginia Department of Health, Google Mobility Reports, and the US Census to estimate a series of 2-way fixed-effect event-study regression models.Results. A stay-at-home order caused people to increase the amount of time spent at home by 12 percentage points and decrease the time the spent at work by 30 percentage points, retail and recreation venues by 40 percentage points, and grocery stores and pharmacies by 10 percentage points. People did not sustain changes in mobility and gradually returned to prepandemic levels before the stay-at-home order was lifted. In areas where people spent the most time at indoor locations, there was a large increase in COVID-19.Conclusions. A more robust and stricter policy response coordinated at the national level combined with a strong economic response from policymakers could have increased the effectiveness of the stay-at-home order.

Bat virus RaTG13 and SARS-CoV are also members of the coronavirus family and SARS-CoV caused a world-wide pandemic in 2003. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through their receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher binding affinity than SARS-CoV and RaTG13. Here we performed molecular dynamics simulation of these binding complexes and calculated their binding free energies using a computational alanine scanning method. Our MD simulation and hotspot residue analysis showed that the lower binding affinity of SARS-CoV to ACE2 vs. SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 can be explained by different hotspot interactions in these two systems. We also found that the lower binding affinity of RaTG13 to ACE2 is mainly due to a mutated residue (D501) which resulted in a less favorable complex formation for binding. We also calculated an important mutation of N501Y in SARS-CoV-2 using both alanine scanning calculation and a thermodynamic integration (TI) method. Both calculations confirmed a significant increase of the binding affinity of the N501Y mutant to ACE2 and explained its molecular mechanism. The present work provides an important theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism in coronavirus spike protein binding to human ACE2.","Li, Zhendong; Zhang, John Z H",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,182,22

Previous studies involving avian species demonstrated various dose ranges and multiple routes of administration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term sedative, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory effects of an intramuscular injection of alfaxalone on budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). A crossover study was performed with a sample size of 10 male budgerigars, previously determined to be healthy based on physical examination. Alfaxalone was administered intramuscularly at two doses: 15 and 20 mg/kg. The lower dose resulted in mild to moderate sedation for 29 ± 5 min, whereas the higher dose resulted in moderate to profound sedation for 29 ± 7 min. A statistically significant decrease in heart rate was observed 2 min after administration of alfaxalone at 15 mg/kg; however, this finding was noted to be transient. A statistically significant decrease in respiratory rate was observed at 6 and 10 min after injection in both groups. Cloacal temperature measurement with a digital thermometer and eye temperature calculated from thermographic images demonstrated a decrease in body temperature over time but was not found to be statistically significant. Intramuscular use of alfaxalone proved to provide short-term sedation in budgerigars, with statistically significant but clinically mild cardiorespiratory effects. Due to a significant decrease in body temperature, active warming is recommended when using alfaxalone in budgerigars.","Romano, Jon; Hasse, Kayla; Johnston, Matthew",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,182,5

The associations of initial symptoms with age, vaccinations of Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), and influenza and pathogens were determined by Chi-square t-test. Results We evaluated 248 confirmed cases, and 56 suspected cases with COVID-19. The median age was 6.82 years old, and 118 cases (38.82%) were girls. Furthermore, 30.26% of all patients were asymptomatic cases. The percentage of asymptomatic cases vaccinated with BCG was not significantly higher than that without BCG vaccination [86/280 (30.71%) vs. 6/13 (46.15%), P=0.203], and initial symptoms were not related with immunized influenza vaccine (P=0.267).

It is associated with chewing of areca nut and tobacco products with a high global prevalence, particularly in the southeast Asian countries. A wide range of treatment modalities are available, ranging from corticosteroids, antioxidants, nutritional supplements to herbal medicines but lacks a reliable treatment regimen. Aim This systematic review will comprehensively analyze the medicinal treatment for OSMF from 2011 to 2020, apprise the literature with new clinical studies, and initiate a discussion about other potential medicines. Material and methods A comprehensive electronic search was conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, and other databases from January 2011 to June 2020 according to the PRISMA guidelines, to identify all the clinical studies for the medicinal management of OSMF with definite keywords and defined criteria. Results Among the thirty-two included clinical studies 23 were randomized controlled studies and 9 were case-control studies. The treatment outcomes were diverse, and the majority of the studies showed improvement in the subjective signs and symptoms of OSMF. Only a few studies noticed the side effects. Conclusion No single treatment modality is effective in the management of OSMF. The concurrent use of triple therapy is efficacious. The naturally occurring herbal medicines have an immense potential in the management of OSMF. Therefore, high-quality, longitudinal, multi-center randomized controlled trials with larger samples need to be conducted to further assess the efficacy of various medicinal formulations in conjunction with physiotherapy in the management of OSMF.","More, Chandramani B; Jatti Patil, Deepa; Rao, Naman R",Journal of oral biology and craniofacial research,182,19

To investigate factors contributing to this differential infection outcome, the targets of SHFV infection, macrophages (MΦs) and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), were differentiated from macaque and baboon peripheral blood monocytes and used to compare viral replication and cell responses. SHFV replicated in >90% of macaque MΦs but in only ∼10% of baboon MΦs. Although SHFV infected ∼50% of macaque and baboon mDCs, virus replication was efficient in macaque but not in baboon mDCs. Both types of macaque cultures produced higher virus yields than baboon cultures. A more efficient type I interferon response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12/23(p40), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), in response to SHFV infection were observed in macaque but not baboon cultures, suggesting less efficient counteraction of these responses by viral proteins in macaque cells. Baboon cultures produced higher levels of IL-10 than macaque cultures both prior to and after SHFV infection. In baboon but not macaque cell cultures, SHFV infection upregulated IL-10R1, a subunit of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), and also SOCS3, a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine production. Incubation of macaque cultures with human IL-10 before and/or after SHFV infection decreased production of IL-6, IL-1β, and MIP-1α but not TNF-α, suggesting a role for IL-10 in suppressing SHFV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in macaques.","Vatter, Heather A; Brinton, Margo A",Journal of virology,182,1

SOURCE Relevant articles in PubMed MEDLINE from the first publication (2003) until 2020. N=101 articles were included in this review. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Type III IFNs represent a relatively newly described inflammatory cytokine family. Although they induce substantially similar signalling to the well-known type I IFNs, significant functional differences make these molecules remarkable. Type III IFNs have extensive biological effects, contributing to the pathogenesis of several diseases and also offering new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: 1) their potent anti-viral properties make them promising therapeutics against viral hepatitis and even against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; 2) imbalances in the IFN-λs contribute to several forms of chronic inflammation (e.g., systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases) and potentially predict disease progression and therapeutic response to biologic therapies; and 3) the antitumor properties of the type III IFNs open up new therapeutic perspectives against malignant diseases. CONCLUSION Over the last 18 years, researchers have gathered extensive information about the presence and role of these versatile inflammatory cytokines in human diseases, but further research is needed to clarify the mechanistic background of those observations. Better understanding of their biological activities will permit us to use type III IFNs more efficiently in new diagnostic approaches and individualized therapies, consequently improving patient care.","Malik, Aniko E; Issekutz, Thomas B; Derfalvi, Beata",Clinical and investigative medicine.

Proteins with specific structural features including constricting rings, helical scaffolds, and hydrophobic membrane insertions are thought to be the primary drivers of fission. In contrast, here we report a mechanism of fission that is independent of protein structure-steric pressure among membrane-bound proteins. In particular, random collisions among crowded proteins generate substantial pressure, which if unbalanced on the opposite membrane surface can dramatically increase membrane curvature, leading to fission. Using the endocytic protein epsin1 N-terminal homology domain (ENTH), previously thought to drive fission by hydrophobic insertion, our results show that membrane coverage correlates equally with fission regardless of the hydrophobicity of insertions. Specifically, combining FRET-based measurements of membrane coverage with multiple, independent measurements of membrane vesiculation revealed that fission became spontaneous as steric pressure increased. Further, fission efficiency remained equally potent when helices were replaced by synthetic membrane-binding motifs. These data challenge the view that hydrophobic insertions drive membrane fission, suggesting instead that the role of insertions is to anchor proteins strongly to membrane surfaces, amplifying steric pressure. In line with these conclusions, even green fluorescent protein (GFP) was able to drive fission efficiently when bound to the membrane at high coverage. Our conclusions are further strengthened by the finding that intrinsically disordered proteins, which have large hydrodynamic radii yet lack a defined structure, drove fission with substantially greater potency than smaller, structured proteins.","Snead, Wilton T; Hayden, Carl C; Gadok, Avinash K; Zhao, Chi; Lafer, Eileen M; Rangamani, Padmini; Stachowiak, Jeanne C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,182,12

This review provides an update on current tests and new developments. RECENT FINDINGS Widely used rapid antigen tests and immunofluorescence tests were generally less sensitive for 2009 H1N1 influenza than for seasonal influenza. In addition, marked variability was reported for the same tests in different settings and patient groups. The advantages of molecular testing gained wide recognition, namely high sensitivity, speed compared with culture, ability to assess viral load and to identify subtype. Although adoption of influenza molecular testing can be expected to accelerate, immunoassays and rapid cultures performed on site retain advantages for many facilities. Falsely negative results were seen with all methods, especially for samples collected very early or late. SUMMARY Influenza diagnostic test performance can be adversely affected by viral genetic and antigenic changes and should be re-assessed annually. Variability in sensitivity and specificity of the same test in different settings highlights the need for each laboratory to ensure optimal procedures and work with clinicians to improve sample quality. Manufacturers have been motivated to improve immunoassays and develop simpler and faster multiplex molecular tests, hopefully in advance of the next pandemic.","Landry, Marie Louise",Current opinion in pediatrics,182,28

Unfortunately, isolation of plants undergoing potent gene silencing requires laborious design, visual screening, and physical separation for downstream characterization. Here, we developed an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APT)-based RNA interference (RNAi) technology (APTi) in Physcomitrella patens that improves upon the multiple limitations of current RNAi techniques. APTi exploits the pro-survival output of transiently silencing APT in the presence of 2-fluoradenine, thereby establishing survival itself as a reporter of RNAi. To maximize the silencing efficacy of gene targets, we created vectors that facilitate insertion of any gene target sequence in tandem with the APT silencing motif. We tested the efficacy of APTi with two gene families, the actin-dependent motor, myosin XI (a,b), and the putative chitin receptor Lyk5 (a,b,c). The APTi approach resulted in a homogenous population of transient P. patens mutants specific for our gene targets with zero surviving background plants within 8 days. The observed mutants directly corresponded to a maximal 93% reduction of myosin XI protein and complete loss of chitin-induced calcium spiking in the Lyk5-RNAi background. The positive selection nature of APTi represents a fundamental improvement in RNAi technology and will contribute to the growing demand for technologies amenable to high-throughput phenotyping.","Orr, Robert G; Foley, Stephen J; Sherman, Catherine A; Abreu, Isidro; Galotto, Giulia; Liu, Boyuan; Gonzalez-Guerrero, Manuel; Vidali, Luis",Plant physiology,182,1

As with any airborne viral respiratory infection, surgical and non-surgical patients may be affected. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining to COVID-19 infection among adult patients. Results: COVID-19 disease that requires hospitalization results in critical illness approximately 25% of the time and requires mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure. Acute kidney injury, a marked hypercoagulable state, and sometimes myocarditis can be features of COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic severe acute lung injury. Even if not among the most seriously afflicted, older patients with medical comorbidities are both predisposed to infection and risk increased morbidity and mortality, however, all persons presenting for surgical intervention should be suspected of infection (and thus transmissibility) even if asymptomatic. Although most elective surgery has been curtailed by administrative or governmental fiat, patients will still need urgent or emergency operative intervention for time-sensitive disease processes such as malignant neoplasia or for true emergencies such as perforated viscus or traumatic injury. It is possible to provide safe surgical care for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and minimize nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. Conclusions: This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.","Heffernan, Daithi S; Evans, Heather L; Huston, Jared M; Claridge, Jeffrey A; Blake, David P; May, Addison K; Beilman, Greg S; Barie, Philip S; Kaplan, Lewis J",Surgical infections,182,27

These prodrugs also display potent anti-dengue activities in cellular assays although their prodrug moieties were designed to produce high levels of triphosphate in the liver. Since peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are one of the major targets of dengue virus, different prodrug moieties were designed to effectively deliver 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methylguanosine monophosphate prodrugs and their corresponding triphosphates into PBMCs after oral administration. We identified a cyclic phosphoramidate prodrug 17 demonstrating a well-balanced anti-dengue cellular activity and in vitro stability profiles. We further determined the PBMCs concentration of active triphosphate needed to inhibit 50% virus replication (TP50). Compound 17 was assessed in AG129 mouse model and demonstrated 1.6- and 2.2-log viremia reduction at 100 and 300 mg/kg BID, respectively. At 100 mg/kg BID, the terminal triphosphate concentration in PBMCs reached above TP50, demonstrating TP50 as the target exposure for efficacy. In dogs, oral administration of 17 resulted in high PBMCs triphosphate level, exceeding TP50 at 10 mg/kg. Unfortunately, two-week dog toxicity studies at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day showed that No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) could not be achieved due to pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage.

This study examines the psychometric properties of an app-based 6-minute walking test (6WT) and determines OFI in patients with lumbar DDD. METHODS The maximum 6-minute walking distance (6WD) was determined in patients with lumbar DDD. The results were expressed as raw 6WDs (in meters), as well as in standardized z-scores referenced to age- and sex-specific values of spine-healthy volunteers. The 6WT results were assessed for reliability and content validity using established disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS Seventy consecutive patients and 330 volunteers were enrolled. The mean 6WD was 370 m (SD 137 m) in patients with lumbar DDD. Significant correlations between 6WD and the Core Outcome Measures Index for the back (r = -0.31), Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) symptom severity (r = -0.32), ZCQ physical function (r = -0.33), visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain (r = -0.42), and VAS for leg pain (r = -0.32) were observed (all p < 0.05). The 6WT revealed good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.82), and the standard error of measurement was 58.3 m. A 4-tier severity stratification classified patients with z-scores > -1 (no OFI), -1 to -1.9 (mild OFI), -2 to -2.9 (moderate OFI), and ≤ -3 (severe OFI). CONCLUSIONS The smartphone app-based self-measurement of the 6WT is a convenient, reliable, and valid way to determine OFI in patients with lumbar DDD.

An established vaccine is available only for poliovirus, and no effective therapy is available for the treatment of infections caused by any pathogenic picornavirus. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that readily enter cells. A panel of PPMO was tested for their antiviral activities against various picornaviruses. PPMO targeting conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence were highly active against human rhinovirus type 14, coxsackievirus type B2, and poliovirus type 1 (PV1), reducing PV1 titers by up to 6 log(10) in cell cultures. Comparative sequence analysis led us to design a PPMO (EnteroX) targeting 22 nucleotides of IRES sequence that are perfectly conserved across greater than 99% of all human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. EnteroX reduced PV1 replication in cell culture to an extent similar to that of other IRES-specific PPMO. Resistant PV1 arose in cell cultures after 12 passages in the presence of EnteroX and were found to have two mutations within the EnteroX target sequence. Nevertheless, cPVR transgenic mice treated once daily by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with EnteroX before and/or after i.p. infection with 3 x 10(8) PFU (three times the 50% lethal dose) of PV1 had an approximately 80% higher rate of survival than the controls. The viral titer in tissues taken at day 5 postinfection showed that animals in the EnteroX-treated group averaged over 3, 4, and 5 log(10) less virus in the small intestine, spinal cord, and brain, respectively, than the amount in the control animals. These results suggest that EnteroX may have broad therapeutic potential against entero- and rhinoviruses.","Stone, Jeffrey K; Rijnbrand, Rene; Stein, David A; Ma, Yinghong; Yang, Yan; Iversen, Patrick L; Andino, Raul",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,182,1

Some animal experiments suggested the possibility of an animal to animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and were seen in some cases of infected animals. Animal to human transmission was considered unlikely until investigations revealed the possibility of mink to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE Current study aims at highlighting the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various animal species, reverse zoonotic transmission and proposing possible animal models that might aid in study and development of vaccine against Covid-19. METHODS The authors have gathered information on various animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and possible tests conducted from online news reports, websites and Scopus indexed journals. RESULTS Studying the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to domestic animals concluded that pigs, chicken, and ducks were not vulnerable to Covid-19; dogs showed less susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and cats as well as ferrets were seen susceptible to Covid-19. SARS-CoV-2 is seen crossing the species barrier, infecting humans from the wild with the source yet unclear, spreading from humans to humans quickly, humans to animals, animals to animals, and is likely to spread from animals to humans even though minimally. Animals appear somewhat resistant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to humans who globally crossed eight million infection cases, and the infected animals mostly do not show many complications and recover quickly. CONCLUSION Precautions are advised to prevent human to animal transmission of the virus, and in some areas, avoid animal to human spread of the virus. Further monitoring is required to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals as COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving condition worldwide. Cats and ferrets have physiological resemblance and genome sequencing studies propose the possibility of these species to be used as animal models for investigating the SARS-CoV-2 infection and this might aid in further studies and vaccine development against Covid-19.","Kumar, Rajesh; Harilal, Seetha; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G; Paninipara, Mehboobali; Behl, Tapan; Mathew, Githa Elizabeth; Mathew, Bijo",Current pharmaceutical design,182,1

ICD diagnoses codes were used to generate queries on total numbers and demographic data on COVID-19, oral candidasis, total candidasis, and COVID-19 with each form of candidasis. RESULTS From the 889 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 106 (12%) were diagnosed with candidiasis at large and 14 (1.6%) had oral candidiasis. The odds ratio (OR) for COVID-19 in the presence of oral candidiasis was 2.01 (95% CI 1.1870 to 3.4143, P = .094) and the OR for COVID-19 in the presence of candidiasis was 3.73 (95% CI 3.0419 to 4.5847, P < .0001 ). African American were disproportionally affected and comprised about 40% of the COVID-19/candidiasis groups. CONCLUSIONS Total candidiasis was significantly associated with increased risk for COVID-19, whereas oral candidiasis showed an insignificant trend. The dental practitioner should be aware of the importance of unexplained oral and systemic candidiasis as a potential harbinger of T and B cell immunosuppression associated with viral infections. COVID-19 may be a risk factor for total candidiasis.","Katz, Joseph",Quintessence international,182,1

AIM Characterization of the antiviral properties of enisamium iodide against human respiratory viruses in in vitro experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the course of experiments, the cytotoxic properties of enisamium iodide were studied against the cell lines Vero, MA-104, A549, L-41 and HEp-2. The antiviral activity of enisamium iodide was studied using virus yield reduction assay against influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B3 and Coxsackie B4 viruses, as well as adenoviruses types 5 and 6. RESULTS The most sensitive to the action of enisamium iodide was the human parainfluenza virus, whose activity decreased by 2.3 orders of magnitude under the action of the drug in A549 cells. Of the cell cultures used, enisamium iodide exhibited the maximum antiviral effect in human lung carcinoma cells A549, where, in its presence, the level of reproduction of adenoviruses of types 5 and 6, Coxsackie viruses B3 and B4, and human parainfluenza virus decreased by an order of magnitude or more. The antiviral activity of enisamium iodide was least manifested in Vero cells. CONCLUSION According to the results of in vitro experiments, enisamium iodide can be considered as an antiviral drug with a wide spectrum of activity against human respiratory viruses.","Zarubaev, V V; Slita, A V; Sinegubova, E O; Muryleva, A A; Lavrentieva, I N",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,182,31

In this paper, we review current and potential approaches to this critical role of the FDA. The FDA has established pathways to accelerate vaccine availability prior to approval, such as emergency use authorization, and to channel resources to high-priority products and allow more flexibility in the evidence required for approval, including accelerated approval based on surrogate markers of effectiveness. Among the 35 new vaccines approved in the US from 2006-2020, about two-thirds of their pivotal trials used the surrogate outcome of immune system response, and just one-third evaluated actual disease incidence. Post-approval safety surveillance of new vaccines-particularly vaccines receiving expedited approval-is crucial. Currently this is accomplished through such mechanisms as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the CDC Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project. Adverse events detected in this way may lead to changes in a vaccine's recommended use or its withdrawal from the market. Regulatory oversight of new vaccines will have to balance speed with rigor and decisiveness to effectively address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

151502,151502,151502,Translational models of lung disease.,14.32688,8.405715,2015,"INTRODUCTION Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the most common disease leading to blindness in extreme preterm infants. Current screening guidelines recommend frequent eye examinations. There is a dearth of trained ophthalmologists for these frequent screening procedures. The ANZNN neonatal network report (2013) found that only 6.4% of all screened infants had severe ROP and less than half received treatment. WINROP (online prediction model, Sweden) uses the postnatal weight gain (surrogate marker for low insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 and poor retinal vascular growth) to identify ROP requiring treatment and aims to reduce the number of examinations. Our objective was to validate the WINROP model in an Australian cohort of preterm infants. METHODS Birth weight, gestational age, and weekly weight measurements were retrieved retrospectively along with the final ROP outcomes and plotted on the online WINROP software. RESULTS The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of WINROP were 85.7%, 59.0%, 6.98%, and 99.1% respectively for a cohort of 221 preterm infants (Median birth weight, 1040 g; Gestational age, 27.9 weeks). WINROP alarm was signaled in 42.6% of all infants. WINROP did not signal an alarm in one infant who needed treatment. This infant had intra ventricular hemorrhage grade 3-4 and temporary ventricular dilatation. CONCLUSIONS This is the first Australian study validating WINROP model. Our findings suggest that it lacked sensitivity to be used alone. However, adjusting the algorithm for the Australian population may improve the efficacy and reduce the number of examinations when used along with the current screening guidelines.","Desai, Saumil; Athikarisamy, Sam E; Lundgren, Pia; Simmer, Karen; Lam, Geoffrey C",Eye,182,1

Nebulisation of antibiotics as a topic treatment may lead to high local drug concentrations. To provide data on drug transport, the present study analysed a specific drug transport system on the molecular and functional level. Messenger RNA of the proton-coupled transporter PEPT2 that mediates physiological transport of oligopeptides as well as peptidomimetics like beta-lactams and aminolevulinic acid was discovered in rat nasal mucosa by RT-PCR. Real-time PCR studies indicated a lower expression level than control kidney samples. PEPT2 immunoreactivity was identified in nasal mucosa tissue. The protein was expressed in epithelial cells, but goblet cells did not exhibit PEPT2 expression. Functional studies with rat preparations led to uptake of a fluorophore-conjugated substrate into epithelial cells of nasal mucosa. Goblet cells did not exhibit uptake activity. The uptake was competitively inhibited by dipeptides demonstrating similar substrate specificity as reported for PEPT2. Together, these data suggest that PEPT2 is likely to play an important role in mucosal peptide metabolism and may represent a novel target for therapeutic efforts in upper airway diseases.","Quarcoo, David; Fischer, Tanja C; Heppt, Werner; Lauenstein, Hans-Dieter; Pilzner, Carolin; Welte, Tobias; Groneberg, David A",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,182,27

The respiratory viral panel (RVP) is one tool quickly able to detect common viral and bacterial pathogens using polymerase chain reaction technology. Utility may be further enhanced in conjunction with procalcitonin (PCT). However, the optimal use of the RVP to the clinical pharmacist in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections remains unclear. METHODS The purpose of this guide is to review the available literature regarding the impact of the RVP with and without procalcitonin on antimicrobial stewardship efforts and to provide guidance on how to use each of these tools. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In total, 13 studies were included, 5 of which utilized PCT in conjunction with RVP and 8 of which did not use PCT. The majority of studies were retrospective in nature, and the most common outcomes evaluated were antibiotic days of therapy (DOT) and time to antibiotic discontinuation. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION After review, RVP alone has limited value to antimicrobial stewardship; however, when used in conjunction with procalcitonin, RVP has the potential to reduce antibiotic use and duration.","Covert, Kelly; Bashore, Elizabeth; Edds, McKenzie; Lewis, Paul O",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,182,1

This document is intended for stroke teams who face the challenge of integrating new team members into endovascular stroke-treatment workflows during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other global health care emergency. It discusses the key strategies for smooth integration of new stroke-team members in a crisis situation: 1) transfer of key knowledge (simple take-home messages), 2) open communication and a nonjudgmental atmosphere, 3) strategic task assignment, and 4) graded learning and responsibility.

Several authors have shown that this approach is safe and improves obstructive defaecation symptoms and faecal incontinence, without inducing new-onset constipation, possible after posterior rectopexy. Over the last decade, as for other procedures, biological meshes are used to correct pelvic floor disorders. Literature data are scant. In this study, we present our experience with this procedure using biological mesh. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospectively collected data on laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy for internal rectal prolapse were analysed. All patients underwent preoperative evaluation with defaecating proctography and/or pelvic dynamic MRI, full colonoscopy, anal physiology studies and endo-anal ultrasound. End-points were to evaluate surgical complications and functional results of this technique such as changes in bowel function (Wexner Constipation Score and Faecal Incontinence Severity Index) at 3 and 6 months. Analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data and Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data (two-sided p test). RESULTS Thirty-four consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (median age 59, range 25-78 years, mean follow-up was 12 months). Twenty-eight patients (82%) had a constipation score ≥ 5, while 14 (41%) a FISI score ≥ 10. Nine patients (26%) had mixed obstructed defaecation and faecal incontinence. One patient required conversion to open (3%). Median length of stay was 2 days. Overall complication rate was 23.5%. Preoperative constipation (median Wexner score 15) and faecal incontinence (median FISI score 12) improved significantly at 3 months (Wexner 5, FISI 5, both p < 0.001). Two patients experienced prolapse persistence or recurrence. No patients had function worsening or complained of sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy using biological mesh for internal rectal prolapse is safe and effective in ameliorating symptoms of obstructed defaecation and faecal incontinence.","Sileri, Pierpaolo; Franceschilli, Luana; de Luca, Elisabetta; Lazzaro, Sara; Angelucci, Giulio P; Fiaschetti, Valeria; Pasecenic, Carolina; Gaspari, Achille L",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,182,5

Previously described endovascular methods typically involve carotid revascularization with stent placement prior to or following intracranial thrombectomy. Stent-based approaches, however, require the use of antiplatelet therapy which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. We describe a novel modified Dotter technique which may be used for carotid revascularization in lieu of stenting. This technique can eliminate the need for antiplatelet therapy, reduce procedure times, and possibly reduce hemorrhagic conversion rates. METHODS Seven patients presenting between April 2013 and January 2014 were treated with this technique. All patients had carotid stenosis of 65-100% and tandem middle cerebral artery occlusions. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale scores as well as clinical and procedural times were recorded. Pre- and post-Dotter stenosis was measured using the NASCET criteria. Follow-up imaging and clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS The mean age was 64 years and mean initial NIH Stroke Scale score was 11.7. Mean groin to recanalization time was 26 min. Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3 was achieved in all patients. The mean stenosis was 88% preoperatively and 61% postoperatively. There were no intracranial hemorrhages. The modified Rankin Scale score was 0 in six patients (86%) and 6 in one patient (14%). CONCLUSIONS The Dotter stroke technique is a feasible and safe alternative to carotid stenting in the setting of acute ischemic stroke and may reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion. No re-occlusion occurred during follow-up in patients with post-Dotter stenosis ≤65%.","Woodward, Keith; Wegryn, Scott; Staruk, Carla; Nyberg, Eric M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,182,1

METHODS 1175 people received SAFER over a 12-month period at 18 gun shows and community events in 2019 and completed a preassessment measuring firearms ownership, storage practices, knowledge about suicide as the leading type of firearm fatality and attitudes about suicide prevention. 372 responded to a brief postassessment using comparable measures. RESULTS 85% of participants reported keeping firearms at home. 43.7% reported current or prior military service. 53.2% were males between the ages of 35 and 64. Among those who responded to the postassessment, 61% of participants reported SAFER to be highly valuable. Safe firearms storage improved among participants who completed the preassessment and postassessment (51.2% pre, 66.0% post; p<0.01) as did safe medication storage (14.8% pre, 21.6% post; p=0.01). Knowledge that most firearm fatalities are suicides (33.4% pre, 45.8% post; p<0.01) also improved. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible, acceptable and effective to reach groups at elevated risk for suicide using a brief intervention strategy in unconventional settings. Community-based interventions to improve safe storage motivated by suicide prevention messaging should be prioritised because men in the middle years are less likely to use mental health services.","Stuber, Jennifer Paige; Massey, Anne; Meadows, Morgan; Bass, Brett; Rowhani-Rahbar, Ali",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,182,28

In this study, an iron-rich substrate (IRS) was developed based on iron‑carbon micro-electrolysis and applied for simultaneous sediments and overlying water remediation. IRS obtained high ammonia and phosphate adsorption capacities (Langmuir isotherm) of 13.02 and 18.12 mg·kg-1, respectively. In the 90-day long-term remediation, IRS reduced NH4+-N, PO43--P, organic-N, organic-P, TN and TP in overlying water by 48.6%, 97.9%, 34.2%, 67.1%, 53.2% and 90.4%, respectively. In sediments, IRS reduced NO3--N, NH4+-N and organic-N by 98.5%, 26.5% and 6.3%, respectively. The unstable P-compounds (i.e., organic-P, Ca-bounded-P and labile-P) were effectively transferred (20.1%, 54.3% and 98.2%, respectively) into inert P-compounds (i.e., Fe-bounded-P and residual-P). Meanwhile, flux rates of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments to overlying water were reduced from 7.02 to 4.92 mg·m-2·d-1 (by 29.9%) and from 7.42 to 2.21 mg·m-2·d-1 (by 70.2%), respectively. Due to micro-electrolysis, Fe2+/Fe3+/[H] were in-situ generated from IRS and NO3--N was effectively reduced. Additionally, the generation of O2· was promoted by Fe2+/[H] and strengthened the NH4+-N, organic-N/P oxidation. Fe3+ enhanced the immobilization of PO43- (e.g., as FePO4·H2O and FenPO4(OH)3n-3). The released Fe2+/Fe3+ from IRS were finally stabilized as poorly reactive sheet silicate (PRS)-Fe and magnetite-Fe in the sediments and hardly showed side effect to sediments and water body. The developed IRS obtained advantages of high efficiency, ecologically safe and cost-effective in contaminated sediments and overlying water remediation.","Hu, Zhifeng; Deng, Shihai; Li, Desheng; Guan, Detian; Xie, Binghan; Zhang, Chao; Li, Pengyang; Yao, Hong",The Science of the total environment,182,19

METHODS Both applicators were tested in a phantom study at 1.5T with three sequences: T1-weighted three-dimensional volume interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE), T1-weighted fast low angle shot (FLASH), T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE). Applicator orientation to main magnetic field (B0) and slice orientation were varied. Needle tip location error (TLE) was assessed, and artefact diameters were calculated. Influence of imaging parameters on artefacts was assessed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc testing. RESULTS MW applicator: the shaft artefact diameter measured 2.3 +/- 0.8 mm. Tip artefact diameter and length measured 2.2 ± 0.8 mm and 2.4 ± 1.3 mm, respectively. A prominent oval artefact (diameter: 16.5 +/- 1.8 mm, length: 19.1 +/- 2.5 mm) appeared close to the tip. TLE: - .3 +/- 0.6 mm. RF applicator: shaft and tip diameter measured 8.9 +/- 4.7 mm and 9.0 +/- .0 mm, respectively. TLE: -0.1 +/- 0.8 mm. Minimal artefacts were measured with RF applicator orientation parallel to B0 (P < 0.0001), whereas no such influence was found for MW applicator. For both applicators, significantly large artefacts were measured with T1 FLASH (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION The MW applicator's artefact is satisfactory and seems useable for MR-guided ablation procedures. KEY POINTS MW applicator's artefact appearance is independent of angulation to main magnetic field. MW applicator's prominent distal artefact may increase visibility under MR-guidance. RF and MW applicator's artefacts are precise concerning tip depiction. Largest artefact diameters are measured with T1-weighted fast low angle shot sequence.","Hoffmann, Rüdiger; Rempp, Hansjörg; Eibofner, Frank; Keßler, David-Emanuel; Blumenstock, Gunnar; Weiß, Jakob; Pereira, Philippe L; Nikolaou, Konstantin; Clasen, Stephan",European radiology,182,20

Sibling comparisons can minimize variation in these confounders because siblings grow up in similar environments and share the same genetic predisposition for weight gain. METHODS We identified 96 289 women with live births in 2008-2014 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Fifteen percent of women (N = 14 417) had at least two births during the study period for sibling analyses. We assessed associations of GWG according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations with birthweight and obesity at age 3 years, using conventional analyses comparing outcomes between mothers and sibling analyses comparing outcomes within mothers, which control for stable within-family unmeasured confounders such as familial environment and genetics. We used generalized estimating-equations and fixed-effects models. RESULTS In conventional analyses, GWG above the IOM recommendations was associated with 88% greater odds of large-for-gestational age birthweight [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.80, 1.97] and 30% greater odds of obesity at 3 years old (95% CI: 1.24, 1.37) compared with GWG within the IOM recommendations. In sibling analyses, GWG above the IOM recommendations was also associated with greater odds of large-for-gestational age [odds ratio (OR): 1.36; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.54], but was not associated with obesity at 3 years old (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.15). CONCLUSIONS GWG likely has a direct impact on birthweight; however, shared environmental and lifestyle factors within families may play a larger role in determining early-childhood weight status and obesity risk than GWG.","Badon, Sylvia E; Quesenberry, Charles P; Xu, Fei; Avalos, Lyndsay A; Hedderson, Monique M",International journal of epidemiology,182,1

However, very limited studies have assessed the long-term impact of conflicts on environmental sustainability. This study investigates the role of internal and external conflicts on ecological footprint in the Middle East and North African countries (MENA) over the period 1995-2016. Here, we test whether the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is valid for MENA countries during the period of internal and external conflicts-characterized by energy disasters and deteriorating income levels. Using robust econometric tools based on 12 MENA countries, the results show that income growth has negative impact with evidence of inherent heterogeneity across quantile distribution of ecological footprint. However, the positive impact of the square term of income decreases ecological footprint, thus, confirming U-shaped relationship between income and environmental indicator across MENA countries. The results further show that excessive energy consumption is attributed to a rising level of urbanization, while increase in conflicts stimulates environmental degradation. These findings are essential for effective conflict resolution and environmental policies across conflict-prone countries.","Usman, Ojonugwa; Rafindadi, Abdulkadir Abdulrashid; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu",Environmental science and pollution research international,182,19

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment option for the majority of PID. As a Pediatric Hematology-Oncology-Immunology Transplantation Unit, we wanted to present our HSCT experience regarding treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases. METHODS 58 patients were included in the study between January 2014 and June 2019. We searched 9/10 or 10/10 matched-related donor (MRD) firstly, in the absence of fully matched-related donor. We screened matched unrelated donor (MUD) from donor banks. MRD was used in 24 (41.3%) patients, MUD in 20 (34.4%) patients, and haploidentical donors in 14 (24.1%) patients. Demographic data, HSCT characteristics, and outcome were evaluated. While 16 patients had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the remaining was non-SCID. RESULTS Of the 58 patients, 38 were male and 20 were female. Median age at transplantation was 12 months (range: 2.5-172 months). Combined immunodeficiencies consisted 67.2% of patients. Mean follow-up time was 27 months (6 months-5 years). Median neutrophil, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte engraftment days were similar in comparison of both donor type and stem cell source. The most common complication was acute GvHD in 15 (25.8%) patients. In total, five patients (31%) belonging to the SCID group and 10 patients (23.8%) belonging to the non-SCID group died. Our total mortality rate was 15 (25.8%) in all patients. CONCLUSIONS We would like to present our HSCT experiences as a pediatric immunology transplantation center. Existing severe infections before transplantation period, BCGitis, and CMV are important issues of transplantation in Turkey. However, the follow-up time is shorter than some studies, our results regarding complications and survival are similar to previous reports.","Erol Cipe, Funda; Adakli Aksoy, Basak; Aydogdu, Selime; Dikme, Gurcan; Kiykim, Ayca; Aydogmus, Cigdem; Yucel, Esra; Bozkurt, Ceyhun; Fisgin, Tunc",Pediatric transplantation,182,1

This case describes lifesaving sinus surgery on a critically ill gorilla performed by a human otolaryngology team in collaboration with the gorilla's veterinary medicine team. METHODS The 35-year-old western silverback gorilla was treated for 3 months with aggressive medical therapy for a worsening sinus infection. When his condition became severe, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed showing advanced chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps vs other masses and some bone erosion. As his condition deteriorated further, a tertiary otolaryngology team performed sinus surgery using the latest technology available, including image guidance, steroid-eluting sinus stents, and balloon sinus dilation. The postoperative course was complicated by subcutaneous infection and eventual fistulization. Fortunately, with culture-directed antibiotic therapy his condition gradually improved. One year later he required revision sinus surgery. At that point allergy testing was performed followed by appropriate allergy medical therapy. Now, 3 years out from his initial surgery, he continues to do well and has fathered a young female gorilla. RESULTS This case represents a unique collaboration between human physicians and veterinarians. The combined medical approach was critical to heal this ailing gorilla. This case discusses many of the challenges and offers recommendations for physicians who may be involved with similar care of animals in the future. CONCLUSION The success of the surgical and medical treatment of this gorilla's life-threatening sinus infection required many experts, careful planning, and corporate generosity. The interaction between human and animal medicine would not have been successful without the close and trusting collaborations between human and veterinary health providers. We encourage human healthcare providers to seek volunteer opportunities through their local zoos by engaging in discussions with their local veterinarians.","Davis, Greg E; Baik, Fred M; Liddell, Robert M; Ayars, Andrew G; Branch, Kelley R; Pottinger, Paul S; Hillel, Allen D; Helmick, Kelly; Collins, Darin",International forum of allergy & rhinology,182,10

Currently, several quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays are being used by clinical, research and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear whether results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to make independent evaluations of primer-probe sets used in four common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. From our comparisons of RT-qPCR analytical efficiency and sensitivity, we show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 viral RNA copies per reaction. The exception for this is the RdRp-SARSr (Charité) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity, probably due to a mismatch to circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the reverse primer. We did not find evidence for background amplification with pre-COVID-19 samples or recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution decreasing sensitivity. Our recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is to select an assay with high sensitivity and that is regionally used, to ease comparability between outcomes.","Vogels, Chantal B F; Brito, Anderson F; Wyllie, Anne L; Fauver, Joseph R; Ott, Isabel M; Kalinich, Chaney C; Petrone, Mary E; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Catherine Muenker, M; Moore, Adam J; Klein, Jonathan; Lu, Peiwen; Lu-Culligan, Alice; Jiang, Xiaodong; Kim, Daniel J; Kudo, Eriko; Mao, Tianyang; Moriyama, Miyu; Oh, Ji Eun; Park, Annsea; Silva, Julio; Song, Eric; Takahashi, Takehiro; Taura, Manabu; Tokuyama, Maria; Venkataraman, Arvind; Weizman, Orr-El; Wong, Patrick; Yang, Yexin; Cheemarla, Nagarjuna R; White, Elizabeth B; Lapidus, Sarah; Earnest, Rebecca; Geng, Bertie; Vijayakumar, Pavithra; Odio, Camila; Fournier, John; Bermejo, Santos; Farhadian, Shelli; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Iwasaki, Akiko; Ko, Albert I; Landry, Marie L; Foxman, Ellen F; Grubaugh, Nathan D",Nature microbiology,182,14

This study aimed at evaluating how the sampling site and the type of diagnostic test influence test results in children with suspected severe viral infection. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING PICUs at 21 tertiary pediatric referral centers in the United States. PATIENTS During the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons, we enrolled children (6 mo to 17 yr old) who were suspected to have severe viral infection. INTERVENTIONS We collected samples by using a standardized protocol for nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in nonintubated patients and for endotracheal tube aspirate and nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in intubated patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Viral testing included a single reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction influenza test and the GenMark Respiratory Viral Panel (20 viruses). We enrolled 90 endotracheally intubated and 133 nonintubated children. We identified influenza in 45 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing; the multiplex panel was falsely negative for influenza in two patients (4.4%). Six patients (13.3%) had not been diagnosed with influenza in the PICU. Non-influenza viruses were identified in 172 of 223 children (77.1%). In nonintubated children, the same virus was identified by nasopharyngeal flocked swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirate in 133 of 183 paired samples (72.7%), with +nasopharyngeal aspirate/-nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in 32 of 183 paired samples (17.4%). In intubated children, the same virus was identified by nasopharyngeal flocked swabs and endotracheal tube aspirate in 67 of 94 paired samples (71.3%), with +nasopharyngeal flocked swabs/- endotracheal tube aspirate in 22 of 94 paired samples (23.4%). Most discrepancies were either adenovirus or rhinovirus in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Standardized specimen collection and sensitive diagnostic testing with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction increased the identification of influenza in critically ill children. For most pathogenic viruses identified, results from nasopharyngeal flocked swabs agreed with those from nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates.","Randolph, Adrienne G; Agan, Anna A; Flanagan, Ryan F; Meece, Jennifer K; Fitzgerald, Julie C; Loftis, Laura L; Truemper, Edward J; Li, Simon; Ferdinands, Jill M",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,182,16

Immune-mediated neurological damages caused by COVID-19 are increasingly recognized. Case report A young male presented in March 2020 with a new-onset seizure. Later, he started to experience a severe headache. During the second admission in May, the MRI of the brain showed left frontal lesion. Nasal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, but the serology was positive, raising the suspicion of immune-mediated encephalitis. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G with two oligoclonal bands were also seen. The patient received IV immunoglobulin and showed improvement in headache. Follow-up MRIs of the brain revealed complete resolution of the lesion. Discussion Neurological complications from COVID-19 have been increasingly recognized. The proposed pathophysiology is either direct damage of neurological tissues, or indirectly through immune-mediated mechanisms. The timeline of the patient's presentation with seizure, as well as the lesion on the brain MRI with complete resolution after the IV immunoglobulin, strongly suggest that the patient had immune-mediated encephalitis after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions Several cases of encephalitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.

METHODS A convenience sample of 1569 people living in Italy responded to an online survey using virtual snowball sampling. The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, likelihood of infection, coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS Gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women. The scores on well-being were significantly lower in the current study than in a previous validation study. CONCLUSION The results of the study provided both theory and practical implications in understanding mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine.","Prati, Gabriele","Anxiety, stress, and coping",182,1

This study aimed to determine the reliability of an innovative cycling ergometer permitting the start of fatigue measurement within 1 s after cycling. METHODS Twelve subjects participated in two experimental sessions. Knee-extensor NMF was assessed by electrical nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation with both a traditional chair setup (PRE- and POST-Chair, 2 min postexercise) and the new cycling ergometer (PRE, every 3 min during incremental exercise and POST-Bike, at task failure). RESULTS The reduction in maximal voluntary contraction force POST-Bike (63% ± 12% PRE; P < 0.001) was not different between sessions and there was excellent reliability at PRE-Bike (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.97; coefficients of variation [CV], 3.2%) and POST-Bike. Twitch (Tw) and high-frequency paired-pulse (Db100) forces decreased to 53% ± 14% and 62% ± 9% PRE, respectively (P < 0.001). Both were reliable at PRE-Bike (Tw: ICC, 0.97; CV, 5.2%; Db100: ICC, 0.90; CV, 7.3%) and POST-Bike (Tw: ICC, 0.88; CV, 11.9; Db100: ICC, 0.62; CV, 9.0%). Voluntary activation did not change during the cycling protocol (P > 0.05). Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris M-wave and motor-evoked potential areas showed fair to excellent reliability (ICC, 0.45-0.88). The reduction in maximal voluntary contraction and Db100 was greater on the cycling ergometer than the isometric chair. CONCLUSIONS The innovative cycling ergometer is a reliable tool to assess NMF during and immediately postexercise. This will allow fatigue etiology during dynamic exercise with large muscle mass to be revisited in various populations and environmental conditions.","Doyle-Baker, Douglas; Temesi, John; Medysky, Mary E; Holash, Robert J; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,182,31

The word 'epidemic' has the potential to lead to chaotic, unreasoned responses to health problems, especially when used by journalists. Nigeria like other poor resource countries is equally affected by the current corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Standardization and proper documentation of the mortality of the COVID-19 in the poor resource countries will help in managing other disease outbreaks in future. This paper calls for improvement in capturing these data for better planning in the future. AREAS COVERED Quality data is very essential for policy makers to appreciate any disease condition. In order to present a comprehensive picture of COVID-19 mortality, the deaths were broadly grouped into two as follows: direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths. Most of the current reported deaths seem to be direct deaths. EXPERT OPINION We propose that for better estimation and standardization, verbal autopsy could be used to differentiate direct/indirect COVID deaths. At full development, this model could be applied to other diseases, outbreaks or pandemics. The disease surveillance officers, and other health workers can be trained in this regard as well as scaling up the e-surveillance of the DSNOs.","Mbanuzuru, Ahoma V; Okoro, Chukwuemeka C; Mbanuzuru, Chinyere M; Ibeh, Christian C",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,182,12

The aim of the present study is to compare mesh shrinkage and pain between two different techniques of mesh fixation in a prospective randomized trial. METHODS A randomized trial was performed. Patients with ventral hernia of maximal diameter 8 cm were assigned to mesh fixation using either transfascial nonabsorbable sutures or metal tacks for fixation of a parietene composite mesh. The borders of the mesh were marked using clips, and radiological images in prone position were used for assessment of mesh size and location. The primary endpoint was mesh shrinkage; secondary endpoints included postoperative pain, mesh dislocation, and surgical morbidity. RESULTS Demographic parameters were similar in both groups. A total of 40 patients were randomized, and 36 patients were available for follow-up. There was one hernia recurrence in each group. Pain was significantly higher following suture fixation after 6 weeks, but no difference was found after 6 months. Mesh shrinkage after 6 months was significantly higher using tacks for mesh fixation. CONCLUSIONS Transfascial sutures are associated with more pain within the first 6 postoperative weeks and less mesh shrinkage after 6 months compared with mesh fixation using metal tacks.","Beldi, Guido; Wagner, Markus; Bruegger, Lukas E; Kurmann, Anita; Candinas, Daniel",Surgical endoscopy,182,27

We investigated the role of a specific, highly salient health concern, namely the spread of the coronavirus, and associated COVID-19 disease, on moral disapproval. We hypothesized that individuals who report greater subjective worry about COVID-19 would be more sensitive to moral transgressions. Across three studies (N = 913), conducted March-May 2020 as the pandemic started to unfold in the United States, we found that individuals who were worried about contracting the infectious disease made harsher moral judgments than those who were relatively less worried. This effect was not restricted to transgressions involving purity, but extended to transgressions involving harm, fairness, authority, and loyalty, and remained when controlling for political orientation. Furthermore, for Studies 1 and 2 the effect also was robust when taking into account the contamination subscale of the Disgust Scale-Revised. These findings add to the growing literature that concrete threats to health can play a role in abstract moral considerations, supporting the notion that judgments of wrongdoing are not based on rational thought alone.","Henderson, Robert K; Schnall, Simone",Evolutionary psychology : an international journal of evolutionary approaches to psychology and behavior,182,17

Favipiravir is a repurposed antiviral agent in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to meet the current need, pharmaceutical companies are working for manufacturing licensed generic favipiravir. For getting the marketing authorization, the bioequivalence of the generic product must be proven first. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of a new favipiravir tablet formulation as compared to the reference tablet formulation in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS To prove the bioequivalence, a randomized, single oral dose, cross-over, two-period study was carried out in 30 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. Plasma favipiravir levels were quantified by using an in-house-developed high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (LC-MSD) method. RESULTS The 90% CIs for the test/reference geometric mean ratios of the Cmax and AUC0-tlast were 88.02 - 103.11% and 98.19 - 102.06%, respectively. CONCLUSION This single-dose study has shown that the test and reference favipiravir products met the required bioequivalence criteria. Besides, both products were well tolerated and safe.","Sağlam, Onursal; Güney, Berrak; Saraner, Nihal; Sevici, Gamze; Doğan-Kurtoğlu, Emel; Ulusoy, Merve G; Demiray, Gökçe; Nacak, Muradiye; Erenmemişoğlu, Aydın; Ozbek, Mahmut; Aytaç, Peri",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,182,12

The delivery and support of cells seeded throughout acellular scaffolds are typically conducted through the vascular axis of the tissues. However, it is unclear how cell concentration and injection frequency can affect the distribution of cells throughout the scaffold. Furthermore, what effects re-endothelialization have on vascular patency and function are not well understood. We investigated the use of ultrasound-guided photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging as a technique to visualize the distribution of microvascular endothelial cells within an optimized acellular construct upon re-endothelialization and perfusion conditioning. We also evaluated the vascular performance of the re-endothelialized scaffold using quantitative vascular corrosion casting (qVCC) and whole-blood perfusion. We found US/PA imaging was an effective technique to visualize the distribution of cells. Cellular retention following perfusion conditioning was also detected with US/PA imaging. Finally, we demonstrated that a partial recovery of vascular performance is possible following re-endothelialization-confirmed by fewer extravasations in qVCC and improved blood clearance following whole-blood perfusion. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Re-endothelialization is a method that enables decellularized tissue to become useful as a tissue engineering construct by creating a nutrient delivery and waste removal system for the entire construct. Our approach utilizes a decellularization method that retains the basement ECM of a highly vascularized tissue upon which endothelial cells can be injected to form an endothelium. The US/PA method allows for rapid visualization of cells within a construct several cm thick. This approach can be experimentally used to observe changes in cellular distribution over large intervals of time, to help optimize cell seeding parameters, and to verify cell retention within re-endothelialized constructs. This approach has temporal and depth advantages compared to section reconstruction and imaged fluorophores respectively.","Nagao, Ryan J; Ouyang, Yafei; Keller, Renee; Nam, Seung Yun; Malik, George R; Emelianov, Stanislav Y; Suggs, Laura J; Schmidt, Christine E",Acta biomaterialia,182,16

METHODS From 1994 to 2014, 1787 RFA procedures were performed percutaneously in 1162 patients with cirrhosis (852 Child A and 310 Child B) with HCC nodules (1.2-7 cm), prothrombin time >50%, platelet count of 50.000 mm3 and total bilirubin ranging from 0.80 to 4.5 mg dl-1. In 67 patients, RFA was performed on both intraparenchymal HCC nodule and tumour thrombus extended in the main portal vein and/or its branches. RESULTS Four patients (0.3%) died after RFA. 39 patients (3.2%) changed in Child's class: 26 out of 28 Child A patients with cirrhosis changed to Child B and 2 changed to Child C class; 11 Child B patients changed to Child C class. On multivariate analysis, the total bilirubin pre-RFA was the only independent risk factor for impairment of liver function and death. Complications were hemoperitoneum, abscess and intrahepatic haematoma. CONCLUSION RFA of HCC in patients with cirrhosis is safe, even in case of invasion of the portal venous system. Functional liver reserve should be strictly monitored, mainly when pre-RFA total bilirubin value is >2.5 mg dl-1. The study was approved by our institutional review board. Advances in knowledge: The total bilirubin value >2.5 mg dl-1 represents the main marker of functional liver reserve that predicts decompensation of liver cirrhosis in patients undergoing RFA for HCC.","Giorgio, Antonio; Merola, Maria G; Montesarchio, Luca; Merola, Francesca; Gatti, Pietro; Coppola, Carmine; Giorgio, Valentina; Calisti, Giorgio",The British journal of radiology,182,24

However, bedbugs are increasingly widespread in care settings, such as nursing homes, as well as in private homes visited by HCPs, leading to increased questions of how health care organizations and their staff ought to respond. This situation is associated with a range of ethical considerations including the duty of care, stigmatization, vulnerability, confidentiality, risks for third parties, and professional autonomy. In this article, we analyze these issues using a case study approach. We consider how patients whose living environments are infested with bedbugs can receive care in the community setting in a manner that supports their well-being, is consistent with fairness in care provision, and takes into account risks for HCPs and third parties. We also discuss limits and obstacles to the provision of care in these situations.","Laliberté, Maude; Hunt, Matthew; Williams-Jones, Bryn; Feldman, Debbie Ehrmann",HEC forum : an interdisciplinary journal on hospitals' ethical and legal issues,182,7

Dementia is one of the possible risk factors for falling and hip fracture, a potential source for complications during surgery and during the postoperative period, difficulties in rehabilitation and a risk factor for hip fracture reccurence. However, in previous studies of hip fracture patients, cognitive status has not been formally assessed during the inpatient stay and diagnosis was based only on previous history. Additionally, no previous studies have compared prevalence of dementia between elderly patients with hip fracture and patients with other surgical pathology. Our aim was to define whether dementia was more prevalent in older subjects with hip fracture than in other elderly patients undergoing surgery. In this study, we prospectively assessed all patients aged 68 and older admitted to our hospital for hip fracture surgery during a one year period and compared them with age and gender matched patients attending other surgical departments. 80 hip fracture patients and 80 controls were assessed for dementia. Dementia was common in both groups, presumably reflecting the advanced mean age of both groups and cognitive deterioration due to hospitalization-status. Dementia was significantly higher in the hip fracture group (85%) compared to the control group (61.5%; p=0.002). Dementia is very common in older patients admitted for surgery to a general hospital and extremely common in those with hip fracture. It seems that dementia is under diagnosed in elderly hospitalised patients. Our data confirm that dementia is a major risk factor for hip fracture in the elderly.","Yiannopoulou, Konstantina G; Anastasiou, Ioannis P; Ganetsos, Theodore K; Efthimiopoulos, Petros; Papageorgiou, Sokratis G",Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,182,1

We examined whether the increase in SmO2 by phenylephrine reflects veno-constriction and to secure filling of the veins, subjects were exposed to head-up tilt (HUT). Phenylephrine (0.2 mg) was administered to 10 healthy males (24 years (22-27; median with interquartile range)) during 40° HUT with SmO2, O2Hb and Hb determined for the biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscles. Changes in red cell volume within the thorax and thigh were evaluated by electrical admittance and brachial vein diameter determined by ultrasound. HUT accumulated blood in arms and legs as indicated by reduced thoracic and conversely enhanced thigh electrical admittance. Both over the arm and leg, HUT reduced SmO2 as a consequence of reduced O2Hb and increased Hb (p < .05). After 5 min HUT, phenylephrine increased MAP and total peripheral resistance, and both arm and thigh SmO2 increased due to a decrease in Hb and an increase in O2Hb. The results confirm that SmO2 decreases during HUT and demonstrate venous filling in the limbs. Furthermore, vasoconstriction during HUT is indicated by a decrease in O2Hb. Conversely, phenylephrine increased SmO2 likely illustrating increased muscle blood flow and venoconstriction as O2Hb increased while Hb was reduced.","Egesborg, Astrid H; Sørensen, Henrik; Olesen, Niels D; Secher, Niels H",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,182,1

Typically, the procedure necessitates five to seven small skin incisions for trocar placement. The senior author (AA Saber) has developed a three-trocar approach for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS Sixteen patients underwent triple-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between May 2009 and August 2009. The same surgeon performed all surgical interventions. The umbilicus was the main point of entry for all patients and the same operative technique and perioperative protocol were used in all patients. RESULTS A total of sixteen triple-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses were performed. The procedures were successfully performed in all patients. Mean operating time was 145.4 min. None of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. There were no mortalities or post-operative technical complications noted during the immediate post-operative period. CONCLUSION Three trocar laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is safe, technically feasible and reproducible. This technique may be considered a ""precursor"" to single-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","Saber, Alan A; Elgamal, Mohamed H; El-Ghazaly, Tarek H; Elian, Alain R; Dewoolkar, Aditya V; Akl, Abir Hassan",International journal of surgery,182,30

Cytomorphologic examination is essential and fundamental for diagnosis and may provide important clues to the nature of diseases. However, based on morphology alone, cytologic diagnosis of lymphocyte-rich effusions could be very challenging, particularly when the lymphocytes are small. Cytologists/cytopathologists might be uncertain when a lymphocyte-rich effusion specimen warrants a comprehensive hematopathologic workup. Herein we present a simple and practical algorithmic approach. On the basis of the cytomorphology of lymphocytes (small vs. large cells), presence or absence of cellular atypia, and clinical information (an earlier history or current lymphoma), the lymphocyte-rich effusion samples could be triaged for ancillary studies including immunophenotyping and molecular assays if indicated. Incorporation of cytomorphology, correlation with clinical information, and appropriate application of various ancillary techniques is mandatory for a correct diagnosis of lymphocyte-rich effusion specimens.","Liu, Chih-Yi; Chuang, Shih-Sung",Advances in anatomic pathology,182,10

In this report, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa-histidine tag was used as a fusion partner for the antitumor-analgesic peptide from the venom of Buthus martensii (Karsch) scorpion (AGAP). The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO-AGAP, was up to 40% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease (Ulp1) to obtain the recombinant AGAP (rAGAP), which was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purified final product was >95% pure by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the protein to be 7142.63 Dalton, which equaled the theoretically expected mass. N-terminal sequencing of rAGAP showed the sequence corresponded to the native protein. MTT assay indicated the rAGAP could significantly inhibit the proliferation of Jurkat and Hut 78 T lymphoma cell lines. The further writhing experiment showed that the rAGAP had an intensive analgesic effect.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of vessel curvature on recanalization results in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large-vessel occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 159 patients (70 ± 12.8 years of age; 79 women) treated for acute ischemic stroke after carotid T and/or MCA occlusion by using stent retrievers, the following angles were measured in standard anteroposterior angiograms to describe vessel anatomy: first, between the terminal ICA segment and the most downward curved M1 segment conterminous to the proximal face of the thrombus (ICA/M1 angle); second, between the most proximal M1 segment and the segment immediately conterminous to the thrombus (M1/M1 angle); and additionally, in patients with distal M1/proximal M2 occlusion, the angle of the last curvature proximal of the thrombus (M1/M2 angle). Angles of patients with-versus-without successful recanalization were compared. RESULTS Patients without successful recanalization (TICI 0-2a) showed significantly larger ICA/M1 angles (mean, 110°± 23.8° versus 69°± 28.7°, P < .001) and significantly larger M1/M1 angles (56°± 29.2° versus 29°± 26.6°, P = .001) than patients with successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3). In patients without successful recanalization after a distal M1 or proximal M2 occlusion, the M1/M2 angle was significantly larger than that in patients with successful recanalization (117° ± 34.3° versus 67° ± 29.5°, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS This retrospective analysis showed that mechanical thrombectomy in the anterior circulation was significantly less often successful in patients with large vessel angles. Therefore, vessel curvature significantly influences the results of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers for treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

As the outer diameter of the nails produced has not previously been described, we designed a study to measure the outer diameter of ACNs fashioned using commercially available and commonly utilized thoracostomy catheters of various sizes. METHODS Six thoracostomy catheters from 2 different manufactures (Argyle PVC Thoracic Catheters; Covidien Ltd and Atrium PVC Thoracic Catheters; Atrium Medical Corporation), ranging from 20 French to 40 French, were utilized in this study. Each catheter was filled with antibiotic-laden cement, and the most proximal segment (largest outer diameter) and most distal segment (smallest outer diameter) were detached for study. Once the cement was cured, the thoracostomy catheters were cut away and the segments were measured using a calibrated digital caliper (Mitutoyo Corp, Aurora, IL). Because the ACNs produced using the technique taper from proximal to distal according to the shape of the thoracostomy catheter design, data were recorded as a maximum and minimum outer diameter for each ACN produced by each of the 6 thoracostomy catheter sizes studied. All measurements were in millimeters and were rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a millimeter. RESULTS The ACNs produced using the various sized thoracostomy catheters had segments with outer diameters ranging from 4.2 mm to 11.2 mm. Both brands of catheters produced nails with similar distal diameters. Specifically, the mean distal diameter measurements were 4.2 mm for a 20 French catheter, 5.5 mm for a 24 French catheter, 6.6 mm for a 28 French catheter, 7.7 mm for a 32 French catheter, 8.4 mm for a 36 French catheter, and 9.9 mm for a 40 French catheter. The Argyle brand catheters produced nails with proximal diameters that increased with the catheter's size, from 7.1 mm for a 20 French catheter to 11.2 mm for a 40 French catheter. The Atrium brand catheters produced nails with a much tighter range of proximal diameters ranging from 9.4 mm to 11.1 mm. CONCLUSIONS Thoracostomy catheters are commonly utilized to produce ACNs. The results of our study confirm that the fabricated nails taper in diameter from proximal to distal. Knowledge of the specific dimensions of the ACN produced by each size thoracostomy catheter will aid the orthopaedic surgeon in selecting the right size based on the diameter of the medullary canal being treated.","Czajka, Cory M; Bauer, Ian N; Warner, Stephen J; Goytia, Robin N; Brinker, Mark R",Journal of orthopaedic trauma,182,7

METHODS A systematic search was conducted of the databases relevant to this area of research (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], PsycINFO, Central, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, IEEE, and ACM). There were no specific selection criteria relating to the participant group. Studies were included if they reported interventions with individual text-based synchronous conversations (ie, chat or text messaging) and a psychological outcome measure. RESULTS A total of 24 articles were included in this review. Interventions included a wide range of mental health targets (eg, anxiety, distress, depression, eating disorders, and addiction) and intervention design. Overall, compared with the waitlist (WL) condition, studies showed significant and sustained improvements in mental health outcomes following synchronous text-based intervention, and post treatment improvement equivalent but not superior to treatment as usual (TAU) (eg, face-to-face and telephone counseling). CONCLUSIONS Feasibility studies indicate substantial innovation in this area of mental health intervention with studies utilizing trained volunteers and chatbot technologies to deliver interventions.

At present, novel coronavirus pneumonia is widely spread around the world, with the characteristics of long incubation time, strong contagion, rapid progress, and high fatality rate. Inflammatory storm, also known as cytokine storm, has been found to play an important role in COVID-19 induced lung injury, and is believed to be one of the core pathological factors leading to exacerbation and even death of novel coronavirus pneumonia patients. It is found that over-expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 will lead to self-attack and aggressive inflammatory response, and finally cause tissue damage. Studies have shown that the intervention of inflammatory injury may be one of the important mechanisms that contribute to therapeutic effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine against COVID-19. Clinical studies found that early intervention with Traditional Chinese Medicine in novel coronavirus pneumonia patients could significantly alleviate signs and symptoms, shorten course of the disease, decrease possibility of the patients progressing into severe stage, slow or even block the outbreak of inflammatory storm in the patient's body, improve cure rate, reduce mortality, relieve sequelae, and promote the recovery of the patients in the recovery period. Through analyzing the representative prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Eighth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for COVID-19, we found the regulation on the inflammatory injury by Traditional Chinese Medicine is realized in a multitarget manner. On the one hand, some Chinese Medicines are exhibited with direct effects against proliferation of the virus;on the other hand, some Chinese Medicines are shown with ability to re-balance the immune system via regulating function of immune cells, decreasing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators. The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia has not yet ended, and the world is still under the attack of COVID-19 virus. Although previous studies have found that certain ingredients in Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as astragalin, astragaloside IV, platycodin and wogonin, etc., as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine prescription including Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Huashibaidu Decoction, etc., can control inflammatory injury, their specific mechanism and the material basis still need to be studied in depth. On the other hand, the objective indicator of Traditional Chinese Medicine for patients with different syndromes still needs to be further clarified to facilitate its promotion in clinic. The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and western medicine has been proved to be more effective in inhibiting the development of novel coronavirus pneumonia, but the role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the integrative therapy still needs to be further explored. Although there is still a lot of work to be carried out, the advantage of early intervention with Traditional Chinese Medicine against COVID-19 virus has been verified in both clinical and experimental studies. This paper aims to review mechanism and treatment strategy of Chinese Medicine on COVID-19 induced inflammation, and provide references for researchers in related area. © 2021, Science Press.

The main goal is to combine the main advantages of fractal theoretical concepts and fuzzy logic theory for achieving efficient control of nonlinear dynamic systems. The concept coming from Fractal theory, known as the fractal dimension, can be utilized to measure the complexity of the dynamic behavior of a non-linear plant. On the other hand, fuzzy logic theory can be used to represent and capture the expert knowledge in controlling a plant. In addition, fuzzy logic enables to manage the uncertainty involved in the decision-making process for achieving efficient control of a non-linear plant. We illustrate the proposed fuzzy fractal control method with the current worldwide situation that requires achieving an efficient control of the COVID-19 pandemics.","Castillo, Oscar Melin Patricia","Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals",182,29

These are available at a fine geographic resolution (mostly at the county level) and are updated daily. The COVIDcast API also tracks all revisions to historical data, allowing modelers to account for the frequent revisions and backfill that are common for many public health data sources. All of the data is available in a common format through the API and accompanying R and Python software packages.

COVID-19 vaccines uptake appears to have an essential role in the successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To examine predictors of COVID-19 vaccination uptake and reasons for decline of vaccination. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review. We searched Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, and a pre-print service (medRxiv) from inception to July 12, 2021. We used the following key-words: vaccin*, COVID-19, and uptake. We included all types of studies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods) reporting COVID-19 vaccination uptake. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021267460). Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. COVID-19 vaccination uptake ranged from 28.6% to 98% in the general population, while among healthcare workers ranged from 33.3% to 94.5%, and among patients ranged from 36% to 80%. The main predictors of COVID-19 vaccination uptake were male gender, white race, older age, higher socioeconomic status, higher self-perceived COVID-19 vulnerability, increased information about COVID-19 vaccines, and chronic illness. The most important reasons for decline of vaccination were concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, illness, medication, pregnancy, fertility, breastfeeding, religious reasons, ethical reasons, previous COVID-19 diagnosis, self-estimation that COVID-19 is not a severe disease, and limited knowledge about the vaccines. Conclusions: Several factors affect COVID-19 vaccination uptake, while various reasons affect people decision to refuse to take a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings are essential to further enhance our understanding of COVID-19 vaccination uptake and design specific interventions. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, our findings have major implications for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccination programmes in the public with special attention to people who are undecided or unlikely to take a COVID-19 vaccine.","Galanis, P.

It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently. According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19 positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","Mann, P.; Jain, S.; Mittal, S.; Bhat, A.","2021 International Conference on Intelligent Technologies, CONIT 2021",182,28

It represents all internet-based software, any other solutions for communications or employees’ sharing without any formal authorization or approval from the IT department. Such behavior can lead to a security breach of the organization’s data privacy, as these risks could disseminate it without the organization fully knowing. Recent research identifies that shadow IT is rarely covered from the knowledge sharing and knowledge protection (KP) perspective. This paper aims to provide an insight on how mobile shadow IT as a phenomenon could impact KP of an organization as a whole. Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory study based on a qualitative approach. The authors conducted interviews with 11 IT users to answer the main research question. The interview guidelines were divided into three parts: types of mobile shadow IT and occurrence;KP nature in the workplace;and mobile shadow IT impact on KP. Findings: The research findings identified that most interviewees use mobile shadow IT without any notice or permission from their IT departments. This sharing also negatively impacts the KP in the organization. The most common mobile shadow IT applications are the clouded type like Dropbox, Google Drive and WhatsApp. Interviewees are using mobile shadow IT mainly because organizations do not provide suitable tools to communicate efficiently. The authors concluded that mobile shadow IT harms KP with no security and privacy on what is being shared because this process is unmonitored by the organization. Practical implications: For adequate knowledge and data protection, IT departments need to take more actions and efforts. This study can help IT decision-makers cope with the technology changes while understanding mobile shadow IT impacts. This study also offers insight regarding types of applications that can be used as an alternative tool for employees rather than using unauthorized applications. This research shows that medium-sized organizations are free to use these applications, which can cause damage to organizations. Originality/value: This research is arguably among the first to explore the interviewees’ perspectives on how mobile shadow IT impacts KP. This paper also provides theoretical and practical insights by identifying the three primary constructs and how mobile shadow IT usage can affect KP. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abbas, M.; Alghail, A.",VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems,182,20

Likewise, the arrival of tourists in residential settings has led to a wide range of positive and negative impacts, resulting in conflicts between different stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether there is variation in the perception of the impacts associated with peer-to-peer accommodation platforms among different stakeholders? Additionally, it also seeks to investigate what kind of impacts generate the highest level of conflict among stakeholders? Design/methodology/approach: Given the relative novelty of the problem, this paper proposes an exploratory study that sheds light on some of the main issues with the purpose of supporting further research in the future. The aim is to analyze which impacts are perceived as more positive or negative by each group and to create indexes of conflict for these groups regarding their perception of the impacts. This study is based on fieldwork carried out in April 2020, which consists of 600 online surveys of local residents in the city of Granada. This city, one of Spain’s main tourist spots, suffers the highest tourist pressure in the country. Findings: The exploratory study suggests that the greatest consensus is generated in the assessment of economic impacts, either negative or positive. The greatest conflicts are related to the assessment of the effect of this activity on housing preservation. The group comprising accommodation owners of tourist flats is the one that shows a more dissenting opinion from the rest, confronting especially the group formed by citizens whose income depends on tourism. Originality/value: There is a lack of studies on the perception of tourism impacts associated with online tourism rental platforms. This is the first study to analyze both, how the main stakeholders associated with this activity assess the different impacts derived from this form of tourist accommodation as a whole and the conflicts derived from such an assessment. An additional innovation is that the analysis investigates the potential fear of disease transmission caused by tourists. It would be interesting to continue this research by applying the same questionnaire in different environments, such as rural areas or societies with different structures from the one analyzed here.

A key determinant of infection is the attachment of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Because of the presumed zoonotic origin of SC2, there is no practical way to assess every species susceptibility to SC2 by direct challenge studies. In an effort to have a better predictive model of animal host susceptibility to SC2, we expressed the ACE2 and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes from humans and other animal species in the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, that is not permissive to infection. We demonstrated that expression of both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes is necessary to support SC2 infection and replication in DF1 and a non-permissive sub-lineage of MDCK cells. Titers of SC2 in these cell lines were comparable to those observed in control Vero cells. To further test the model, we developed seven additional transgenic cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 derived from Felis (cat), Equus (horse), Sus (pig), Capra (goat), Mesocricetus (Golden hamster), Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown bat) and Hipposideros armiger (Great Roundleaf bat) in DF1 cells. Results demonstrate permissive replication of SC2 in cat, Golden hamster, and goat species, but not pig or horse, which correlated with the results of reported challenge studies. The development of this cell culture model allows for more efficient testing of the potential susceptibility of many different animal species for SC2 and emerging variant viruses. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) is believed to have originated in animal species and jumped into humans where it has produced the greatest viral pandemic of our time. Identification of animal species susceptible to SC2 infection would provide information on potential zoonotic reservoirs, and transmission potential at the human-animal interface. Our work provides a model system to test the ability of the virus to replicate in an otherwise non-permissive cell line by transgenic insertion of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from human and other animal species. The results from our in vitro model positively correlate with animal infection studies enhancing the predicative capability of the model. Importantly, we demonstrate that both proteins are required for successful virus replication. These findings establish a framework to test other animal species for susceptibility to infection that may be critical zoonotic reservoirs for transmission, as well as to test variant viruses that arise over time.","Kapczynski, Darrell R.; Sweeney, Ryan; Suarez, David L.; Spackman, Erica; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary",bioRxiv,182,25

Therefore, initiatives must be adopted to prevent the same result in the second lockdown in 2021 for the well-being of patients. Method: This statistical analysis aimed to assess the rise in BGL of diabetic patients before and during the lockdown. A survey was conducted among the DM patients in the Bangladeshi cohort, who came from various socioeconomic backgrounds and included both men and women. The statistical modelling, performed with the help of stat-ease software, was conducted by applying the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method to Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Result: Out of the 3 models applied (quadratic, main effect and the sequential sum of squares for 2 factor interaction (2FI)) in 2 different response vectors the 2FI model was the best suited (p-value - 0.0441 and 0.0015).

Mtb has a complex cell envelope – a partially covalently linked composite of polysaccharides, peptidoglycan and lipids, including a mycolic acid layer – which conveys pathogenicity but also protects against antibiotics. Given previous successes in treating gram-positive and -negative infections with cell wall degrading enzymes, we investigated such approach for Mtb. Objectives (i) Development of an Mtb microtiter growth inhibition assay that allows undisturbed cell envelope formation, to overcome the invalidation of results by typical clumped Mtb-growth in surfactant-free assays. (ii) Exploring anti-Mtb potency of cell wall layer-degrading enzymes. (iii) Investigation of the concerted action of several such enzymes. Methods We inserted a bacterial luciferase-operon in an auxotrophic Mtb strain to develop a microtiter assay that allows proper evaluation of cell wall degrading anti-Mtb enzymes. We assessed growth-inhibition by enzymes (recombinant mycobacteriophage mycolic acid esterase (LysB), fungal α-amylase and human and chicken egg white lysozymes) and combinations thereof, in presence or absence of biopharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. Results Our biosafety level-2 assay identified both LysB and lysozymes as potent Mtb-inhibitors, but only in presence of surfactant. Moreover, most potent disruption of the mycolic acid hydrophobic barrier was obtained by the highly synergistic combination of LysB, α-amylase and polysorbate 80. Conclusions Synergistically acting cell wall degrading enzymes are potently inhibiting Mtb – which sets the scene for the design of specifically tailored antimycobacterial (fusion) enzymes. Airway delivery of protein therapeutics has already been established and should be studied in animal models for active TB.","van Schie, Loes; Borgers, Katlyn; Michielsen, Gitte; Plets, Evelyn; Vuylsteke, Marnik; Tiels, Petra; Festjens, Nele; Callewaert, Nico",bioRxiv,182,1

We focus on the I-states, Lakes states and Great Plains states. The models in the study capture both short-term and long-term impacts of policy changes on land values.FindingsThe authors find that changes in the federal funds rate have long-lasting impacts on farmland values, as it takes at least a decade for the full effects of an interest rate change to be capitalized in farmland values. The results show that the three recent federal funds rate cuts in 2019 were not sufficient to offset the downward pressures from the 2015–2018 interest rate hikes, but the 2020 cut is.

The algorithm first performs an exhaustive search through a discrete set of widely dispersed solutions which are representative of large subregions of the search space;then, it uses the search results to initialize a Monte Carlo process that searches quasi-randomly for a best solution;then, it finally uses a Newton-type iteration to converge to a solution that satisfies mathematical conditions of local optimality. We demonstrate our methodology on an epidemiological model of the coronavirus disease with testing and distancing controls applied over a period of 180 days to two different subpopulations (low-risk and high-risk), where model parameters are chosen to fit the city of Houston, Texas, USA. In order to enable the user to select his/her preferred trade-off between (number of deaths) and (herd immunity) outcomes, the objective function includes costs for deaths and non-immunity. Optimal strategies are estimated for a grid of (death cost) × (non-immunity cost) combinations, in order to obtain a Pareto curve that represents optimum trade-offs. The levels of the four controls for the different Pareto-optimal solutions over the 180-day period are visually represented and their characteristics discussed. Three different variants of the algorithm are run in order to determine the relative importance of the three stages in the optimization. Results from the three algorithm variants are fairly consistent, indicating that solutions are robust. Results also show that the Monte Carlo stage plays an especially prominent role in the optimization, but that all three stages of the process make significant contributions towards finding lower-cost, more effective control strategies.","Tamayo, Luis Vargas Mbazumutima Vianney Thron Christopher Todjihounde Léonard",Mathematics,182,7

While EGCG has anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects, its acute effects on cognition are not well understood. Furthermore, despite widespread green tea consumption, little is known about how EGCG and caffeine co-administration impact behavior. Here, we investigated the effects of multiple doses of either EGCG or caffeine on a rat model of risk-taking. This was assessed using the risky decision-making task (RDT), in which rats choose between a small, safe reward and a large reward with escalating risk of mild footshock. Rats were tested in RDT after acute systemic administration of EGCG, caffeine, or joint EGCG and caffeine. EGCG caused a dose dependent reduction in risk-taking without affecting reward discrimination or task engagement. Caffeine did not impact risk taking, but elevated locomotor activity and reduced task engagement at high doses. Finally, exposure to both EGCG and caffeine had no effect on risk-taking, suggesting that low-dose caffeine is sufficient to mask the risk-aversion caused by EGCG. These data suggest EGCG as a potential therapeutic treatment for psychological disorders that induce compulsive risky decision-making.","Liley, A. E.; Joyner, H.; Gabriel, D. B. K.; Simon, N.

In cells, individual telomeres form distinct globules of finite size that appear to be smaller than expected for bare DNA. Moreover, upon changes in their protein composition, telomeres can cluster to form telomere-induced-foci (TIFs) or co-localize with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. The physical basis for collapse of individual telomeres and coalescence of multiple ones remains unclear, as does the relationship between these two phenomena. By combining single-molecule measurements, optical microscopy, turbidity assays, and simulations, we show that the telomere scaffolding protein TRF2 can condense individual DNA chains and drives coalescence of multiple DNA molecules, leading to phase separation and the formation of liquid-like droplets. Addition of the TRF2 binding protein hRap1 modulates phase boundaries and tunes the specificity of solution demixing while simultaneously altering the degree of DNA compaction. Our results suggest that the condensation of single telomeres and formation of biomolecular condensates containing multiple telomeres are two different outcomes driven by the same set of molecular interactions. Moreover, binding partners, such as other telomere components, can alter those interactions to promote single-chain DNA compaction over multiple-chain phase separation.","Soranno, Andrea; Incicco, J.

Average sports-related costs of hosting are $12.0 billion. Non-sports-related costs are typically several times that. Every Olympics since 1960 has run over budget, at an average of 172 percent in real terms, the highest overrun on record for any type of megaproject. The paper tests theoretical statistical distributions against empirical data for the costs of the Games, in order to explain the cost risks faced by host cities and nations. It is documented, for the first time, that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution. Olympic costs are subject to infinite mean and variance, with dire consequences for predictability and planning. We name this phenomenon""regression to the tail"": it is only a matter of time until a new extreme event occurs, with an overrun larger than the largest so far, and thus more disruptive and less plannable. The generative mechanism for the Olympic power law is identified as strong convexity prompted by six causal drivers: irreversibility, fixed deadlines, the Blank Check Syndrome, tight coupling, long planning horizons, and an Eternal Beginner Syndrome. The power law explains why the Games are so difficult to plan and manage successfully, and why cities and nations should think twice before bidding to host. Based on the power law, two heuristics are identified for better decision making on hosting. Finally, the paper develops measures for good practice in planning and managing the Games, including how to mitigate the extreme risks of the Olympic power law.","Flyvbjerg, Bent; Budzier, Alexander; Lunn, Daniel",,182,16

During the national lockdown of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we developed and launched a Web App (Gestioemocional.cat) to promote emotional self-care in the general population and facilitate contact with healthcare professionals. Methods: Gestioemocional.cat targeted all individuals aged 18 years or more and was designed by adapting the contents of a mobile App for adjuvant treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (i.e., the PTSD Coach App) to the general population and the pandemic/lockdown scenario. We retrospectively assessed the utilization pattern of the Web App using data systematically retrieved from Google Analytics. Data were grouped into three time periods, defined using a join point analysis of COVID-19 incidence in our area: first wave, between-wave period, and second wave. Results: The resulting Web App, maintains the navigation structure of the PTSD Coach App, with three main modules: tools for emotional self-care, a self-assessment test, and professional resources for on-demand contact. The self-assessment test combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and offers professional contact in the advent of a high level of depression and anxiety; contact is prioritized according to a screening questionnaire administered at the time of obtaining individual consent to be contacted. The tools for emotional self-care can be accessed either on-demand or symptom-driven. The utilization analysis showed a high number of weekly accesses during the first wave. In this period, press releases regarding critical events of the pandemic progression and government decisions on containment measures were followed by a utilization peak, irrespective of the sense (i.e., positive or negative) of the information. Positive information pieces (e.g., relaxation of containment measures due to a reduction of COVID-19 cases) resulted in a sharp increase in utilization immediately after information release, followed by a successive decline in utilization.

Patients with a single diagnosis of RA (ICD-10 code) before the diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Patients missing age or sex, under 18 years of age on COVID-19 diagnosis date, or having less than 15 months of activity prior to COVID-19 diagnosis in the data source were excluded. We described demographics, comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 outcomes, including death, hospitalization, ICU admission, and acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI) identified between 14 days prior to and 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Mean and standard deviation (SD) was reported for continuous variables. For categorical variables, count (N) and proportion was reported. Results: We identified 2,948 patients diagnosed with RA and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (mean age± SD: 62 years ± 16, 77% female, 68% white). Of all identified patients, 38% were current or former smokers. For the 2,614 patients with BMI recorded, 78% were overweight or obese (mean BMI±SD: 31.2±8.3). The mean Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 3.6 (SD 3.2), with 87% of the study cohort having one or more comorbid condition, including hypertension (55%), type 2 diabetes (26%), COPD (20%), moderate to severe asthma (17%), coronary artery disease (17%), chronic kidney disease (13%), and heart failure (13%). Severe COVID-19 outcomes occurred in 618 (21%) patients. Among all RA patients with COVID-19, 137 patients (4.6%) experienced ARI, 484 patients (16.4%) were hospitalized (including 174 (5.9%) admitted to the ICU), and 155 patients (5.3%) died. Conclusion: Underlying medical conditions that are known or possible risk factors of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population are common in this RA cohort from a large national EHR database. However, whether patients with RA are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcome than the general population requires adjustment by age and other important confounders.","Ye, Y.; Yue, X.; Krueger, W.; Wegrzyn, L.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,182,1

Previous morphological evidence suggested that the TGN enlarged significantly under this condition. In the present study we have used stereological procedures to estimate the volume and surface area of the Golgi stack and the TGN of baby hamster kidney cells under different conditions. The results indicate that the increase in the size of the TGN at 20 degrees C is accompanied by a significant decrease in the surface area and volume of the preceding Golgi compartments. A similar effect is also seen in uninfected cells at 20 degrees C, as well as during normal (37 degrees C) infection with Semliki Forest virus. In the latter case, however, the decrease in the size of the Golgi stack and the increase in that of the TGN is not accompanied by inhibition of transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface.

Monoclonal antibody CC1 directed against BGP specifically inhibited infection of DBT, Sac-, GT1-7, and OBL21 cells by wild-type MHV-4 and the neuron-adapted variant OBLV60. Binding to this receptor was necessary to establish infection by cell-free MHV; however, the presence of BGP was not required for infection by cell-associated virus. Cell-associated infectious induced syncytium formation on Vero and BHK cells, which lack murine BGP; this activity was not inhibited by monoclonal antibody CC1. Antibody CC1 also did not prevent syncytium formation on DBT cells, which bear BGP. In infectious center assays, the MHV-4 variant OBLV60, which exhibits acid-dependent fusion, spread to cells lacking BGP only when exposed to acidic media. Therefore, spike-mediated fusion was required for BGP-independent spread of MHV infection. Furthermore, BGP-independent, cell-associated spread of MHV-4 was prevented by monoclonal antibodies 5A13.5 and 5B19.2 directed against the spike glycoprotein, but not by other neutralizing and nonneutralizing anti-spike antibodies. Expression of spike glycoprotein by recombinant vaccinia virus resulted in fusion of BGP-negative cells; monoclonal antibodies 5A13.5 and 5B19.2 strongly inhibited spike-mediated fusion in this assay.","Nash, T C; Buchmeier, M J",Virology,182,33

We demonstrated previously that the plant-infecting reovirus Rice dwarf virus (RDV) exploits multivesicular compartments for the transport and release of viral particles from infected insect vector cells. These multivesicular compartments contain small vesicles and, morphologically, they resemble previously reported endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) exploited by enveloped RNA viruses during budding from the plasma membrane of infected cells. Electron microscopy revealed that, at a late stage of infection, RDV virions are released, together with small vesicles similar to secreted vesicles (exosomes), from infected cells. The incorporation of lysosomes into the multivesicular compartments raised the possibility that functions of host MVBs are required for the efficient release of RDV virions from infected insect vector cells. An actin-myosin transport system has been shown to mediate the transport of these multivesicular compartments. In this addendum, we provide evidence for the proposed model of release of RDV virions from infected insect vector cells that exploits secretory exosomes derived from MVBs.","Wei, Taiyun; Hibino, Hiroyuki; Omura, Toshihiro",Communicative & integrative biology,182,27

METHODS The serum anti-coronavirus IgG antibody titer in medical personnel who had closely contacted with SARS patients, healthy individuals, patients with community acquired pneumonia and patients recovered from SARS was detected by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The antibody titer was expressed as the value of absorbency (A) with common logarithm conversion. RESULTS The serum anti-coronavirus IgG antibody titer in patients recovered from SARS was 0.07 +/- 0.13, which was significantly higher as compared with those in other groups. The antibody titer in medical personnel was -1.18 +/- 0.20, which was also significantly higher as compared with those in community acquired pneumonia patients and healthy persons. In the healthy persons, the antibody titer of serum samples obtained from Beijing in May, 2003 was -1.61 +/- 0.13, which was significantly higher than that of samples obtained from Beijing in 2001 when SARS was not found -1.76 +/- 0.25 and that of samples from Shandong province where SARS was not found in May, 2003 -1.95 +/- 0.44. There was no significant difference in the antibody titer between patients of bacterial pneumonia and patients of atypical pneumonia, which was -1.99 +/- 0.31 and -2.05 +/- 0.23 respectively. CONCLUSION Close contact with SARS patients can cause the serum anti-coronavirus antibody titer to increase significantly in medical personnel, a phenomenon deserves further study.","Liu, You-ning; Fan, Bao-xing; Fang, Xiang-qun; Yu, Bing-xiang; Chen, Liang-an",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,182,17

Hip BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Surface electromyography data recorded from the adductor longus muscle were processed to obtain vibration-induced reflex myoelectrical activity. Changes in plasma sclerostin (SOST) levels with WBV were expressed as a standardized vibration-induced SOST index. RESULTS The standardized vibration-induced SOST index was 1.03 ± 0.24 in the low BMD group and 0.99 ± 0.33 in the normal BMD group. For plasma SOST levels, no group-by-time interaction was found. The resting myoelectrical activities of adductor muscles increased significantly during WBV in both groups. However, there was no significant difference in the main effects of WBV on resting myoelectrical activity between the groups. The standardized vibration-induced plasma SOST index was found to be a significant independent predictor of the standardized vibration-induced reflex myoelectrical activity of the adductor muscle in both groups.

BACKGROUND Although biomedicine is the mainstream medical system in Hong Kong, many people employ complementary and alternative medicine in dealing with their chronic health problems. Practising qigong is one of the most popular forms of complementary and alternative medicine used among chronically ill patients. Little is known about the experiences of the chronically ill patients practising qigong in the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and even less is known how this practice is related to the social context of Hong Kong during the outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS Qualitative methods using participant-observation from three qigong classes in Hong Kong and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 30 participants were employed. Content analysis and discourse analysis were used to identify major themes of the data. RESULTS Both the underlying and trigger motivations could motivate these chronically ill participants to practise qigong. Legitimacy of qigong in health maintenance, deterioration of health and unpleasant experiences in biomedical treatment on their chronic illnesses served as the underlying motivations. Stigmatization of and discrimination against the chronically ill and the sense of searching coping strategy during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak further motivated their practice. CONCLUSION To the participants, practising qigong not only could strengthen their health, but was also a coping strategy for them to regain an active control and the sense of security in their health and enabled them to overcome the social stigmatization and discrimination during the outbreak. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE. Searching for emotional support and a more active role in health conditions could be seen from the chronically ill participants. Understanding and paying more attention to the particular needs of the chronically ill patients can enable health-care professionals to provide better care and support for the chronically ill during an epidemic crisis.","Siu, Judy Yuen-Man; Sung, Huei-Chuan; Lee, Wen-Li",Journal of clinical nursing,182,1

Barriers to reduce contamination of food by workers.,14.093025,2.680601,2010,"OBJECTIVES Hospital Acquired Infection (HAI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hemato-oncology. The study aims to report the incidence of hospital-acquired infections in patients with hematological malignancies and the risk factors associated with them. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational study with cross-sectional data collection was carried out from January 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020, in the department of hematology of Brazzaville University Hospital. The study concerned 77 patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies admitted for a course of chemotherapy. Written consent was obtained from each participant. Participants were divided into two groups: with HAI (n=50) and without HAI (n=27). They were compared using the chi-square test and Student's T-test. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the association of HAI with all the risk factors were performed for analysis of the 2 x k contingency tables and repeated using logistic regression. RESULTS The cumulative incidence was 64.9% with a 95% confidence interval of [53.8-74.7]. The time to onset of HAIs was 10.6±6.50 days. The incidence of HAI was significantly greater in acute myelogenous leukemia (80%), grade 4 neutropenia (80%). The risk factors were hospitalization stay of over 14 days (OR: 1.09), the regimen: daunorubicin-aracytine (OR: 5.96), the hemoglobin level on admission (OR: 0.72), and the neutropenia of grade 4 (OR: 7.9). The most common clinically identified focus of infection was peripheral venous infections. The fatality rate was 10%. CONCLUSION The determination of HAI and the identification of its risk factors make it possible to establish prevention strategies.","Ngolet, Lydie Ocini; Bolenga Liboko, Alexis Fortuné; Ossibi Ibara, Bienvenu Roland; Elira Dokekias, Alexis",American journal of blood research,182,1

In Part A of the trial, 321 cows on 15 farms were randomly assigned to either vaccination or placebo groups. On eight farms, 50% of the dams were vaccinated, while on the other seven farms, 80% of the dams were vaccinated. In Part B of the trial, 26 farms were randomly assigned to either a total vaccination program or to no vaccination program. Mortality, disease occurrence and weight gains were recorded on all calves for the first two weeks of life. In Part A, 23.5% of all calves were treated in the first two weeks of life, 20.9% were treated specifically for scours and 3.6% of live-born calves died. Enteropathogenic E. coli was identified on 13 of the 15 farms, rotavirus on 11 and coronavirus on ten. At least one of the three potential pathogens was found on every farm. There were no significant differences between calves from placebo-treated and vaccine-treated dams with regard to the proportion treated for all diseases, or for scours, or the proportion which died. Neither were there differences in days to first treatment for all diseases (seven days on average), days to first scour (6.7 days), duration of treatments (3.9 days for all diseases, 3.7 days for scours), or estimated weight gains (0.5 kg/day to 14 days). These results were not altered when the presence or absence of enteropathogenic E. coli, rotavirus or coronavirus on the premises was accounted for.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Waltner-Toews, D; Martin, S W; Meek, A H; McMillan, I; Crouch, C F",Canadian journal of comparative medicine : Revue canadienne de medecine comparee,182,15

Starting with the construction of first DNA microarrays in the 1990s, microarray technology has flourished in the last years and many different new formats have been developed. Peptide and protein microarrays are now applied for the elucidation of interaction partners, modification sites and enzyme substrates. Antibody microarrays are envisaged to be of high importance for the high-throughput determination of protein abundances in translational profiling approaches. First cell microarrays have been constructed to transform microarray technology from an in vitro technology to an in vivo functional analysis tool. All of these approaches share a common prerequisite: the solid support on which they are generated. The demands on this solid support are thereby as manifold as the applications themselves. This review is aimed to display the recent developments in surface chemistry and derivatization, and to summarize the latest developments in the different application areas of microarray technology.","Sobek, Jens; Bartscherer, Kerstin; Jacob, Anette; Hoheisel, Jvrg D; Angenendt, Philipp",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,182,28

A total of 812 people died due to respiratory insufficiency. Close contact with symptomatic patients appeared to be the main route of transmission. However, potential transmission by blood transfusion could not be definitely excluded. Two real-time SARS-specific PCR assays were assessed for their sensitivities, agreement of test results, and intra-assay variabilities. Both assays rely on reverse transcription and amplification of extracted RNA. Dilutions of gamma-irradiated cell culture supernatants of SARS CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were prepared to determine the precisions, linear ranges, and accuracies of the assays. The linear range for the Artus RealArt HPA-Coronavirus assay (Artus assay) was 1 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(7) copies/ml, and that for the Roche LightCycler SARS CoV Quantification kit (Roche assay) was 1 x 10(4) to 2 x 10(8) copies/ml. The detection limit of the Roche assay was 3,982.1 copies/ml, whereas that of the Artus assay was 37.8 copies/ml. Detection limits were calculated with a standard preparation that was recommended for use by the World Health Organization. However, quantification of CoV in this preparation may be imprecise. In summary, both assays are suitable for quantitative measurement of SARS CoV at the high concentrations expected in sputum samples. The Artus assay is also suitable for detection of SARS CoV at the low concentrations found in serum samples.","Hourfar, Michael K; Roth, W Kurt; Seifried, Erhard; Schmidt, Michael",Journal of clinical microbiology,182,16

During laparoscopic sterilization, the 5-mm port site was closed initially. Large bowel herniation was recognized at the end of the case and managed immediately by laparoscopically reducing the hernia and closing the port site without any short- or long-term complications. Trocar-site bowel hernia is a rare complication after laparoscopic surgery. It is usually associated with trocar size > 10 mm. We describe a case of bowel herniation through a 5-mm trocar site, which was managed after laparoscopic surgery. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old multigravid patient underwent a laparoscopic tubal fulguration. Two 5-mm ports were used for the procedure. At the end of the procedure, the lateral trocar site was found to have fat protrusion that looked like appendices epiploicae. A laparoscopic camera was reintroduced into the abdominal cavity that showed a large bowel herniation through the 5-mm lateral port site. The hernia was reduced laparoscopically, and the fascial defect was repaired. CONCLUSION Bowel herniation can occur through a 5-mm port. All port sites should be closed to avoid such complications.","Khurshid, Nauman; Chung, Maurice; Horrigan, Terrence; Manahan, Kelly; Geisler, John P",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,182,28

In all CTL epitopes prone to escape, only a subset of all potential variants is generally detected, even though many of the changes that are not selected would result in evasion of the T cell response. It is postulated that these unselected mutations significantly impair virus fitness. To define more precisely the basis for this preferential selection, we combine x-ray crystallographic studies of the MHC class I (D(b))/S510 complexes with viral reverse genetics to identify a prominent TCR contact residue (tryptophan at position 4) prone to escape mutations. The data show that a mutation that is commonly detected in chronically infected mice (tryptophan to arginine) potently disrupts the topology of the complex, explaining its selection. However, other mutations at this residue, which also abrogate the CTL response, are never selected in vivo even though they do not compromise virus fitness in acutely infected animals or induce a significant de novo CTL response. Thus, while structural analyses of the S510/D(b) complex provide a strong basis for why some CTL escape variants are selected, our results also show that factors other than effects on virus fitness limit the diversification of CD8 T cell epitopes.","Butler, Noah S; Theodossis, Alex; Webb, Andrew I; Dunstone, Michelle A; Nastovska, Roza; Ramarathinam, Sri Harsha; Rossjohn, Jamie; Purcell, Anthony W; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,182,17

At present, diagnosis COVID-19 were based on real-time RT-PCR, which have to be performed in biosafe laboratory and is unsatisfactory for suspect case screening. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body detection in suspected COVID-19 cases. METHODS In the prospective cohort, 150 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang province, China, between January 20 to February 2, 2020. All patients were tested by the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for COVID-19. At least two samples of each patient were collected for RT-PCR assay analysis, and the PCR results were performed as the reference standard of diagnosis. Meanwhile 26 heathy blood donor were recruited. The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated. Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity. RESULTS The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993]. In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result. In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970]. CONCLUSIONS The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19. Further investigations should be done to evaluate this assay in variety of clinical settings and populations.","Shen, Bo; Zheng, Yufen; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Weituo; Wang, Donglian; Jin, Jie; Lin, Rong; Zhang, Ying; Zhu, Guangjun; Zhu, Hongguo; Li, Jun; Xu, Jiaqin; Ding, Xianhong; Chen, Shiyong; Lu, Ruyue; He, Zebao; Zhao, Haihong; Ying, Lingjun; Zhang, Chao; Lv, Dongqing; Chen, Baofu; Chen, Jiya; Zhu, Jiansheng; Hu, Bingjie; Hong, Chenliang; Xu, Xiangyu; Chen, Jiaxi; Liu, Chong; Zhou, Kai; Li, Jing; Zhao, Guoling; Shen, Weixiang; Chen, Chunfeng; Shao, Chunyan; Shen, Xiaoying; Song, Jingjing; Wang, Zhipeng; Meng, Ying; Wang, Chao; Han, Junsong; Chen, Aojun; Lu, Daru; Qian, Biyun; Chen, Haixiao; Gao, Hengjun",American journal of translational research,182,33

Involvement of AYAs in treatment decisions might support adherence to medical treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of AYAs, aged 15 to 20 years, in cancer treatment decision making (TDM). METHODS: Using interpretive focused ethnography, we conducted interviews with 16 AYAs (total of 31 interviews) receiving cancer treatment within 1 year of diagnosis. Participants reflected on a major recent TDM experience (eg, clinical trial, surgery) and other treatment decisions. RESULTS: Participants distinguished important major cancer treatment decisions from minor supportive care decisions. We identified 3 common dimensions related to AYAs' involvement in cancer TDM: (1) becoming experienced with cancer, (2) import of the decision, and (3) decision-making roles. The preferences of AYAs for participation in TDM varied over time and by type of decision. We have proposed a 3-dimensional model to illustrate how these dimensions might interact to portray TDM during the first year of cancer treatment for AYAs. CONCLUSIONS: As AYAs accumulate experience in making decisions, their TDM preferences might evolve at different rates depending on whether the decisions are perceived to be minor or major. Parents played a particularly important supportive role in TDM for AYA participants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Clinicians should consider the AYAs' preferences and the role they want to assume in making different decisions in order to support and encourage involvement in their TDM and care.","Pyke-Grimm, Kimberly A; Franck, Linda S; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie; Goldsby, Robert E; Rehm, Roberta S",Cancer Nurs,182,10

Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. A search of electronic information was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Setting: Studies that compared the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected patients. Participants: Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified. Main outcome measures: Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other test performance characteristics and discrepant findings between both investigations. Results: Chest CT had a median sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.91 (range 0.82–0.98), 0.775 (0.25–1.00) and 0.87 (0.68–0.99), respectively, with RT-PCR as the reference. Importantly, early small, China-based studies tended to favour chest CT versus later larger, non-China studies. Conclusions: A relatively high false positive rate can be expected with chest CT. It is possible it may still be useful to provide circumstantial evidence, however, in some patients with a suspicious clinical presentation of COVID-19 and negative initial Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RT-PCR tests, but more evidence is required in this context. In acute cardiorespiratory presentations, negative CT scan and RT-PCR tests is likely to be reassuring.","Karam, M.; Althuwaikh, S.; Alazemi, M.; Abul, A.; Hayre, A.; Alsaif, A.; Barlow, G.",JRSM Open,182,20

The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for COVID-19-related UMVs after outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study were from the Optum® de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record database from June 1 to December 9, 2020. Adults with first COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in outpatient settings were identified. Cumulative incidence function analysis stratified by risk factors was used to estimate the 30-day incidence of COVID-19-related UMVs. Competing risk regression models were used to derive adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with UMVs. RESULTS: Among 206,741 patients [58.8% female, 77.5% non-Hispanic Caucasian, mean (SD) age: 46.7 (17.8) years], the 30-day incidence was 9.4% (95% CI 9.3-9.6) for COVID-19-related emergency room (ER)/urgent care (UC)/hospitalizations and 3.8% (95% CI 3.7-3.9) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Likelihood of hospitalization increased with age and body mass index, with age the strongest risk factor (aHR 5.61; 95% CI 4.90-6.32 for patients &#8805; 85 years). Increased likelihood of hospitalization was observed for first presentation in the ER/UC vs. non-ER/UC outpatient settings (aHR 2.35; 95% CI 2.22-2.47) and prior all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.00). Clinical risk factors of hospitalizations included pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disease. A study limitation is that data on COVID-19 severity and symptoms were not captured. CONCLUSION: Predictors of COVID-19-related UMVs include older age, obesity, and several comorbidities. These findings may inform patient management and resource allocation following outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis.","Wei, Wenhui; Sivapalasingam, Sumathi; Mellis, Scott; Geba, Gregory P; Jalbert, Jessica J",Adv. ther,182,16

Like most of the US, barely half of Vermont teens are up-to-date with the vaccination, with comparable deficits in New Hampshire and Maine. The rates for HPV vaccine initiation and completion are as low as 33% in rural New England. Consequently, there is a compelling responsibility to communicate its importance to unvaccinated teenagers before their risk for infection increases. Messaging in rural areas promoting HPV vaccination is compromised by community-based characteristics that include access to appropriate medical care, poor media coverage, parental and peer influence, and skepticism of science and medicine. Current strategies are predominantly passive access to literature and Internet-based information. Evidence indicates that performance-based messaging can clarify the importance of HPV vaccination to teenagers and their parents in rural areas. Increased HPV vaccination will significantly contribute to the prevention of a broadening spectrum of cancers. Reducing rurality-based inequities is a public health priority. Development of a performance-based peer-communication intervention can capture a window of opportunity to provide increasingly effective and sustained HPV protection. An effective approach can be partnering rural schools and regional health teams with a program that is nimble and scalable to respond to public health policies and practices compliant with COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications on physical distancing and interacting in the foreseeable future.","Finley, Christine; Dugan, Matthew J; Carney, Jan Kirk; Davis, Wendy Sue; Delaney, Thomas V; Hart, Victoria C; Holmes, Breena W; Stein, Gary S; Katrick, Robin; Morehouse, Holly; Cole, Bernard; Bradford, Leslie S; Boardman, Maureen B; Considine, Heidi; Kaplan, Nancy C; Plumpton, Merideth; Schadler, Linda; Smith, Jennifer J; McAllister, Kate",Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,182,16

This study is a collection of clinical data from 54 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Zhongfa Xincheng district of China at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 28, 2020 to February 11, 2020. The average age of the patients was 61.8 ± 14.5 years, and the predominant age group was 50-79. The proportion of critical-type patients with comorbidities was higher than that of severe-type patients. Lymphocyte counts were significantly reduced in routine bloodwork for all patients, but significantly lower in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. Prolongation of prothrombin times (PT) and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers (D-Ds) were detected in coagulation function tests, and more significant changes were observed in critical-type patients compared to severe-type patients. Serum ferritin levels were sensitive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but could not be used for disease assessment. In addition, levels of two inflammatory factors, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in all patients, but higher in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. Moreover, kidney injury was the second-most common organ affected by COVID-19 followed by heart and liver. Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered. Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered. The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients. In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.","Li, Yanlei; Hu, Yanbing; Yu, Jinyan; Ma, Tiangang",Lab Invest,182,6

The capability of femoroplasty to alter the natural history of cam morphology is still in question. PURPOSE: To (1) investigate the correlation between cam morphology and damage to the articular cartilage and (2) assess whether correction of the cam morphology affects survivorship of the joint, progression to arthroplasty, and functional patient-reported outcome scores. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected for patients presenting for hip arthroscopy between February 2008 and April 2017. Cases were divided into 3 groups: control group with an alpha angle <50° pre- and postoperatively, treated group with an alpha angle >55° preoperatively and <50° postoperatively, and a group with an alpha angle >55° pre- and postoperatively. All patients had minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up for the modified Harris Hip Score, the Non-arthritic Hip Score, and visual analog scale for pain. Conversion to total hip arthroplasty was recorded. RESULTS: A 1:1:1 match successfully yielded 98 hips for each group. Follow-up time was 50.77 ± 24.60 months (mean ± SD). The pre- and postoperative mean alpha angles were 45.2°± 3.4° and 40.6°± 4.3° in the control group, respectively; 66.2°± 8.4° and 42.3°± 5.9° in the treated group; and 68.5°± 9.4° and 61.4°± 7.6° in the alpha >55° group. Intraoperatively, the alpha >55° and treated groups had greater acetabular cartilage damage than the control group (P = .0245 and P = .0036, acetabular labrum articular disruption, respectively; P = .0347 and P = .0211, acetabular Outerbridge). The alpha >55° group achieved the patient acceptable symptomatic state for the modified Harris Hip Score (58.2%) significantly less than the treated (75.5%; P = .0100) and control (73.5%; P = .0239) groups. Progression to arthroplasty was significantly higher in the alpha >55° group (n = 17) when compared with the control (n = 8) and treated (n = 10) groups (P = .0034 and P = .0338, respectively). CONCLUSION: Cam deformity was associated with higher-grade damage of the acetabular articular cartilage. An alpha angle >55° after surgery was associated with lower native hip joint survivability and less successful functional outcomes when compared with that of treated cam deformity as well as no deformity. These data suggest that correcting the cam deformity may positively affect the natural history of these patients.","Domb, Benjamin G; Annin, Shawn; Chen, Jeffrey W; Kyin, Cynthia; Rosinsky, Philip J; Maldonado, David R; Meghpara, Mitchell B; Lall, Ajay C; Shapira, Jacob",Am J Sports Med,182,12

While online posting proves very convenient for individual users, it also fosters fast-spreading of various rumors. The rapid and wide percolation of rumors can cause persistent adverse or detrimental impacts. Therefore, researchers invest great efforts on reducing the negative impacts of rumors. Towards this end, the rumor classification system aims to detect, track, and verify rumors in social media. Such systems typically include four components: (i) a rumor detector, (ii) a rumor tracker, (iii) a stance classifier, and (iv) a veracity classifier. In order to improve the state-of-the-art in rumor detection, tracking, and verification, we propose VRoC, a tweet-level variational autoencoder-based rumor classification system. VRoC consists of a co-train engine that trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) and rumor classification components. The co-train engine helps the VAEs to tune their latent representations to be classifier-friendly. We also show that VRoC is able to classify unseen rumors with high levels of accuracy. For the PHEME dataset, VRoC consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques, on both observed and unobserved rumors, by up to 26.9%, in terms of macro-F1 scores.","Cheng, Mingxi; Nazarian, Shahin; Bogdan, Paul",,182,16

In Italy, available data highlight that general practitioners (GPs) are, apparently, the most heavily affected group. Indeed, they currently represent 44.1% of the total COVID-19 related death cases occurred among physicians, whereas they constitute about 15% of the total number of doctors. This high proportion is most likely the consequence of a work-related contagion happening especially during the first weeks of the epidemic, and persisting also in the following weeks, after the national lockdown. There are various reasons for these higher contagion rates: GPs perform a lot of medical examinations daily, usually in close contact with patients. Especially at the beginning of the epidemic, GPs might have had scant information on the specific safety procedures for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., there was limited knowledge on the possibility of contagions deriving from asymptomatic patients) and, moreover, the availability of personal protective equipment was insufficient. Furthermore, the risk of infection is highly increased by the virus' characteristics, like its survival for several hours/days on different surfaces and its persistence in the air after an aerosolization process, with possibilities to be transmitted over distances longer than two meters. Following these observations, and considering the high cost in term of GPs' lives, the COVID-19 pandemic will probably revolutionize the approach to patients in general practice. Clear and effective guidelines are absolutely and urgently needed for the refinement of adequate measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections among GPs.","Modenese, Alberto; Gobba, Fabriziomaria",,182,20

MicroRNA (miRNA) plays an important role in this genetic regulation and contributes to the enhancement of viral RNA binding through the host mRNA. OBJECTIVE: This research is aimed to detect miRNA targets of SARS-CoV-2 and examines their role in Indonesia cases against Wuhan cases. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from GISAID ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ), NCBI ( https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), and National Genomics Data Center ( https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/ ) databases. MiRDB ( https://github.com/gbnegrini/mirdb-custom-target-search ) was used to annotate and predict target human mature miRNAs. For statistical analysis, we utilized a series chi-square test to obtain significant miRNA. DIANA-miRPath v3.0 ( http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv3 ) analyzed the Gene Ontology of mature miRNAs. RESULT: The statistical results detected five significant miRNAs. Two miRNAs: hsa-miR-4778-5p and hsa-miR-4531 were consistently found in the majority of Wuhan samples, while they were only found in less than half of the Indonesia samples. The other three miRNA, hsa-miR-6844, hsa-miR-627-5p, and hsa-miR-3674, were discovered in most samples in both groups but with a significant difference ratio. Among these five significant miRNA targets, hsa-miR-6844 is the only miRNA that has an association with the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The Gene Ontology analysis of five significant miRNA targets indicates a significant role in inflammation and the immune system. The specific detection of host miRNAs in this study shows that there are differences in the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 between Indonesia and Wuhan.","Rahmadi, Agus; Fasyah, Ismaily; Sudigyo, Digdo; Budiarto, Arif; Mahesworo, Bharuno; Hidayat, Alam Ahmad; Pardamean, Bens",Genes &amp; genomics (Online),182,1

This article aims to report and discuss the data of the first 8 weeks of COVID-19 epidemic in the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Parma. METHODS: The ED visits were analyzed as follows: total ED visits, divided in COVID-19/ non-COVID-19 cases, and in trauma-related/non-trauma-related cases; outcome (i.e., discharged, admitted, dead in the ED) of patients, altogether or stratified according to triage class; age classes of the entire ED population. RESULTS: Total ED visits decreased starting from the first days of the outbreak, then exhibiting progressive growth afterwards. COVID suspected cases rapidly increased, whereas non-COVID suspected dropped and remained well below the standard. Trauma-related cases declined, both as ED visits and as hospital admissions. The percentage and absolute number of patients admitted to hospital wards progressively increased, rapidly overwhelming the number of cases that could be discharged. The admission rate in the lowest priority classes also displayed a marked increase. The youngest age classes dramatically declined, whilst the oldest progressively increased, remaining considerably over the standard rate of the local ED. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged the health care systems to undergo a paradigm shift. Even triage criteria have partially lost their meaning, as shown by the dramatic increase of hospital admissions, even in the lowest priority classes. A deep re-organizational process of the ED was undertaken. Hospitals must be constantly resilient and prepared to these new emergencies in terms of equipment, medical and nurses staff, larger bed capacity in short time, availability of intensive and sub-intensive beds, and flexibility.","Comelli, Ivan; Scioscioli, Francesco; Cervellin, Gianfranco",Acta Biomed,182,16

However, divergent views are still expressed. We aim to gain further insight into metformin and insulin in both pre-admission and in-hospital usage in COVID-19 patients with pre-existed type 2 diabetes. MAIN METHODS: This is a multicentral retrospective study of the hospital confirmed COVID-19 patients between January 19 to April 09, 2020, who admitted to 3 main hospitals in Xiangyang city, China. The effect of type 2 diabetes, metformin, and insulin on COVID-19 were analyzed, respectively. Clinical characteristics, blood laboratory indices, clinical observational indices, and outcomes of these cases were collected. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 50 pre-existed type 2 diabetes) were eligible in our study. COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes had more adverse outcomes than non-diabetes (OR2: mortality: 1.46 [95% CI3 1.11, 1.93]; P < 0.001).

Ms. Montes was interviewed twice during this period;data were analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Pre-COVID, Ms. Montes provided her students daily opportunities to tackle challenging mathematical problems and taught self-regulation strategies for students to better understand themselves as learners. After the shift to ERT, Ms. Montes described “the wall between us” as various barriers that made teaching mathematics online far more challenging. Challenges included supporting students with productive struggle when not physically present with them and supporting student self-regulation during mathematical problem-solving. Supporting students with disabilities to learn mathematics during ERT and distance learning will require considering emotional and affective dimensions of learning. Coaching students and families in self-regulation strategies could support student engagement in mathematical problem-solving in online learning.","Lambert, Rachel Schuck Rachel",The Asia-Pacific Education Researcher,182,1

By the end of April 2020, close to 165 000 cases and 13 000 deaths were reported in the city with considerable variability across the city's ZIP codes. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examine: (a) the extent to which the variability in ZIP code-level case positivity can be explained by aggregate markers of socioeconomic status (SES) and daily change in mobility; and (b) the extent to which daily change in mobility independently predicts case positivity. METHODS: COVID-19 case positivity by ZIP code was modeled using multivariable linear regression with generalized estimating equations to account for within-ZIP clustering. Daily case positivity was obtained from NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and measures of SES were based on data from the American Community Survey. Changes in human mobility were estimated using anonymized aggregated mobile phone location systems. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the socioeconomic markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP-level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings present evidence that heterogeneity in COVID-19 case positivity during NYC's spring outbreak was largely driven by residents' SES.","Lamb, Matthew R; Kandula, Sasikiran; Shaman, Jeffrey",Influenza other respir. viruses,182,9

Governments are forced to define strict measures to avoid the spreading of the virus, which may further impose psychological burden for the majority of the population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress in Austria during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: From 25 March to 3 April 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. Target group included all members of the Austrian population older than 16 years. The survey addressed the following areas (1) and sociodemographic data, (2) physical and mental health; (3) knowledge and concerns about COVID-19; (4) contact with infected people; (5) prevention efforts; (6) need for further information. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used to assess mental health. Analyses were based on 4126 individuals (74% female, age: M = 38.68, SD = 13.36). RESULTS: 43.3% rated the psychological impact as moderate (5.6%) or severe (37.7%). 26.5% reported moderate (13.3%) to severe (13.2%) depression; 20.3% moderate (8.9%) to severe (11.4%) anxiety and 21.2% reported to suffer from moderate (10.5%) or severe stress (10.7%). Being female, higher age, lower levels of education, concern about family members, internet as main source of information, student or pupil status, poor self-rated health, and downplaying the seriousness of the problem were significantly associated with higher psychological burden. Protective factors were the possibility to work in home office, frequent (indirect) contact with family or friends, the availability of virus-specific information, confidence in the diagnosis capability, and physical activity during the crisis. CONCLUSION: This study is among the first in Europe on the psychological correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic. 37.7% of the Austrian study population reported a severe psychological impact on the event and 1 in 10 is considered to suffer from severe depression, anxiety or stress. The present findings inform about the identification of protective factors, psychologically vulnerable groups and may guide the development of psychological interventions.","Traunmüller, Claudia; Stefitz, Rene; Gaisbachgrabner, Kerstin; Schwerdtfeger, Andreas",BMC Public Health,182,16

The product of this reaction has a maximum absorption at 495 nm. By using a series of optimized experiments, we obtained the optimum instrument operation parameters and reaction conditions to analyze aniline in leather extract solutions. Under optimal conditions, aniline concentration was within the range of 0.002-2.0 mg/L, and peak height (H, mV) and concentration (c, mg/L) had a linear relationship. The linear correlation coefficient was R2 = 0.9997, the detection limit was 1.62 µg/L, and the RSD was 0.71%. Aniline in leather extract after accelerated aging was calculated using our calculation method, and the range of standard addition recovery was recorded to be between 97.8% and 103.8%. Compared with the national standard anti-interference method, our result recorded more accurate results and the relative mean absolute error (RAAE) was smaller. Our flow injection analysis combined with ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry (FIA-UV) method can eliminate interference due to trace elements in the extraction solution, as well as effectively improving accuracy and reliability for the determination of aniline in chrome-free leather extraction solution.","Yujie, Ma; Feng, Gao; Wenhua, Yang; Zhihua, Shan",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,182,1

The study used a sequential exploratory design. In the qualitative phase, 40 participants were recruited based on theoretically relevant criteria and the saturation of the information provided by the interviews. In the quantitative phase, a large representative sample was applied. The universe considered was the adult population of Spain. A total of 6789 surveys were conducted. Both the analysis of the narratives of the interviews and the responses to the panel survey showed relevant changes in attitudes and mood swings compared to the period prior to lockdown. These changes include dysphoric moods (i.e., experiences of distress such as sadness/depression, anxiety, rage, feeling of unreality, worry, etc.) and also some euphoric moods (i.e., feelings of well-being, happiness, etc.). A higher number of women were affected than men and a greater increase was observed in younger people. The findings of the study may serve as a basis for detecting needs and providing psychological support, as the symptoms detected as the most common are key for the processes of screening at-risk individuals.","Hidalgo, María Dolores; Balluerka, Nekane; Gorostiaga, Arantxa; Espada, José Pedro; Santed, Miguel Ángel; Padilla, José Luis; Gómez-Benito, Juana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),182,16

While they are caused by external pathogens, host genetics also plays a part in susceptibility to infections. Past studies have reported diverse associations between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and infections, but many were limited by small sample sizes and/or focused on only one infection. METHODS: We performed an immunogenetic association study examining 13 categories of severe infection (bacterial, viral, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genital, hepatitis, otitis, pregnancy-related, respiratory, sepsis, skin infection, urological and other infections), as well as a phenotype for having any infection, and seven classical HLA loci (HLA-A, B, C, DPB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1). Additionally, we examined associations between infections and specific alleles highlighted in our previous studies of psychiatric disorders and autoimmune disease, as these conditions are known to be linked to infections. RESULTS: Associations between HLA loci and infections were generally not strong. Highlighted associations included associations between DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0604 and viral infections (P = 0.002835 and P = 0.014332, respectively), DQB1*0503 and sepsis (P = 0.006053), and DQA1*0301 with ""other"" infections (a category which includes infections not included in our main categories e.g. protozoan infections) (P = 0.000369). Some HLA alleles implicated in autoimmune diseases showed association with susceptibility to infections, but the latter associations were generally weaker, or with opposite trends (in the case of HLA-C alleles, but not with alleles of HLA class II genes). HLA alleles associated with psychiatric disorders did not show association with susceptibility to infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that classical HLA alleles do not play a large role in the etiology of severe infections. The discordant association trends with autoimmune disease for some alleles could contribute to mechanistic theories of disease etiology.","Nudel, Ron; Allesøe, Rosa Lundbye; Thompson, Wesley K; Werge, Thomas; Rasmussen, Simon; Benros, Michael E",J Transl Med,182,20

The previous literature rarely solved this real-time issue, and there is a lack of public research proposing an effective way forward on it. However, the study examines the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on energy consumption and CO2 emission. The design of the study is quantitative, and the data is acquired from different online databases. The model of the study is inferred by using panel unit root test and ARDL test. The robustness of study findings was checked through panel quantile regression. The findings highlighted that the COVID-19 outbreak is negatively significant with energy consumption and CO2 emission. The study suggested revising the energy consumption patterns by developing and implementing the national action plan for energy consumption and environmental protection. The study also contributed in knowledge by suggesting the novel insight into CO2 emission and energy consumption patterns during COVID-19 pandemic and recommended to consider renewable energy transition methods as an opportunity for the society. For a more effective management of energy consumption and environmental pollution, country-specific measures are suggested to be taken, and the national government should support the concerned public departments, ministries and private organizations on it.

Besides the clinical benefits, they are thought to be less costly than the injectable-containing regimens, for both the patient and the health system. STREAM is the first randomised controlled trial with an economical evaluation to compare all-oral and injectable-containing 9-11-month MDR-TB treatment regimens. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Health system costs of delivering a 9-month injectable-containing regimen and a 9-month all-oral bedaquiline-containing regimen will be collected in Ethiopia, India, Moldova and Uganda, using 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' costing approaches. Patient costs will be collected using questionnaires that have been developed based on the STOP-TB questionnaire. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the cost utility of the two regimens, from a health system perspective. Secondary objectives include estimating the cost utility from a societal perspective as well as evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the regimens, using both health system and societal perspectives. The effect measure for the cost-utility analysis will be the quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while the effect measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the efficacy outcome from the clinical trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been evaluated and approved by the Ethics Advisory Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and also approved by ethics committees in all participating countries. All participants have provided written informed consent. The results of the economic evaluation will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

250616,250616,250616,Universal public use of surgical mask and respiratory viral infection,14.11086,8.622654,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder. Hematologic and cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 causes thromboembolic events across multiple organs which mainly manifest as venous thromboembolism, and rarely, peripheral arterial thromboembolic events. In-situ thrombosis of a healthy, non-atherosclerotic native artery is rare, and COVID-19 has been reported to be a cause of this phenomenon. We aimed to report our institutional experience with COVID-19 patients who developed acute limb ischemia (ALI) during hospitalization or after discharge. METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Records of all patients &#8805;18 years of age admitted to a tertiary center with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between September 1 and December 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. Data regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities and outcomes were collected. Patients were followed-up during index hospitalization and for 30 days postdischarge. Acute limb ischemia was diagnosed by means of duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography in the presence of a clinical suspicion. RESULTS: A total of 681 consecutive patients (38.5% women) were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. Median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-74). In-hospital mortality occurred in 94 (13.8%) patients. Ninety (13.2%) patients required intensive care unit admission at some point of their hospital stay. Six (0.9%) patients (one woman) with a median age of 62 years experienced ALI (IQR, 59-64.3). All patients were receiving low molecular weight heparin when they developed ALI. The median of duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and ALI symptom onset was 13 days (IQR, 11.3-14). Three patients underwent emergent surgical thrombectomy combined with systemic anticoagulation, and 3 received systemic anticoagulation alone. Two patients with ALI did not survive to hospital discharge. Among survivors, 1 patient underwent bilateral major amputations, and another underwent a minor amputation within 1 month of hospital discharge. Symptoms of ALI completely resolved in 2 patients without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a multisystemic disorder with involvement of hematologic and cardiovascular systems. Despite widespread use of thromboprophylaxis, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of ALI, and subsequent limb loss or even death.","Topcu, Ahmet Can; Ozturk-Altunyurt, Gozde; Akman, Dilara; Batirel, Ayse; Demirhan, Recep",Ann. vasc. surg,182,16

We have created a novel solution, called the High and Low (HaLo) method, that generates physical unclonable function (PUF) signatures based on process variations within flash memory in order to uniquely identify and authenticate remote sensors. The HaLo method consumes 60% less power than conventional authentication schemes, has an average latency of only 39ms for signature generation, and can be readily implemented through firmware on ONFI 2.2 compliant off-the-shelf NAND flash memory chips. The HaLo method generates 512 bit signatures with an average error rate of 5.9 * 10^-4, while also adapting for flash chip aging. Due to its low latency, low error rate, and high power efficiency, the HaLo method could help progress the field of remote patient monitoring by accurately and efficiently authenticating remote health sensors.","Gordon, Holden; Lyp, Thomas; Kimbro, Calvin; Tehranipoor, Sara",,182,26

The survey examined caregivers' stress and challenges faced during daycare service cessation, their perceived needs for continuation of daycare service, and observed changes in functional status of PwD. Regression analyses were performed to explore the associated factors of caregiving stress and preference for continuation of daycare service. Results Family caregivers of PwD experienced greater caregiving stress after cessation of daycare service. Infection was their main challenge in caregiving, and their physical and emotional health was adversely affected by the longer time commitment with PwD under the stay-home policy. Older age of caregivers, greater emotional and communication problems of PwD, and more time spent with PwD were associated with greater caregiving stress. More than one-third of the participants preferred the continuation of daycare service during the pandemic. Conclusions Policy makers should consider the well-being of PwD and their caregivers when planning infection control measures. Daycare service with enhanced infection controlled measures should remain available to PwD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wong, Bel Pui-sze Kwok Timothy Chi-yui Chui Kenny Chi-man Cheng Tobi Sum-to Ho Florence Kwai-ying Woo Jean",International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,182,20

Measures to mitigate the potential COVID-19 outbreaks in its population were taken by using conventional public health measures with special attention to task-shifting and widespread community mental health interventions. A Preparedness and Response Centre was established to overseer the mitigating measures happening inside the university. Measures taken included empowerment of frontline staff, strengthening of restrictions, strengthening university health center, vigorous contact tracing, widespread health education, maintaining cultural sensitivity, and establishment of early standard operating procedures and university continuity plans.

This is because the patient, during the lockdown, was forced to leave the house and go several miles away to reach the place where the drug was dispensed. Moreover, very often, the place was placed in covid-19 hospitals, like the one in Perugia, and was also a risk for the patient himself. The logistical organization allows, in addition to the advantages of traceability, efficiency and savings, with the arrival of the drug at home, a very high patient compliance that also translates into greater security in a pandemic period. To the Usl Umbria 1 of Perugia (Italy) has been centralized the activity of warehouse for all the South area that includes three hospitals and four sanitary districts. Such warehouse, through computerized procedure, guarantees the direct distribution with sending of the medicines directly to the district of belonging of the patient. In this way the patient was not forced to make long and risky trips to continue their chronic therapies. Moreover, this logistic warehouse has also allowed to cope with the correct management of many medicinal specialties that have been used against the SARS-CoV-2 virus avoiding their temporary deficiency for patients already on therapy according to the normal therapeutic indications (anti-inflammatory, antiretroviral and immunomodulatory).

Those studies were predominantly conducted under moderately to highly polluted outdoor atmospheres. The purpose of this study was to extend the data set to include a less polluted atmospheric environment. A relationship between PM2.5 and ILI activity extended to include lightly to moderately polluted atmospheres could imply a more complicated mechanism than that suggested by existing studies. We obtained concurrent PM2.5 mass concentration data, meteorological data and reported Influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) activity for the light to moderately polluted atmospheres over the Tucson, AZ region. We found no relation between PM2.5 mass concentration and ILI activity. There was an expected relation between ILI, activity, temperature, and relative humidity. There was a possible relation between PM2.5 mass concentration anomalies and ILI activity. These results might be due to the small dataset size and to the technological limitations of the PM measurements.

Cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons, including physician preference and access to real-time imaging, with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning. Nonetheless, the patients' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ECMO and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite. AIMS: Therefore, with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport, we implemented a protocol for bedside ECMO cannulation. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 89 patients required ECMO support at Hennepin County Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2019. Twenty-eight (31%) required veno-venous support and were all cannulated at the bedside. Overall survival was 71% with no morbidity or mortality related to the cannulation procedure. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic, the strategy of veno-venous bedside cannulation may have additional benefits for the care of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus-disease-2019, decreasing the risk of exposure of health care worker or other patients to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 occurring during patient transport, preparation, or during disinfection of the procedural suite and the transportation pathway after ECMO cannulation.","Calcaterra, Domenico; Heather, Beth; Kohl, Louis P; Erickson, Heidi L; Prekker, Matthew E",J Card Surg,182,16

There are an ever-increasing number of reports of neurological symptoms in patients, from severe (encephalitis), to mild (hyposmia), suggesting the potential for neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective investigates the hypothesis that the reliance on self-reporting of hyposmia has resulted in an underestimation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. While the acute effect of the virus on the nervous system function is vastly overshadowed by the respiratory effects, we propose that it will be important to monitor convalescent individuals for potential long-term implications that may include neurodegenerative sequelae such as viral-associated parkinsonism. As it is possible to identify premorbid harbingers of Parkinson's disease, we propose long-term screening of SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery for these expressions of neurodegenerative disease. An accurate understanding of the incidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring for sequelae after remission and a strategized health policy to ensure healthcare systems all over the world are prepared for a third wave of the virus in the form of parkinsonism.","Beauchamp, Leah C; Finkelstein, David I; Bush, Ashley I; Evans, Andrew H; Barnham, Kevin J",J Parkinsons Dis,182,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed using convenience sampling to obtain a sample of healthcare workers. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect the information of the basic characteristics, workload, and the health condition. Burnout, coping style, anxiety, and depression were measured by specific scales. Multiple logistic regression model was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety or depression. RESULTS: There were 902 questionnaires received between February 9, 2020 and February 11, 2020. The proportion of healthcare workers with symptoms of moderate/severe anxiety and moderate/severe depression were 16.63% and 18.29%, respectively. There were 24.50% healthcare workers experiencing moderate/severe anxiety and depression at the same time. The increased workload, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, having done specific test(s) related to COVID-19, having family member needs to be taken care of, negative coping style, and job burnout were the independent risk factors of anxiety. Furthermore, the increased workload, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, having done specific test(s) related to COVID-19, negative coping style, and job burnout were the independent risk factors of depression. CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the mental health of frontline healthcare workers at the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Taking steps to reduce the intensity of the work and burnout will be effective to stabilize the mental state of them.","Chen, Jie; Liu, Xinghuang; Wang, Dongke; Jin, Yan; He, Miao; Ma, Yanling; Zhao, Xiaolong; Song, Shuangning; Zhang, Lei; Xiang, Xuelian; Yang, Ling; Song, Jun; Bai, Tao; Hou, Xiaohua",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,182,6

Although previous studies reported a lower rate of death in patients treated with heparin, the potential benefit of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between OAT with the risk of ARDS and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective Italian study including consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 22, 2020, at six Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups according to the chronic assumption of oral anticoagulants. RESULTS: Overall, 427 patients were included; 87 patients (19%) were in the OAT group. Of them, 54 patients (13%) were on treatment with non-vitamin k oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and 33 (8%) with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). OAT patients were older and had a higher rate of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease compared to No-OAT group. The rate of ARDS at admission (26% vs 28%, P=0.834), or developed during the hospitalization (9% vs 10%, P=0.915), was similar between study groups; in-hospital mortality (22% vs 26%, P=0.395) was also comparable. After balancing for potential confounders by using the propensity score matching technique, no differences were found in term of clinical outcome between OAT and No-OAT patients CONCLUSION: Oral anticoagulation therapy, either NOACs or VKAs, did not influence the risk of ARDS or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Russo, Vincenzo; Bottino, Roberta; D039,; Andrea, Antonello; Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Golino, Paolo; Nigro, Gerardo; Valsecchi, Orazio; Attena, Emilio; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Galasso, Gennaro; Parodi, Guido; Scudiero, Fernando",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,182,2

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population. Importantly, this simple measure could easily be implemented in countries without widespread access to COVID-19 testing or implemented as a fast early response before wide-spread testing can be facilitated.","Iravani, Behzad; Arshamian, Artin; Ravia, Aharon; Mishor, Eva; Snitz, Kobi; Shushan, Sagit; Roth, Yehudah; Perl, Ofer; Honigstein, Danielle; Weissgross, Reut; Karagach, Shiri; Ernst, Gernot; Okamoto, Masako; Mainen, Zachary; Monteleone, Erminio; Dinnella, Caterina; Spinelli, Sara; Mariño-Sánchez, Franklin; Ferdenzi, Camille; Smeets, Monique; Touhara, Kazushige; Bensafi, Moustafa; Hummel, Thomas; Sobel, Noam; Lundström, Johan N",Chem. senses,182,16

This was a quality improvement project prompted by an adverse event after a telemedicine visit. METHODS: We reviewed all completed telemedicine and conventional visits from March 26 to June 1 of 2020 and 2019 to identify patients who required an ED visit or hospital admission within eight weeks after the visit. RESULTS: In 2020, the overall rate of ED visits of hospital admission within eight weeks of a neurology visit was less than 5%. Comparing 2020 with 2019: (1) cohorts were similar for age, payor, state of residence, medical complexity, recommendation for close follow-up, new medications, or new tests ordered; (2) it took longer to present to the ED (by 10 days) or to be hospitalized (by three days); (3) planned admissions were approximately 50% lower; (4) on multivariate analysis, risk factors for any ED/admission included a patient call within seven days before the ED/admission (P = 0.0004) or being seen by an epilepsy specialist (P = 0.02); (5) a presenting complaint of worsening symptoms had a lower odds ratio of subsequent ED visit/admission (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is safe, with a similar likelihood of ED or hospital admission during the pandemic in 2020 versus before the pandemic in 2019. In 2020, even if patients described worse symptoms at the time of their clinic visit, the odds of ED or hospital admission were lower than in 2019, but those who called after the telemedicine visit were more likely to be seen in ED or require hospitalization.","Joshi, Charuta; Jacobson, Mona; Silveira, Lori; Shea, Stephanie; Yang, Michele; Eschbach, Krista",Pediatr Neurol,182,10

This study examines geriatric patients with proximal femur fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic, shifts in secondary disease profile, the impact of the pandemic on hospitalization and further treatment. Methods: In a retrospective monocentric study, geriatric proximal femur fractures treated in the first six months of 2020 were analyzed and compared with the same period of 2019. Pre-traumatic status (living in a care home, under supervision of a legal guardian), type of trauma, accident mechanism, geriatric risk factors, associated comorbidities, time between hospitalization and surgery, inpatient time and post-operative further treatment of 2 groups of patients, aged 65-80 years (Group 1) and 80+ years (Group 2) were investigated. Results: The total number of patients decreased (70 in 2019 vs. 58 in 2020), mostly in Group 1 (25 vs. 16) while the numbers in Group 2 remained almost constant (45 vs. 42). The percentage of patients with pre-existing neurological conditions rose in 2020. This corresponded to an increase in patients under legal supervision (29.3%) and receiving pre-traumatic care in a nursing home (14.7%). Fractures were mostly caused by minor trauma in a home environment. In 2020, total number of inpatient days for Group 2 was lower compared to Group 1 (p = 0.008). Further care differed between the years: fewer Group 1 patients were discharged to geriatric therapy (69.6% vs. 25.0%), whereas in Group 2 the number of patients discharged to a nursing home increased. Conclusions: Falling by elderly patients is correlated to geriatric comorbidities, consequently there was no change in the case numbers in this age group. Strategic measures to avoid COVID-19 infection in hospital setting could include reducing the length of hospital stays by transferring elderly patients to a nursing home as soon as possible and discharging independent, mobile patients to return home.","Polan, C.; Meyer, H.

We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25 most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis and found three distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness of the lockdown protocols: rise and fall, power law, or logistic. For countries showing power law growth we have determined the scaling exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown in the rate of infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the total number of infections and the expected final date. Three different extrapolation methods (logistic, parabolic, and cutoff power law) were used. All methods agree on the order of magnitude of saturation and end dates.

Understanding how the virus engages the immune system will facilitate the development of needed therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins spike (S) and envelope (E) activate the key immune signaling IFN pathway in both human and mouse immune and epithelial cells independent of viral infection and replication. These proteins induce reactive oxidative species generation and increases in human- and murine-specific, IFN-responsive cytokines and chemokines, similar to their upregulation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Induction of IFN signaling is dependent on canonical but discrepant inflammatory signaling mediators, as the activation induced by S is dependent on IRF3, TBK1, and MyD88, whereas that of E is largely MyD88 independent. Furthermore, these viral surface proteins, specifically E, induced peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary vasculitis in a mouse model. Finally, we show that the organized inflammatory infiltrates are dependent on type I IFN signaling, specifically in lung epithelial cells. These findings underscore the role of SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins, particularly the understudied E protein, in driving cell specific inflammation and their potential for therapeutic intervention.","Anand, Gautam; Perry, Alexandra M; Cummings, Celeste L; Raymond, Emma; Clemens, Regina A; Steed, Ashley L",J. immunol,182,16

To establish relationship between anosmia and severity of COVID-19 infection along with requirement of tocilizumab. This was a retrospective cum prospective cross sectional study done on COVID-19 patients who were admitted in normal COVID-19 ward and intensive care unit of Employee's State Insurance Corporation Hospital, Udaipur and Maharaja Bhupal Hospital of Ravindra Nath Medical College between September 2020 and 15 January 2021 age group of 18 to 92 years, both sexes. We had asked about anosmia in all COVID-19 positive patients and followed all patients in perspective of severity of disease and tocilizumab. p value < 0.001 of prevalence of anosmia in COVID -19 patients who were isolated at home, admitted in ward and intensive care unit showed that anosmia is inversely related to severity of disease. Tocilizumab has no significant role in decreasing mortality in severe form of disease. Our study indicates that anosmia is related to the mildness of disease and there is no role of tocilizumab in decreasing the mortality in severe form of disease.","Silu, Manju; Mathur, Navneet Prasad; Kumari, Rekha; Chaudhary, Pallavi",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,182,22

METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) between 1 March and 29 May 2020. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analyses and multiple Cox proportional-hazards regression were conducted to assess the survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from hospital admission to discharge (censored) or death. Micro-costing was used to estimate the direct medical costs associated with hospitalization per patient. RESULTS: The number of included patients with complete status (discharge or death) was 1422. The overall 14-day survival was 0.699 (95%CI: 0.652-0.741). Older adults (>70 years) (HR = 5.00, 95%CI = 2.83-8.91), patients on MVs (5.39, 3.83-7.64), non-Saudi patients (1.37, 1.01-1.89), and ICU admission (2.09, 1.49-2.93) were associated with a high risk of mortality. The mean cost per patient (in SAR) for those admitted to the general Medical Ward (GMW) and ICU was 42,704.49 ± 29,811.25 and 79,418.30 ± 55,647.69, respectively.

STEM Teaching Fellows met once a week to plan the following week's STEM class to be delivered via Zoom to twelve first grade students at the Boys and Girls Club. During the planning meeting the weekly topic was discussed and collectively it was decided which specific activities would be performed the following week with the students. In week one, the topic was the heart. The STEM Fellow used PowerPoint slides to illustrate the anatomy of the heart while explaining the physiology of the heart. Then the students were guided through the creation of a simple heart pump. The STEM Director was on site with the students to assist them when needed. To complete the activity, the 3 jars were filled halfway with water and a few drops of red dye to represent blood. A red balloon was placed around the rim of the center jar (representing the heart). Two holes were made in the balloon of the center jar and straws that were immersed in the blood of the outer jars were placed in the wholes. Pushing on the balloon of the center jar made the heart pump the ?blood? from one jar to another in sequence thus mimicking heart function. After the activity there was an opportunity for the students to ask questions and the STEM Fellow provided answers. Homework was then assigned to students related to the topic to share with others what they learned. The teaching portion of the topic went well as students were engaged and asked questions. The heart model activity took about 10 minutes longer than expected. Students seemed to have difficulty combining the straws together. Students also behaved well and followed the COVID guidelines adequately. A few things that can be changed for next time would be to have the straws ready for students rather than have them put them together. They enjoyed this activity and had fun with it as well. The student participation level went beyond expectations for the first-grade group. They could read and understand the PowerPoint presented and were filled with questions. They also answered questions when asked such as, ?What is the heart?? and ?Why do we need a heart?? The Fellows planning group meetings before each class were beneficial to practice the activities before officially teaching the topic, which made it easier when the class met. As a group, the STEM Fellows themselves learned something new and enjoyed the chosen topic. In the future the Heart model activity will be repeated and is highly recommended for others to engage K-12 students in physiology.","Sankoh, Mamady Halpin Patricia",The FASEB Journal,182,24

On Twitter and similar sites, it is possible to report on ongoing situations globally with minimal delay, while the cost of such reporting remains negligible. One of the most important features of this social network is that content delivery can be customized to allow users to focus only on news items covering subject matters they find interesting. With this in mind, it becomes necessary to create verification mechanisms that can ascertain whether the claims made on Twitter can be taken seriously and prevent false content from spreading too far. This study demonstrates an innovative System for verification of information that can fulfill the role described above. The System is comprised of four mutually connected modules: a legacy module, a trustworthiness classifier; a module managing user authority, and a ranking procedure. All of the modules function within an integrated framework and jointly contribute to an accurate classification of messages and authors. Effectiveness of the solution was evaluated empirically on a sample of Twitter users, with a strict 10-fold evaluation procedure applied for each module.

OBJECTIVE: This current study aimed to introduce the adaptation of family medicine training for house officers during COVID-19 pandemic and gauge their level of satisfaction with the training. METHODS: Unfortunately, more than one-fourth of the house officers attending the family medicine training turned out to be hospital-admitted or in obligatory home isolation. A time-sensitive plan was proposed to maintain a competent training guaranteeing safety and support of house officers and fulfilling the training objectives in a virtual setting. Three mentors were assigned to each 10 house officers to provide continuous support and monitoring. Tutor and house officer interaction and reflection were maintained through a virtual clinical training session via Zoom application and a daily online discussion of a clinical scenario. Peer interaction was provided through post-webinar and small-group online discussion sessions. RESULTS: The adapted training was applied on thirteen cohorts of house officers. The response rate was 70% (666 out of 950). Most of them were satisfied with the training (84.6%). Their satisfaction with each modality of the training was encouraging. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, successful adaptation of family medicine training has succeeded in fulfilling the training objectives and providing psychological support and engagement for house officers without burdening the hospital-admitted and home-isolated house officers.","Ahmed, Marwa M; Fares, Samar; Sayed, Asmaa A; El Sayed, Inas T",J Prim Care Community Health,182,1

Computer vision AI applications use medical imaging, such as lung chest X-Rays (LCXRs), to facilitate diagnoses by providing second-opinions in addition to a physician's or radiologist's interpretation. Considering the advent of the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, LCXRs may provide rapid insights to indirectly aid in infection containment, however generating a reliably labeled image dataset for a novel disease is not an easy feat, nor is it of highest priority when combating a global pandemic. Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to select features that distinguish between healthy and disease states for other lung pathologies; this study aims to leverage that body of literature in order to apply image transformations that would serve to balance the lack of COVID-19 LCXR data. Furthermore, this study utilizes a simple CNN architecture for high-performance multiclass LCXR classification at 94 percent accuracy.","Ramnarine, Alexandrea K.",,182,33

Here we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore the activity of the main inhibitory intracortical circuits within the primary motor cortex (M1) in a sample of patients complaining of fatigue and presenting executive dysfunction after resolution of COVID-19 with neurological manifestations. METHODS: Twelve patients who recovered from typical COVID-19 pneumonia with neurological complications and complained of profound physical and mental fatigue underwent, 9 to 13 weeks from disease onset, a psychometric evaluation including a self-reported fatigue numeric-rating scale (FRS, Fatigue Rating Scale) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Intracortical activity was evaluated by means of well-established TMS protocols including short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), reflecting GABAA-mediated inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), a marker of GABAB receptor activity, and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) that indexes central cholinergic transmission. TMS data were compared to those obtained in a control group of ten healthy subjects (HS) matched by age, sex and education level. RESULTS: Post-COVID-19 patients reported marked fatigue according to FRS score (8.1 ± 1.7) and presented pathological scores at the FAB based on Italian normative data (12.2 ± 0.7). TMS revealed marked reduction of SICI, and disruption of LICI as compared to HS. SAI was also slightly diminished. CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents for the first time reduced GABAergic inhibition in the M1 in patients who recovered from COVID-19 with neurological complications and manifested fatigue and dysexecutive syndrome. SIGNIFICANCE: TMS may serve as diagnostic tool in cognitive disturbances and fatigue in post-COVID-19 patients.","Versace, Viviana; Sebastianelli, Luca; Ferrazzoli, Davide; Romanello, Roberto; Ortelli, Paola; Saltuari, Leopold; D039,; Acunto, Alessia; Porrazzini, Francesco; Ajello, Valentina; Oliviero, Antonio; Kofler, Markus; Koch, Giacomo",Clin Neurophysiol,182,16

Understanding the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased COVID-19 patients; and estimation of time-interval between symptom onset, hospital admission and death could inform public health interventions focusing on preventing mortality due to COVID-19. Methods: We obtained COVID-19 death summaries from the official dashboard of the Government of Tamil Nadu, between 10th May and July 10, 2020. Of the 1783 deaths, we included 1761 cases for analysis. Results: The mean age of the deceased was 62.5 years (SD: 13.7). The crude death rate was 2.44 per 100,000 population; the age-specific death rate was 22.72 among above 75 years and 0.02 among less than 14 years, and it was higher among men (3.5 vs 1.4 per 100,000 population). Around 85% reported having any one or more comorbidities; Diabetes (62%), hypertension (49.2%) and CAD (17.5%) were the commonly reported comorbidities. The median time interval between symptom onset and hospital admission was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7); admission and death was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7) with a significant difference between the type of admitting hospital. One-fourth of (24.2%) deaths occurred within a day of hospital admission. Conclusion: Elderly, male, people living in densely populated areas and people with underlying comorbidities die disproportionately due to COVID-19. While shorter time-interval between symptom onset and admission is essential, the relatively short time interval between admission and death is a concern and the possible reasons must be evaluated and addressed to reduce avoidable mortality.","Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Sarman, Charishma Jones; Saravanamurthy, Sakthivel P; Mahalingam, Periasamy; Maduraipandian, Swarna; Lakshmanan, Jeyaseelan",,182,1

The accelerated weathering test applied consecutive steps of UV irradiation (at 340 nm and 0.76 W m-2 irradiance) and moisture at 50 °C following the ASTM D4329 standard for up to 2000 h of exposure time. The morphology, chemical structure, crystallization, as well as the mechanical and thermal properties were studied. Samples were characterized after 500, 1000, and 2000 h of exposure time. Different degradation mechanisms were proposed to occur during the weathering exposure and were confirmed based on the experimental data. The PHBV surface revealed cracks and increasing roughness with the increasing exposure time, whereas the PHBV/TiO2 nanocomposites showed surface changes only after 2000 h of accelerated weathering. The degradation of neat PHBV under moisture and UV exposure occurred preferentially in the amorphous phase. In contrast, the presence of TiO2 in the nanocomposites retarded this process, but the degradation would occur simultaneously in both the amorphous and crystalline segments of the polymer after long exposure times. The thermal stability, as well as the temperature and rate of crystallization, decreased in the absence of TiO2. TiO2 not only provided UV protection, but also restricted the physical mobility of the polymer chains, acting as a nucleating agent during the crystallization process. It also slowed down the decrease in mechanical properties. The mechanical properties were shown to gradually decrease for the PHBV/TiO2 nanocomposites, whereas a sharp drop was observed for the neat PHBV after an accelerated weathering exposure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), using the amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) tool, also confirmed the mechanical changes in the surface area of the PHBV and PHBV/TiO2 samples after accelerated weathering exposure. The changes in the physical and chemical properties of PHBV/TiO2 confirm the barrier activity of TiO2 for weathering attack and its retardation of the degradation process.","Antunes, Ana; Popelka, Anton; Aljarod, Omar; Hassan, Mohammad K; Kasak, Peter; Luyt, Adriaan S",,182,19

Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the nature of this virus, which is rapidly escalating into a global pandemic. Asymptomatic carriers can inadvertently transmit the virus through the air stream. Many diseases can infect human bodies with tiny droplets or particles that carry various viruses and bacteria that are generated by the respiratory system of infected patients. This article presents the numerical results of the spread of droplets or particles in a room. The proposed numerical model in this work takes into account the sedimentation of particles or droplets under the action of gravitational sedimentation and transport in the room during the process of breathing and sneezing or coughing. Three different cases are numerically investigated taking into account normal breathing and coughing or sneezing, respectively, and three different rates of particle ejection from the mouth are considered. Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows were used to describe three-dimensional air flow inside ventilated rooms. The influence of ventilation rate on social distancing is also computationally investigated. It was found that particles can move up to 5 m with a decrease in concentration in the direction of the air flow. The conclusions made in this work show that, given the environmental conditions, the two meter social distance recommended by WHO is insufficient.","Issakhov, Alibek; Zhandaulet, Yeldos; Omarova, Perizat; Alimbek, Aidana; Borsikbayeva, Aliya; Mustafayeva, Ardak",Sci Rep,182,1

As there is an increase of infections in the male population, concerns have emerged about the potential impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 impact on male reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, discussing them in light of the evidence published on other coronaviruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 24 original articles were included for the analysis, investigating the effects of the infection on semen parameters, male reproductive hormones, and pregnancy outcomes. Further, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted based on the available evidence linking the virus with male reproduction and conception. RESULTS: Although there is limited data, viral mRNA has been identified in semen of infected men, with some evidence of altered seminal parameters. Low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone with raised luteinizing hormone has been reported as well as preterm delivery in pregnant women; however, data regarding vertical transmission remains contradictory and inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The recent literature provides evidence that male gonads may be potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, recommending caution to pregnant women and couples planning natural pregnancy or assisted reproduction.","Khalili, Mohammad Ali; Leisegang, Kristian; Majzoub, Ahmad; Finelli, Renata; Panner Selvam, Manesh Kumar; Henkel, Ralf; Mojgan, Moshrefi; Agarwal, Ashok",World J Mens Health,182,16

METHODS: An online survey using social media-based advertising was conducted among U.S. adults in April 2020. Participants were asked whether they thought they could acquire a COVID-19 test, along with basic demographic, socioeconomic and geographic information. RESULTS: A total of 6,378 participants provided data on perceived access to COVID-19 testing. In adjusted analyses, we found higher income and possession of health insurance to be associated with perceived ability to access Coronavirus testing. Geographically, perceived access was highest (68%) in East South Central division and lowest (39%) in West North Central. Disparities in health insurance coverage did not directly correspond to disparities in perceived access to COVID-19 testing. CONCLUSIONS: Sex, geographic location, income, and insurance status were associated with perceived access to COVID-19 testing; interventions aimed at improving either access or awareness of measures taken to improve access are warranted. These findings from the pandemic's early months shed light on the importance of disaggregating perceived and true access to screening during such crises.","Ali, Shahmir H; Tozan, Yesim; Jones, Abbey M; Foreman, Joshua; Capasso, Ariadna; DiClemente, Ralph J",Ann Epidemiol,182,21

DATA SOURCES: Published literature obtained through PubMed database searches and clinical pictures. STUDY SELECTIONS: Studies relevant to the mechanisms, diagnosis, management, and potential therapy of infectious complications of AD. RESULTS: Skin barrier defects, type 2 inflammation, Staphylococcusaureus colonization, and cutaneous dysbiosis are the major predisposing factors for the increased infections in AD. Although overt infections require antibiotics, the use of antibiotics in AD exacerbation remains controversial. CONCLUSION: Infectious complications are a comorbidity of AD. Although not common, systemic bacterial infections and eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening. Preventive therapy of infections in AD emphasizes skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory therapy.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of face mask usage and investigate about different types of face mask and their distribution among pedestrians in southwest Iran during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in August 2020 in Ahvaz, southwest Iran. Using a multistage sampling method, a total of 10,440 pedestrians selected from 8 urban districts and 92 neighborhoods of the city. The data gathered by observation method. Percentage, mean and standard deviation were used to describe the variables. Chi-square test, fisher exact test and Chi-square for trend used to assess relationship between two categorical variables. We used unconditional logistic regression model to control confounders. RESULTS: The most common age group was 10 to 39 years and 67.9% of the participants were male. The overall prevalence of face mask usage was 45.6% (95% CI, 44.6-46.5). In general, as the age increased, the prevalence of face mask use significantly increased (p for trend < 0.001). Women used face masks significantly higher than men (60.2% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.001). Among the pedestrians who used the mask, 75.6% wore facemask correctly. The most common type of facemask used by the pedestrians were surgical (medical) masks (63.8%). In total, the prevalence of facemask usage was significantly higher during a.m. (49.4%) compared to p.m. (43.9%), (p < 0.001). Besides, in our study, 1.7 and 0.3% of Pedestrians had worn gloves and shielded respectively. Women used shields and gloves significantly higher than men (3.6% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001). Also, women used shields more than men (0.5% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the prevalence rate of face mask use in Ahvaz was fairly low especially in men and younger people. Hence, the observed rates probably cannot protect the community against COVID-19 spread. Therefore, it is important to implement educational programs as well as to establish laws and regulations governing the use of face masks in public places.","Rahimi, Zahra; Shirali, Gholam Abbas; Araban, Marzieh; Mohammadi, Mohammad Javad; Cheraghian, Bahman",BMC Public Health,182,17

Methods This scientific study is a retrospective cohort study of patients without a known history of liver diseases who were hospitalized with COVID-19 viral infection. Patients were stratified into low score groups (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score &lt;10) and high score groups (MELD = 10). Clinical outcomes were evaluated, including in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS). Results Our cohort of 186 COVID-19 positive patients included 88 (47%) women with a mean age of 60 years in the low score group and mean age of 73 years in the high score group. Patients in the high score group were older in age (p&lt;0.0001) and more likely to have history of diabetes mellitus (p=0.0020), stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p=0.0013), hypertension (p&lt;0.0001), stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (p=0.0163), asthma (p=0.0356), dementia (p&lt;0.0001), and chronic heart failure (p=0.0055). The in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice rate was significantly higher in the high-score group as opposed to the low-score group (p=0.0014). Conversely, there was no significant difference among both groups in the hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICU LOS (p=0.6929 and p=0.7689, respectively). Conclusion Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection and found to have a MELD score greater than or equal to 10 were found to have a higher mortality as compared to their counterparts. Conversely a low MELD score is a very strong indicator of a more favorable prognosis, indicating hospital survival. We propose using the MELD score as an adjunct for risk stratifying patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without prior history of liver dysfunction.","Stawinski, P. M.; Dziadkowiec, K.

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. SETTING: 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. PARTICIPANTS: 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital. RESULTS: The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37% (618/1658) died, and 46% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report. In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity.

METHODS: From March 1 to 31, 2020, 916 caregivers of older adults participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. The seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and a self-developed questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality and duration. Six questions about COVID-19-related experiences were used to assess community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression and sleep problems were computed. The Wald &#967;2 were applied to compare the differences between subgroups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and multimorbidity. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.8%, 29.8%, and 10.8%, respectively. Approximately 263 participants (28.7%) presented with two or more mental health problems. Being female (OR, 2.254; 95% CI, 1.510-3.363), having community-level COVID-19 contact (OR, 1.856; 95% CI, 1.189-2.898), and having a mental disorder (OR, 3.610; 95% CI, 1.644-7.930) were associated with increased risk of multimorbidity among caregivers. Caregivers who preferred positive information (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.472-0.899) had reduced risk of multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression were common among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic. Being female and having community-level COVID-19 contact were independent risk factors for experiencing multiple mental health problems. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of multimorbidity among caregivers, while enhanced access to positive media information decreased the risk of multimorbidity.","Li, Qiuxuan; Zhang, Haifeng; Zhang, Ming; Li, Tao; Ma, Wanxin; An, Cuixia; Chen, Yanmei; Liu, Sha; Kuang, Weihong; Yu, Xin; Wang, Huali",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,182,22

Several studies have shown neurological symptoms, ranging from dizziness and loss of consciousness to cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune-mediated inflammatory neuropathy, has been closely associated with critical cases of infection with ""severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19. Its pathophysiology is related to a generalized inflammation that affects the nervous system, but neurotropism was also revealed by the new coronavirus, which may increase the risk of neurological sequel, as well as the mortality of the disease. Thus, considering the comorbidities that SARS-CoV-2 infection can promote, the modulation of purinergic signaling can be applied as a potential therapy. In this perspective, given the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in neural intercommunication, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) acts on microglia cells and its inhibition may be able to reduce the inflammatory condition of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, alternative measures to circumvent the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic need to be considered, given the severity of critical cases and the viral involvement of multiple organs.","Simões, Júlia Leão Batista; Bagatini, Margarete Dulce",J. neuroimmune pharmacol,182,5

The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of DEBs in a sample of Italian children and adolescents with T1D and in matched-pair healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 138 children and adolescents with T1D (aged 8.01-19.11 years, 65 boys) attending a Southern Italian diabetic service and 276 age- and gender-matched healthy peers voluntarily completed an online survey about eating behaviors (ChEAT and EAT-26), anthropometric characteristics, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 8.69% (N = 12) of participants with T1D and 13.4% (N = 37) of controls had ChEAT/EAT-26 scores indicating presence of DEBs, with no differences between patients-whether children (total ChEAT score F(1, 157) = .104, p = .748) or adolescents (total EAT-26 score F(1, 255) = .135, p = .731)-and healthy peers. zBMI values were lower than those measured in the latest diabetes visit (p < .0001), while HbA1c values remained unchanged (p = .110). In both groups, adolescents had lower Oral Control scores than children (T1D: F(1, 138) = 20.411, p < .0001, Î·2 = .132, controls: F(1, 276) = 18.271, p < .0001, Î·2 = .063); additionally, gender (female) and age were found to be significant predictors of several ChEAT/EAT-26 scores. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggested that children and adolescents with T1D did not experience more DEB symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to healthy controls. Results revealed DEBs as more of a female adolescent developmental issue rather than a result of the challenges of living with a chronic illness under quarantine measures. Possible effects of parental pressure on their children's eating behaviors in the context of home confinement and of using a non-diabetes-specific measure to assess DEBs are discussed.","Troncone, Alda; Chianese, Antonietta; Zanfardino, Angela; Cascella, Crescenzo; Piscopo, Alessia; Borriello, Anna; Rollato, Serena; Casaburo, Francesca; Testa, Veronica; Iafusco, Dario",J Eat Disord,182,20

Drug repurposing, i.e., utilizing an approved drug for a different indication, offers a time-and cost-efficient alternative for making new (relevant) therapies available to physicians and patients. Considering given strategy, many approved and investigational antiviral compounds, alone or in various relevant combinations, used in the past to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1, or Influenza viruses are being evaluated against the SARS-CoV-2. Triazavirin (TZV), a non-toxic broad--spectrum antiviral compound, is efficient against various strains of the Influenza A virus (Influenza Virus A, Orthomyxoviridae), i.e., swine flu (H1N1, or H3N2), avian influenza (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2, or highly pathogenic H7N3 strain), Influenza B virus (Influenza Virus B, Orthomyxoviridae), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Orthopneumovirus, Pneumoviridae), Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (known as Forest--Spring Encephalitis Virus;Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), West Nile Virus (Flavivirus, Flavaviridae), Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae), and Herpes viruses (Simplexviruses, Herpesviridae) as well. In regard to COVID-19, the molecule probably reduced inflammatory reactions, thus limiting the damage to vital organs and reducing the need for therapeutic support, respectively. In addition, in silico computational methods indicated relatively satisfactory binding affinities of the TZV ligand to both structural (E)-and (S)-proteins, non-structural 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3-CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 as well as human angiotensin-I converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). The interactions between TZV and given viral structures or the ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 might effectively block both the entry of the pathogen into a host cell and its replication. Promising treatment patterns of COVID-19 positive patients might be also based on a suitable combination of a membrane fusion inhibitor (umifenovir, for example) with viral RNA synthesis and replication inhibitor (TZV).","Malík, I.; Čižmárik, J.; Kováč, G.; Pecháčová, M.; Hudecová, L.",Ceska a Slovenska Farmacie,182,1

Due to the rapid spread, strong contagion, high incidence of lethality in severe cases, and the lack of a pharmaceutical prevention or cure, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to human life and health. It has also had a tremendous impact on mental health, including fear and worry, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and increased use of poor coping mechanisms. Osteopathic medical students have had additional concerns regarding the interruption of their studies, closing of clinical rotations, and postponed licensing exams. To date, few reports have focused on osteopathic medical students and their reactions to the outbreak. OBJECTIVES: To assess resilience, coping, health behaviors, and emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all medical students enrolled at Nova Southeastern University in May 2020 (n=1,310) via an e-mail invitation using the institution's student listservs. Our major study variables were based on published reports and anecdotal evidence; we subsequently developed the Emotional Wellbeing in Healthcare Professions Students Questionnaire (EWB-Q). This EWB-Q contained validated scales to assess the contribution of levels of coping strategies used, personal resilience, and health behaviors on the emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students. Multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v0.26. RESULTS: Of the 1,310 students invited to participate, 335 (25.5%) surveys were returned. Of those, 133 had more than 33% of the necessary data missing and were removed, resulting in 202 (15.4%) completed questionnaires. The mean age of the participants was 26.7 years. About half (n=92; 45.5%) were in the clinical phase (years 3 and 4) of their medical school training (in rotations). A significant regression equation was found (F[4,171]=17.481, p<0.000, R 2 =0.290, R 2adjusted=0.274), indicating that levels of coping, personal resilience, and health behaviors (i.e., not sleeping more than usual, not exercising less than usual) accounted for a significant amount of the variance in emotional wellbeing scores in osteopathic medical students. Higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, not sleeping more than usual, and not exercising less than usual were predictors of emotional wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Cultivating positive mental health should be a high priority for medical educators as they develop and implement curriculum-based initiatives to help medical students bolster their personal resilience and to encourage healthy coping behaviors during times of crisis and beyond. A proactive position that assists with building personal resilience and developing stress management habits is paramount in assisting students who are grappling not only with the challenges of rigorous medical training, but also with the uncertainty and stress that exists during any major global health or socioeconomic crisis.","Jacobs, Robin; Lanspa, Michelle; Kane, Michael; Caballero, Joshua",J Osteopath Med,182,23

METHODS: MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: ""COVID 19"" OR ""coronavirus"" AND ""brain"" OR ""CNS"" OR ""neurologic"". RESULTS: Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general. CONCLUSION: While neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Simani, Leila",J Neurol Sci,182,23

However, compression on one hand has an advantage in overcoming space requirements, but on the other hand, its processing gets expensive due to the decompression, which indents additional computing resources. Therefore, it would be novel to think of developing algorithms that can operate/analyse directly with the compressed data without involving the stages of decompression and recompression (required as many times, the compressed data needs to be operated or analyzed).

While concentrated research efforts are underway to develop antibody-based vaccines that would neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccine candidates are currently in Phase III clinical trials or have received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring second-generation vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e. neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them. These results are compared against existing experimental data, and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior. We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures. We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long-term. Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins, and present a new approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe present novel dynamic mechanisms of coronavirus S proteins that encode antibody binding and cellular fusion properties. These mechanisms may offer an explanation for the widespread nature of SARS-CoV-2 and more limited spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. A comprehensive computational characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures and dynamics provides insights into structural and thermal stability associated with a variety of S protein mutants. These findings allow us to make recommendations about the future mutant design of SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants that are optimized to elicit neutralizing antibodies, resist structural rearrangements that aid cellular fusion, and are thermally stabilized. The integrated computational approach can be applied to optimize vaccine immunogen design and predict escape of vaccine-induced antibody responses by SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Kunkel, Genevieve; Madani, Mohammad; White, S.

Therefore, cooling or freezing the samples is recommended in case of longer transportation times. In this study, the impact on SARS-CoV-2 detectability by reverse transcriptase PCR was assessed after prolonged unfrozen storage or repetitive freeze-thawing of SARS-CoV-2 samples. SARS-CoV-2-positive patient swabs stored in viral transport medium were exposed to different temperatures (4°C, 25°C, and 35°C) and to repetitive freeze-thawing, to assess the effect of storage conditions on reverse transcriptase PCR detection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still reliably detected by reverse transcriptase PCR after 21 days of storage in viral transport medium, even when the samples had been stored at 35°C. The change of Ct value per day was 0.023 to 0.046 (±0.018 to 0.019). In addition, viral RNA was still detected after 15 freeze-thaw cycles, with a change of Ct value of 0.106 to 0.197 (±0.009 to 0.061) per freeze-thaw cycle.

The results of this study indicate that viral RNA levels, as measured by reverse transcriptase PCR assays, are significantly, but not substantially, altered by prolonged unrefrigerated storage of up to 21 days at temperatures ranging up to 35°C or after repeated freeze-thaw cycles.","Dzung, Andreas; Cheng, Phil; Stoffel, Corinne; Tastanova, Aizhan; Turko, Patrick; Levesque, Mitchell P; Bosshard, Philipp P",J. mol. diagn,182,16

Important respiratory viruses that will need to be closely monitored during this time include SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B. The epidemiology of these viruses is very similar in terms of susceptible populations, mode of transmission, and the clinical syndromes, thus the etiological agent will be difficult to differentiate without target specific assays. The availability of a sensitive and specific multiplex assay that can simultaneously detect all these targets will be valuable. Here we report the validation of a real-time reverse transciptase-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B. This multiplex assay is comparable to its singleplex counterparts with a limit-of-detection being less than 5 copies/reaction, 100 % specificity, over seven logs of dynamic range, less than 1 % coefficientof variation showing high precision, and equivalent accuracy using patient samples. It also offers the added benefits of savings in reagents and technologist time while improving testing efficiency and turn-around-times in order to respond effectively to the ongoing pandemic.","Pabbaraju, Kanti; Wong, Anita A; Ma, Raymond; Zelyas, Nathan; Tipples, Graham A",J Virol Methods,182,24

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using restingstate and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. RESULTS: EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy. CONCLUSION: EEG can identify distinct neurophysiological changes among Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder that are akin to substance abuse disorders.","Sharifat, H.; Suppiah, S.",Med J Malaysia,182,21

The spread of this infection from children poses a danger to vulnerable adults. Therefore, child care institutions and schools currently are widely closed. METHODS: Since the status of infection tends to be congruent in mothers and their children, we tested 401 mothers of children between 1 and 10 years in the city of Rostock (State of Mecklenburg-Westpomerania, northeast of Germany), for the presence of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, and of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. RESULTS: In none of the mothers tested, RNA of this virus was detected in the throat swab. In the ELISA test, IgG antibodies were positive in one serum sample, IgA antibodies were positive in 11, and borderline in 3 serum samples. All 401 sera were negative in the indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) with FITC-labeled IgG, IgA, und IgM antibodies.

However, there is a lack of first-hand data on i) comparative efficacy of various treatment processes for SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal;and ii) temporal variations in the removal efficacy of a given treatment process in the backdrop of active COVID-19 cases. This work provides a comparative account of the removal efficacy of conventional activated sludge (CAS) and root zone treatments (RZT) based on weekly wastewater surveillance data, consisting of forty-four samples, during a two-month period. The average genome concentration was higher in the inlets of CAS-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the Sargasan ward (1.25 × 103 copies/ L), than that of RZT-based WWTP (7.07 × 102 copies/ L) in an academic institution campus of Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. ORF 1ab and S genes appeared to be more sensitive to treatment i.e., significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) than N genes (p &gt; 0.05). CAS treatment exhibited better RNA removal efficacy (p = 0.014) than RZT (p = 0.032). Multivariate analyses suggested that the effective genome concentration should be calculated based on the presence/absence of multiple genes. The present study stresses that treated effluents are not always free from SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the removal efficacy of a given WWTP is prone to exhibit temporal variability owing to variations in active COVID-19 cases in the vicinity and genetic material accumulation over the time. Disinfection seems less effective than the adsorption and coagulation processes for SARS-CoV-2 removal. Results stress the need for further research on mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 removal through various treatment processes taking solid–liquid partitioning into account.","Kumar, Manish Kuroda Keisuke Joshi Madhvi Bhattacharya Prosun Barcelo Damia",Chemical Engineering Journal,182,24

This study aimed to assess and compare predictive abilities of different frailty and comorbidity measures for COVID-19 mortality in a community sample and COVID-19 inpatients. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed (i) the full sample of 410,199 U.K. Biobank participants in England, aged 49-86 years, and (ii) a subsample of 2812 COVID-19 inpatients with COVID-19 data from March 1 to November 30, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was defined using the physical frailty phenotype (PFP), frailty index (FI), and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), and comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). PFP and FI were available at baseline, whereas HFRS and CCI were assessed both at baseline and concurrently with the start of the pandemic. Inpatient COVID-19 cases were confirmed by PCR and/or hospital records. COVID-19 mortality was ascertained from death registers. RESULTS: Overall, 514 individuals died of COVID-19. In the full sample, all frailty and comorbidity measures were associated with higher COVID-19 mortality risk after adjusting for age and sex. However, the associations were stronger for the concurrent versus baseline HFRS and CCI, with odds ratios of 20.40 (95% confidence interval = 16.24-25.63) comparing high (>15) to low (<5) concurrent HFRS risk category and 1.53 (1.48-1.59) per point increase in concurrent CCI. Moreover, only the concurrent HFRS or CCI significantly improved predictive ability of a model including age and sex, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) >0.8. When restricting analyses to COVID-19 inpatients, similar improvement in AUC was not observed. CONCLUSION: HFRS and CCI constructed from medical records concurrent with the start of the pandemic can be used in COVID-19 mortality risk stratification at the population level, but they show limited added value in COVID-19 inpatients.","Mak, Jonathan K L; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf; Wang, Yunzhang; Hägg, Sara; Jylhävä, Juulia",J. am. geriatr. soc,182,1

Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine.

Identifying the metabolic pathways that are altered early with viral infection and their association with disease severity is crucial to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology, and guide clinical decisions. This study aimed at assessing the critical metabolic pathways altered with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Forty-nine hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in a prospective, observational, single-center study in Barcelona, Spain. Demographic, clinical, and analytical data at admission were registered. Plasma samples were collected within the first 48 h following hospitalization. Patients were stratified based on the severity of their evolution as moderate (N = 13), severe (N = 10), or critical (N = 26). A panel of 221 biomarkers was measured by targeted metabolomics in order to evaluate metabolic changes associated with subsequent disease severity. Our results show that obesity, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, as well as some analytical parameters and radiological findings, were all associated with disease severity. Additionally, ceramide metabolism, tryptophan degradation, and reductions in several metabolic reactions involving nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD) at inclusion were significantly associated with respiratory severity and correlated with inflammation. In summary, assessment of the metabolomic profile of COVID-19 patients could assist in disease severity stratification and even in guiding clinical decisions.","Marín-Corral, Judith; Rodríguez-Morató, Jose; Gomez-Gomez, Alex; Pascual-Guardia, Sergi; Muñoz-Bermúdez, Rosana; Salazar-Degracia, Anna; Pérez-Terán, Purificación; Restrepo, Marcos I; Khymenets, Olha; Haro, Noemí; Masclans, Joan Ramon; Pozo, Oscar J",Int. j. mol. sci.

DESIGN: Rapid review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. RESULTS: 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Effective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak. These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.","Kisely, Steve; Warren, Nicola; McMahon, Laura; Dalais, Christine; Henry, Irene; Siskind, Dan",BMJ,182,20

We aimed to identify clusters with similar epidemic patterns across Italian regions. To do that, we defined a set of regional indicators reflecting different domains and employed a hierarchical clustering on principal component approach to obtain an optimal cluster solution. As of 24 April 2020, Lombardy was the worst hit Italian region and entirely separated from all the others. Sensitivity analysis-by excluding data from Lombardy-partitioned the remaining regions into four clusters. Although cluster 1 (i.e. Veneto) and 2 (i.e. Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna) included the most hit regions beyond Lombardy, this partition reflected differences in the efficacy of restrictions and testing strategies. Cluster 3 was heterogeneous and comprised regions where the epidemic started later and/or where it spread with the lowest intensity. Regions within cluster 4 were those where the epidemic started slightly after Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, favoring timely adoption of control measures.

Survey based studies have estimated that physicians spend 4-6 hours of their workday devoted to EHR. Our study was designed to use computer software to objectively obtain time spent on EHR. METHODS: We recorded EHR time for 248 physiciansover 2 time intervals. EHR active use was defined as more than 15 keystrokes, or 3 mouse clicks, or 1700 ""mouse miles"" per minute. We recorded total time and % of work hours spent on EHR, and differences in those based on seniority. Physicians reported duty hours using a standardized toolkit. RESULTS: Physicians spent 3.8 (±2) hours on EHR daily, which accounted for 37% (±17%), 41% (±14%), and 45% (±12%) of their day for all clinicians, residents, and interns, respectively. With the progression of training, there was a reduction in EHR time (all p values <0.01). During the first academic quarter, clinicians spent 38% (± 8%) of time on chart review, 17% (± 7%) on orders, 28% (±11%) on documentation (i.e. writing notes) and 17% (±7%) on other activities (i.e. physician hand-off and medication reconciliation). This pattern remained unchanged during the fourth quarter. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians spend close to 40% of their work day on EHR, with interns spending the most time. There is a significant reduction in time spent on EHR with training and greater experience, although the overall amount of time spent on EHR remained high.","Verma, Gautam; Ivanov, Alexander; Benn, Francis; Rathi, Anil; Tran, Nathaniel; Afzal, Ashwad; Mehta, Parag; Heitner, John F",PLoS One,182,26

In the present study, phytochemicals from spices were assessed for their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Structure based virtual screening was performed with 146 phytochemicals from spices using Autodock Vina. Phytochemicals with binding energy &#8805; -8.0 kcal/mol were selected to understand their interaction with MPro. Virtual screening was further validated by performing molecular docking to generate favorable docked poses and the participation of important amino acid residues. Molecular dynamics simulation for the docked poses was performed to study thermodynamic properties of the protein, ligand and protein-ligand complexes. The finding shows that cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin showed favorable binding affinity values with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. The results are comparable in terms of docked poses, important amino acid participation and thermodynamic properties with the standard control drugs remdesivir, benazepril and hydroxychloroquine diphosphate. Prime MM-GBSA was employed for end-point binding energy calculation. Binding to domain I and II of MPro were mediated through the OH, SH, NH2 and non-polar side chain of amino acids. Cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin binds to MPro with many sub sites within the active site with RMSD and RMSF within 4 Å. The results computed using Prime MM-GBSA show that cinnamtannin B2 (-68.54940214 kcal/mol) and cyanin (-62.1902835 kcal/mol) have better binding affinity in comparison to hydroxychloroquine diphosphate (-54.00912412 kcal/mol) and benazepril (-53.70242369 kcal/mol).

While the field of infodemiology has studied information patterns on the Web and in social media for at least 18 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been referred to as the first social media infodemic. However, there is limited evidence about whether and how the social media infodemic has spread panic and affected the mental health of social media users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine how social media affects self-reported mental health and the spread of panic about COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODS: To carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared and conducted in Iraqi Kurdistan, and a total of 516 social media users were sampled. This study deployed a content analysis method for data analysis. Correspondingly, data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Participants reported that social media has a significant impact on spreading fear and panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a potential negative influence on people's mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most used social media network for spreading panic about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq. We found a significant positive statistical correlation between self-reported social media use and the spread of panic related to COVID-19 (R=.8701). Our results showed that the majority of youths aged 18-35 years are facing psychological anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown, people are using social media platforms to gain information about COVID-19. The nature of the impact of social media panic among people varies depending on an individual's gender, age, and level of education. Social media has played a key role in spreading anxiety about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan.","Ahmad, Araz Ramazan; Murad, Hersh Rasool",J Med Internet Res,182,20

Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a low-fat diet (10.5% kcal from fat) or a high fat (58% kcal from fat) high carbohydrate (42g/L) diet with or without PFOS or PFHxS in feed (0.0003% w/w) for 29 weeks. Lipidomic, proteomic, and gene expression profiles were determined to explore lipid outcomes and hepatic mechanistic pathways. With administration of a high fat high carbohydrate (HFHC) diet, PFOS and PFHxS increased hepatic expression of targets involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In the blood, PFOS and PFHxS altered serum phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, plasmogens, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides. Further, oxidized lipid species were enriched in the blood lipidome of PFOS and PFHxS treated mice. These data support the hypothesis that PFOS and PFHxS increase the risk of metabolic and inflammatory disease induced by diet, possibly by inducing dysregulated lipid metabolism and oxidative stress.","Pfohl, Marisa; Ingram, Lishann; Marques, Emily; Auclair, Adam; Barlock, Benjamin; Jamwal, Rohitash; Anderson, Dwight; Cummings, Brian; Slitt, Angela L",Toxicol. sci,182,12

There have been a number of reports stating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids may exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this review aimed to collate information available in published articles to identify any evidence behind these claims with the aim of advising clinicians on how best to treat patients. This review found no published evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if utilised in the early acute phase of infection, however, conflicting evidence from the World Health Organisation surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. Given the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Rigg, Anne; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",ecancermedicalscience,182,1

436420,436420,436420,Elderberry for prevention and treatment of viral respiratory illnesses: a systematic review,14.28936,8.674898,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Cancer-related neuropathic pain (CNP) affects an increasing proportion of cancer patients, given improved survival, but it remains difficult to treat. There are no studies on an extended intravenous ketamine protocol and its synergies with common neuropathy treatments to treat CNP. This study aims to 1) evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an intravenous ketamine protocol to treat refractory CNP and 2) uncover synergies between ketamine and common neuropathy treatments. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective review of 57 patients and 192 infusions, with prospective follow-up on 14 enrolled patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. RESULTS: The etiologies of CNP were as follows: 13 from tumor compression, 25 with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, 13 from surgery, and 6 from radiation therapy. Overall, 42 of 57 patients (73.7%) were responders, and 71.8% of responders received >3 weeks of pain relief on their last infusion. Analysis of adjuvant treatments revealed that the combination of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and ketamine resulted in an increase in responders compared with nonresponders (P < 0.01). Adverse events occurred in 32 of 192 infusions (16.7%). All side effects self-resolved or resolved with intervention per the adverse events protocol. During the pandemic, all 14 currently enrolled patients did not receive ketamine infusions. Thirteen of the 14 patients returned to baseline pain, with 61.5% increasing medications. All experienced worsened function, mobility, mood, or anorexia. CONCLUSION: Intravenous ketamine may be a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for CNP, especially with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Larger, prospective studies are warranted and should explore parameters to help prognosticate response to ketamine infusions.","Oh, Daniel; Haffey, Paul; Patel, Ankur; Gulati, Amitabh",Pain Med,182,1

In the case of virion cells, substantial extinction power, counting both absorbing and scattering effects, is a prerequisite for performing a variety of coupling actions against the viral particles and, thus, a highly sought-after feature. By considering realistic dispersion for the dielectric permittivity of proteins and a core-shell modeling allowing for rigorous formulation via Mie theory, we report optical extinction resonances for corona-virions at mid-infrared range that are not significantly perturbed by changes in the objects size or the background host. Our findings indicate the optimal regime for interaction of photonic radiation with viral particles and may assist towards the development of equipment for thermal damage, disintegration or neutralization of coronavirus cells.","Valagiannopoulos, Constantinos; Sihvola, Ari",,182,20

We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in patients with severe (requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask) or critical (requiring greater supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal support) COVID-19. METHODS: We did a 60-day, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational phase 3 trial at 45 hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Russia, and Spain. We included adults (&#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pneumonia, who required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:1 with permuted blocks of five) to receive intravenous sarilumab 400 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo. Patients, care providers, outcome assessors, and investigators remained masked to assigned intervention throughout the course of the study. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement of two or more points (seven point scale ranging from 1 [death] to 7 [discharged from hospital]) in the modified intention-to-treat population. The key secondary endpoint was proportion of patients alive at day 29. Safety outcomes included adverse events and laboratory assessments. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04327388; EudraCT, 2020-001162-12; and WHO, U1111-1249-6021. FINDINGS: Between March 28 and July 3, 2020, of 431 patients who were screened, 420 patients were randomly assigned and 416 received placebo (n=84 [20%]), sarilumab 200 mg (n=159 [38%]), or sarilumab 400 mg (n=173 [42%]). At day 29, no significant differences were seen in median time to an improvement of two or more points between placebo (12·0 days [95% CI 9·0 to 15·0]) and sarilumab 200 mg (10·0 days [9·0 to 12·0]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·03 [95% CI 0·75 to 1·40]; log-rank p=0·96) or sarilumab 400 mg (10·0 days [9·0 to 13·0]; HR 1·14 [95% CI 0·84 to 1·54]; log-rank p=0·34), or in proportions of patients alive (77 [92%] of 84 patients in the placebo group; 143 [90%] of 159 patients in the sarilumab 200 mg group; difference -1·7 [-9·3 to 5·8]; p=0·63 vs placebo; and 159 [92%] of 173 patients in the sarilumab 400 mg group; difference 0·2 [-6·9 to 7·4]; p=0·85 vs placebo). At day 29, there were numerical, non-significant survival differences between sarilumab 400 mg (88%) and placebo (79%; difference +8·9% [95% CI -7·7 to 25·5]; p=0·25) for patients who had critical disease. No unexpected safety signals were seen. The rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were 65% (55 of 84) in the placebo group, 65% (103 of 159) in the sarilumab 200 mg group, and 70% (121 of 173) in the sarilumab 400 mg group, and of those leading to death 11% (nine of 84) were in the placebo group, 11% (17 of 159) were in the sarilumab 200 mg group, and 10% (18 of 173) were in the sarilumab 400 mg group. INTERPRETATION: This trial did not show efficacy of sarilumab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and receiving supplemental oxygen. Adequately powered trials of targeted immunomodulatory therapies assessing survival as a primary endpoint are suggested in patients with critical COVID-19.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the education system has been disrupted especially;it affects more for Higher Educational Institutes where students have come from various regions. The immediate lockdown in the country made the outside students reach their homes without any prior knowledge of its effects. Most of the education sector has switched to distance learning. Our institute has also adopted Virtual Learning. Various virtual platforms are available as the Learning Management System. We have adopted the use of ICT in education for the last 3-4 years. This helped us to handle the Teaching-Learning during a pandemic outbreak. We have used Moodle Learning Management System for Virtual Learning. Learners Centric MOOCs (LCM) model is implemented through LMS and the effectiveness is improved by adding Feedback and Assessment to it. The LCM model consists of structural elements: Learning Dialogs (LeD) in the form of short 10 to 12 minutes Videos, Learning by Doing (LbD) in the form of an assignment question or activity to do, Learning Experience Interactions (LxI) in the form reflection spot and discussion on the video provided and Learning Extension Trajectories (LxT) in the form of a small quiz on the video and resources. The major challenge for Virtual Learning is learner’s engagement. We have added feedback to improve the teaching-learning process. The model is effectively applied for Third Year Computer Science and Engineering class. The course of Compiler Construction is taken in to account for the implementation. A total of 73 students were involved in this activity. The results of feedback from students are satisfactory.

Objective: To assess whether suicide rates in Japan increased in April through November 2020 compared with previous years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used national data obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare from 2016 to 2020 on the monthly number of individuals who died of suicide in Japan from January to November of 2016 to 2020. Exposure: 2020 vs previous years. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was monthly suicide rates, calculated as the number of individuals who died of suicide divided by the total population. A difference-in-difference regression model was used to estimate the change in monthly suicide rates in April to November 2020 vs these months in 2016 to 2019. Results: Analyses included 90â¯048 individuals (61â¯366 [68.1%] men) who died of suicide from 2016 to 2020. The difference-in-difference analysis of men showed that there was no increase in suicide rates from April through September 2020 compared with these months in 2016 to 2019, but that suicide rates were increased in October (difference-in-difference, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.67] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population) and November (difference-in-difference, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.60] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population). Among women, suicide rates in 2020 compared with 2016 to 2019 increased in July (difference-in-difference, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.38] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population), August (difference-in-difference, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.45] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population), September (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population), October (difference-in-difference, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population), and November (difference-in-difference, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44] suicide deaths per 100â¯000 population). In secondary analyses in which the suicide rates of 2020 were compared with the expected rates based on trends from 2011 to 2019, the increases in suicide rates were most pronounced among men aged younger than 30 years (eg, November: observed vs expected rate ratio [RR], 1.48 [95% CI, 1.26-1.71]) and women aged younger than 30 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.76 to 2.52]) and 30 to 49 years (eg, October: observed vs expected RR, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.01 to 2.58]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that compared with previous years, suicide rates in Japan in 2020 increased in October and November for men and in July through November for women.","Sakamoto, Haruka; Ishikane, Masahiro; Ghaznavi, Cyrus; Ueda, Peter",JAMA Netw Open,182,16

This study aimed to propose a clinical staging proposal of the disease course in non-severe patients with COVID-19. In this retrospective study, 108 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were grouped according to the duration from symptoms onset to hospital admission: &#8804; 1 week, > 1 to 2 weeks, > 2 to 3 weeks, > 3 to 5 weeks, respectively. The dynamic changes of clinical signs were profiled across the four groups. A clinical staging proposal of the disease course over time was proposed from the perspective of the interaction between the virus and host. The prodromal phase, characterized by pneumonia, significant lymphopenia, and slightly elevated inflammatory markers, occurred in the first week after symptoms onset. In the second week, all the hematological and inflammatory markers were at the peak or bottom. Meanwhile, progressive pneumonia as well as the secondary damage of other organs (e.g. cardiac damage, coagulopathy, etc.) was significant during this period, making the disease progress into the apparent manifestation phase. In the third week, the improvement of the majority of clinical signs accompanied by a relatively high degree of inflammatory response defined the remission phase. After 3 weeks, patients were in the convalescent phase, in which all the indicators were maintained at a relatively normal level. We concluded that the disease course over time in non-severe patients with COVID-19 could be divided into four phases: the prodromal phase (in the first week), the apparent manifestation phase (in the second week), the remission phase (in the third week), and the convalescent phase (after 3 weeks), respectively. In clinical practice, tailored therapies should be considered seriously in different stages of the disease course.","Lin, Yiting; Wu, Yiqun; Zhong, Ping; Hou, Bingbo; Liu, Jielan; Chen, Yingying; Liu, Jiajun",Sci Rep,182,33

It is known to directly cause damage and dysfunction in neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. However, the deleterious effects of stretch-injury on microglia, the brain's primary immunocompetent cell, are currently unknown. The Cell Injury Controller II (CICII), a validated cellular neurotrauma model, was used to induce a mechanical stretch-injury in primary rat microglia. Statistical analysis utilized Student's t test and one- and two-way ANOVAs with Tukey's and Sidak's multiple comparisons, respectively. Cells exposed to stretch-injury showed no signs of membrane permeability, necrosis, or apoptosis, as measured by media-derived lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cleaved-caspase 3 immunocytochemistry, respectively. Interestingly, injured cells displayed a functional deficit in nitric oxide production (NO), identified by media assay and immunocytochemistry, at 6, 12, 18, and 48 h post-injury. Furthermore, gene expression analysis revealed the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10, and enzyme arginase-1 was significantly downregulated at 12 h post-injury.

Lastly, coinciding with the functional immune deficits was a significant change in morphology, with process length decreasing and cell diameter increasing following an injury at 12 h. Taken together, the data demonstrate that stretch-injury produces significant alterations in microglial function, which may have a marked impact on their response to injury or their interaction with other cells.","Shaughness, Mike; Byrnes, Kimberly",Mol.

We conducted a meta-analysis, using random-effects, examining individual and relationship outcomes of online relationship education programs. We identified 12 publications included in the analysis, and found that online relationship education programs produced significant effects in increasing relationship satisfaction, communication skills, relationship confidence, positive relationship qualities, and decreasing negative relationship qualities. At the individual-level, we found that online relationship programs reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms, increased health satisfaction, and overall quality of life. Additionally, we found no differences related to gender, whether or not couples were identified as ""distressed,"" whether or not the programs were ""enhanced,"" or length of the program.","Spencer, Chelsea M; Anderson, Jared R",J Marital Fam Ther,182,16

METHODS: Fresh donor corneas and primary explant cultures of corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells were evaluated for the expression of viral entry factors. Using immunohistochemistry, the samples were tested for the expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). RESULTS: In total, 5 donor corneas were evaluated for the expression of viral entry factors. In all specimens, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed throughout the surface epithelium (corneal, limbal, and conjunctival) and corneal endothelium. In corneal stromal cells, ACE2 was sporadically expressed, whereas TMPRSS2 was absent. DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR expression varied between donor specimens. Four specimens expressed DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR in a similar distribution to ACE2, but 1 specimen from a young donor showed no expression of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR. ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR were all expressed in the cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Both corneal and conjunctival epithelia express ACE2, DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR, and TMPRSS2, suggesting that the ocular surface is a potential route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The risk of viral transmission with corneal transplantation cannot be ruled out, given the presence of ACE2 in corneal epithelium and endothelium. Cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells mimic the expression of viral entry factors in fresh donor tissue and may be useful for future in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection studies.","Roehrich, Heidi; Yuan, Ching; Hou, Joshua H",Cornea,182,32

Methods: COVID-19 Taskforce was established to formulate standardized scenario-based simulation training materials in late-January 2020. Post-training questionnaires made up of 5-point Likert scales were distributed to all participants to evaluate their personal strengths, in terms of i) assertiveness, ii) mental preparedness, iii) self-efficacy, iv) internal locus of control, and v) internal locus of responsibility. Independent sample t-tests were used to analyze between-group difference in ""In-situ"" and ""Lab-based"" group; and one-sample t-tests were used to compare change in personal strengths with reference point of 3 (Neutral). Kirkpatrick's Model served as the analytical framework for overall training effects. Results: Between 05 February and 18 March 2020, 101 sessions of simulation training were conducted in ""In-Situ"" at either Accident & Emergency Department (20, 20%) or Intensive Care Unit (15, 14%) and ""Lab-based"" for Isolation (30, 30%) and General Wards (36, 36%). 1,415 hospital staff members, including 1,167 nurses (82%), 163 doctors (12%) and 85 patient care assistants (6%), were trained. All domains of personal strengths were scored 4.24 or above and statistically significantly increased when comparing with reference population (p < .001). However, no significant differences between in-situ and lab-based simulation were found (p > .05), for all domains of personal strengths. Conclusion: Healthcare simulation training enhanced healthcare workers' personal strengths critical to operational and clinical outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheung, Victor Kai-Lam; So, Eric Hang-Kwong; Ng, George Wing-Yiu; So, Sze-Sze; Hung, Jeff Leung-Kit; Chia, Nam-Hung",Integr Med Res,182,24

Prioritising healthcare workers may have intuitive appeal, but the ethical justifications for doing so and the potential harms that could follow require careful analysis. Ethical justifications commonly offered for healthcare worker prioritisation for ventilators rest on two social value criteria: (1) instrumental value, also known as the 'multiplier effect', which may preserve the ability of healthcare workers to help others, and (2) reciprocity, which rewards past usefulness or sacrifice. We argue that these justifications are insufficient to over-ride the common moral commitment to value each person's life equally. Institutional policies prioritising healthcare workers over other patients also violate other ethical norms of the healthcare professions, including the commitment to put patients first. Furthermore, policy decisions to prioritise healthcare workers for ventilators could engender or deepen existing distrust of the clinicians, hospitals and health systems where those policies exist, even if they are never invoked.","Chen, Donna T; Shepherd, Lois; Taylor, Jordan; Marshall, Mary Faith",J. med. ethics,182,20

We evaluated the ambulance driving time to primary PCI centres in the Netherlands and assessed to what extent ambulance driving times were impacted by the expansion of off-site PCI centres. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated the driving routes from every Dutch postal code to the nearest PCI centre with (on-site) or without (off-site) surgical back-up. We used data from ambulance records to estimate the ambulance driving time on each route. There were 16 on-site and 14 off-site PCI centres. The median (interquartile range) time to on-site PCI centres was 18.8â¯min (12.2-26.3) compared with 14.9â¯min (8.9-20.9) to any PCI centre (pâ¯< 0.001). In postal code areas that were impacted by the initiation of off-site PCI, the median driving time decreased from 25.4 (18.2-33.1) to 14.7â¯min (8.9-20.9) (pâ¯< 0.001). Ambulance driving times of >120â¯min were only seen in non-mainland areas. CONCLUSION: Based on a computational model, timely ambulance transfer to a PCI centre within 120â¯min is available to almost all STEMI patients in the Netherlands. Expansion of off-site PCI has significantly reduced the driving time to PCI centres.","Hoedemaker, N P G; de Winter, R J; Kommer, G J; Giesbers, H; Adams, R; van den Bosch, S E; Damman, P",Neth. heart j,182,24

The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and governor mandated Stay at Home Order on ED super utilizers. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to the 12 emergency departments of the Franciscan Mission of Our Lady Hospital System in Louisiana between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patients who were 18 years of age or older and had four ED visits within a one-year period (2018, 2019, or 2020) were classified as super-utilizers. We examined number and category of visits for the baseline period (January 2018 - March 2020), the governor's Stay at Home Order, and the subsequent Reopening Phases through December 31, 2020. RESULTS: The number of visits by super utilizers decreased by over 16% when the Stay at Home Order was issued. The average number of visits per week rose from 1010.63 during the Stay at Home Order to 1198.09 after the Stay at Home Order was lifted, but they did not return to Pre-COVID levels of approximately 1400 visits per week in 2018 and 2019. When categories of visits were examined, this trend was found for emergent visits (p < 0.001) and visits related to injuries (p < 0.001). Non-emergent visits declined during the Stay at Home Order compared to the baseline period (p < 0.001), and did not increase significantly during reopening compared to the Stay at Home Order (p = 0.87). There were no changes in number of visits for psychiatric purposes, alcohol use, or drug use during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Significant declines in emergent visits raise concerns that individuals who needed ED treatment did not seek it due to COVID-19. However, the finding that super utilizers with non-emergent visits continued to visit the ED less after the Stay at Home Order was lifted raises questions for future research that may inform policy and interventions for inappropriate ED use.","Alwood, Shannon; Musso, Mandi W; Jones, Glenn N; Mosley, Joel; Wippel, Brittany; Theriot, Lauren; Hamer, Diana",Am J Emerg Med,182,20

One of the difficulties encountered in the virtual curriculum is the teaching of clinical competencies that would traditionally require students to undergo in-person simulations and patient encounters. We implemented a novel informed consent activity module with standardized patients to improve self-efficacy in communication within our core surgery clerkship. STUDY DESIGN: All medical students who participated in the virtual surgery clerkship were recruited to participate in a retrospective survey study regarding the novel informed consent module. These questions evaluated their perceived competence in four domains relating to informed consent: identifying the key elements, describing common challenges, applying the New Mexico Clinical Communication Scale (NMCCS, and documenting. RESULTS: 34 out of the 90 students participated in the study (38% of the cohort). Respondents to the survey reported that their self-efficacy in communication skills related to informed consent improved as a result of their participation in the activity in each of the four domains surveyed (p<0.01), with the majority of students identifying as satisfactory or above in each domain post-module. Students generally viewed the virtual informed consent activity positively, but noted that it was not the same as an in-person clinical experience. CONCLUSION: A virtual module of communication skills training using standardized patients and faculty improved student belief in their self-efficacy in obtaining informed consent. This communication module can be useful in a virtual or mixed curricular structure for both current and future medical students.","Pang, Joyce H; Finlay, Esme; Fortner, Sally; Pickett, Bradley; Wang, Ming-Li",J.

The study was a cross-sectional surveyperformed among 309 HCWs in a tertiaryhospital during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire, including demographic data, a 10-item COVID-19 stress questionnaire, Generic QOL Inventory-74, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression was used to analyse the relationship between the study variables and the QOL. Among the 309 participants, resilience and active coping were positively correlated with the QOL (P<0.001), whereas, working in confirmed case wards, COVID-19 stress, and passive coping were negatively correlated with the QOL (P<0.001). Resilience and the active coping were negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress (P<0.001). Resilience, coping style,and COVID-19 stressaccounted for 32%, 13%, and 8% of the variance in predicting the Global QOL, respectively.

AD, a degenerative brain disease, is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid beta (Aß) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles disposition. Some studies have recently demonstrated that Aß and tau cannot fully explain the pathophysiological development of AD and that metabolic disease factors, such as insulin, adiponectin, and antioxidants, are important for the sporadic onset of nongenetic AD. Obesity prevention and treatment can be an efficacious and safe approach to AD prevention. Adiponectin is a benign adipokine that sensitizes the insulin receptor signaling pathway and suppresses inflammation. It has been shown to be inversely correlated with adipose tissue dysfunction and may enhance the risk of AD because a range of neuroprotection adiponectin mechanisms is related to AD pathology alleviation. In this study, we summarize the recent progress that addresses the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of adiponectin in AD. Furthermore, we review recent studies on the diverse medications of adiponectin that could possibly be related to AD treatment, with a focus on their association with adiponectin. A better understanding of the neuroprotection roles of adiponectin will help clarify the precise underlying mechanism of AD development and progression.","Kim, Jong Youl; Barua, Sumit; Jeong, Ye Jun; Lee, Jong Eun",,182,23

First, mathematical analyses establish that the global dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 infectious disease are completely determined by the basic reproduction number R0. If R0 &#8804; 1, then the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. If R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Second, the unknown parameters of model are estimated by the MCMC algorithm on the basis of the total confirmed new cases from February 1, 2020 to March 23, 2020 in the UK. We also estimate that the basic reproduction number is R0 = 4.2816(95%CI: (3.8882, 4.6750)). Without the most restrictive measures, we forecast that the COVID-19 epidemic will peak on June 2 (95%CI: (May 23, June 13)) (Figure 3a) and the number of infected individuals is more than 70% of UK population. In order to determine the key parameters of the model, sensitivity analysis are also explored. Finally, our results show reducing contact is effective against the spread of the disease.

This study investigates the use of neuro-fuzzy and group method of data handling, for the diagnosis of acute leukemia in children based on the complete blood count test. Furthermore, a principal component analysis is applied to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. The results show that distinguishing between patient and non-patient individuals can easily be done with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, whereas for classifying between the types of diseases themselves, more pre-processing operations such as reduction of features may be needed. The proposed approach may help to distinguish between two types of leukemia including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Based on the sensitivity of the diagnosis, experts can use the proposed algorithm to help identify the disease earlier and lessen the cost.","Fathi, Ehsan; Rezaee, Mustafa Jahangoshai; Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Reza; Alizadeh, Azra; Montazer, Aynaz",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,182,24

Outpatient care has been gradually shifted from physical visits to tele-health and online consultations. General recommendations have favored the conservative approach over surgeries, although no patient should be deprived of standard care owing to concerns about COVID. The general principles followed by spine surgeons should include early detection of COVID symptomatology; triaging of patients based on underlying spinal pathology; prescription of appropriate investigations to confirm the COVID status; isolation, as needed; selection of optimal management method as per the guidelines; adherence to best intraoperative practices; and ensuring protective measures for non-infected patients, family members, fellow heath care providers, and themselves against the disease.","Viswanathan, Vibhu Krishnan; Subramanian, Surabhi; Rao, Arthi K",,182,8

This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for SARS-CoV-2. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, 512 potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over seventeen thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were then compared subsequently to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire viral realm. Sequences found in common with other viral species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the SARS-CoV-2 were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates were then confirmed experimentally.

There is limited information on MiP in low transmission regions as Colombia. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of MiP through active surveillance of infections by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2016 and January 2017 in five municipalities (Apartadó, Turbo, El Bagre, Quibdó, and Tumaco) in Colombia. Pregnant women self-presenting at health centers for antenatal care visits, seeking medical care for suspected malaria, or delivery, were enrolled. Diagnosis of Plasmodium spp was made in peripheral and placental blood samples by microscopy and PCR. Results: A total of 787 pregnant women were enrolled; plasmodial infection was diagnosed by microscopy in 4.2% (95% CI 2.8-5.6; 33/787) or by nPCR in 5.3% (95% CI 3.8-6.9; 42/787) in peripheral blood.

Clinically, nebulization of IFN-α-2b has been historically used in China to treat viral pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV. Very recent data show that the use of inhaled type I IFN is associated with decreased mortality in Chinese COVID-19 patients. However, IFN nebulization is currently not standard in Europe and the United States. Therefore, our group has set up a project aimed to evaluate the possibility to nebulize IFN-β-1b (a drug currently used in Europe to treat multiple sclerosis via subcutaneous injections) and to assess the safety of this new mode of administration in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We present here literature data that allowed us to build our hypothesis and to develop collaboration between clinical pharmacists, intensivists and nebulization engineers in order to gain first pre-clinical and clinical experience of IFN-β-1b nebulization. After validation of the nebulization method and verification of droplet size compatible with nebulization, the method has been applied to four intensive care patients treated at our university hospital, for whom none of the COVID-19 therapies initially used in France led to significant clinical improvement. All patients exhibited negative viral carriage and experienced clinical improvement 7–16 days after having initiated nebulized IFN-β-1b inhalation therapy. No side effects were observed. All patients were alive within a 90-days follow-up. Although it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on treatment efficacy based on this case report, our study shows that pulmonary IFN-β-1b administration is feasible, with a good safety profile. This procedure, which presents the advantage of directly targeting the lungs and reducing the risks of systemic side effects, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the care of patients with severe COVID-19. However, our preliminary observation requires confirmation by randomized controlled trials.","Mary, Aurélien; Hénaut, Lucie; Macq, Pierre Yves; Badoux, Louise; Cappe, Arnaud; Porée, Thierry; Eckes, Myriam; Dupont, Hervé; Brazier, Michel",Front Pharmacol,182,1

In addition to pneumonia, individuals affected by the disease have neurological symptoms. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has a neuroinvasive capacity. It is known that the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to a cytokine storm. An exacerbated inflammatory state can lead to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage as well as to intestinal dysbiosis. These changes, in turn, are associated with microglial activation and reactivity of astrocytes that can promote the degeneration of neurons and be associated with the development of psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Studies also have been shown that SARS-CoV-2 alters the composition and functional activity of the gut microbiota. The microbiota-gut-brain axis provides a bidirectional homeostatic communication pathway. Thus, this review focuses on studies that show the relationship between inflammation and the gut microbiota–brain axis in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Manosso, Luana M.; Arent, Camila O.; Borba, Laura A.; Ceretta, Luciane B.; Quevedo, João; Réus, Gislaine Z.",Cells,182,17

To assess mucosal irritation, previous studies employed the snail Arion lusitanicus as the mucosal model in Slug Mucosal Irritation (SMI) assay. The obtained results confirmed snails as a suitable experimental model for their anatomical characteristics superimposable to the human mucosae and the different easily observed readouts. Another terrestrial gastropod, Limacus flavus, also known as “ Yellow slug “, due to its larger size and greater longevity, has already been proposed as an SMI assay alternative model. In this study, for the first time, in addition to the standard parameters recorded in the SMI test, the production of yellow pigment in response to irritants, unique to the snail L. flavus, was evaluated.

During this pandemic, clinical teaching hospitals have faced unprecedented challenges regarding the management of postgraduate medical students since postgraduate students in clinical medicine have both student and resident identity characteristics. The purpose of this study was to explore the management effectiveness of Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) based on PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle management and to further develop the medical student management system during the pandemic. METHODS: The methods of document review, questionnaire surveys and interviews were used to continuously improve the management measures for postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the PDCA cycle. RESULTS: Investigations were conducted on the management system, back-to-school arrangements, laboratory management, COVID-19 prevention and control training, online teaching, mentoring, dissertation progress, and emotional state of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that strengthening public health management knowledge training, increasing infectious-disease-related knowledge training, innovating online teaching methods, improving PDCA management model maps, and formulating improvement programmes are conducive to improving the quality of such management. CONCLUSION: Given the difficulties involved in the management of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, managers need to comprehensively consider and conduct overall planning and use the PDCA management model to improve the management of postgraduate medical students during this period.

The aim was to evaluate the effect of peer mentoring in third-year students and to gauge the evolution of non-technical skills (NTS) acquisition up to the fifth year. The study groups were selected between September 2015 and May 2018, based on the NTS training they had or had not received: (1) fifth-year students with no training (G1); (2) third-year students mentored in NTS (G2a); and (3) a small group of fifth-year students who became mentors (G2b). A total of 276 students who took part in this study were assessed using a 114-item self-evaluation questionnaire. Data were collected from seven surveys conducted between September 2015 and May 2018, and statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s post-hoc test. G2a improved their non-technical skill acquisition over three years of clinical training up to their fifth year. This group and G2b showed statistically significant differences compared to non-mentored students (G1).

DTMUV infection mainly results in significant decreases in egg production in egg-laying ducks within 1–2 weeks post infection. However, information on the comparative protein expression of host tissues in response to DTMUV infection is limited. In the present study, the cellular protein response to DTMUV infection in duck ovarian follicles was analyzed using nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed 131 differentially expressed proteins, among which 53 were up regulated and 78 were down regulated. The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as cellular structure and integrity, RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and modification, vesicle transport, signal transduction, and mitochondrial pathway. Some selected proteins that were found to be regulated in DTMUV-infected tissues were screened by quantitative real-time PCR to examine their regulation at the transcriptional level, western blot analysis was used to validate the changes of some selected proteins on translational level. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the proteomic changes in duck ovarian follicles following DTMUV infection. The protein-related information obtained in this study may be useful to understand the host response to DTMUV infection and the inherent mechanism of DTMUV replication and pathogenicity.","Han, Kaikai; Zhao, Dongmin; Liu, Yuzhuo; Liu, Qingtao; Huang, Xinmei; Yang, Jing; An, Fengjiao; Li, Yin",Front Microbiol,182,16

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry/infection. METHODS: We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2. RESULTS: Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, Western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus. This highlights the importance of safety practices including face masks and ocular contact precautions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease.","Zhou, Lingli; Xu, Zhenhua; Castiglione, Gianni M.; Soiberman, Uri S.; Eberhart, Charles G.; Duh, Elia J.",Ocul Surf,182,32

The currently administered vaccines depend on adenovirus DNA vectors or on SARS-CoV-2 mRNA that might become reverse transcribed into DNA, however infrequently. In some societies, people have become sensitized against the potential short- or long-term side effects of foreign DNA being injected into humans. In my laboratory, the fate of foreign DNA in mammalian (human) cells and organisms has been investigated for many years. In this review, a summary of the results obtained will be presented. This synopsis has been put in the evolutionary context of retrotransposon insertions into pre-human genomes millions of years ago. In addition, studies on adenovirus vector-based DNA, on the fate of food-ingested DNA as well as the long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA/DNA will be described. Actual integration of viral DNA molecules and of adenovirus vector DNA will likely be chance events whose frequency and epigenetic consequences cannot with certainty be assessed. The review also addresses problems of remaining adenoviral gene expression in adenoviral-based vectors and their role in side effects of vaccines. Eventually, it will come down to weighing the possible risks of genomic insertions of vaccine-associated foreign DNA and unknown levels of vector-carried adenoviral gene expression versus protection against the dangers of Covid-19. A decision in favor of vaccination against life-threatening disease appears prudent. Informing the public about the complexities of biology will be a reliable guide when having to reach personal decisions about vaccinations.","Doerfler, Walter",Virus Res,182,1

We then investigated the lung perfusion conditions in patients affected by COVID- 19 during recovery. Method. We retrospectively studied 20 patients, from 14 to 60 days after resolution of the COVID-19 symptoms, using chest CT. In a subgroup of 5 patients contrasted CT was used. Beside normal radiological evaluation of lung tissue, perfusion conditions were evaluated by digital image processing in the lung volume automatically segmented. Results. Pulmonary lung evaluation showed that COVID-19 pneumonia almost completely regressed, with mild focal areas affected by fibrous stripes. In patients that reported dyspnea, lung CT showed complete resolution of interstitial changes. Quantification of lung perfusion condition by contrasted CT, showed that dyspnea in 3 patients was associated with areas of hypoperfusion, while in 2 patients not reporting dyspnea perfusion conditions were comparable to normal controls. Conclusions. Although we obtained preliminary data, this is the first report on quantitative evaluation of hypoperfused lung tissue detected in recovering COVID-19 patients. These results suggest the need to further investigate these patients and to redefine the role of CT evaluation for diagnostic purposes as well as for evaluation of potential treatments.","Patelli, G.; Paganoni, S.; Besana, F.; Ronzoni, M.; Manini, S.; Remuzzi, A.",,182,30

However, few large, population-based studies have investigated the risk of infection in childhood across the full spectrum of gestational age. The objectives of this study were to explore the association between gestational age at birth and infection-related hospital admissions up to the age of 10 years, how infection-related hospital admission rates change throughout childhood, and whether being born small for gestational age (SGA) modifies this relationship. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a population-based, record-linkage cohort study design, birth registrations, birth notifications and hospital admissions were linked using a deterministic algorithm. The study population included all live, singleton births occurring in NHS hospitals in England from January 2005 to December 2006 (n = 1,018,136). The primary outcome was all infection-related inpatient hospital admissions from birth to 10 years of age, death or study end (March 2015). The secondary outcome was the type of infection-related hospital admission, grouped into broad categories. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each gestational age category (<28, 28–29, 30–31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 weeks) and the models were repeated by age at admission (<1, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, and 7–10 years). An interaction term was included in the model to test whether SGA status modified the relationship between gestational age and infection-related hospital admissions. Gestational age was strongly associated with rates of infection-related hospital admissions throughout childhood. Whilst the relationship attenuated over time, at 7–10 years of age those born before 40 weeks gestation were still significantly higher in comparison to those born at 40 weeks. Children born <28 weeks had an aRR of 6.53 (5.91–7.22) during infancy, declining to 3.16 (2.50–3.99) at ages 7–10 years, in comparison to those born at 40 weeks; whilst in children born at 38 weeks, the aRRs were 1·24 (1.21–1.27) and 1·18 (1.13–1.23), during infancy and aged 7–10 years, respectively. SGA status modified the effect of gestational age (interaction P<0.0001), with the highest rate among the children born at <28 weeks and SGA. Finally, study findings indicated that the associations with gestational age varied by subgroup of infection. Whilst upper respiratory tract infections were the most common type of infection experienced by children in this cohort, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (<28 weeks, aRR = 10.61(9.55–11.79)) and invasive bacterial infections (<28 weeks, aRR = 6.02 (4.56–7.95)) were the most strongly associated with gestational age at birth. Of LRTIs experienced, bronchiolitis (<28 weeks, aRR = 11.86 (10.20–13.80)), and pneumonia (<28 weeks, aRR = 9.49 (7.95–11.32)) were the most common causes. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age at birth was strongly associated with rates of infection-related hospital admissions during childhood and even children born a few weeks early remained at higher risk at 7–10 years of age. There was variation between clinical subgroups in the strength of relationships with gestational age. Effective infection prevention strategies should include focus on reducing the number and severity of LRTIs during early childhood.","Coathup, Victoria; Carson, Claire; Kurinczuk, Jennifer J.; Macfarlane, Alison J.; Boyle, Elaine; Johnson, Samantha; Petrou, Stavros; Quigley, Maria A.",PLoS One,182,28

To date, reducing and tracking human movement during the COVID-19 pandemic has proven effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Existing methods for monitoring and modeling the spatial spread of infectious diseases rely on various data sources as proxies of human movement, such as airline travel data, mobile phone data, and banknote tracking. However, intrinsic limitations of these data sources prevent us from systematic monitoring and analyses of human movement on different spatial scales (from local to global). OBJECTIVE: Big data from social media such as geotagged tweets have been widely used in human mobility studies, yet more research is needed to validate the capabilities and limitations of using such data for studying human movement at different geographic scales (eg, from local to global) in the context of global infectious disease transmission. This study aims to develop a novel data-driven public health approach using big data from Twitter coupled with other human mobility data sources and artificial intelligence to monitor and analyze human movement at different spatial scales (from global to regional to local). METHODS: We will first develop a database with optimized spatiotemporal indexing to store and manage the multisource data sets collected in this project. This database will be connected to our in-house Hadoop computing cluster for efficient big data computing and analytics. We will then develop innovative data models, predictive models, and computing algorithms to effectively extract and analyze human movement patterns using geotagged big data from Twitter and other human mobility data sources, with the goal of enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. RESULTS: This project was funded as of May 2020. We have started the data collection, processing, and analysis for the project. CONCLUSIONS: Research findings can help government officials, public health managers, emergency responders, and researchers answer critical questions during the pandemic regarding the current and future infectious risk of a state, county, or community and the effectiveness of social/physical distancing practices in curtailing the spread of the virus.

Some of these peptides have been shown to inhibit multiple unrelated viruses. We have suggested that such broad-spectrum antiviral peptides share a property called interfacial activity; they are somewhat hydrophobic and amphipathic, with a propensity to interact with the interfacial zones of lipid bilayer membranes. In this study, we further tested the hypothesis that such interfacial activity is a correlate of broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In this study, several families of peptides, selected for the ability to partition into and disrupt membrane integrity but with no known antiviral activity, were tested for the ability to inhibit multiple diverse enveloped viruses. These include Lassa pseudovirus, influenza virus, dengue virus type 2, herpes simplex virus 1, and nonenveloped human adenovirus 5. Various families of interfacially active peptides caused potent inhibition of all enveloped viruses tested at low and submicromolar concentrations, well below the range in which they are toxic to mammalian cells. These membrane-active peptides block uptake and fusion with the host cell by rapidly and directly interacting with virions, destabilizing the viral envelope, and driving virus aggregation and/or intervirion envelope fusion. We speculate that the molecular characteristics shared by these peptides can be exploited to enable the design, optimization, or molecular evolution of novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics.IMPORTANCE New classes of antiviral drugs are needed to treat the ever-changing viral disease landscape. Current antiviral drugs treat only a small number of viral diseases, leaving many patients with established or emerging infections to be treated solely with supportive care. Recent antiviral peptide research has produced numerous membrane-interacting peptides that inhibit diverse enveloped viruses in vitro and in vivo Peptide therapeutics are becoming more common, with over 60 FDA-approved peptides for clinical use. Included in this class of therapeutics is enfuvirtide, a 36-residue peptide drug that inhibits HIV entry/fusion. Due to their broad-spectrum mechanism of action and enormous potential sequence diversity, peptides that inhibit virus entry could potentially fulfill the need for new antiviral therapeutics; however, a better understanding of their mechanism is needed for the optimization or evolution of sequence design to combat the wide landscape of viral disease.","Hoffmann, Andrew R; Guha, Shantanu; Wu, Eric; Ghimire, Jenisha; Wang, Yilin; He, Jing; Garry, Robert F; Wimley, William C",J. virol,182,16

As a mandate, Goal 4 of Sustainable Development Goals states that by 2030 all member states should work to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” (UNESCO, 2015). In practice, however, the responses of different international education institutions during the Covid‐19 confinement indicate that the achievement of this equity plan at the global level is rather unfeasible. To address this issue from a local lens, this study seeks to examine the plan implemented for online teaching in the Algerian higher education institutions. It draws on a key body of literature on online infrastructure and pedagogy to explore (1) the different online teaching models that were implemented, (2) Algerian higher education teachers' practices within the framework of this new model of teaching, and (3) the different challenges encountered by teachers during this transition. To achieve this end, a qualitative study that is based on an analysis of teachers' interviews is conducted to explore teachers' practices in different higher education institutions in Algeria. The results of this research will not only highlight the prevailing disparities, but will also serve to offer recommendations that could be relevant to future teachers' professional development programs.","Hadjeris, Fadhila",Hum Behav Emerg Technol,182,16

In patients with COVID-19, elevated high sensitive troponin (hs-TnI) levels are frequent independent from the underlying cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between high troponin levels and LVGLS in such patients remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the relation between troponin levels and LVGLS values in patients with COVID-19. A total of thirty-eight patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent echocardiography examination within the first week of hospital admission were enrolled in our study. Patients were divided into two groups according to their hs-TnI levels. Conventional left venticular (LV) function parameters, including ejection fraction, LV diastolic and systolic volumes were obtained and LVGLS was determined using 2D-STE. Frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and current smoking were similar among groups. Compared with the patients in the negative troponin group, those in the positive troponin group were more likely to have a higher age; higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and ferritin; higher need for high-flow oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation therapy or both; and a higher number of intensive care unit admissions. There was no statistically significant difference in LVGLS and ejection fraction values between the two groups.(− 18.5 ± 2.9, − 19.8 ± 2.8, p = 0.19; 55.2 ± 9.9, 59.5 ± 5.9, p = 0.11 respectively).

Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.","Shaw, Megan L.",Reviews in Medical Virology,182,12

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this non-interventional retrospective study, carried out at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System, all adult patients who were admitted in the Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology Department between March 9th and May 4th, 2020, were included. Clinical, biological and radiological data, as well as mortality rates, were collected from hospital medical records. RESULTS: A total of 293 periods of hospitalization were analysed in 288 patients. Mean age was 66.1 years old and 57.3% were females. Nineteen patients (6.48%) met the inclusion criteria to be categorized as a nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a comparison between patients with and without nosocomial infection, age, mortality and hospital length of stay were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort was 16 days (6–86 days). No statistically significant differences were found in sex, living situation, reason of admission or period of admission (even if we observed that most of the nosocomial infections (78.9%) occurred in March). CONCLUSION: We have found a 6.48% of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2, but with an important reduction of it after undergoing preventing protocols that included screening RT-PCR test for COVID-19. Age and hospital length stay were statistically significant risk factors for nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. For the progressive restoration of the surgical activity, we recommend to correctly select the patients in elective surgery and to encourage fast-track programs and early discharge of patients with fractures.","Lakhani, Kushal; Minguell, Joan; Guerra-Farfán, Ernesto; Lara, Yuri; Jambrina, Unai; Pijoan, Joan; Núñez, Jorge H.",Int Orthop,182,22

We aim to understand patent challenges and identify the factors that are associated with successful patent challengers under the patent linkage system in South Korea. METHODS: We constructed a novel dataset that combined information on manufacturers with detailed data about their patent challenges after introduction of the patent linkage system. Based on the number of successful patent challenges, manufacturers were categorized into non-challengers, passive challengers, and aggressive challengers. Then, two types of logistic models were applied to identify the factors associated with successful and aggressive challengers. FINDINGS: Only 39 active ingredients were challenged by 77 manufacturers from March 2015 to December 2019. Of 171 manufacturers, 94 (55 %) were non-challengers, 58 (34 %) were passive challengers who had succeeded in fewer than 4 patent challenges, and 19 (11 %) were aggressive challengers who had succeeded in 4 or more patent challenges. Higher sales, more employees, and a greater number of reimbursed drugs were associated with being a patent challenger, while a greater number of reimbursed drugs was associated with being an aggressive challenger. CONCLUSION: Some manufacturers utilize patent challenges to strengthen their product portfolios in the market. However, under the patent linkage system, the frequency of patent challenges is limited in South Korea compared to the United States.

However, the kernels of these programs, the dynamic programming algorithms for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, run in 𝒪(γn(2)) memory, where γ is the number of the constraints and n is the maximum of the lengths of sequences. As a result, such a high memory requirement limits the overall programs to align short sequences~only. Results: We adopt the divide-and-conquer approach to design a memory-efficient algorithm for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, which greatly reduces the memory requirement of the dynamic programming approaches at the expense of a small constant factor in CPU time. This new algorithm consumes only 𝒪(αn) space, where α is the sum of the lengths of constraints and usually α ≪ n in practical applications. Based on this algorithm, we have developed a memory-efficient tool for multiple sequence alignment with constraints.

To date, all existing solutions are combined with the conventional face-to-face learning process. However, the latter can be unexpectedly hindered in some emergency cases, like the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To handle such unexpected scenarios, this paper presents NOTA, a novel online teaching and assessment scheme that takes advantage of Blockchain technology to maintain the expected teaching quality and assessment fairness while respecting the courses’ and examinations’ schedule. Besides, NOTA also motivates both learners and teachers to persist in their endeavours, even from home, through Blockchain’s incentive strategies. The preliminary results taken during the CoronaVirus period showed a very high satisfaction ratio, exceeding the 90%. This made us feel very optimistic about the potential of our proposal when deployed at a larger scale.","Cheriguene, Anissa; Kabache, Taieb; Kerrache, Chaker Abdelaziz; Calafate, Carlos T.; Cano, Juan Carlos",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),182,26

Most interestingly, the fourth member of the vanilloid family of TRP channels (TRPV4) serves different partially antagonistic functions in the respiratory system. This review highlights the role of TRPV4 channels in lung fibroblasts, the lung endothelium, as well as the alveolar and bronchial epithelium, during physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Data available from animal models and human tissues confirm the importance of this ion channel in cellular signal transduction complexes with Ca(2+) ions as a second messenger. Moreover, TRPV4 is an excellent therapeutic target with numerous specific compounds regulating its activity in diseases, like asthma, lung fibrosis, edema, and infections.","Rajan, Suhasini; Schremmer, Christian; Weber, Jonas; Alt, Philipp; Geiger, Fabienne; Dietrich, Alexander",Cells,182,3

Because TREM2 encodes a receptor exclusively expressed on immune cells, identification of these variants conclusively demonstrates that the immune response can play an active role in the pathogenesis of NDDs. These TREM2 variants also confer the highest risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease of any risk factor identified in nearly two decades, suggesting that understanding more about TREM2 function could provide key insights into NDD pathology and provide avenues for novel immune-related NDD biomarkers and therapeutics. The expression, signaling and function of TREM2 in NDDs have been extensively investigated in an effort to understand the role of immune function in disease pathogenesis and progression. We provide a comprehensive review of our current understanding of TREM2 biology, including new insights into the regulation of TREM2 expression, and TREM2 signaling and function across NDDs. While many open questions remain, the current body of literature provides clarity on several issues. While it is still often cited that TREM2 expression is decreased by pro-inflammatory stimuli, it is now clear that this is true in vitro, but inflammatory stimuli in vivo almost universally increase TREM2 expression. Likewise, while TREM2 function is classically described as promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype, more than half of published studies demonstrate a pro-inflammatory role for TREM2, suggesting that its role in inflammation is much more complex. Finally, these components of TREM2 biology are applied to a discussion of how TREM2 impacts NDD pathologies and the latest assessment of how these findings might be applied to immune-directed clinical biomarkers and therapeutics.","Jay, Taylor R.; von Saucken, Victoria E.; Landreth, Gary E.",Mol Neurodegener,182,11

BACKGROUND: In Italy, the first confirmed case of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was registered on 21 February 2020. As of 20 April, about 250 000 cases were registered, 1143 of which were in the province of Pescara. METHODS: We compared transfusion services provided by the blood centre of Pescara between 1 March and 20 April 2019 and between 1 March and 20 April 2020. We assessed the number and type of blood components donated, those transfused in the various hospital departments and those transfused to Covid‐19 patients. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, we documented a decrease of 32% in the number of donations. The number of transfusions increased by 139% in the infectious diseases department (IDD), dedicated to Covid‐19 patients, and by 76% in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas it markedly decreased in the other departments. Of 299 patients with Covid‐19, 60 were transfused (20.1%). Transfused patients in the ICU were significantly younger than those in IDD and had a lower number of lymphocytes, lower post‐transfusion increment of haemoglobin levels and higher D‐dimer and C reactive protein values. Mortality rate was 60.7% among transfused patients in the ICU and 39.0% among those in the IDD (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The Covid‐19 epidemic had a profound impact on transfusion activities. The important blood demand for Covid‐19 patients was satisfied because of the reduction in activities in other hospital wards. Covid‐19‐positive transfused patients showed a very poor prognosis.","Quaglietta, Anna; Nicolucci, Antonio; Posata, Raffaella; Frattari, Antonella; Parruti, Giustino; Accorsi, Patrizia",Transfus Med,182,29

Nevertheless, most studies in this field only handle situations involving single resource. This paper formulates the Multi-Resource Scheduling and Routing Problem (MRSRP) for emergency relief and develops a solution framework to effectively deliver expendable and non-expendable resources in Emergency Recovery Operations. Six methods, namely, Greedy, Augmented Greedy, k-Node Crossover, Scheduling. Monte Carlo, and Clustering, are developed and benchmarked against the exact method (for small instances) and the genetic algorithm (for large instances). Results reveal that all six heuristics are valid and generate near or actual optimal solutions for small instances. With respect to large instances, the developed methods can generate near-optimal solutions within an acceptable computational time frame. The Monte Carlo algorithm, however, emerges as the most effective method. Findings of comprehensive comparative analysis suggest that the proposed MRSRP model and the Monte Carlo method can serve as a useful tool for decision-makers to better deploy resources during emergency recovery operations.","Bodaghi, Behrooz; Shahparvari, Shahrooz; Fadaki, Masih; Lau, Kwok Hung; Palaneeswaran, Ekambaram; Chhetri, Prem",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,182,23

The feasibility of the ABS method was successfully demonstrated by studies of icaritin-loaded polymeric micelles (IPMs). The prepared IPMs were characterized to have a spherical shape with a size of 72.74 ± 0.51 nm, and 13.18% drug loading content. In vitro release tests confirmed the faster release of icaritin from IPMs compared to an oil suspension. Furthermore, bioavailability of icaritin in IPMs in beagle dogs displayed a 14.9-fold increase when compared with the oil suspension. Transcellular transport studies of IPMs across Caco-2 cell monolayers confirmed that the IPMs were endocytosed in their intact forms through macropinocytosis, clathrin-, and caveolae-mediated pathways. In conclusion, the results suggested that the mixed micelles of Soluplus(®) and Poloxamer 407 could be a feasible drug delivery system to enhance oral bioavailability of icaritin, and the ABS method might be a promising technology for the preparation of polymeric micelles to encapsulate poorly water-soluble weakly acidic and alkaline drugs.","Tang, Cheng; Chen, Xiaoming; Yao, Hua; Yin, Haiyan; Ma, Xiaoping; Jin, Mingji; Lu, Xin; Wang, Quntao; Meng, Kun; Yuan, Qipeng",Molecules,182,20

Despite well-documented occupational exposure risks, however, there is evidence of lower uptake among some H&SCW groups. Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews to gain insight into COVID-19 vaccination beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours amongst H&SCWs in the UK by socio-demographic and employment variables. 1917 people were surveyed 1658 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 261 social care workers (SCWs). Twenty participants were interviewed. Findings: Workplace factors contributed to vaccination access and uptake. SCWs were more likely to not be offered COVID-19 vaccination than HCWs (OR:1.453, 95%CI: 1.244-1.696). SCWs specifically reported uncertainties around how to access COVID-19 vaccination. Participants who indicated stronger agreement with the statement ""I would recommend my organisation as a place to work"" were more likely to have been offered COVID-19 vaccination (OR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.06-1.56). Those who agreed more strongly with the statement ""I feel/felt under pressure from my employer to get a COVID-19 vaccine"" were more likely to have declined vaccination (OR:1.75, 95%CI: 1.27-2.41). Interviewees that experienced employer pressure to get vaccinated felt this exacerbated their vaccine concerns and increased distrust. In comparison to White British and White Irish participants, Black African and Mixed Black African participants were more likely to not be offered (OR:2.011, 95%CI: 1.026-3.943) and more likely to have declined COVID-19 vaccination (OR:5.55, 95%CI: 2.29-13.43). Reasons for declining vaccination among Black African participants included distrust in COVID-19 vaccination, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Conclusion: H&SCW employers are in a pivotal position to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination access, by ensuring staff are aware of how to get vaccinated and promoting a workplace environment in which vaccination decisions are informed and voluntary.","Bell, S.; Clarke, R.

Oxygen is an essential medicine used to treat hypoxemia from respiratory diseases. However, the availability and utilization of oxygen delivery systems for adults in sub-Saharan Africa is not well-described. We aim to identify and describe existing data around oxygen availability and provision for adults in sub-Saharan Africa, determine knowledge or research gaps, and make recommendations for future research and capacity building. METHODS: We systematically searched four databases for articles on April 22, 2020, for variations of keywords related to oxygen with a focus on countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Inclusion criteria were studies that included adults and addressed hypoxemia assessment or outcome, oxygen delivery mechanisms, oxygen availability, oxygen provision infrastructure, and oxygen therapy and outcomes. RESULTS: 35 studies representing 22 countries met inclusion criteria. Availability of oxygen delivery systems ranged from 42%-94% between facilities, with wide variability in the consistency of availability. There was also wide reported prevalence of hypoxemia, with most studies focusing on specific populations. In facilities where oxygen is available, health care workers are ill-equipped to identify adult patients with hypoxemia, provide oxygen to those who need it, and titrate or discontinue oxygen appropriately. Oxygen concentrators were shown to be the most cost-effective delivery system in areas where power is readily available. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial need for building capacity for oxygen delivery throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Addressing this critical issue will require innovation and a multi-faceted approach of developing infrastructure, better equipping facilities, and health care worker training.","Navuluri, Neelima; Srour, Maria L; Kussin, Peter S; Murdoch, David M; MacIntyre, Neil R; Que, Loretta G; Thielman, Nathan M; McCollum, Eric D",Journal of global health,182,0

Methods Using a classical epidemiologic framework, and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020 and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions- shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing- to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced, automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. Results Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in >90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. Conclusion Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.","Nuzzo, Andrea; Tan, Can Ozan; Raskar, Ramesh; DeSimone, Daniel C.; Kapa, Suraj; Gupta, Rajiv",Mayo Clin Proc,182,1

Pre-existing T cell memory has been hypothesized as a protective mechanism but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that all unexposed individuals harbor SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells with marginal cross-reactivity to common cold corona and other unrelated viruses. They display low functional avidity and broad protein target specificities and their frequencies correlate with the overall size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the immunological age of an individual. COVID-19 patients have strongly increased SARS-CoV-2-specific inflammatory T cell responses that are correlated with severity. Strikingly however, patients with severe COVID-19 displayed lower TCR functional avidity and less clonal expansion. Our data suggest that a low avidity pre-existing T cell memory negatively impacts on the T cell response quality against neoantigens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may predispose to develop inappropriate immune reactions especially in the elderly. We propose the immunological age as an independent risk factor to develop severe COVID-19.","Bacher, P.; Rosati, E.; Esser, D.; Rios Martini, G.; Saggau, C.; Schiminsky, E.; Dargvainiene, J.; Schrampoumlder, I.; Wieters, I.; Eberhardt, F.; Neb, H.; Khodamoradi, Y.; Sonntagbauer, M.; Vehreschild, M.

Moreover, we interpret the results that suggested a potential survival benefit of low-dose aspirin and colchicine when used for COVID-19. Expert opinion:Nitazoxanide/azithromycin combination has been first hypothesized by the author and practiced by him and several researchers to benefit COVID-19 patients due to a potential ability to augment the natural interferon response as well as their positive immunomodulatory effects on several cytokines. Furthermore, NSAIDs, that are unfortunately currently at best of second choice after paracetamol, have been early postulated and clinically practiced by the author to prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 complications and mortality due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.

First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series. Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made. Result: It has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 17024322 and total death can be 86265 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher. Policy Suggestion: Government should choose properly one between two options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life. A very weak lock down for a long time does not make any sense.","Shuvo, Sadik Hasan",,182,30

In this study, 51 stool samples of calves from 10 Brazilian dairy farms were analysed by an RT-PCR that amplifies a 488-bp fragment of the hypervariable region of the spike glycoprotein gene. Maximum parsimony genealogy with a heuristic algorithm using sequences from 15 field strains studied here and 10 sequences from GenBank and bredavirus as an outgroup virus showed the existence of two major clusters (1 and 2) in this viral species, the Brazilian strains segregating in both of them. The mean nucleotide identity between the 15 Brazilian strains was 98.34%, with a mean amino acid similarity of 98%. Strains from cluster 2 showed a deletion of 6 amino acids inside domain II of the spike protein that was also found in human coronavirus strain OC43, supporting the recent proposal of a zoonotic spill- over of BCoV. These results contribute to the molecular characterization of BCoV, to the prediction of the efficiency of immunogens, and to the definition of molecular markers useful for epidemiologic surveys on coronavirus-caused diseases.","Brandão, P.

Experiments in the millimeter region thus require an optimization of the coupling between the source and the molecular system and a method to estimate the amplitude of the electric field as seen by the molecular system. We have developed an analytical model capable of reproducing the coherent transient signals obtained with a millimeter-wave chirped pulse setup operated in a monochromatic pulse mode. The fit of the model against the experimental data allowed access to the amplitude of the electric field and, as a byproduct, to the molecular relaxation times T(1) and T(2).","Dhont, G.; Fontanari, D.; Bray, C.; Mouret, G.; Cuisset, A.; Hindle, F.; Hickson, K.

However, there is a lack of research on whether this scoring system can be applied to viral community acquired pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of PSI in viral community acquired pneumonia. This retrospective cohort study included 1,434 adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital during 2013–2015 because of community-acquired pneumonia. Viral infections were diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Patients diagnosed with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia were included in the control group (N = 1,173). The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to calculate the risk of death. Respiratory viruses were detected in 261 (18.2%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Two types of respiratory viruses were detected in 7 cases. Of the 254 cases detected with only one virus, 62 were influenza A, 18 were influenza B, 65 were rhinovirus, 35 were respiratory syncytial virus, 25 were metapneumovirus, 20 were parainfluenza, 17 were coronavirus, 7 were bocavirus, and 5 were adenovirus. Mortality was not significantly different between patients with respiratory virus and those without respiratory virus; the 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 20.3% and 22.4%, respectively (P = 0.45). Mortality rate increased with an increasing PSI score with or without respiratory viral infection. Pulmonary severity index was significantly associated with mortality adjusted for respiratory virus detection (hazard ratio = 1.024, 95% confidence interval = 1.020–1.028). Pneumonia severity index score is an important factor for assessing the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, regardless of respiratory virus detection.","Kim, Mi-Ae; Park, Jae Seok; Lee, Choong Won; Choi, Won-Il",PLoS One,182,1

Antibodies as capture agents have been largely used in bioassays but their low stability, low-efficiency production, and cross-reactivity in multiplex approaches impairs their larger applications. Instead, synthetic peptides, even with higher stability and easily adapted amino acid sequences, still remain largely unexplored in this field. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept of a microfluidic device for direct detection of biomarker overexpression. The multichannel microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device was first derivatized with PAA (poly(acrylic acid)) solution. CRP-1, VEGF-114, and ΦG6 peptides were preliminarily tested to respectively bind the biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Each PDMS microchannel was then respectively bioconjugated with a specific peptide (CRP-1, VEGF-114, or ΦG6) to specifically capture CRP, VEGF, and TNF-α. With such microdevices, a fluorescence bioassay has been set up with sensitivity in the nanomolar range, both in buffered solution and in human serum. The proposed multiplex assay worked with a low amount of sample (25 μL) and detected biomarker overexpression (above nM concentration), representing a noninvasive and inexpensive screening platform.","Di Natale, Concetta; Battista, Edmondo; Lettera, Vincenzo; Reddy, Narayana; Pitingolo, Gabriele; Vecchione, Raffaele; Causa, Filippo; Netti, Paolo Antonio",Bioconjug Chem,182,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed. The literature was systematically searched using keywords such as “COVID-19” and “Neurosurgery.” RESULTS: Among the 425 records, 128 articles were found to be eligible for analysis. These articles described the perspectives of the neurosurgical departments during the pandemic, departmental models, and organizational schemes for triaging emergent and nonemergent neurosurgical cases for the optimal utilization of limited resources, and solutions to continue academic and research activities. Triaging systems help us to optimally utilize the limited resources available. Guidelines have been developed for safe neurosurgical practice and for the continuation of clinical and academic activities during this pandemic by various national and international neurosurgical societies. Key changes in the telemedicine regulatory guidelines would help us to continue to provide neurosurgical care. Videoconferences, online education programs, and webinars could help us to overcome the disadvantages brought upon the neurosurgical education by the social-distancing norms. CONCLUSION: In an unprecedented time like this, no single algorithm is going to clear the ethical dilemma faced by us. Individual patient triage is a way for maintaining our ethical practice and at the same time, for efficiently utilizing the limited resources. As the pandemic progresses, new guidelines and protocols will continue to evolve for better neurosurgical practice.","Sadhasivam, Saravanan; Arora, Rajnish Kumar; Rekapalli, Rajasekhar; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Goyal, Nishant; Bhargava, Pranshu; Mittal, Radhey Shyam",Asian J Neurosurg,182,18

Nous présentons les adaptations d’un programme de thérapie comportementale dialectique et les conséquences du confinement sur le vécu de patients souffrant d’un trouble de personnalité borderline. Méthode: Nous avons, pour sept patients, comparé deux périodes de huit semaines, avant et pendant le confinement. Nous avons analysé leurs cartes journalières (n = 426) et le recensement hebdomadaire de la fréquence de leurs comportements problèmes (n = 69). Résultats: L’analyse des cartes journalières indique que la période de confinement prédit une diminution significative des sentiments de peur, de honte ou culpabilité et de tension mais une augmentation de la détresse. Le suivi hebdomadaire montre une diminution significative des comportements hyperphagiques. Discussion: Malgré le petit nombre de patients inclus, cette étude se base sur des échantillonnages d’expérience au quotidien et des mesures hebdomadaires. Ces deux types de mesures répétées indiquent certaines améliorations pendant le confinement, attestant des capacités d’adaptation de ces patients, soutenus par un cadre thérapeutique intensif poursuivi qui a été maintenu. Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. Method: We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n = 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n = 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. Results: The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7 %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m = 30.9 (10.0)) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m = 15.0 (5.0)). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Conclusions: Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.","Salamin, Virginie; Rossier, Vanessa; Joye, Daisy; Nolde, Chrystelle; Pierrehumbert, Timothée; Gothuey, Isabelle; Guenot, Florence",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),182,24

High dietary sodium intake leading to sodium toxicity is associated with comorbid conditions of COVID-19 such as hypertension, kidney disease, stroke, pneumonia, obesity, diabetes, hepatic disease, cardiac arrhythmias, thrombosis, migraine, tinnitus, Bell’s palsy, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome. This article synthesizes evidence from epidemiology, pathophysiology, immunology, and virology literature linking sodium toxicological mechanisms to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sodium toxicity is a modifiable disease determinant that impairs the mucociliary clearance of virion aggregates in nasal sinuses of the mucosal immune system, which may lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral sepsis. In addition, sodium toxicity causes pulmonary edema associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, as well as inflammatory immune responses and other symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever and nasal sinus congestion. Consequently, sodium toxicity potentially mediates the association of COVID-19 pathophysiology with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sodium dietary intake also increases in the winter, when sodium losses through sweating are reduced, correlating with influenza-like illness outbreaks. Increased SARS-CoV-2 infections in lower socioeconomic classes and among people in government institutions are linked to the consumption of foods highly processed with sodium. Interventions to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality through reduced-sodium diets should be explored further.","Brown, Ronald B.",Medicina (Kaunas),182,1

While the effects of paid maternity leave on child health have been the subject of a large body of research, little is known about fathers’ leave-taking and the effects of paid paternity leave. This is a limitation, since most of the recent expansion in paid family leave in OECD countries has been to expand leave benefits to fathers. Mothers’ and fathers’ leave-taking may improve child health by decreasing postpartum depression among mothers, improving maternal mental health, increasing the time spent with a child, and increasing the likelihood of child medical checkup. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid family leave on the wellbeing of children, extending what we know about the effects of maternity leave and establishing new evidence on paternity leave. The paper examines the effects of paid family leave expansions on country-level neonatal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, under-five mortality rates, and the measles immunization rates in 35 OECD countries, during the time period of 1990 to 2016. Using an event study design, an approximately 1.9 to 5.2 percent decrease in the infant, neonatal, and under-five mortality rates has been found following the adoption of paid maternity leave. However, the beneficial impact is not as visible for extension of paid leave to fathers. The implications and potential reasons behind the larger protective effects of maternity leave over paternity leave on child health outcomes are discussed.","Khan, Mariam S.",Child Youth Serv Rev,182,16

Little is known about appropriate nutrition therapy in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study in adult patients with confirmed COVID‐19 infection receiving mechanical ventilation. Data regarding patient demographics and nutrition therapy were collected. Patients that received enteral nutrition within 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation were compared with patients starting enteral nutrition later. The primary outcome was inpatient length of stay. Propensity score matching was conducted to control for baseline differences in patient groups. RESULTS: One hundred fifty‐five patients were included in final analysis. Patients who received enteral nutrition within 24 hours received a significantly greater daily amount of calories (17.5 vs 15.2 kcal/kg, P = .015) and protein (1.04 vs 0.85 g/kg, P = .003). There was no difference in length of stay (18.5 vs 23.5 days, P = .37). The propensity score analysis included 100 patients. Following propensity scoring, significant differences in daily calorie (17.7 [4.6] vs 15.1 [5.1] kcal/kg/d, P = .009) and protein (1.03 [0.35] vs 0.86 [0.38] g/kg/d, P = .014) provision remained. No differences in length of stay or other outcomes were noted in the propensity score analysis.

SETTING Academic ophthalmology center. DESIGN Interventional analysis. METHODS Schlieren airflow imaging was taken of an examinee wearing frequently used face masks and enacting common clinical scenarios-with and without manual occlusion of the superior mask gap and/or neck extension-and maximum visible vertical breath plume height was quantified. Bottle height during eyedrop administration was measured for 4 ophthalmologists during instillation to 8 eyes of 4 subjects. RESULTS Breath plume height (mean ± SD 275.5 ± 16.3 mm) was significantly greater than mean bottle height (13.9 ± 4.7 mm; P < .01). Plume height was reduced with manual mask occlusion vs without (P < .01) and was also lower than mean bottle height with manual mask occlusion (P < .01) but not in the absence of occlusion (P < .01). Neck extension alone did not adequately redirect liberated breath to prevent contact with a bottle. CONCLUSIONS Exhaled air liberated from commonly worn patient face masks was able to contact multiuse eyedrop bottles during eyedrop administration. These findings have important patient safety implications during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and with other respiratory pathogens because these multiuse bottles could potentially serve as vectors of disease. Occlusion of the superior mask gap significantly reduces breath contamination and should be strongly considered by eyecare providers during drop administration in eye clinics.,"Garcia, Giancarlo A; Hines, Jacob A; Wang, Evan W; Davila, Jose R; Chiang, Bryce; Choi, Daniel Y",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,182,16

However, the use of a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is necessary for jurisdictions to contain its spread. Although the implementation cost of NPIs may be low from the healthcare system perspective, it can be costly when considering the indirect costs from the societal perspective. COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have begun in several countries worldwide. Nonetheless, the quantity of vaccines available remain limited over the next 1 to 2 years. A tool for informing vaccine prioritisation that considers both cost and effectiveness will be highly useful. This study aims to identify the most cost-effective combination of COVID-19 response policies, using Singapore as an example. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model will be used to generate the number of infections stratified by disease severity under different intervention scenarios. Polices of interest include test-trace-isolate, travel restriction, compulsory face mask and hygiene practices, social distancing, dexamethasone/remdesivir therapy and vaccination. The latest phase 3 trial results and the WHO Target Product Profiles for COVID-19 vaccines will be used to model vaccine characteristics. A cost (expected resource utilisation and productivity losses) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be attached to these outputs for a cost-utility analysis. The primary outcome measure will be the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio generated from the incremental cost of policy alternatives expressed as a ratio of the incremental benefits (QALYs gained). Efficacy of policy options will be gathered from literature review and from its observed impacts in Singapore. Cost data will be gathered from healthcare institutions, Ministry of Health and published data. Sensitivity analysis such as threshold analysis and scenario analysis will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was not required for this study. The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals.","Chua, Brandon Wen Bing; Huynh, Vinh Anh; Lou, Jing; Goh, Fang Ting; Clapham, Hannah; Teerawattananon, Yot; Wee, Hwee Lin",BMJ Open,182,1

Findings showed that healthcare workers expressed deep concerns for family members and apprehension at a national level. Respondents noted that they were coping well with the crisis while expressing negative perceptions of how the crisis was managed. A regression model showed that the low self-assessment of medical staff of coping with the crisis, deep concerns at the organizational level, negative perceptions of crisis management, and providing care for COVID-19 patients were predictors of burnout.

These events define five major clades (G, I, S, D and V) of globally-circulating viral populations, representing 85.7% of all sequenced cases, which we can identify using a 10 nucleotide genetic classifier or barcode. We applied this barcode to 4,000 additional genomes deposited between March 31st and April 15th and classified successfully 95.6% of the clades demonstrating the utility of this approach. An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host-entry and genome replication. The systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of circulating virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage and contain the virus and, also, with available efficacious antivirals and vaccines, aid in the monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent. The barcode will add the necessary genetic resolution to facilitate tracking and monitoring of infection clusters to distinguish imported and indigenous cases and thereby aid public health measures seeking to interrupt transmission chains without the requirement for real-time complete genomes sequencing.","Guan, Qingtian; Sadykov, Mukhtar; Nugmanova, Raushan; Carr, Michael J.; Arold, Stefan T.; Pain, Arnab",bioRxiv,182,16

This has been attributed to their multimorbidity and disability. However, it remains to be established which clinical features of older adults are associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. This information would aid in an accurate prognosis and appropriate care planning. Here, we aimed to identify the chronic clinical conditions and the comorbidity clusters associated with in-hospital mortality in a cohort of older COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the IRCCS Policlinico San Martino Hospital, Genoa, Italy, between January and April 2020. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including 219 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older and is part of the GECOVID-19 study group. During the study period, upon hospital admission, demographic information (age, sex) and underlying chronic medical conditions (multimorbidity) were recorded from the medical records at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis before any antiviral or antibiotic treatment was administered. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Results: The vast majority of the patients (90%) were >80 years; the mean patient age was 83 ± 6.2 years, and 57.5% were men. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease, along with dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, and vascular diseases were the most prevalent clinical conditions. Multimorbidity was assessed with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The risk of in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 was higher for males, for older patients, and for patients with dementia or cerebral-vascular disease. We clustered patients into three groups based on their comorbidity pattern: the Metabolic-renal-cancer cluster, the Neurocognitive cluster and the Unspecified cluster. The Neurocognitive and Metabolic-renal-cancer clusters had a higher mortality compared with the Unspecified cluster, independent of age and sex. Conclusion: We defined patterns of comorbidity that accurately identified older adults who are at higher risk of death from COVID-19. These associations were independent of chronological age, and we suggest that the identification of comorbidity clusters that have a common pathophysiology may aid in the early assessment of COVID-19 patients with frailty to promote timely interventions that, in turn, may result in a significantly improved prognosis.","Mahmoud, Mona; Carmisciano, Luca; Tagliafico, Luca; Muzyka, Mariya; Rosa, Gianmarco; Signori, Alessio; Bassetti, Matteo; Nencioni, Alessio; Monacelli, Fiammetta",Front Med (Lausanne),182,1

Neurological and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 have been reported, but there are limited data on incidence rates and relative risks. Methods. Using retrospective cohort studies and time-to-event analysis, we estimated the incidence of ICD-10 diagnoses in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; Parkinsonism; Guillain-Barre syndrome; nerve/nerve root/plexus disorders; myoneural/muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders; substance misuse; and insomnia. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients). We compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory infections using a Cox model. We investigated the effect on incidence estimates of COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalization and encephalopathy (including delirium and related disorders). Findings. 236,379 patients survived a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Among them, the estimated incidence of neurological or psychiatric sequelae at 6 months was 33.6%, with 12.8% receiving their first such diagnosis. Most diagnostic categories were commoner after COVID-19 than after influenza or other respiratory infections (hazard ratios from 1.21 to 5.28), including stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, dementia, and psychotic disorders. Findings were equivocal for Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Amongst COVID-19 cases, incidences and hazard ratios for most disorders were higher in patients who had been hospitalized, and markedly so in those who had experienced encephalopathy. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including comparisons against an additional four index health events. Interpretation. The study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity following COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, those who had severe COVID-19. The information can help in service planning and identification of research priorities.","Taquet, M.; Geddes, J. R.; Husain, M.; Luciano, S.; Harrison, P. J.",,182,19

The C-type lectin, DC-SIGN efficiently binds and transmits HIV-1 to susceptible cell in trans thereby augmenting the infection. A potential association of the DC-SIGN neck domain repeats polymorphism and risk of HIV-1 infection is currently under debate. METHODS: Genetic risk association study was conducted in HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HES; n = 50) individuals, HIV-1 seronegative (HSN; n = 314) healthy control and HIV-1 infected seropositive patients (HSP; n = 190) for polymorphism in neck domain of DC-SIGN gene. The DC-SIGN genotypes were identified by PCR from DNA extracted from peripheral blood and confirmed by sequencing. Fisher exact or χ(2) test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: One HSN and HSP individual who were heterozygous (7/8) with respect to DC-SIGN repeat regions were found. The DC-SIGN neck repeat polymorphism among North Indian individuals was not associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, inheritance study of heterozygous mutation (7/8) in HSN individual's family showed that one parent, two brothers, one sister and one daughter were heterozygous (7/8) for DC-SIGN mutant allele. Sequence analyses of DC-SIGN exon 4 repeat region of randomly selected 25 North Indian individuals from HSP, HSN and HES revealed four conserved intronic mutations. These mutations were at nucleotide position 1283, 1306, 1308 upstream and 1906 downstream of the DC-SIGN exon 4 repeat region when compared with the wild type sequence (NCBI Acc. No. AF209479). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism in DC-SIGN neck repeats region was rare and not associated with HIV-1 susceptibility among North Indians. Sequencing analysis of DC-SIGN gene confirmed four novel genetic variants in intronic region flanking exon 4 coding region.","Rathore, Anurag; Chatterjee, Animesh; Sood, Vikas; Khan, Sohrab Z.; Banerjea, Akhil C.; Yamamoto, Naohiko; Dhole, Tapan N.",Clin Chim Acta,182,26

The use of masks may reduce the spread of the infection by minimising the excretion of Flügge droplets. The objective of this study was to compile the evidence available on the use of masks in relation to respiratory infections. METHODOLOGY: An umbrella review (review of systematic reviews) was conducted. Two reviewers independently carried out the screening process, data extraction and data analysis. Discrepancies were resolved with a third reviewer, and the assessment of the risk of bias of the studies was carried out using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The Rayyan QCRI program was used for the screening process. RESULTS: A total of eight systematic reviews were included. The studies analysed the use of masks in the general population, in long-term care facilities, in hospitals and at mass gatherings, and compared the effectiveness thereof in preventing infection. The results of this review revealed that the use of masks is associated with a protective effect against respiratory infections in healthcare facilities, in long-term care facilities and at mass gatherings. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the results, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of masks to the general population, but this use should be accompanied by a training programme to improve compliance, as not using them properly may increase the risk of infection.","Olry de Labry-Lima, Antonio; Bermúdez-Tamayo, Clara; Martinez-Olmos, José; Martin-Ruiz, Eva",Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed),182,26

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. Demographics, comorbidities, and daily clinical physiologic and laboratory data were collected. Plasma levels of neurofilament-light chain, total tau, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were measured. The primary neurologic outcome was delirium defined by the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (scale 1–8). Associations among plasma biomarkers, respiratory failure, and inflammation were analyzed. SETTING: Multicenter study in ICUs. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with respiratory failure, with coronavirus disease 2019, or without (ICU control). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 27 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and 19 ICU controls were enrolled. Compared with ICU controls with pneumonia of other etiology, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had significantly higher glial fibrillary acidic protein (272 pg/mL [150–555 pg/mL] vs 118 pg/mL [78.5–168 pg/mL]; p = 0.0009). In coronavirus disease 2019 patients, glial fibrillary acidic protein (rho = 0.5115, p = 0.0064), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (rho = 0.4056, p = 0.0358), and neurofilament-light chain (rho = 0.6223, p = 0.0005) positively correlated with Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score and were increased in patients with delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ≥ 4) in the coronavirus disease 2019 group but not in ICU controls. There were no associations between the measures of respiratory function or cytokines with glial fibrillary acidic protein, total tau, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, or neurofilament-light chain levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein is two-fold higher in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with ICU controls. Higher levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and neurofilament-light chain associate with delirium in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Elevated plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and neurofilament-light chain are independent of respiratory function and peripheral cytokines.","Cooper, Jennifer; Stukas, Sophie; Hoiland, Ryan L.; Fergusson, Nicholas A.; Thiara, Sonny; Foster, Denise; Mitra, Anish; Stoessl, Jon A.; Panenka, William J.; Sekhon, Mypinder S.; Wellington, Cheryl L.",Crit Care Explor,182,20

Aberrant lipid metabolism in morbidly obese individuals adversely affects the COVID-19 immune response and increases disease severity. Such observations are in line with the importance of lipid metabolism in COVID-19, and point to the gut as a site for intervention as well as a therapeutic target in treating the disease. Formation of complex lipid membranes and palmitoylation of coronavirus proteins are essential during viral replication and assembly. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and restoration of lipid catabolism by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) impede replication of coronaviruses closely related to SARS-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2). In vitro findings and clinical data reveal that the FASN inhibitor, orlistat, and the AMPK activator, metformin, may inhibit coronavirus replication and reduce systemic inflammation to restore immune homeostasis. Such observations, along with the known mechanisms of action for these types of drugs, suggest that targeting fatty acid lipid metabolism could directly inhibit virus replication while positively impacting the patient’s response to COVID-19.","Tanner, Jerome E.; Alfieri, Caroline",Viruses,182,1

Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii Aci46 can resist colistin and carbapenems with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 512 µg/mL as determined by microdilution method and shows no zone of inhibition by disk diffusion method. These phenotypic characteristics prompted us to further investigate the genotypic characteristics of Aci46. Next generation sequencing was applied in this study to obtain whole genome data. We determined that Aci46 belongs to Pasture ST2 and is phylogenetically clustered with international clone (IC) II as the predominant strain in Thailand. Interestingly, Aci46 is identical to Oxford ST1962 that previously has never been isolated in Thailand. Two plasmids were identified (pAci46a and pAci46b), neither of which harbors any antibiotic resistance genes but pAci46a carries a conjugational system (type 4 secretion system or T4SS). Comparative genomics with other polymyxin and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains (AC30 and R14) identified shared features such as CzcCBA, encoding a cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux RND transporter, as well as a drug transporter with a possible role in colistin and/or carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses against MDR ACICU strain showed three novel mutations i.e., Glu229Asp, Pro200Leu, and Ala138Thr, in the polymyxin resistance component, PmrB.

Self-esteem and self-efficacy also decrease in teachers with greater service seniority at work. Teachers perceived a greater difficulty in students than in their own difficulty. The concentration of the school system’s efforts on the massive and, for long periods, exclusive organisation of distance learning risks favouring only cognitive aspects to the detriment of affective dynamics.

Two of the well-known immunonutrients are selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn). Se and Zn deficiency might lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and viral entry into the cells by decreasing ACE-2 expression; three factors that are proposed to be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Thus, in the current study we aimed at evaluating the correlation between serum Se and Zn status and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Eighty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this observational study. Patients were diagnosed based on an infectious disease specialist diagnosis, using WHO interim guidance and the recommendations of the Iranian National Committee of Covid-19. The patients with acute respiratory tract infection symptoms were checked for compatibility of chest computed tomography (CT) scan results with that of Covid-19 and Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for corona virus infection. The severity of Covid-19 was categorized into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe) using CDC criteria. Serum Zn and Se level of all subjects was measured. The severity of the disease was determined only once at the onset of disease. RESULTS: According to the results of linear regression test, there was a significant association between Zn and Se level and COVID-19 severity (β = − 0.28, P-value = 0.01 for Se; β = − 0.26, P-value = 0.02). However the significance disappeared after adjusting for confounding factors. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant negative association between serum Zn, Se and CRP level (r = − 0.35, P-value = 0.001 for Se; r = − 0.41, P-value < 0.001 for Zn). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that increasing levels of Se and Zn were accompanied by a decrease in serum CRP level. However, the significant association between Se, Zn, and disease severity was lost after adjusting for confounding factors.","Razeghi Jahromi , Soodeh; Moradi Tabriz , Hedieh; Togha, Mansoureh; Ariyanfar, Shadi; Ghorbani, Zeinab; Naeeni, Sima; Haghighi, Samaneh; Jazayeri, Aboozar; Montazeri, Mahnaz; Talebpour, Mohammad; Ashraf, Haleh; Ebrahimi, Mehdi; Hekmatdoost, Azita; Jafari, Elham",BMC Infect Dis,182,1

TMV is typically produced in planta, and, as an RNA virus, is highly susceptible to natural mutation that may impact its properties. Over the course of 2 years, from 2018 until 2020, our laboratory followed a spontaneous point mutation in the TMV coat protein—first observed as a 30 Da difference in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS). The mutation would have been difficult to notice by electrophoretic mobility in agarose or SDS-PAGE and does not alter viral morphology as assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The mutation responsible for the 30 Da difference between the wild-type (wTMV) and mutant (mTMV) coat proteins was identified by a bottom-up proteomic approach as a change from glycine to serine at position 155 based on collision-induced dissociation data. Since residue 155 is located on the outer surface of the TMV rod, it is feasible that the mutation alters TMV surface chemistry. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays found no difference in binding between mTMV and wTMV. Functionalization of a nearby residue, tyrosine 139, with diazonium salt, also appears unaffected. Overall, this study highlights the necessity of standard workflows to quality-control viral stocks. We suggest that ESI–MS is a straightforward and low-cost way to identify emerging mutants in coat proteins.","Lumata, Jenica L.; Ball, Darby; Shahrivarkevishahi, Arezoo; Luzuriaga, Michael A.; Herbert, Fabian C.; Brohlin, Olivia; Lee, Hamilton; Hagge, Laurel M.; D’Arcy, Sheena; Gassensmith, Jeremiah J.",Sci Rep,182,1

To elucidate the role of Giardia duodenalis in calf scours, diagnostic samples from 189 scouring calves were tested by different assays during a 1-year-study period. Giardia antigens were detected in 22/189 scouring calves by a fecal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 10 of these were positive for assemblage E, G. duodenalis by polymerase chain reaction. Giardia trophozoites were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in intestinal sections from five calves in which the parasites were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically detectable enteritis. Our data suggest that under certain circumstances, Giardia may cause intestinal lesions leading to calf scours. Gnotobiotic calf-based infectivity studies are needed if the pathogenicity of Giardia in calves is to be definitively determined.","Barigye, Robert; Dyer, Neil W.; Newell, Teresa K.; Khaitsa, Margaret L.; Trout, James M.; Santin, Monica; Fayer, Ronald",Vet Parasitol,182,14

Initial reports were mainly on people with type 2 diabetes, although recent surveys have shown that individuals with type 1 diabetes are also at risk of severe COVID-19. The reason for worse prognosis in people with diabetes is likely to be multifactorial, thus reflecting the syndromic nature of diabetes. Age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease, obesity, and a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulative state all probably contribute to the risk of worse outcomes. Glucose-lowering agents and anti-viral treatments can modulate the risk, but limitations to their use and potential interactions with COVID-19 treatments should be carefully assessed. Finally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection itself might represent a worsening factor for people with diabetes, as it can precipitate acute metabolic complications through direct negative effects on β-cell function. These effects on β-cell function might also cause diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with diabetes, hyperglycaemia at hospital admission in individuals with unknown history of diabetes, and potentially new-onset diabetes.","Apicella, Matteo; Campopiano, Maria Cristina; Mantuano, Michele; Mazoni, Laura; Coppelli, Alberto; Del Prato, Stefano",Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,182,20

Antihistamines are safe and effective treatments for reducing inflammation and cytokine release. Combinations of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor antagonists have been effective in urticaria, and might reduce the histamine-mediated pulmonary cytokine storm in COVID-19. Can a combination of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor blockers improve COVID-19 inpatient outcomes? Methods: A physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg b.i.d. and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. Results: Of all patients, including those with Do Not Resuscitate directives, receiving the dual-histamine receptor blockade for at least 48 hours, the combination drug treatment resulted in a 16.4% rate of intubation, a 7.3% rate of intubation after a minimum of 48 hours of treatment, a 15.5% rate of inpatient mortality, and 11.0 days duration of hospitalization. The drug combination exhibited beneficial reductions in inpatient mortality and symptom progression when compared to published reports of COVID-19 inpatients. Concomitant medications were assessed and hydroxychloroquine was correlated with worse outcomes. Conclusions: This physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm. Further clinical studies in COVID-19 are warranted of the repurposed off-label combination of two historically-safe histamine receptor blockers.","Hogan, Reed B; Hogan, Reed B; Cannon, Tim; Rappi, Maria; Studdard, John; Paul, Doug; Dooley, Thomas P",,182,16

Health-care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, different infection control strategies have been used to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our study aims to assess the level of adherence of HCWs to the preventive measures against COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods: An observational study was carried out using data collected by a self-administrated dual-language (Arabic and English) online questionnaire directed to HCWs in Saudi Arabia to measure the level of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. All HCWs involved in patient care in Saudi Arabia were included in this study. Results: A total of 214 HCWs were included in the study (median age = 30 years; 62% male). Among all the participants, 65% of HCWs were in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, and 18% were diagnosed with COVID-19. The level of overall adherence to mask use was 82%. HCWs were committed to wearing gloves, gowns, and goggles with a percent of 95%, 85%, and 68%, respectively.

Lung and gut microbiota play several important roles in the development, regulation, and maintenance of healthy immune responses. Dysbiosis and subsequent dysregulation of microbiota-related immunological processes affect the onset of the disease, its clinical characteristics, and responses to treatment. Bacteria and viruses are the most extensively studied microorganisms relating to asthma pathogenesis, but other microbes, including fungi and even archaea, can potently influence airway inflammation.

Binding of viral peptides was affected by the naturally occurring polymorphisms at residues 190 and 192, which are located at second extracellular loop–transmembrane helix 5 interface. Substitution of R190 with W190 enhanced the affinity for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus peptide 6 fold but reduced the affinity for N-formyl-Nle–Leu–Phe by 2.5 fold. A 12 mer peptide derived from coronavirus 229E (ETYIKPWWVWL) was the most potent antagonist of the formyl peptide receptor W190 with a K i of 230 nM. Fluorescently labeled ETYIKPWWVWL was effectively internalized by all three variants with EC50 of ∼25 nM. An HKU-1 coronavirus peptide, MYVKWPWYVWL, was a potent antagonist but N-formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL was a potent agonist. ETYIKPWWVWL did not stimulate GTPγS binding but inhibited the stimulation by formyl-NleLeuPhe. It also blocked β arrestin translocation and receptor downregulation induced by formyl-Nle–Leu–Phe. This indicates that formyl peptide receptor may be important in viral infections and that variations in its sequence among individuals may affect their likelihood of viral and bacterial infections.","Mills, John S.",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease,182,21

METHODS: A service evaluation audit of a hydroxychloroquine retinopathy monitoring service was undertaken. Results of Humphrey 10–2 field tests, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence were collected with data on dose, weight, duration of treatment, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and concurrent tamoxifen therapy. Visual field tests were assessed as reliable or unreliable, and classified as normal, hydroxychloroquine-like, poor test or related to other pathology. Cases of definite and possible retinopathy were identified using the 2018 RCOphth criteria. RESULTS: There were 1976 attendances over two years of 1597 patients. Seven hundred and twenty-eight patients had taken hydroxychloroquine for less than 5 years and 869 had taken hydroxychloroquine for 5 years or more. Fourteen patients were identified with definite hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (1.6%), and 41 patients with possible retinopathy (4.7%). Sixty-seven per cent of 861 visual fields were performed reliably, with 66.9% classified as normal, 24.9% as poor test, 5.2% hydroxychloroquine-like and 3.0% abnormal due to other pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The 1.6% prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is lower than the previously reported prevalence of 7.5% as reported by Melles and Marmor JAMA Ophthalmol 132: 1453–60 (2014). This is because of a difference in the diagnostic criteria. Both definite and possible retinopathy would meet the diagnostic criteria of the Melles and Marmor study; 6.3% in our data, compared with 7.5%, a much smaller difference and likely to be explained by differences in the risk characteristics of the two groups.","Marshall, Elena; Robertson, Matt; Kam, Satu; Penwarden, Alison; Riga, Paraskevi; Davies, Nigel",Eye (Lond),182,0

These dynamics are studied in this paper, which analyzes quarterly changes in herding behavior by quantifying the self-similarity intensity of six stock markets in Asia and Europe. A multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) is applied, using intraday trade prices with a 15-min frequency from Jan-2020 to Dec-2020. The empirical results confirm that Covid-19 had a significant impact on the efficiency of the stock markets under study, although with a quarterly varying impact. During the first quarter of the year, European stock markets remained efficient compared to Asian markets; in the subsequent two quarters, the Chinese stock market showed significant improvement in its efficiency and became the least inefficient market, with a decline in the market efficiency of the UK and Japan. Furthermore, European markets are more sensitive to asset losses than Asian markets, so investors are more likely to show herding in the former. Herding was at its peak during the 2nd quarter of 2020. These findings could be related to possible market inefficiencies and herding behavior, implying the possibility of investors forming profitable trading strategies.","Aslam, Faheem; Ferreira, Paulo; Ali, Haider; Kauser, Sumera",Eurasian Econ Rev,182,14

The combination of numerical encoding techniques and digital signal processing methods are becoming increasingly important in handling large genomic data. In this paper, we propose to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genomic signature using the combination of different nucleotide representations and signal processing tools in the aim to identify its genetic origin. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was compared with 21 relevant sequences including bat, yak and pangolin coronavirus sequences. In addition, we developed a new algorithm to locate the nucleotide modifications. The results show that the Bat and Pangolin coronaviruses were the most related to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% and 86% of identity all along the genome. Within the S gene sequence, the Pangolin sequence presents local highest nucleotide identity. Those findings suggest genesis of SARS-Cov-2 through evolution from bat and pangolin strains.

To overcome the barrier presented by the nuclear membrane and gain access to the nucleus, virally encoded proteins have evolved ways to appropriate components of the nuclear transport machinery. By binding karyopherins, or the nuclear pore complex, viral proteins influence their own transport as well as the transport of key cellular regulatory proteins. This review covers how viral proteins can interact with different components of the nuclear import machinery and how this influences viral replicative cycles. We also highlight the effects that viral perturbation of nuclear transport has on the infected host and how we can exploit viruses as tools to study novel mechanisms of protein nuclear import.

FIV infection causes AIDS-like disease and mortality in the domestic cat (Felis catus) and serves as a natural model for HIV infection in humans. In African lions (Panthera leo) and other exotic felid species, disease etiology introduced by FIV infection are less clear, but recent studies indicate that FIV causes moderate to severe CD4 depletion. RESULTS: In this study, comparative genomic methods are used to evaluate the full proviral genome of two geographically distinct FIV subtypes isolated from free-ranging lions. Genome organization of FIV(Ple )subtype B (9891 bp) from lions in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and FIV(Ple )subtype E (9899 bp) isolated from lions in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, both resemble FIV genome sequence from puma, Pallas cat and domestic cat across 5' LTR, gag, pol, vif, orfA, env, rev and 3'LTR regions. Comparative analyses of available full-length FIV consisting of subtypes A, B and C from FIV(Fca), Pallas cat FIV(Oma )and two puma FIV(Pco )subtypes A and B recapitulate the species-specific monophyly of FIV marked by high levels of genetic diversity both within and between species. Across all FIV(Ple )gene regions except env, lion subtypes B and E are monophyletic, and marginally more similar to Pallas cat FIV(Oma )than to other FIV. Sequence analyses indicate the SU and TM regions of env vary substantially between subtypes, with FIV(Ple )subtype E more related to domestic cat FIV(Fca )than to FIV(Ple) subtype B and FIV(Oma )likely reflecting recombination between strains in the wild. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the necessity of whole-genome analysis to complement population/gene-based studies, which are of limited utility in uncovering complex events such as recombination that may lead to functional differences in virulence and pathogenicity. These full-length lion lentiviruses are integral to the advancement of comparative genomics of human pathogens, as well as emerging disease in wild populations of endangered species.","Pecon-Slattery, Jill; McCracken, Carrie L; Troyer, Jennifer L; VandeWoude, Sue; Roelke, Melody; Sondgeroth, Kerry; Winterbach, Christiaan; Winterbach, Hanlie; O'Brien, Stephen J",BMC Genomics,182,20

It is therefore not surprising that the major steps of the life cycle of viruses of animals and plants also depend on cellular membranes. Indeed, interactions of viral proteins with host cell membranes are important for viruses to enter into host cells, replicate their genome, and produce progeny particles. To replicate its genome, a virus first needs to cross the plasma membrane. Some viruses can also modify intracellular membranes of host cells to create a compartment in which genome replication will take place. Finally, some viruses acquire an envelope, which is derived either from the plasma membrane or an internal membrane of the host cell.

However, dialysis supplies and personnel are often limited. METHODS Using data from adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients from five hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System who were admitted from March 10th and December 26th, 2020, we developed and validated several models (logistic regression, LASSO, random forest, and XGBoost (with and without imputation)) for predicting treatment with dialysis or death at various time horizons (1, 3, 5 and 7 days) following hospital admission. Patients admitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital were used for internal validation while the other hospitals were part of the external validation cohort. Features included demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory and vitals signs within 12 hour of hospital admission. RESULTS 6093 patients (2,442 in training and 3,651 in external validation) were included in the final cohort. Of the different model approaches used, XGBoost without imputation had the highest area under the receiver curve on internal validation (range of 0.93-0.98) and area under the precision recall curve (range of 0.78-0.82 across) for all time points. XGBoost without imputation also had the highest test parameters on external validation (AUROC range 0.85 to 0.87, and AUPRC range of 0.27 to 0.54) across all time windows. XGBoost without imputation outperformed all models with higher precision and recall (mean difference in AUROC of 0.04 and mean difference in AUPRC of 0.15). Features of creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, and Red cell distribution width were major drivers of model's prediction. CONCLUSIONS An XGBoost model without imputation for prediction of a composite outcome of either death or dialysis in COVID positive patients had the best performance compared to standard and other machine learning models.","Vaid, Akhil; Chan, Lili; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Jaladanki, Suraj; Paranjpe, Ishan; Russak, Adam; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Levin, Matthew; He, John; Bottinger, Erwin; Charney, Alexander; Fayad, Zahi; Coca, Steven; Glicksberg, Benjamin; Nadkarni, Girish",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,182,1

While crucial, the precise identification of structures serving as evolutionary traits and systematic criteria is not per se a highly motivating task for students. Teaching this in a traditional teaching setting is quite challenging especially with a large crowd of students to be kept engaged. This is even more difficult if, as during the COVID‐19 crisis, students are not allowed to access laboratories for hands‐on observation on fresh specimens and sometimes restricted to short‐range movements outside their home. Here, we present QuoVidi, a new open‐source web platform for the organization of large‐scale treasure hunts. The platform works as follows: students, organized in teams, receive a list of quests that contain morphologic, ecologic, or systematic terms. They have to first understand the meaning of the quests, then go and find them in the environment. Once they find the organism corresponding to a quest, they upload a geotagged picture of their finding and submit this on the platform. The correctness of each submission is evaluated by the staff. During the COVID‐19 lockdown, previously validated pictures were also submitted for evaluation to students that were locked in low‐biodiversity areas. From a research perspective, the system enables the creation of large image databases by the students, similar to citizen science projects. Beside the enhanced motivation of students to learn the vocabulary and perform observations on self‐found specimens, this system allows instructors to remotely follow and assess the work performed by large numbers of students. The interface is freely available, open‐source and customizable. Unlike existing naturalist platforms, allows the educators to fully customize the quests of interest. This enables the creation of multiple teaching scenarios, without being bound to a fixed scope. QuoVidi can be used in other disciplines with adapted quests and we expect it to be of interest in many classroom settings.","Lobet, Guillaume; Descamps, Charlotte; Leveau, Lola; Guillet, Alain; Rees, Jean‐François",Ecol Evol,182,18

Treatment of tuberculosis (TB) involves the use of multiple antibiotics over a prolonged period. However, the emergence of resistance leading to multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is the most challenging aspect of TB treatment. Therefore, there is a constant need to search for novel therapeutic strategies that could tackle the growing problem of drug resistance. One such strategy could be perturbing the functions of novel targets in Mtb, such as universal stress protein (USP, Rv1636), which binds to cAMP with a higher affinity than ATP. Orthologs of these proteins are conserved in all mycobacteria and act as “sink” for cAMP, facilitating the availability of this second messenger for signaling when required. Here, we have used the cAMP-bound crystal structure of USP from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a closely related homolog of Mtb, to conduct a structure-guided hunt for potential binders of Rv1636, primarily employing molecular docking approach. A library of 1.9 million compounds was subjected to virtual screening to obtain an initial set of ~2,000 hits. An integrative strategy that uses the available experimental data and consensus indications from other computational analyses has been employed to prioritize 22 potential binders of Rv1636 for experimental validations. Binding affinities of a few compounds among the 22 prioritized compounds were tested through microscale thermophoresis assays, and two compounds of natural origin showed promising binding affinities with Rv1636. We believe that this study provides an important initial guidance to medicinal chemists and biochemists to synthesize and test an enriched set of compounds that have the potential to inhibit Mtb USP (Rv1636), thereby aiding the development of novel antitubercular lead candidates.","Chakraborti, Sohini; Chakraborty, Moubani; Bose, Avipsa; Srinivasan, Narayanaswamy; Visweswariah, Sandhya S.",Front Mol Biosci,182,20

To this end, the effectiveness of several air cleaning devices (ACDs) in reducing HCPs exposure to aerosols generated during dental procedures was estimated, separately or in combination with each other. These ACDs were a chairside unit capturing aerosols at the source of generation, and four ambient ACDs: a portable ambient ACD; a negative pressure module; a custom made, fan-operated and wall-mounted air filter (WMAF); and a smaller and passive version of the latter. The last three ACDs were intended for mobile dental clinics (MDCs) only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This assessment was performed in two different environments: in a dental clinic operatory and in a MDC. Two dental personnel, acting in the roles of dentist and dental assistant, performed on simulated patient aerosol-generating and non-aerosol-generating procedures. For each 5-minute scenario, the cumulative exposure to airborne particulate matter 10 µm in size or smaller (PM(10)) was determined by calculating the sum of all 1 second readings obtained with personal and ambient air monitors. The effectiveness of the ACDs in capturing PM(10) was estimated based on the capability of the ACDs to keep PM(10) level at or below the initial background level. RESULTS: In all conditions assessed in the dental clinic operatory, when both the chairside and portable ambient ACDs were functioning, an estimated effectiveness of 100% in capturing PM(10) was achieved. In the MDC, in all conditions where the chairside ACD was used without the negative pressure module, an estimated effectiveness of 100% was also achieved. The simultaneous operation of the negative pressure module in the MDC, which led to a room negative pressure of −0.25 inch wc, reduced the chairside ACD’s effectiveness in capturing aerosols. Conversely, the use of the WMAF in the MDC in combination with the chairside ACD further reduced exposure to PM(10) below the initial background level. Nonetheless, in all conditions assessed in both settings (dental clinic operatory and MDC), larger visible aerosols were produced, often landing on the surrounding environment. A fair portion of these aerosols landed on the inside of the chairside ACD flange. CONCLUSIONS: This assessment suggests that the use of the tested chairside ACD, by capturing aerosols at the source of generation, had the greatest impact on reducing exposure of dental personnel to PM(10) produced during dental procedures. This study also indicates that such exposure is further reduced with the addition of an ambient ACD. However, creating a negative pressure room as high as −0.25 inch wc can lead to air turbulence reducing the effectiveness of ACDs in capturing aerosols at the source. Furthermore, the presence of uncaptured droplets and spatter on the surrounding environment supports the need to complement the use of engineering controls with proper administrative controls and personal protective equipment, as recommended by governmental agencies and the scientific community for preventing the transmission of infection in health care settings.","Maurais, T; Kriese, J; Fournier, M; Langevin, L; MacLeod, B; Blier, S; Tessier-Guay, J P; Girardin, A; Maheux, L",Mil Med,182,16

Preventive behaviors and keeping social distance are regarded as compelling ways to prevent COVID-19. This study focused on the sociological and psychological factors associated with proper and excessive preventive behaviors of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. For the sample, we collected the data of 4788 participants who were surveyed between 4 April and 15 April 2020 from eight provinces in China. This study designed a self-filled questionnaire that included demographic information, six components of the Health Belief Model, and target preventive behaviors. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square test, logistic regression analysis, Mantel–Haenszel hierarchical analysis, and propensity score matching were employed in this study. The results showed that 54.7% of the participants had adequate basic prevention, 63.6% of the participants had adequate advanced prevention, and 5.8% of the participants practiced excessive prevention. The elder participants were less likely to engage in proper preventive behaviors. Perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and knowledge levels were associated with preventive behaviors. Excessive preventive behaviors in high-risk groups with suspected symptoms were associated with their extreme psychological condition, while the support from the community and family plays an important role in avoiding these behaviors.","Ye, Yisheng; Wang, Ruoxi; Feng, Da; Wu, Ruijun; Li, Zhifei; Long, Chengxu; Feng, Zhanchun; Tang, Shangfeng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,182,16

Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification). Results obtained from cell lines which differed in permissiveness to MHV infection suggested that the ability to support MHV infection does not correlate with endocytosis. Rather, nonpermissive cells, such as rat astrocytoma (C-6) and Vero cells, showed higher levels of recoverable internalized MHV than did fully permissive L-2 cells. Cells which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHV-susceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection.","Kooi, Cora; Cervin, Marguerite; Anderson, Robert",Virology,182,18

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) serve as the sensor arm of the innate immune system and induce proinflammatory cytokine expressions. We recruited a total of 18 paired KD patients, before intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and at least 3 weeks after IVIG treatment, 18 healthy controls, and 18 febrile controls. For TLR genes and their cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) markers, we used Affymetrix GeneChip(®) Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 and Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to evaluate gene expression levels and methylation patterns, respectively. KD patients demonstrated a significantly differential expression of TLR mRNA levels compared to both the healthy and febrile controls, with only TLR 3 and 7 not differing between the KD patients and the controls. After patients underwent IVIG treatment, the TLR mRNA levels, except for TLR3, decreased significantly in KD patients. In contrast, the methylation status of the CpG sites of TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 demonstrated an opposite tendency between the two stages of both the KD samples and the controls. TLRs, particularly TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, may stimulate the immunopathogenesis of KD. These results are among the first to use TLRs to prove that a bacterial inflammatory response may trigger KD.","Huang, Ying-Hsien; Li, Sung-Chou; Huang, Lien-Hung; Chen, Pao-Chun; Lin, Yi-Yu; Lin, Chiung-Chun; Kuo, Ho-Chang",Oncotarget,182,20

Innumerable lives have been lost to this novel infectious disease, the nature of which supersedes conventional medical understanding. The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a global health crisis, several aspects of life in the post-COVID-19 era are also being contemplated. Experts in unison are warning that the upcoming changes in all areas of life could potentially be far more drastic than ever experienced in the entire human civilization. The medical community is no exception, and therefore, personnel involved in forensic medicine also need to be adequately prepared for the future. Forensic medicine is a branch of medicine dedicated to one of the most important stages of the human lifecycle and has always been at the forefront in times of unprecedented social change. The autopsy, one of the most important tools of forensic medicine, is also useful to infectious diseases because it identifies the causal relationship between death and infection, reveals medical and epidemiological knowledge, and provides objective evidence for legal disputes. We present new autopsy guidelines in forensic medicine, formulated based on the various infectious diseases that we presently live with and may encounter in the future. In formulation of these guidelines several considerations have been taken into account, namely, the role forensic pathologists should play in the post-COVID-19 era and the necessary preparations as well as the support needed from society to fulfill that role. The present COVID-19 outbreak should be a starting point for formulating improvements in current practices in forensic science, including autopsy biosafety practices and the medicolegal death investigation system.","Kim, Moon-Young; Cheong, Harin; Kim, Hyung-Seok",J Korean Med Sci,182,11

The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical manifestations and postoperative outcomes after colectomy for COVID-19-associated colonic ischemia in the first versus the second wave of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 at our institution between 1 March 2020 and 31 January 2021 was performed. All patients with severe COVID-19, requiring critical care and surgical treatment of colonic ischemia, were included. The main outcomes were surgical complications and mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included of whom 20 (10.5%) patients underwent surgery for colon ischemia. Preoperatively, d-dimer was elevated, especially in the first wave (median 15.24 (interquartile range 6.00–32.00) vs. 2.09 (1.42–4.28) mg/L, p = 0.025). Twelve (60%) patients underwent a (sub)total colectomy, 7 (35%) a right hemicolectomy, and one patient (5%) an ileocecal resection. Grade 3b complications occurred in one of 5 patients (20%) in the first and in 9 of 15 patients (60%) in the second wave. The overall in-hospital mortality was similar in both waves (40% vs. 47%), with death occurring after a median stay of 21 days. CONCLUSION: In this cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 and colonic ischemia, clinical presentation and laboratory findings varied. However, the majority of patients required (sub)total colectomy. Despite a lower threshold to surgery in the second wave, mortality remained high.","Yang, Cui; Hakenberg, Priska; Weiß, Christel; Herrle, Florian; Rahbari, Nuh; Reißfelder, Christoph; Hardt, Julia",Int J Colorectal Dis,182,16
