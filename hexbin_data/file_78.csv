121,Host Gene Expression Profiling of Dengue Virus Infection in Cell Lines and Patients,2007-11-21,"BACKGROUND: Despite the seriousness of dengue-related disease, with an estimated 50–100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000–500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome each year, a clear understanding of dengue pathogenesis remains elusive. Because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus-infected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR method to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples, we identified differentially expressed genes along three major pathways; NF-κB initiated immune responses, type I interferon (IFN) and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor. Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA. A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication. The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which reduced viral replication. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Unbiased gene expression analysis has identified new host genes associated with dengue infection, which we have validated in functional studies. We showed that some parts of the host response can be used as potential biomarkers for the disease while others can be used to control dengue viral replication, thus representing viable targets for drug therapy.","Fink, Joshua; Gu, Feng; Ling, Ling; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Olfat, Farzad; Chin, Keh Chuang; Aw, Pauline; George, Joshy; Kuznetsov, Vladimir A.; Schreiber, Mark; Vasudevan, Subhash G.; Hibberd, Martin L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2100376/,78
1989,Formalin Inactivation of Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine Alters the Antigenicity and Immunogenicity of a Neutralization Epitope in Envelope Protein Domain III,2015-10-23,"Formalin-inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccines are widely available, but the effects of formalin inactivation on the antigenic structure of JEV and the profile of antibodies elicited after vaccination are not well understood. We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to map the antigenic structure of live JEV virus, untreated control virus (UCV), formalin-inactivated commercial vaccine (FICV), and formalin-inactivated virus (FIV). The binding activity of T16 MAb against Nakayama-derived FICV and several strains of FIV was significantly lower compared to live virus and UCV. T16 MAb, a weakly neutralizing JEV serocomplex antibody, was found to inhibit JEV infection at the post-attachment step. The T16 epitope was mapped to amino acids 329, 331, and 389 within domain III (EDIII) of the envelope (E) glycoprotein. When we explored the effect of formalin inactivation on the immunogenicity of JEV, we found that Nakayama-derived FICV, FIV, and UCV all exhibited similar immunogenicity in a mouse model, inducing anti-JEV and anti-EDII 101/106/107 epitope-specific antibodies. However, the EDIII 329/331/389 epitope-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody titers were significantly lower for FICV-immunized and FIV-immunized mouse serum than for UCV-immunized. Formalin inactivation seems to alter the antigenic structure of the E protein, which may reduce the potency of commercially available JEV vaccines. Virus inactivation by H(2)O(2), but not by UV or by short-duration and higher temperature formalin treatment, is able to maintain the antigenic structure of the JEV E protein. Thus, an alternative inactivation method, such as H(2)O(2), which is able to maintain the integrity of the E protein may be essential to improving the potency of inactivated JEV vaccines.","Fan, Yi-Chin; Chiu, Hsien-Chung; Chen, Li-Kuang; Chang, Gwong-Jen J.; Chiou, Shyan-Song",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4619746/,78
2258,Establishment and application of a real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification system for the detection of CYP2C19 polymorphisms,2016-06-01,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most widespread type of genetic variation (approximately 90%) in the human genome, and the demand to overcome such variation has received more attention now than ever before. The capacity to rapidly assess SNPs that correlate with disease predisposition, drug efficacy and drug toxicity is a key step for the development of personalized medicine. In this work, a rapid one-step SNP detection method, real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), was first applied for CYP2C19 polymorphisms testing. The optimized method was established with specifically designed primers for target amplification by real-time detection in approximately 30 min under isothermal conditions. RT-LAMP amplified few copies of template to produce significant amounts of product and quantitatively detected human DNA with compatible specificity and sensitivity. The success in the establishment of this RT-LAMP protocol for CYP2C19 polymorphism testing is significant for the extension of this technique for the detection of other SNPs, which will further facilitate the development of personalized medicine.","Zhang, Chao; Yao, Yao; Zhu, Juan-Li; Zhang, Si-Nong; Zhang, Shan-Shan; Wei, Hua; Hui, Wen-Li; Cui, Ya-Li",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887897/,78
2321,Heterogeneity in District-Level Transmission of Ebola Virus Disease during the 2013-2015 Epidemic in West Africa,2016-07-19,"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa in 2013–2015 spread heterogeneously across the three hardest-hit countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the estimation of national transmission of EVD provides little information about local dynamics. To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers. We estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of the case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. To take into account the heterogeneity between and within countries, we fitted a mixed effects model and calculated R(0) based on the predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution. At district level, R(0) ranged from 0.36 (Dubréka) to 1.72 (Beyla) in Guinea, from 0.53 (Maryland) to 3.37 (Margibi) in Liberia and from 1.14 (Koinadugu) to 2.73 (Western Rural) in Sierra Leone. At national level, we estimated an R(0) of 0.97 (95% CI 0.77–1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95% CI 0.98–1.55) for Liberia and 1.66 (95% CI 1.32–2.00) for Sierra Leone. Socio-demographic variables related to urbanisation such as high population density and high wealth index were found positively associated with R(0) suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD.","Krauer, Fabienne; Gsteiger, Sandro; Low, Nicola; Hansen, Christian H.; Althaus, Christian L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951043/,78
2542,Improvement and Evaluation of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for Rapid Detection of Toxoplasma gondii Infection in Human Blood Samples,2017-01-05,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), an attractive DNA amplification method, was developed as a valuable tool for the rapid detection of Toxoplasma gondii. In this study, species-specific LAMP primers were designed by targeting the AF146527 sequence, which was a conserved sequence of 200- to 300-fold repetitive 529 bp fragment of T.gondii. LAMP reaction system was optimized so that it could detect the minimal DNA sample such as a single tachyzoite or 10 copies of recombinant plasmid. No cross-reactivity was found when using DNA from other parasites as templates. Subsequently, a total of 200 human blood samples were directly investigated by two diagnostic methods, LAMP and conventional PCR. Fourteen of 200 (7%) samples were positive for Toxoplasma by LAMP (the primers developed in this study), whereas only 5 of 200 (2.5%) were proved positive by conventional PCR. The procedure of the LAMP assay was very simple, as the reaction would be carried out in a single tube under isothermal conditions at 64°C and the result would be read out with 1 h (as early as 35 min with loop primers). Thus, this method has the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection and would be useful for rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis, especially in developing countries.","Sun, Xi-meng; Ji, Yong-sheng; Liu, Xian-yong; Xiang, Mei; He, Guang; Xie, Li; Suo, Jing-xia; Suo, Xun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215908/,78

3396,Genome Sequence of Peacock Reveals the Peculiar Case of a Glittering Bird,2018-09-19,"The unique ornamental features and extreme sexual traits of Peacock have always intrigued scientists and naturalists for centuries. However, the genomic basis of these phenotypes are yet unknown. Here, we report the first genome sequence and comparative analysis of peacock with the high quality genomes of chicken, turkey, duck, flycatcher and zebra finch. Genes involved in early developmental pathways including TGF-β, BMP, and Wnt signaling, which have been shown to be involved in feather patterning, bone morphogenesis, and skeletal muscle development, revealed signs of adaptive evolution and provided useful clues on the phenotypes of peacock. Innate and adaptive immune genes involved in complement system and T-cell response also showed signs of adaptive evolution in peacock suggesting their possible role in building a robust immune system which is consistent with the predictions of the Hamilton–Zuk hypothesis. This study provides novel genomic and evolutionary insights into the molecular understanding toward the phenotypic evolution of Indian peacock.","Jaiswal, Shubham K.; Gupta, Ankit; Saxena, Rituja; Prasoodanan, Vishnu P.

3654,Experimental Zika virus infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) and possible entry of virus into brain via activated microglial cells,2019-02-04,"The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the New World has led to more than 200,000 human infections. Perinatal infection can cause severe neurological complications, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and in adults there is an association with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes sp. mosquitoes, yet little is known about its enzootic cycle in which transmission is thought to occur between arboreal Aedes sp. mosquitos and non-human primates. In the 1950s and ‘60s, several bat species were shown to be naturally and experimentally susceptible to ZIKV with acute viremia and seroconversion, and some developed neurological disease with viral antigen detected in the brain. Because of ZIKV emergence in the Americas, we sought to determine susceptibility of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), one of the most common bats in the New World. Bats were inoculated with ZIKV PRVABC59 but did not show signs of disease. Bats held to 28 days post-inoculation (PI) had detectable antibody by ELISA and viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, saliva and urine in some of the bats. Immunoreactivity using polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibody was detected in testes, brain, lung and salivary glands plus scrotal skin. Tropism for mononuclear cells, including macrophages/microglia and fibroblasts, was seen in the aforementioned organs in addition to testicular Leydig cells. The virus likely localized to the brain via infection of Iba1(+) macrophage/microglial cells. Jamaican fruit bats, therefore, may be a useful animal model for the study of ZIKV infection. This work also raises the possibility that bats may have a role in Zika virus ecology in endemic regions, and that ZIKV may pose a wildlife disease threat to bat populations.","Malmlov, Ashley; Bantle, Collin; Aboellail, Tawfik; Wagner, Kaitlyn; Campbell, Corey L.; Eckley, Miles; Chotiwan, Nunya; Gullberg, Rebekah C.; Perera, Rushika; Tjalkens, Ronald; Schountz, Tony",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382173/,78
4000,"Projections of epidemic transmission and estimation of vaccination impact during an ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in Northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, as of Feb. 25, 2019",2019-08-05,"BACKGROUND: As of February 25, 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. METHODS: For short- and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short- and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott’s rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. RESULTS: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872–1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874–1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876–933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877–983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013–2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.","Worden, Lee; Wannier, Rae; Hoff, Nicole A.; Musene, Kamy; Selo, Bernice; Mossoko, Mathias; Okitolonda-Wemakoy, Emile; Muyembe Tamfum, Jean Jacques; Rutherford, George W.; Lietman, Thomas M.; Rimoin, Anne W.; Porco, Travis C.; Kelly, J.

RESULTS: A real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for rapid detection of porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3). The method had a detection limit of 1 × 10(1) copies/μL with no cross-reactions with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) C strain, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) LG vaccine strain, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), or pseudorabies virus (PRV). The PCV3 positive detection rate of 203 clinical samples for the real-time LAMP assay was 89.66% (182/203).

In early infection scanning electron microscopy and streptavidin immunoperoxidase staining showed marked predilection of cryptosporidia for the fae. Cryptosporidial antigen was also found in subepithelial tissue, both in the domes over the ipp and in villi, apparently in macrophages, where the parasites seemed to be progressively degraded. The fae showed long tightly spaced microvilli, replacing normal low folds and protrusions, particularly in late infection. Endocytosis of indian ink was restricted to the cell periphery in late infection, contrasting the normal, more even distribution of endocytosis in the fae apical cytoplasm. Few parasites were seen in the intestinal mucosa at this stage. At convalescence the fae was normal, but all stages of infection were characterised by elongation of microvilli in absorptive cells.","LANDSVERK, T.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131281/,78

Following the 2009 pandemic, there was widened interest in studying influenza burden in all regions. However, since data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remain limited, we aimed to contribute to the understanding of influenza burden in Lebanon. METHODS: A retrospective chart review extending over a period of 8 seasons from Jan 1st, 2008 till June 30th, 2016 at a tertiary care center in Beirut was performed. All cases confirmed to have influenza based on rapid antigen detection or/and polymerase chain reaction on a respiratory sample were included for analysis. Data on epidemiology, clinical presentation, complications, antiviral use and mortality were collected for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1829 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza were identified. Average annual positivity rate was 14% (positive tests over total requested). Both influenza A and B co-circulated in each season with predominance of influenza A. Influenza virus started circulating in December and peaked in January and February. The age group of 19–50 years accounted for the largest proportion of cases (22.5%) followed by the age group of 5–19 years (18%). Pneumonia was the most common complication reported in 33% of cases. Mortality reached 3.8%. The two extremes of age (< 2 years and ≥ 65 years) were associated with a more severe course of disease, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, complications, and mortality rate. Of all the identified cases, 26% were hospitalized. Moderate-to-severe disease was more likely in influenza B cases but no difference in mortality was reported between the two types. Antivirals were prescribed in 68.8% and antibiotics in 41% of cases. There seemed to be an increasing trend in the number of diagnosed and hospitalized cases over the years of the study. CONCLUSION: Patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza at our center had a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. A population based prospective surveillance study is needed to better estimate the burden of Influenza in Lebanon that would help formulate a policy on influenza control.","Assaf-Casals, Aia; Saleh, Zeina; Khafaja, Sarah; Fayad, Danielle; Ezzeddine, Hady; Saleh, Mohammad; Chamseddine, Sarah; Sayegh, Rouba; Sharara, Sima L.; Chmaisse, Ahmad; Kanj, Souha S.; Kanafani, Zeina; Hanna-Wakim, Rima; Araj, George F.; Mahfouz, Rami; Saito, Reiko; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Zaraket, Hassan; Dbaibo, Ghassan S.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216128/,78

COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic owing to its global spread, and technologies based on engineered materials that help to reduce the spread of infections have been reported. Nanotechnology present in materials with enhanced physicochemical properties and versatile chemical functionalization offer numerous ways to combat the disease. Facemasks are a reliable preventive measure, although they are not 100% effective against viral infections. Nonwoven materials, which are the key components of masks, act as barriers to the virus through filtration. However, there is a high chance of cross-infection because the used mask lacks virucidal properties and can become an additional source of infection. The combination of antiviral and filtration properties enhances the durability and reliability of masks, thereby reducing the likelihood of cross-infection. In this review, we focus on masks, from the manufacturing stage to practical applications, and their abilities to combat COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the impacts of masks on the environment, while considering safe industrial production in the future. Furthermore, we discuss available options for future research directions that do not negatively impact the environment.","Karmacharya, Mamata; Kumar, Sumit; Gulenko, Oleksandra; Cho, Yoon-Kyoung",ACS Appl Bio Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7839420/,78
55216,Detecting the Dominant T and B Epitopes of Klebsiella pneumoniae Ferric Enterobactin Protein (FepA) and Introducing a Single Epitopic Peptide as Vaccine Candidate,2021-06-30,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has changed things in ways unimaginable – including disruption of in‐person scientific research. To facilitate undergraduate student research remotely, due to COVID‐19, our lab switched from a traditional to a pedagogical approach of research. Case studies are excellent tools to introduce undergraduate students to a normal scientific process and allow us to capture reality, highlight various research methodologies, and improve critical thinking skills through process‐oriented inquiries. Our case study is focused on the most relevant topic in the news, COVID‐19 vaccine types and their efficacy. To‐date, this has been the largest vaccination campaign with over 15.9 million doses administered in 37 countries thus far, of which 5.48 million vaccinations were given in the United States alone (Jan 6, 2021). With the arrival of the vaccine in the new year, health professionals are now confident in the world's ability to curb the virus. However, there is a growing concern on the differences between the various vaccines that are being offered around the world and their efficacies. The goal of this pedagogical research is to use an inquiry‐based approach while developing a case study that sheds light on these concerns. Our approach involved a comprehensive literature search, spanning the past year, using the PubMed Central search engine with “COVID AND SARS‐CoV‐2 AND vaccine” as descriptors. The search initially yielded 2,127 journal articles which was narrowed to identify articles on vaccine efficacy (1,122). We then examined the statistics of potential vaccines in the pipeline in various countries. Of the ~200 publications thus identified, 5 were clinical trials, 4 randomized controlled trials, 151 reviews with 9 systematic reviews. These articles were screened for the most accurate, peer‐reviewed information regarding each vaccine which was then used to construct this case study. Our case study follows a group of fictitious characters ‐ 3 friends living in the United States with family members abroad. One of the subjects who is living in Illinois is immunocompromised; the other has elderly family members living in India and the third with family members living in the United Kingdom, where there is a new variant of SARS‐CoV2. The case study discusses a) types of COVID‐19 vaccines available globally, b) efficacy, c) distribution, and d) vaccine campaign. This case study is geared towards undergraduate students in immunology, and allied health programs, graduate students in physiology, nursing and public health, and other professional programs using case‐based collaborative learning. With this case, we offer a novel strategy to circumvent COVID‐related barriers and move undergraduate research forward, with the caveat that students are not working on their original research hypotheses. The case study research model provides an alternate way to train students in the scientific process to evaluate and identify high‐quality research. Further, by addressing the science behind the COVID vaccines, we hope to provide timely information to assist with critical analysis, interpretation and to help navigate the quagmire of information available to the community.","Mehmood, Daniyal; Simkeviciute, Gerda; Poch, Mark; Perez Morales, Tiara; Sarathy, Jayashree",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239630/,78

58607,Design and Evaluation of Bispidine-Based SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors,2021-09-29,"The extraordinary diversity of glycans leads to large differences in the glycomes of different kingdoms of life. Yet, while most monosaccharides are solely found in certain taxonomic groups, there is a small set of monosaccharides with widespread distribution across nearly all domains of life. These general monosaccharides are particularly relevant for glycan motifs, as they can readily be used by commensals and pathogens to mimic host glycans or hijack existing glycan recognition systems. Among these, the monosaccharide fucose is especially interesting, as it frequently presents itself as a terminal monosaccharide, primed for interaction with proteins. Here, we analyze fucose-containing glycan motifs across all taxonomic kingdoms. Using a hereby presented large species-specific glycan dataset and a plethora of methods for glycan-focused bioinformatics and machine learning, we identify characteristic as well as shared fucose-containing glycan motifs for various taxonomic groups, demonstrating clear differences in fucose usage. Even within domains, fucose is used differentially based on an organism’s physiology and habitat. We particularly highlight differences in fucose-containing motifs between vertebrates and invertebrates. With the example of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, we also demonstrate the importance of fucose-containing motifs in molecular mimicry and thereby pathogenic potential. We envision that this study will shed light on an important class of glycan motifs, with potential new insights into the role of fucosylated glycans in symbiosis, pathogenicity, and immunity.","Thomès, Luc; Bojar, Daniel",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8492980/,78

We encountered a case of SAM-related SAH due to ruptured dissection of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery concomitant with internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. Case Description A 53-year-old man presented with SAH due to a ruptured right A1 dissecting aneurysm. The aneurysm was trapped; however, 7 days after the onset of SAH, he experienced right hemiparesis and aphasia. Angiography showed left ICA dissection; urgent carotid artery stenting was performed, leading to symptom improvement. Abdominal computed tomography angiography showed aneurysms of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. He was diagnosed with SAM based on clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings.

We describe innovative and practical methods used to develop this guideline. Informed by GRADE-ADOLOPMENT and ADAPTE frameworks, we adopted or adapted recommendations from multiple high-quality guidelines or developed de novo recommendations. A Guideline Steering Committee and a multidisciplinary Guideline Working Group of 25 key stakeholder representatives formulated the guideline scope and developed 33 clinical questions. We identified four relevant high-quality source guidelines; their recommendations were mapped to clinical questions. The choice of guideline recommendation, if more than one guideline addressed a question, was based on its appropriateness, currency of the literature, access to evidence, and relevance. Updated literature searches identified 440 new studies and key new evidence identified. The decision to develop adopted, adapted or de novo recommendations was based on the supporting evidence-base and its transferability to the local setting. The guideline underwent a 12-week consultation period. The final guideline consisted of 35 evidence-informed and 17 consensus-based recommendations and 19 practice points. An algorithm to inform imaging and observation decision-making was also developed. The resulting process was an efficient and rigorous way to develop a guideline based on existing high-quality guidelines from different settings.","Tavender, Emma; Ballard, Dustin W; Wilson, Agnes; Borland, Meredith L; Oakley, Ed; Cotterell, Elizabeth; Wilson, Catherine L; Ring, Jenny; Dalziel, Stuart R; Babl, Franz E",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528917/,78
64601,Is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease an independent predictor for adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 patients?,2020-11-01,"Many viruses interact with the host cell division cycle to favor their own growth. In this study, we examined the ability of influenza A virus to manipulate cell cycle progression. Our results show that influenza A virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) replication results in G(0)/G(1)-phase accumulation of infected cells and that this accumulation is caused by the prevention of cell cycle entry from G(0)/G(1) phase into S phase. Consistent with the G(0)/G(1)-phase accumulation, the amount of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, a necessary active form for cell cycle progression through late G(1) into S phase, decreased after infection with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. In addition, other key molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as p21, cyclin E, and cyclin D1, were also changed and showed a pattern of G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. It is interesting that increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in cells synchronized in the G(0)/G(1) phase were observed compared to those in either unsynchronized cells or cells synchronized in the G(2)/M phase. G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest is likely a common strategy, since the effect was also observed in other strains, such as H3N2, H9N2, PR8 H1N1, and pandemic swine H1N1 viruses. These findings, in all, suggest that influenza A virus may provide favorable conditions for viral protein accumulation and virus production by inducing a G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest in infected cells.","He, Yuan; Xu, Ke; Keiner, Bjoern; Zhou, Jianfang; Czudai, Volker; Li, Tianxian; Chen, Ze; Liu, Jinhua; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Shu, Yue Long; Sun, Bing",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01216-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20861262/,78
77350,Light and corona: guided-wave readout for coronavirus spike protein-host-receptor binding.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND The effects of gastric bypass surgery on the secretion of the anorexigenic gut-derived hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), independent of caloric restriction and due to different dietary macronutrients, is not well characterized. This study examines the effects of a mixed-nutrient or high-fat liquid meal on the postprandial stimulation of GLP-1 and PYY following gastric bypass or equivalent hypocaloric diet. METHODS Total PYY and active GLP-1 were measured fasting and at multiple points after standardized mixed-nutrient and high-fat liquid meals in two matched groups of obese subjects. The meal stimulation tests were performed before and 14.6 ± 3.3 days after gastric bypass (GBP, n = 10) and before and after a 7-day hypocaloric liquid diet matching the post-GBP diet (control, n = 10). RESULTS Mixed-nutrient and high-fat postprandial GLP-1 levels increased following GBP (mixed-nutrient peak: 85.0 ± 28.6-323 ± 51 pg/ml, P < 0.01; high-fat peak: 81.8 ± 9.6-278 ± 49 pg/ml, P < 0.01), but not after diet (mixed-nutrient peak: 104.4 ± 9.4-114.9 ± 15.8 pg/ml, P = NS; high-fat peak: 118.1 ± 16.4-104.4 ± 10.8 pg/ml, P = NS). The postprandial PYY response also increased after GBP but not diet, though the increase in peak PYY did not reach statistical significance (GBP mixed-nutrient peak: 134.8 ± 26.0-220.7 ± 52.9 pg/ml, P = 0.09; GBP high-fat peak: 142.1 ± 34.6-197.9 ± 12.7 pg/ml, P = 0.07; diet mixed-nutrient peak: 99.8 ± 8.0-101.1 ± 13.3 pg/ml, P = NS; diet high-fat peak: 105.0 ± 8.8-103.1 ± 11.8 pg/ml, P = NS). The postprandial GLP-1 response was not affected by the macronutrient content of the meal. However, following GBP the mixed-nutrient PYY total area under the curve (AUC(0-120)) was significantly greater than the high-fat PYY AUC(0-120) (22,081 ± 5,662 pg/ml min vs. 18,711 ± 1,811 pg/ml min, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Following GBP there is an increase in the postprandial stimulation of PYY and GLP-1 that is independent of caloric restriction. The phenomenon of ""bariatric surgery-induced anorexia"" may be linked to the increased levels after GBP.","Evans, Sarah; Pamuklar, Zehra; Rosko, Jonathan; Mahaney, Patrick; Jiang, Ning; Park, Chan; Torquati, Alfonso",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2004-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044971/,78

We hypothesized that the incidence of IRA dehiscence would be greater (1) when performed with PSP and (2) for hand-sewn anastomoses. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective. ANIMAL POPULATIONS Client-owned dogs at Michigan State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. METHODS Records of dogs surviving 72 hours after IRAs between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed for age, gender, neuter status, weight, presence of PSP, preoperative albumin, IRA indication and location, anastomotic technique, suture type, postoperative dehiscence and timing, duration of hospitalization, last follow-up, and other complications. Univariate logistic regression and chi-square analysis were used to screen prognostic factors; factors with P < .3 were included in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS Two hundred and ten IRAs in 198 dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Dehiscence was diagnosed in 11.4% cases, 6.6% without PSP, and 21.1% with PSP (P = .01). Indication for IRA did not influence the risk of dehiscence. No association was detected between anastomotic technique and IRA dehiscence in dogs without PSP (stapled 4.2%, hand-sewn 8.1%); however, stapled anastomoses were less likely to dehisce in dogs with PSP (stapled 9.7%, hand-sewn 28.9%). Risk factors for dehiscence included PSP (P = .005) and hand-sewn technique (P = .02). CONCLUSION Our results confirmed that PSP is a risk factor for dehiscence of IRA and suggest that patients with PSP may be a unique surgical population, in which stapling may be preferred over hand-sewn anastomoses after enterectomies.","Davis, Daniel J; Demianiuk, Ryan M; Musser, Jon; Podsiedlik, Maria; Hauptman, Joe",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28885694/,78
79274,"Identification, protein antiglycation, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and molecular docking of novel bioactive peptides produced from hydrolysis of Lens culinaris.",2020-10-04,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays important roles in innate defense against respiratory viruses [including influenza A viruses (IAVs)]. Truncated trimers composed of its neck and carbohydrate recognition domains (NCRDs) bind various ligands; however, they have minimal inhibitory activity for IAV. We have sought to find ways to increase the antiviral activity of collectin NCRDs. Cross-linking of the SP-D NCRD with nonblocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) markedly potentiates antiviral activity. In the present report, we demonstrate that F(ab')2 [but not F(ab')1] fragments of a cross-linking mAb have similar effects. Hence, cross-linking activity, but not the Fc domain of the mAb, is needed for increased antiviral activity. In contrast, the Fc domain of the mAb was important for increasing viral uptake or respiratory burst responses of human neutrophils. Our NCRD constructs contain an S protein binding site. Herein, we show that a multivalent S protein complex caused cross-linking and also increased the antiviral activity of NCRDs. NCRDs of conglutinin and CL43 had greater intrinsic antiviral activity than those of SP-D or mannose-binding lectin. Based on motifs found in these serum collectins, we have constructed mutant versions of the human SP-D NCRD that have increased antiviral activity. These mutant NCRDs also had potentiated activity after cross-linking with F(ab')2 fragments or S protein complexes. Hence, the antiviral activity of NCRDs can be increased by 2 distinct, complementary strategies, namely cross-linking of NCRDs through various means and mutagenesis of CRD residues to increase viral binding. These findings may be relevant for antiviral therapy.","White, Mitchell R; Boland, Patrick; Tecle, Tesfaldet; Gantz, Donald; Sorenson, Grith; Tornoe, Ida; Holmskov, Uffe; McDonald, Barbara; Crouch, Erika C; Hartshorn, Kevan L",Journal of innate immunity,https://doi.org/10.1159/000272313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375547/,78

In this study, a 3D inversion recovery-prepared ultrashort echo time cones (IR-UTE-Cones) sequence was used for both morphological and quantitative imaging of myelin on a clinical 3 T scanner. Myelin powder phantoms with different myelin concentrations were imaged with the 3D UTE-Cones sequence and it showed a strong correlation between concentrations and UTE-Cones signals, demonstrating the ability of the UTE-Cones sequence to directly image myelin in the brain. Quantitative myelin imaging with multi-echo IR-UTE-Cones sequences show similar T2 * values for a D2 O-exchanged myelin phantom (T2 * = 0.33 ± 0.04 ms), ex vivo brain specimens (T2 * = 0.20 ± 0.04 ms) and in vivo healthy volunteers (T2 * = 0.254 ± 0.023 ms), further confirming the feasibility of 3D IR-UTE-Cones sequences for direct myelin imaging in vivo. In ex vivo MS brain study, signal loss is observed in MS lesions, which was confirmed with histology. For the in vivo study, the lesions in MS patients also show myelin signal loss using the proposed direct myelin imaging method, demonstrating the clinical potential for MS diagnosis. Furthermore, the measured IR-UTE-Cones signal intensities show a significant difference between normal-appearing white matter in MS patients and normal white matter in volunteers, which cannot be found in clinical used T2 -FLAIR sequences. Thus, the proposed 3D IR-UTE-Cones sequence showed clinical potential for MS diagnosis with the capability of direct myelin detection of the whole brain.","Ma, Ya-Jun; Searleman, Adam C; Jang, Hyungseok; Fan, Shu-Juan; Wong, Jonathan; Xue, Yanping; Cai, Zhenyu; Chang, Eric Y; Corey-Bloom, Jody; Du, Jiang",NMR in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691472/,78

Liver enzyme elevation is commonly seen in this group, but its clinical significance remains elusive. In this study, we calculated the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and assessed its association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, inflammatory cytokine levels, and clinical outcome. A total of 202 hospitalized participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal sampling were included in this analysis. FIB-4 was calculated for each participant using the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, age, and platelet count. We evaluated the association between FIB-4 and mortality using both multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model. Correlations between FIB-4 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cytokine levels were evaluated using the Spearman test. Among the 202 participants, 22 died. The median FIB-4 in participants who survived and died were 1.91 and 3.98 (P < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test), respectively. Each one-unit increment in FIB-4 was associated with an increased odds of death (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.36, 2.35; P < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline characteristics including sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and history of liver diseases. During hospitalization, FIB-4 peaked and then normalized in the survival group but failed to normalize in the death group. FIB-4 was positively correlated with the level of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and monocyte-associated cytokines, especially interleukin-6 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10.

Expression of genes associated with type I interferon signalling and inflammation and production of their corresponding proteins were determined. Both linear and macrocyclic GdBCA stimulated expression of multiple type I interferon-regulated genes and the expression of numerous chemokines, cytokines and growth factors in normal human peripheral blood monocytes. There was no correlation between the magnitude of the measured response and the Gd chelate used. To explore the mechanisms responsible for GdBCA induction of fibrosis in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in vitro, normal human dermal fibroblasts were incubated with GdBCA-treated monocyte culture supernatants and the effects on profibrotic gene expression were examined. Supernatants from monocytes exposed to all GdBCA stimulated types I and III collagen, fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in normal dermal fibroblasts.

We hypothesized that genetically determined blood subtype A1 is associated with increased risk of ARDS and markers of microvascular dysfunction and coagulation. METHODS We conducted analyses in three cohorts of critically ill trauma and sepsis patients (n = 3,710) genotyped on genome-wide platforms to determine the association of the A1 blood type genotype with ARDS risk. We subsequently determined if associations were present in FUT2 defined non-secretors who lack ABO antigens on epithelium, but not endothelium. In a patient subgroup, we determined the associations of blood type with plasma levels of endothelial glycoproteins and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Lastly, we tested if blood type A was associated with less donor lung injury recovery during human ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). RESULTS The A1 genotype was associated with a higher risk of moderate to severe ARDS relative to type O in all three populations. In sepsis, this relationship was strongest in non-pulmonary infections. The association persisted in non-secretors, suggesting a vascular mechanism. The A1 genotype was also associated with higher DIC risk as well as concentrations of thrombomodulin and von Willebrand Factor, which in turn were associated with ARDS risk. Blood type A was also associated with less lung injury recovery during EVLP.

In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of its immunostimulatory potency in immune responses of macrophages, using polysaccharides prepared from Polyporus umbellatus (PPS). MATERIALS AND METHODS Splenocyte proliferation was analyzed with (3)H-TdR incorporation method. Nitric oxide (NO) was measured by Griess method and cytokines of culture supernatants was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The fluoresceinamine-labeled PPS (Flu-PPS) and dextran (Flu-dextran) were prepared by the cyanogen bromide activation method. The cell-binding activity of Flu-PPS was analyzed with FACS and confocal microscopy. NF-κB activity was measured by ELISA assay. RESULTS We found that PPS is able to strongly upregulate the functions of macrophages such as Nitric oxide (NO) production and cytokine expression. Compared with C3H/HeJ group, PPS significantly stimulated the proliferation of splenocytes and the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and NO of peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeN mice. The function blocking antibodies to TLR-4, but not TLR-2 and CR3, markedly suppressed PPS-mediated TNF-α and IL-1β production. Flow cytometric and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis shown that fluorescence-labeled PPS (f-PPS) can bind specifically to the target cells, and the binding can blocked by unlabeled PPS and anti-TLR4, but not anti-TLR2 and CR3 monoclonal antibodies. Nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB was significantly induced by PPS. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, our data suggest that PPS may exert its immunostimulating potency via TLR-4 activation of signaling pathway.","Li, Xingqun; Xu, Wen",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.06.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600759/,78

Treating chronic wounds in elderly patients is difficult due to comorbidities and poor immunity, tissue renewal, and regeneration. This study shared the therapeutic experiences of 40 patients with super long-term difficult-to-heal wounds and to describe the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)-assisted debridement and autologous scalp grafting. Elderly patients with chronic wounds for more than 60 years who underwent NPWT-assisted debridement and autologous scalp grafting between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Forty patients were identified and analyzed. Among all patients, the average wound area was 56 (interquartile range 30-90) cm2. The wound infection rate was 82.1%, and that before the first autologous scalp grafting was 51.3%. The average total number of surgeries was 3, and the number of times the NPWT device was replaced was once. A total of 97.4% of patients had one autologous scalp grafting performed. The transplanted scalp survived completely in 97.4% of patients. One hundred percent of patients had no postoperative complications and healed. The average wound healing time was 34.5 ± 10.1 days. This study showed that NPWT-assisted debridement and autologous scalp grafting have the advantages of high survival rate of the skin and decreased wound recurrence and may be a suitable treatment for super long-term difficult-to-heal wounds in elderly patients.","Ye, Chunjiang; Zhang, Yuanhai; Han, Chunmao; Mao, Shulei; Ni, Liangfang; Liu, Jia; Wu, Junmei; Zhang, Jianfen",The international journal of lower extremity wounds,https://doi.org/10.1177/1534734620960292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962469/,78

However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.","Cui, Jian; Zhang, Lin; Yang, Lin; Zhu, Yue-Lu; Fang, Hui; Chen, Bo; Ning, Yi; Zhang, Hai-Zeng",Cancer medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079470/,78

The cyanide-sensing species is a non-fluorescent fluorophore-polymer-Cu2+ complex; which forms as a result of the imidazole polymer's ability to bind both fluorophore and fluorescence quencher (Cu2+). Cyanide removes Cu2+ from these complexes; thereby ""turning-on"" sensor fluorescence. These sensors are water-soluble and have a detection limit of ~2.5 μM (CN-) in water. Our ternary complex-based sensing approach also enables facile emission tuning; we demonstrate the convenient, synthesis-free preparation of blue and green-emitting sensors using distyrylbiphenyl and fluorescein fluorophores, respectively.

The poor prognosis among patients affected with this type of cancer is associated with its high-invasiveness and the lack of successful therapies. A comprehensive understanding for the early molecular mechanisms in glioblastoma would definitely enhance the diagnosis and the treatment strategies. Deregulated expression of key genes that are known to be involved in early neurogenesis could be the instigator of brain tumorigenesis. Ras Like Without CAAX 1 (RIT1) gene that encodes an unusual ""orphan"" GTPase protein belongs to this category of critical genes that are known to be involved in controlling sequential proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells. In this study, we surveyed RIT1 gene expression by in-silico approaches to determine its spatio-temporal pattern in glioblastoma. Our results revealed a significant and progressive upregulation of RIT1 mRNA levels in various publicly available datasets. RIT1 expression ranked among the top upregulated genes in glioblastoma cohorts and it correlated with poor overall survival. Genetic and epigenetic analysis of RIT1 didn't reveal any significant aberration that could underlie its deregulated expression. Yet, our results highlighted the possibility of its activity to be transcriptionally controlled by STAT3, one of the main players in the onset of glioblastoma. In conclusion, our study presented for the first time a potential oncogenic role for RIT1 in glioblastoma. Knowing that the RAS superfamily of proteins has created an evolution in the cancer field, RIT1 should be added to this list through further investigations on its possible usage as a biomarker and therapeutic target in glioblastoma.","Khalil, Athar; Nemer, Georges",Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,https://doi.org/10.3233/cbm-191264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831193/,78

We sought to examine whether the wall shear stress (WSS) values of LIMA grafts during the perioperative period reflected the 1-year patency by using combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images. METHODS CCTA was performed in 233 patients with LIMA graft perioperatively and 1 year later from October 2014 to May 2017. LIMA occlusion was detected in six patients at the 1-year follow-up CCTA. Two patients were excluded due to poor imaging quality. The remaining four patients were enrolled as occlusive (OCC) group, and eight patients with patent LIMA were recruited as patent (PAT) group. The WSS values of LIMA during perioperative period were calculated. LIMA graft was artificially divided into three even segments, proximal (pLIMA), middle (mLIMA) and distal (dLIMA) segments. The independent samples t-test and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used. RESULTS The WSS values of dLIMA were significantly higher in the PAT group than in the OCC group (4.43 vs. 2.56, p < 0.05). The WSS values of dLIMA in the PAT group were significantly higher than pLIMA, which was absent in the OCC group. CONCLUSIONS A higher WSS value of the distal segment of LIMA and a higher WSS value of the distal segment compared with the proximal segment of LIMA in the PAT were observed; this tendency might be helpful in predicting the 1-year patency of LIMA.","Zhu, Lan; Pan, Zilai; Li, Zehang; Chang, Yunxiao; Zhu, Yunpeng; Yan, Fuhua; Tu, Shengxian; Yang, Wenjie",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937666/,78

T cells were isolated on histopaque density gradient by differential centrifugation, and were cultured with the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), free radical generator (H2O2/FeSO4) and with different concentrations of L1 and [Cu(L1)] (1 - 100 μM). Proliferation (MTT assay), cytokines (Elisa kits), ATP levels, cytotoxic effect (micronucleus test) and oxidative markers (glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents) were investigated after 48-h incubation. Our results showed that H2O2/FeSO4 treatment induced a reduction in T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion and ATP levels associated to an evident intracellular oxidative stress, inflammatory profile and DNA damage. Addition of L1 at 100 μM was able to increase cell proliferation, IL-2, IL-4 and INFγ secretion and ATP contents and to reduce hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents, catalase activity and micronuclei number in lymphocytes under oxidative stress, with a partial protection. The [Cu(L1)] exhibited protective effects in T lymphocytes by inhibiting H2O2/FeSO4 - induced cell proliferation suppression, inflammatory status, ATP loss and oxidative stress generation, whatever the concentration used. In conclusion, in the situation of excessive oxidative stress, [Cu(L1)] treatment improved T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, ATP contents and oxidant/antioxidant status.

To make matters worse, an upcoming and alarming trend that is increasingly being noticed as a post-COVID sequel is that of pulmonary fibrosis. Given the scale of the pandemic, the magnitude of this problem is likely to be high. Extrapolated conclusions from previous studies discussing the beneficial role of antifibrotics in progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases provide some hope that these medicines might have a potentially useful role in COVID-19 related lung fibrosis as well. Increased serum levels of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators in COVID-19 patients, similar cytokine profiles in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19, and broad anti-fibrotic activity of approved antifibrotics irrespective of the underlying etiology, are some of the proposed mechanisms favoring the argument. However, no studies currently support or refute the use of antifibrotics in patients developing post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis.

METHODS Consecutive patients diagnosed with early HCC by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (single nodule of ≤ 5 cm, or multi- (up to 3) nodules of ≤ 3 cm each) and who underwent RFA treatment with curative intent between January 2010 and August 2011 at the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo, Brazil were enrolled in the study. RFA of the liver tumors (with 1.0 cm ablative margin) was carried out under CT-fluoro scan and ultrasonic image guidance of the percutaneous ablation probes. Procedure-related complications were recorded. At 1-mo post-RFA and 3-mo intervals thereafter, CT and MRI were performed to assess outcomes of complete response (absence of enhancing tissue at the tumor site) or incomplete response (enhancing tissue remaining at the tumor site). Overall survival and disease-free survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log rank test or simple Cox regression. The effect of risk factors on survival was assessed by the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS A total of 38 RFA sessions were performed during the study period on 34 patients (age in years: mean, 63 and range, 49-84). The mean follow-up time was 22 mo (range, 1-33). The study population showed predominance of male sex (76%), less severe liver disease (Child-Pugh A, n = 26; Child-Pugh B, n = 8), and single tumor (65%). The maximum tumor diameters ranged from 10 to 50 mm (median, 26 mm). The initial (immediately post-procedure) rate of RFA-induced complete tumor necrosis was 90%. The probability of achieving complete response was significantly greater in patients with a single nodule (vs patients with multi-nodules, P = 0.04). Two patients experienced major complications, including acute pulmonary edema (resolved with intervention) and intestinal perforation (led to death). The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 82% and 71%, respectively. Sex, tumor size, initial response, and recurrence status influenced survival, but did not reach the threshold of statistical significance. Child-Pugh class and the model for end-stage liver disease score were identified as predictors of survival by simple Cox regression, but only Child-Pugh class showed a statistically significant association to survival in multiple Cox regression analysis (HR = 15; 95%CI: 3-76 mo; P = 0.001). The 1- and 2-year cumulative disease-free survival rates were 65% and 36%, respectively. CONCLUSION RFA is an effective therapy for local tumor control of early HCC, and patients with preserved liver function are the best candidates.","Kikuchi, Luciana; Menezes, Marcos; Chagas, Aline L; Tani, Claudia M; Alencar, Regiane Ssm; Diniz, Marcio A; Alves, Venâncio Af; D'Albuquerque, Luiz Augusto Carneiro; Carrilho, Flair José",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i6.1585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24587635/,78

Several recent studies suggest that immune dysregulation with early and prolonged adaptive immune system activation can result in cellular exhaustion. In this issue of the JCI, Files et al. compared cellular immune phenotypes during the first two months of COVID-19 in hospitalized and less severe, non-hospitalized patients. The authors utilized flow cytometry to analyze circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both patient-cohorts maintained B and T cell phenotypes consistent with activation and cellular exhaustion throughout the first two months of infection. Additionally, follow-up samples from the non-hospitalized patient cohort showed that activation markers and cellular exhaustion increased over time. These findings illustrate the persistent nature of the adaptive immune system changes that have been noted in COVID-19 and suggest longer-term effects that may shape the maintenance of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Mudd, Philip A; Remy, Kenneth E",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci143928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104057/,78

In laparoscopic hernia surgery, either fixation outside the trapezoid of disaster or no fixation is recommended to avoid postoperative pain. To avoid recurrence are transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair, the myopectineal orifice must be covered with mesh during TAPP, but lifting or shrinking of the mesh can lead to recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a novel technique for mesh fixation to prevent the mesh from lifting off. METHODS After the preperitoneal space was created during TAPP, the anatomy of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh or the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve within the trapezoid of disaster was checked. The mesh was tacked at the trapezoid of disaster without nerve injury, and the mesh was fixed with circumferential tacking. We call this procedure secure tacking against recurrence (STAR). We treated 391 adult patients (478 hernias) with TAPP repair; novel tacking was used in some patients (STAR group, 236 hernias). The results of the STAR group were retrospectively compared with those of patients in whom we did not use this novel tacking (conventional group, 242 hernias). RESULTS There was no postoperative chronic pain in either group. There were no cases of hernia recurrence in the STAR group, but there were four cases of hernia recurrence in the conventional group (0% vs 1.7%, P = 0.047). These four recurrences consisted of indirect hernia and mesh lifting on the lateral side. CONCLUSION The STAR procedure is feasible and safety as a standard procedure for securing the mesh during TAPP.","Nagahisa, Yoshio; Kawashima, Ryuju; Matsumoto, Ryu; Harada, Masaki; Hashida, Kazuki; Okabe, Michio; Kawamoto, Kazuyuki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29457698/,78

The intraperitoneal onlay mesh procedures (IPOM) are frequently used for open or laparoscopic repair for incisional and ventral hernia. The risk of PoA can be increased in these patients, thus, any further laparoscopic exploration might be considered difficult. The aim of our study is to analyze the adhesiolysis-related challenges and complications in patients requiring laparoscopic surgery after IPOM ventral hernia repair. Methods: All the patients who underwent any laparoscopic procedure after open or video-assisted IPOM ventral hernia repair in Ponderas Academic Hospital from May 2011 to December 2018, were retrospectively analyzed. Two trained experts reviewed all video recordings and collected data on surgical history, adhesion location and density, dissection difficulty, interval time to release adhesions from the mesh and complications. Results: Twenty-nine patients were included into the study. There were 17 females, mean age of 58.0 +- 14.5 years, mean BMI of 28.7 +- 7.0 Kg/m2 and a median number of abdominal surgeries of 3/ patient. Risk factors for adhesion formation, other than the mesh itself were found in16 patients. The median time from the last IPOM procedure to the laparoscopic exploration was 26 months and it was related to the hernia repair technique in 21 patients and indicated for other pathologies in 8 patients.Adherences to the mesh were found in the majority of the cases (96%).The mean score of surface adhesion and adhesion tenacity was 4.0 +- 1.7 and 3.0 +- 0.8, respectively. The median time to complete the adhesiolysis to the mesh was 22 minutes. Small bowel was open during the dissection in six patients. Mesh migration was encountered in two. There were three conversions to open surgery and one to robotic surgery. History of peritonitis and septic complications at the last surgery were significantly associated with a higher rate of conversion. One surgical site infection and no mesh infection were encountered. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days. The 30-day postoperative mortality was nil. The median postoperative follow-up was 13 months. There are 3 recurrent incisional hernias. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that laparoscopic approach after previous IPOM is feasible but challenging. Adherences to the mesh are expected in the majority of the cases. History of peritonitis, a large number of open abdominal procedures, and septic complication at last surgery correlate with a high difficulty of adhesiolysis.","Turcu, Florin; Arnăutu, Octavian; Copaescu, Cătălin",Chirurgia,https://doi.org/10.21614/chirurgia.114.1.39; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830843/,78

Design, Setting and Participants: Using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), this retrospective epidemiological assessment reviewed reports filed between January 1, 2021, and June 18, 2021, among adolescents ages 12-17 who received mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. Symptom search criteria included the words myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis to identify children with evidence of cardiac injury. The word troponin was a required element in the laboratory findings. Inclusion criteria were aligned with the CDC working case definition for probable myocarditis. Stratified cardiac adverse event (CAE) rates were reported for age, sex and vaccination dose number. A harm-benefit analysis was conducted using existing literature on COVID-19-related hospitalization risks in this demographic. Main outcome measures: 1) Stratified rates of mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis in adolescents age 12-15 and 16-17; and 2) harm-benefit analysis of vaccine-related CAEs in relation to COVID-19 hospitalization risk. Results: A total of 257 CAEs were identified. Rates per million following dose 2 among males were 162.2 (ages 12-15) and 94.0 (ages 16-17); among females, rates were 13.0 and 13.4 per million, respectively. For boys 12-15 without medical comorbidities receiving their second mRNA vaccination dose, the rate of CAE is 3.7-6.1 times higher than their 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization risk as of August 21, 2021 (7-day hospitalizations 1.5/100k population) and 2.6-4.3-fold higher at times of high weekly hospitalization risk (2.1/100k), such as during January 2021. For boys 16-17 without medical comorbidities, the rate of CAE is currently 2.1-3.5 times higher than their 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization risk, and 1.5-2.5 times higher at times of high weekly COVID-19 hospitalization. Conclusions: Post-vaccination CAE rate was highest in young boys aged 12-15 following dose two. For boys 12-17 without medical comorbidities, the likelihood of post vaccination dose two CAE is 162.2 and 94.0/million respectively. This incidence exceeds their expected 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization rate at both moderate (August 21, 2021 rates) and high COVID-19 hospitalization incidence. Further research into the severity and long-term sequelae of post-vaccination CAE is warranted. Quantification of the benefits of the second vaccination dose and vaccination in addition to natural immunity in this demographic may be indicated to minimize harm.","Hoeg, T.

Fulminant SARS-CoV-2 viral myocarditis have been reported, though it is likely relatively rare. In both children and adults, COVID-19 may also cause a Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome with heart involvement being a prominent feature. Possible mechanisms of cardiovascular injury in COVID-19 include hypoxia from lung disease, direct viral infection of cells in the cardiovascular system, down-regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dysregulated immune response, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis. Medications used to treat COVID-19 may also have cardiac side effects including QT-prolongation and arrhythmias. Troponin elevation or acute cardiac injury may be used to risk-stratify patients with severe COVID-19. The dysregulated immune response in COVID-19 can be targeted with glucocorticoids and possibly immunomodulators. Anticoagulation may be indicated in select COVID-19 patients to prevent or treat thrombotic complications. The relationship between angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and COVID-19 is not completely understood and major societies have recommended that patients who were otherwise benefiting from ACEIs or ARBs continue to take it. © Journal of Xiangya Medicine.

Currently, only a small percentage of the populace is vaccinated, and their protection is likely to have waned. Most therefore are susceptible today. And when the disease re-emerges the susceptible individuals may be manipulated by disinformation on Social Media to refuse vaccines. Thus, a combination of countermeasures consisting of antiviral drugs and vaccines and a range of policies for their application need to be investigated. Opinions as to receptivity of vaccines evolve with time through social exchanges over networks that overlap with but are not identical to the disease propagation networks. These couple the spread of the biological and information contagion and necessitate a joint investigation of the two. Towards these, we develop a computationally tractable metapopulation epidemiological model that captures the joint spatio-temporal evolution of smallpox and opinion dynamics. The computations based on the model show that opinion dynamics has a substantial impact on the fatality count. Towards understanding how perpetrators are likely to seed the infection we identify a) the initial distribution of infected individuals that maximize the overall fatality count regardless of mobility patterns, and b) which habitation structures are more vulnerable to outbreaks. We assess the relative efficacy of different countermeasures and conclude that a combination of vaccines and drugs minimizes the fatalities, and by itself, for smallpox, drugs reduce fatalities more than the vaccine. Accordingly, we assess the efficacies of three separate policies for administering the drugs and identify the best among them for various parameter combinations. When the availability of the drug is finite, we show that increase in its supply substantially reduces the overall fatality. Our findings lead to policy recommendations for public health and urban design authorities towards thwarting smallpox and other infectious disease outbreaks.","Ali, R.

There are four main disease courses: no or mild symptoms, unavoidable hospitalisation, severe or lethal outcome, and permanent or posthoc manifestations. The last course is usually referred to as post-COVID syndrome. As a part of the acute and post-COVID symptomatology there were published pain perceptions with frequent but heterogeneous localisation. It is practical to classify them by the origin of pain: nociceptive/inflammatory, peripheral neuropathic or central. Additionally, we have to clear which phase is the post-COVID patient in i.e. the patient has the prolonged COVID- or persistent post-COVID syndrome. However, in addition to an acute general inflammatory reaction, a true inflammation of joints and muscles is very rare in the musculoskeletal system. The diffuse musculoskeletal pain, chronic fatigue, generalised anxiety and depressive disposition manifest themselves in both acute and persistent forms. Their explanation is essentially of neurological nature: there are para-infectious “neuro-inflammation”, i.e. neuropathic and central mechanisms in the background. Accordingly, therapeutic options must be chosen while concerning the neuropharmacological action mechanisms of analgesics.

Computational approaches inform function to aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult as glycans can sample a wide range of low energy conformations, thus limiting the study of glycan-mediated molecular interactions. In this work, we expanded the RosettaCarbohydrate framework, developed and benchmarked effective tools for glycan modeling and design, and extended the Rosetta software suite to better aid in structural analysis and benchmarking tasks through the SimpleMetrics framework. We developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates (KDE) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. After a rigorous optimization of kinematic and energetic considerations to improve near-native sampling enrichment and decoy discrimination, GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of diverse glycan structures, or “trees”. Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. GlycanTreeModeler algorithms and associated tools were employed to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine that are able to direct the immune response by shielding regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, aid in both X-ray and electron microscopy density solutions and refinement, and help lead the way towards a new era of computational glycobiology.","Adolf-Bryfogle, Jared; Labonte, Jason W.; Kraft, John C.; Shapovalov, Maxim; Raemisch, Sebastian; Lütteke, Thomas; DiMaio, Frank; Bahl, Christopher D.; Pallesen, Jesper; King, Neil P.; Gray, Jeffrey J.; Kulp, Daniel W.; Schief, William R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.462000,78

The WHO on March 11, 2020, has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. Several studies found an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms, such as distress, anxiety, fear of infection, depression and insomnia in the general population. Therefore, psychiatrists have been professionally overloaded, trying to manage the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and suffering its effects in person.ObjectivesTo evaluate the disease perceptions, distress and burnout among psychiatrists from the Department of Mental Health and Addictions of Pavia in three different times, which correspond to the three main phases of the pandemic management in Italy: T0 is the first peak of the infections and the lock-down, from March to June;T1 is the reduction of the infections and the reopening, from June to October;T2 is the second wave of infections with a new progressive closure, the current one.MethodsWe used three questionnaires: the BIPQ (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire), the PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale-10), the PED (Profile of emotional distress).

A readily available wild-plant biomass (Cyperus papyrus, CP) was chosen as the raw material for manufacturing the adsorbent. A “green-etching” process was employed to synthesize adsorbents with significant modifications and without using of any chemicals. As observed via characterization analysis, upon mixing SFMs with CP at a 1:1 weight ratio, there were considerable developments in the specific surface area (SBET = 830 m2/g) for both micro- (0.333 cm3/g) and mesopores (0.053 cm3/g) as well as diversified functional groups (e.g., amino and carbonyl) on the sorbent that was produced. This is a key for the adsorbent’s ability in order to remove a variety of pollutants from aqueous solutions. The heavy metal (Cr(VI)) ion adsorption capacity was used to identify the optimum adsorption parameters. Significantly lower amounts of Cr(VI) residues were achieved at a concentration of 2 mg/L from an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 30 mg/L by applying an SFM-modified sorbent dose of 10 g/L.

To further explore what contributed to fake news susceptibility of social media users, the research 1) integrated a widely-adopted mass communication theory of third-person perception (TPP) with digital disinformation;2) examined users’ social media engagement and individual characteristics toward risk as antecedents of TPP;and lastly, 3) tested TPP of fake news under a context of COVID-19 outbreak, an uncertain situation flooded with baseless news and information. An online survey was conducted on 871 respondents via Amazon Mechanical Turk. As a result, we found that in the context of COVID-19, social media engagement 1) directly increased TPP;and 2) indirectly increased TPP via self-efficacy and perceived knowledge. However, negative affect failed to mediate a positive relationship between communal engagement and TPP, as the respondents rated themselves more attentive to fake news than are others. Therefore, the fact that social media directly and indirectly provoked higher TPP implicates that a potential harm of social media is not confined to a rumor mill that propagates false stories, as widely recognized, but can further extend to an echo chamber to cultivate a slanted belief that he or she is fake-news-proof.","Yang, Jeongwon Tian Yu",Computers in Human Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106950,78

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations were characterized, together with the pattern of virus replication and appearance of antibodies in the lungs. Total BAL cell numbers increased from 140x10(6) at 5 days p.i. to 948x10(6) at 25 days p.i. and remained at high levels until the end of the experiment. The number of monocytes/macrophages, as identified by monoclonal antibodies 74-22-15 and 41D3, increased two- to fivefold between 9 and 52 days p.i. with a maximum at 25 days p.i. Flow cytometry showed that the population of differentiated macrophages was reduced between 9 and 20 days p.i. and that between the same time interval, both 74-22-15-positive and 41D3-negative cells, presumably monocytes, and 74-22-15- and 41D3-double negative cells, presumably non-phagocytes, entered the alveolar spaces. Virus replication was highest at 7 to 9 days p.i., decreased slowly thereafter and was detected until 40 days p.i. Anti-PRRSV antibodies were detected starting at 9 days p.i. but neutralizing antibodies were only demonstrated in one pig euthanized at 35 days and another at 52 days p.i. The decrease of virus replication in the lungs from 9 days p.i. can be attributed to (i) shortage of susceptible differentiated macrophages, (ii) lack of susceptibility of the newly infiltrated monocytes and (iii) appearance of anti-PRRSV antibodies in the lungs. Neutralizing antibodies may contribute to the clearance of PRRSV from the lungs.","Labarque, G G; Nauwynck, H J; Van Reeth, K; Pensaert, M B",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10769076/,78

METHOD Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (NPA) from 349 patients(1 from each) and 130 cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) specimens were collected from children who were admitted to the PICU of Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Additional 87 NPA specimens were collected from healthy children for routine examination on the physical examination center, and the clinical data were collected. Multiplex PCR was applied to detect 16 kinds of viruses from NPA and CSF. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was applied to detect 13 viruses from CSF and to analyze the clinical data of positive cases. RESULT There were 209 samples (59.9%) of the 349 NPA specimens were positive for viruses, which included 117 cases positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 60 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 20 for influenza virus A (Inf A), 10 for adenovirus (ADV), 6 for parainfluenza virus type 3(PIV-3), 6 for human Boca virus (HBoV), 5 for influenza virus C(Inf C), 4 for parainfluenza virus type 4(PIV-4), 4 for human coronavirus-HKU1/OC43, 3 for influenza virus B (Inf B), 3 for WU Polyomavirus (WUPyV), 2 parainfluenza virus type 1(PIV-1), 2 human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and 1 human coronavirus-NL63/229E. But none from 87 healthy controls were positive for any respiratory virus. Among the 130 CSF specimens, in 58 cases the diagnosis was viral encephalitis. There were 22 samples (37.9%) among the 58 CSF specimens positive for viruses, which included 14 enterovirus (EV), 3 human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), 2 mumps virus, 1 coxsackie virus A16 (Cox-A16), 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV) and 1 human rhinovirus (HRV). The total positive rate was 63.3% (221/349) . Co-infection by at least 2 viral pathogens under study was observed in 45 of the 349 patients (12.9% of the total number of cases, 20.4% of the positives cases). The commonest pathogens in co-infected samples were WUPyV (100%) and HMPV(100%). The positive rate of virus peaked in the first 6 months of life, the rate in boys were higher than in girls and the peak season was summer. The numbers of none serious cases in the virus positive group were less than those in the virus negative group while the numbers of extremely serious cases in the virus positive group were higher than in the virus negative group. CONCLUSION Viral pathogen is a major cause of infectious disease in pediatric critical illnesses and virus infection may lead to severe illness.","Cai, Xiao-ying; Lu, Xue-dong; Lin, Guang-yu; Cai, Zhi-wei; Lin, Chuang-xing; Chen, Pai-zhen; Zheng, Yan-ling; Zhou, Xiao-hua; Feng, Xue-yong; Xiao, Ze-xi",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131585/,78

Doctors and nurses were equally unlikely to draw congruent assessments of the patient's past and present health condition, mixed use of biomedical/ethnocultural practices, adherence with medication and eat/drink instructions, (dis)satisfaction, and future confidence in recommended biomedical and ethnocultural approaches. Nurses were considerably more likely to hold views that were congruent with the patient's reported health care effectiveness in Finland. The findings suggest that doctors should request and place special weight on the insights of the principal attending nurse when assessing the potential contributions of personal, family, and host-society health care assets and inhibitors to a migrant patient's overall health plan. The results also suggest that culturally sensitive health care training offers specific advantages to nurses who attend to PAS.","Koehn, Peter H; Sainola-Rodriguez, Kirsti",Journal of transcultural nursing : official journal of the Transcultural Nursing Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16160192/,78

The need for humidification of NIV gas is controversial. Some unique aspects of NIV conspire to alter the delivered humidity and airway function. In the presence of air leaks, unidirectional air flow dries the airways and increases airway resistance. Patient comfort is also a critical issue, as tolerance of NIV is often tied to patient comfort. This paper provides the arguments for and against routine humidification during NIV in the hospital setting. Data from clinical research demonstrate the effects of delivered humidification on relevant physiologic variables. The impact of humidification on NIV success/failure remains speculative.","Branson, Richard D; Gentile, Michael A",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20105346/,78

We aimed to determine trends, geographical variations, and factors influencing bariatric surgery and the choice of procedure in France in a large observational study.The Health Insurance Fund for Salaried Workers (Caisse National Assurance Maladie Travailleurs Salariés) covers about 86% of the French population. The Système National d'Information Inter-régimes de l'Assurance Maladie database contains individualized and anonymized patient data on all reimbursements for healthcare expenditure. All types of primary bariatric procedures (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB] or omega loop, adjustable gastric banding [AGB], or longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy [LSG]) performed during 2011 to 2013 were systematically recorded. Surgical techniques performed by region of residence and age-range relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of undergoing LSG or RYGB versus AGB were computed.In 2013, LSG was performed more frequently than RYGB and AGB (57% vs 31% and 13%, respectively). A total of 41,648 patients underwent a bariatric procedure; they were predominantly female (82%) with a mean (±standard deviation) age of 40 (±12) years and a body mass index ≥40 kg/m for 68% of them. A total of 114 procedures were performed in patients younger than 18 years and 2381 procedures were performed in patients aged 60 years and older. Beneficiaries of the French universal health insurance coverage for low-income patients were more likely to undergo surgery than the general population. Large nationwide variations were observed in the type choice of bariatric surgical procedures. Significant positive predictors for undergoing RYGB compared to those for undergoing AGB were as follows: referral to a center performing a large number of surgeries or to a public hospital, older age, female gender, body mass index ≥50 kg/m, and treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes, or depression. Universal health insurance coverage for low-income patients was inversely correlated with the probability of RYGB.Differences in access to surgery have been observed in terms of the patient's profile, geographical variations, and predictors of types of procedures. Several challenges must be met when organizing the medical care of this growing number of patients, when delivering surgery through qualified centers while assuring the quality of long-term follow-up for all patients.","Czernichow, Sébastien; Paita, Michel; Nocca, David; Msika, Simon; Basdevant, Arnaud; Millat, Bertrand; Fagot-Campagna, Anne",Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27930509/,78

This commentary argues that, despite its devastating effects, the Covid-19 pandemic can be a longer-term positively transformative event for global health. However, this will require going beyond the development of more effective plans for health emergency preparedness, to confront the crisis in global health governance and leadership, and rethink the roles of key actors involved in world health.

A full understanding of this scenario is required, as transplantation is a lifesaving procedure and COVID-19 remains an ongoing threat. METHODS: Abdominal organ transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to transplantation were identified by chart review and clinical data was collected. The primary outcome was the transplant outcome including graft loss, rejection and death, and reactivation of infection posttransplant. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients who received abdominal organ transplants after symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; four patients had a positive PCR at the time of admission for transplantation. The median time of follow-up was 79 (22-190) days. One recipient with negative PCR before transplant tested positive 9 days after transplant. One of 14 transplanted patients developed disseminated mold infection and died 86 days after transplant. During follow-up, only one patient developed rejection; thirteen patients had favorable graft outcomes.

METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from January 31, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Data of 902 patients were obtained from clinical records in hospitals, primary care units, and community pharmacies. Inclusion criteria were adults with IMIDs treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs who started therapy 3 months prior to study commencement. Patients with poor adherence to treatments were excluded. COVID-19 was classified as ""definitive"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive), ""possible"" (characteristic symptoms and negative PCR), and ""suspected"" (characteristic symptoms but PCR not performed). RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 70 patients (11 definitive, 19 possible, and 40 suspected). The cumulative incidence of definitive COVID-19 was 1.2%. When considering all cases, the incidence was 7.8%. Patients on biosimilars tumor necrosis factor blockers were more likely to have a diagnosis of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 2.308; p < 0.001). Patients on anti-B-cell therapies had a lower incidence of infections (p = 0.046).

Data suggest that women are less susceptible to severe illness. However, sex-disaggregated data are incomplete, leaving room for misinterpretation, and focusing only on biologic sex underestimates the gendered impact of the pandemic on women. This narrative review summarizes what is known about gender disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic, domestic, and health burdens along with overlapping vulnerabilities related to the pandemic. In addition, this review outlines recommended strategies that advocacy groups, community leaders, and policymakers should implement to mitigate the widening gender disparities related to COVID-19.","Nordhues, Hannah C; Bhagra, Anjali; Stroud, Natya N; Vencill, Jennifer A; Kuhle, Carol L",Mayo Clin Proc,,78

With over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths around the world, to date, this pandemic represents the gravest global health crisis of our times. Thus, the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is an urgent global imperative. At the time of writing, there are over 165 vaccine candidates being developed, with 33 in various stages of clinical testing. In this review, we discuss emerging insights about the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and their implications for vaccine design. We then review emerging knowledge of the immunogenicity of the numerous vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in the clinic and discuss the range of immune defense mechanisms that can be harnessed to develop novel vaccines that confer durable protection against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the potential role of a systems vaccinology approach in accelerating the clinical testing of vaccines, to meet the urgent needs posed by the pandemic.","Grigoryan, Lilit; Pulendran, Bali",Semin Immunol,,78

In March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Carrying high numbers of cases and mortality rates, far-reaching consequences of the global pandemic continues to be the prime global agenda. Communication efforts were maintained continuously during the epidemic to inform the public, raise awareness, take precautions and to eventually mitigate the pandemic so as to prevent the national health system from collapsing. Media played a key role as the public and health authorities disclosed information. Nevertheless, modern communication technologies and the infodemic spreading from social media hindered the communication of accurate information. Given the insufficient health literacy in Turkey, the rapidly changing and unstable pandemic environment resulted in information gaps and in overlooked information. The significance of critical media literacy and health literacy, particularly in digital media, was once again underlined. This study evaluates the influence of risk communication and media on society during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the study assesses important concerns for media during risk periods, including a pandemic.","Sezgin, Deniz; Karaaslan, Yesim Sert; Ersoy, Ibrahim",Gazi Med. J.,,78

250641,Exploring the New Potential Antiviral Constituents of Moringa oliefera for SARS-COV-2 Pathogenesis: An in Silico Molecular Docking and Dynamic Studies,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There is emerging evidence to support that the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures may be associated with negative mental health sequelae. Rural populations in particular may fair worse because they share many unique characteristics that may put them at higher risk for adverse outcomes with the pandemic. Yet, rural populations may also be more resilient due to increased sense of community. Little is known about the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and well-being of a rural population pre- and post-pandemic, especially those with serious mental illness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study with assessments preceding the pandemic (between October 2019 and March 2020) and during the stay-at-home orders (between April 23, 2020, and May 4, 2020). Changes in hopelessness, suicidal ideation, connectedness, and treatment engagement were assessed using a repeated-measures ANOVA or Friedman test. RESULTS: Among 17 eligible participants, 11 people were interviewed. Overall, there were no notable changes in any symptom scale in the first 3-5 months before the pandemic or during the stay-at-home orders. The few patients who reported worse symptoms were significantly older (mean age: 71.7 years, SD: 4.0). Most patients denied disruptions to treatment, and some perceived telepsychiatry as beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Rural patients with serious mental illness may be fairly resilient in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic when they have access to treatment and supports. Longer-term outcomes are needed in rural patients with serious mental illness to better understand the impact of the pandemic on this population.","Riblet, Natalie B; Stevens, Susan P; Shiner, Brian; Cornelius, Sarah; Forehand, Jenna; Scott, Robert C; Watts, Bradley V",Mil. med,,78

Methods: A total of 134 suspected COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University were recruited from January 23 to May 23, 2020. We analyze the pathogenic form and clinical characteristics. Results: Among them, pathogens were identified in only 84 patients (62.7%), including 23 (17.1%) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 30 (22.3%) with other viruses, 31 (25.0%) with other pathogens and 3 (3.5%) with mixed infections. The commonly observed symptoms of COVID-19 patients were cough, fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, which were significantly different than the symptoms of nonviral infections (P&gt;0.05) but from those of other viral infections (P&gt;0.05). Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase and the neutrophil/lymphocyte were found significantly high in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (P&gt;0.05). The most common manifestations of COVID-19 patients were ground-glass opacities (100%) with or without lung consolidation, however, they also often showed involvement of several lobes of both lungs (P&gt;0.05). Due to the clear differential diagnosis, the overall antibiotic use rate was 35.8% (31/87). Conclusions: When diagnosing COVID-19, infections with other pathogens should not be ignored. Successful pathogen identification will support accurate treatment.","Li, S.; Li, Z.; Chen, L.; Cheng, J.; Zhan, Y.; Yang, F.; Jiang, Q.; Su, X.; Xie, Y.; Wu, Z.; Guo, W.; Gu, W.; Zhong, N.; Ye, F.",Annals of Translational Medicine,,78

Therefore, wearing eyeglasses more than 8 hours per day may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly because eyeglasses are a barrier that reduces the frequency with which people touch their eyes. The aim of the study was to determine if eyeglasses protect from COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used UK Biobank (UKB) data to corroborate findings of the Hubei study in the UK population. RESULTS: Eyewear was associated with a reduced risk of infection, odds ratio (OR)=0.77. The effects of sex, age, and eyewear were independent and significant at the 95% level. Men are 1.24-times more likely to be infected than women; subjects' risk of infection is less (0.95) for every year of age.

We aimed to present early data on children tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a large Australian tertiary children's hospital according to the state health department guidelines, which varied over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. It included all paediatric patients (aged 0-18 years) who presented to the ED or the Respiratory Infection Clinic (RIC) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The 30-day study period commenced after the first confirmed positive case was detected at the hospital on 21 March 2020, until 19 April 2020. We recorded epidemiological and clinical data. RESULTS: There were 433 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in ED (331 [76%]) or RIC (102 [24%]). There were four (0.9%) who had positive SARS-CoV-2 detected, none of whom were admitted to hospital or developed severe disease. Of these SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 1/4 (25%) had a comorbidity, which was asthma. Of the SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, 196/429 (46%) had comorbidities. Risk factors for COVID-19 were identified in 4/4 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 47/429 (11%) SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. CONCLUSION: Our study identified a very low rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in children presenting to a tertiary ED or RIC, none of whom were admitted to hospital. A high proportion of patients who were SARS-CoV-2 negative had comorbidities.","Ibrahim, Laila F; Tosif, Shidan; McNab, Sarah; Hall, Samantha; Lee, Hyun Jung; Lewena, Stuart; Daley, Andrew J; Crawford, Nigel W; Steer, Andrew C; Bryant, Penelope A; Babl, Franz E",Emerg. med Australas,,78

Schools are recognised as an effective ?place? setting to enable improvement to nutrition outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in UK school closures from March 2020. In re-opening in September 2020, schools were required to meet guidelines to ensure the minimised impact of COVID-19 on the population (DfE 2020). We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 school guidelines on secondary and post-16 (16?18 years) food provision. An online survey was posted on 8th October to 1st December 2020, targeted at young people, parents and staff of secondary/post-16 education establishments in the UK. Two hundred and fifty-two responses were received, of which 91% reported a change in their school food provision, 77% reported time for lunch was shortened and 44% indicated the provision was perceived as less healthy during September 2020 (post-lockdown school return) compared with March 2020 (pre-lockdown). Analyses demonstrated that time, limited choice and healthiness impacted negatively upon young people's school food experience. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a huge challenge to the delivery of healthy school food to young people. Therefore, schools require more support in following national food standards and incorporating nutrition education and behaviour change strategies within current guidelines.","Rose, Kelly O’Malley Claire Brown Laura Ells Louisa Jane Lake Amelia A.",Nutrition Bulletin,,78

292707,Fast and efficient purification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase complex expressed in Escherichia coli,2021,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging global public health system. Sex-differences in infectious diseases are a common but neglected problem. METHODS: We used the national surveillance database of COVID-19 in mainland China to compared gender differences in attack rate (AR), proportion of severe and critical cases (PSCC) and case fatality rate (CFR) in relation to age, affected province, and onset-to-diagnosis interval. RESULTS: The overall AR was significantly higher in female population than in males (63.9 versus 60.5 per million persons; P Ë .001). By contrast, PSCC and CFR were significantly lower among female patients (16.9% and 4.0%) than among males (19.5% and 7.2%), with ORs of 0.87 and 0.57, respectively (both P Ë .001). The female-to-male differences were age-dependent, which were significant among people aged 50-69 years for AR, and in the patients of 30-years or older for both PSCC and CFR (all P &#8804; .001). The AR, PSCC and CFR varied greatly from province to province. However, female-to-male differences in AR, PSCC and CFR were significant in the epicenter, Hubei province, where 82.2% confirmed cases and 97.4% deaths occurred. After adjusting for age, affected province and onset-to-diagnosis interval, the female-to-male difference in AR, PSCC and CFR remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We elucidate an age-dependent gender dimorphism for COVID-19, in which the females have higher susceptibility but lower severity and fatality. Further epidemiological and biological investigations are required to better understand the sex-specific differences for effective interventions.","Qian, Jie; Zhao, Lin; Ye, Run-Ze; Li, Xiu-Jun; Liu, Yuan-Li",Clin. infect. dis,,78

Whether aducanumab succeeds, other disease-modifying therapies for AD will follow, and the health-care system is unprepared for the reimbursement and access challenges. Novel AD therapies are much needed, but we cannot assume substantial cost offsets. With forethought and preparation, however, the health-care system can accommodate new AD drugs. First, we urge the use of cost-effectiveness of new Alzheimer's treatments as a starting point for setting value-based prices. Second, payments for new AD therapies should ideally incorporate a performance warranty, which helps apportion risk associated with initial therapy value estimates between drug manufacturers and payers. Third, we urge consideration of ""subscription"" payment agreements to address system affordability issues.","Lin, Pei-Jung; Cohen, Joshua T; Neumann, Peter J",Alzheimers dememt,,78

302593,Repurposing of FDA Approved Drugs for the Identification of Potential Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,2020,"As the detrimental effects of human agency loom large in the 'Anthropocene', theologians and philosophers have called for restraint by invoking the concept of kenosis. Although a 'self-emptying' form of life helps to counter the ways that humans are increasingly driving other species to extinction, we argue that such calls are often compromised by relying on notions of the Creator's own attenuated or self-limited agency. They therefore trade in a competitive construal that is susceptible to the tendency of human agency to either displace, or project itself upon, all other agencies, inadvertently perpetuating the 'human epoch'. In their place, we critically develop the new direction in kenotic theology that speaks of divine self-realization in history through 'deep incarnation'. Our constructive proposal argues for a more thoroughgoing recognition of both the transcendence of divine agency and, as a corollary, the diverse agencies of our fellow creatures.

302902,Optimized surface plasmon resonance immunoassay for staphylococcal enterotoxin G detection using silica nanoparticles,2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world ever since it came into sight. X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. Deep learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large data sets. However, data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for COVID-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification [collaborative or sparse representation (SR)] might provide satisfactory performance with limited size data sets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to the neural network (NN)-based methods. To address this deficiency, convolution support estimation network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between representation-based and NN approaches by providing a noniterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally SR coefficient support, which is critical information for class decision in representation-based techniques. The main premises of this study can be summarized as follows: 1) A benchmark X-ray data set, namely QaTa-Cov19, containing over 6200 X-ray images is created. The data set covering 462 X-ray images from COVID-19 patients along with three other classes; bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal. 2) The proposed CSEN-based classification scheme equipped with feature extraction from state-of-the-art deep NN solution for X-ray images, CheXNet, achieves over 98% sensitivity and over 95% specificity for COVID-19 recognition directly from raw X-ray images when the average performance of 5-fold cross validation over QaTa-Cov19 data set is calculated. 3) Having such an elegant COVID-19 assistive diagnosis performance, this study further provides evidence that COVID-19 induces a unique pattern in X-rays that can be discriminated with high accuracy.","Yamac, Mehmet; Ahishali, Mete; Degerli, Aysen; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E H; Gabbouj, Moncef",IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst,,78

313035,Insight Derived from Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations into the Binding Interactions Between HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro,2020,"BACKGROUND: Smart technology use in rehabilitation is growing and can be used remotely to assist clients in self-monitoring their performance. With written home exercise programs being the commonly prescribed form of rehabilitation after discharge, mobile health technology coupled with task-oriented programs can enhance self-management of upper extremity training. In the current study, a rehabilitation system, namely mRehab, was designed that included a smartphone app and 3D-printed household items such as mug, bowl, key, and doorknob embedded with a smartphone. The app interface allowed the user to select rehabilitation activities and receive feedback on the number of activity repetitions completed, time to complete each activity, and quality of movement. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usability, perceived usefulness, and acceptance of the mRehab system by individuals with stroke and identify the challenges experienced by them when using the system remotely in a home-based setting. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used with 11 individuals with chronic stroke. Following training, individuals with stroke used the mRehab system for 6 weeks at home. Each participant completed surveys and engaged in a semistructured interview. Participants' qualitative reports regarding the usability of mRehab were integrated with their survey reports and quantitative performance data. RESULTS: Of the 11 participants, 10 rated the mRehab system between the 67.5th and 97.5th percentile on the System Usability Scale, indicating their satisfaction with the usability of the system. Participants also provided high ratings of perceived usefulness (mean 5.8, SD 0.9) and perceived ease of use (mean 5.3, SD 1.5) on a 7-point scale based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Common themes reported by participants showed a positive response to mRehab with some suggestions for improvements. Participants reported an interest in activities they perceived to be adequately challenging. Some participants indicated a need for customizing the feedback to be more interpretable. Overall, most participants indicated that they would like to continue using the mRehab system at home. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing usability in the lived environment over a prolonged duration of time is essential to identify the match between the system and users' needs and preferences.

STUDY DESIGN: We included all children presenting with MIS-C at a single centre with 3 or more ECGs taken during the course of their illness. We measured ECG intervals (PR, QRSd and QTc) and amplitudes (R-, S- and T-waves) on each ECG and documented any arrhythmias and ST-segment changes. RESULTS: A majority of children (n=42, 67%) showed ECG changes. The most common findings were low QRS amplitudes and transient T-wave inversion (TWI). ST changes were uncommon, and included ST-segment elevation consistent with pericarditis in one child and acute coronary ischemia in one child. Arrhythmias were seen in thirteen children (21%), but were benign with the exception of one child who was compromised by an atrial tachycardia requiring support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). No children were found to have high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block. CONCLUSION: MIS-C is associated with electrocardiographic changes over the course of the illness, with low amplitude ECGs on presentation, followed by transient T-wave inversion, particularly in the precordial leads. There was a low prevalence of ST-segment changes and tachyarrhythmias.","Regan, Will; O039,; Byrne, Laura; Stewart, Kirsty; Miller, Owen; Pushparajah, Kuberan; Theocharis, Paraskevi; Wong, James; Rosenthal, Eric",J. pediatr.

Initially, Pakistan lacked ""standard operating procedures,"" and the government had to ship testing kits from China and Japan. Moreover, due to violations of the lockdown and standard operating procedures (SOPs), the rapidly increasing number of cases created a burden on the healthcare system. More and more, this pandemic and its impact have grown. As vaccine development has not been successful yet, ""herd immunity"" can only be achieved if about three quarters of the population contract the virus-requiring immunocompromised citizens to be sacrificed for the sake of the country. Moreover, Pakistan has limited testing capacity, so most COVID-19 tests are missing their mark even as the virus spreads. The current scenario is also raising several concerns about the capacity of the government to tackle the prevailing healthcare crisis. In this regard, healthcare professionals suggest that the government must act responsibly to ensure better security provided to healthcare professionals. Identifying suspected cases, introducing personal protective equipment, and taking administrative measures to ensure that better security is provided to healthcare professionals are the needs of the hour to improve outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Testing, tracking, and lockdowns must be focused on areas where clusters are detected. The healthcare professionals must be given utmost protection before this pandemic could wreak havoc in terms of fatalities. Investing in the chronically underfunded healthcare system is needed, so that Pakistan can build capacity to fight the pandemic.","Khalid, Atiqa; Ali, Sana",Asian Bioeth Rev,,78

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with available vaccination information captured in Brazil's national electronic respiratory infection data system between 1 January 2020 and 23 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were age-specific mortality rates of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without recent inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 53 752 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed. Controlling for health facility of treatment, comorbidities as well as an extensive range of sociodemographic factors, patients who received a recent influenza vaccine experienced on average 7% lower odds of needing intensive care treatment (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98), 17% lower odds of requiring invasive respiratory support (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and 16% lower odds of death (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90). Protective effects were larger when the vaccine was administered after onset of symptoms as well as among younger patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 with recent inactivated influenza vaccination experience significantly better health outcomes than non-vaccinated patients in Brazil. Beneficial off-target effects of influenza vaccination through trained innate immune responses seem plausible and need to be further explored. Large-scale promotion of influenza vaccines seems advisable, especially in populations at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease progression.","Fink, Günther; Orlova-Fink, Nina; Schindler, Tobias; Grisi, Sandra; Ferrer, Ana Paula S; Daubenberger, Claudia; Brentani, Alexandra",BMJ Evid.

Neighborhood community-based interventions have been shown to be both effective and cost-effective in preventing cardiovascular disease. There is a dearth of robust studies identifying the key determinants of cardiovascular disease and the underlying effect mechanisms at the neighborhood level. We aim to contribute to the evidence base for neighborhood cardiovascular health research. Methods and Results We created a new neighborhood health data set at the census tract level by integrating 4 types of potential predictors, including unhealthy behaviors, prevention measures, sociodemographic factors, and environmental measures from multiple data sources. We used 4 tree-based machine learning techniques to identify the most critical neighborhood-level factors in predicting the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke, and compared their predictive performance for variable selection. We further quantified the effects of the identified determinants on stroke prevalence using a Bayesian linear regression model. Of the 5 most important predictors identified by our method, higher prevalence of low physical activity, larger share of older adults, higher percentage of non-Hispanic Black people, and higher ozone levels were associated with higher prevalence of stroke at the neighborhood level. Higher median household income was linked to lower prevalence. The most important interaction term showed an exacerbated adverse effect of aging and low physical activity on the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke. Conclusions Tree-based machine learning provides insights into underlying drivers of neighborhood cardiovascular health by discovering the most important determinants from a wide range of factors in an agnostic, data-driven, and reproducible way. The identified major determinants and the interactive mechanism can be used to prioritize and allocate resources to optimize community-level interventions for stroke prevention.","Hu, Liangyuan; Liu, Bian; Ji, Jiayi; Li, Yan",J Am Heart Assoc,,78

389540,SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) - A drug repurposing study,2020,"Structure-based drug discovery efforts require knowledge of where drug-binding sites are located on target proteins. To address the challenge of finding druggable sites, we developed a machine-learning algorithm called TACTICS (trajectory-based analysis of conformations to identify cryptic sites), which uses an ensemble of molecular structures (such as molecular dynamics simulation data) as input. First, TACTICS uses k-means clustering to select a small number of conformations that represent the overall conformational heterogeneity of the data. Then, TACTICS uses a random forest model to identify potentially bindable residues in each selected conformation, based on protein motion and geometry. Lastly, residues in possible binding pockets are scored using fragment docking.

With fellowship interviews beginning in April 2020, there was minimal time to adapt. Each program rapidly developed its own platform, expectations, materials, and process for interviews, and applicants were exposed to a wide array of variability in the process - all while under the stress of interviewing for fellowship positions. AIMS: The aim of this survey-based study was to obtain input from applicants to help guide program decisions about ""best practice"" for the future for both pediatric anesthesiology and other graduate medical education matches. METHODS: A 28-question survey was developed utilizing Qualtrics. An anonymous link was sent to all pediatric anesthesiology program directors for distribution of the survey link to all recently matched applicants. Incoming fellows who were accepted outside of the match process were also invited to respond. RESULTS: 50 respondents completed the survey, for a response rate of 30% based on the 167 matched fellowship positions nationwide (50/167). A majority of the respondents reported they felt virtual interviews allowed them to learn the following things equally as well compared with a traditional interview about fellowship programs: salary and benefits, available academic opportunities, available clinical opportunities, clinical schedule of the fellowship, mentorship opportunities, clinical experience and training of the fellowship, and expected work-life balance during fellowship. Respondents report that the most important factors in making their rank list were perceived goodness of fit, desired geographic location, and perception of program leadership. Additionally, respondents ranked the types of information and interactions that they found most helpful to make decisions. All respondents reported the benefit of cost savings compared to a traditional application cycle, with the most commonly reported estimated savings being $3,000-$5,000 per respondent. CONCLUSIONS: These results allow recommendations for ""best practices"" for virtual interviews to include programs providing an electronic packet of information prior to the interview day, providing dedicated time for applicants to interact with current fellows, providing applicants an understanding of the city/region of the location of the program, and offering a completely optional post-interview visit, when possible. Based on the results of this survey, we recommend that programs continue to offer virtual interviews as a penalty-free option for applicants, even when in-person interviews may be feasible.","DiGiusto, Matthew; Lupa, M Concetta; Corridore, Marco; Sivak, Erica L; Lockman, Justin L",Paediatr. anaesth,,78

Retina-specific deletion of Lhx4 in mice results in a visual defect resembling human congenital stationary night blindness. This visual dysfunction results from the absence of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and the loss of selective rod-connecting cone bipolar cell (CBC) subtypes and AII amacrine cells (ACs). Inactivation of Lhx4 causes the apoptosis of BCs and cell fate switch from some BCs to ACs, whereas Lhx4 overexpression promotes BC genesis. Moreover, Lhx4 positively regulates Lhx3 expression to drive the fate choice of type 2 BCs over the GABAergic ACs. Lhx4 inactivation ablates Bhlhe23 expression, whereas overexpression of Bhlhe23 partially rescues RBC development in the absence of Lhx4. Thus, by acting upstream of Bhlhe23, Prdm8, Fezf2, Lhx3, and other BC genes, Lhx4, together with Isl1, could play essential roles in regulating the subtype-specific development of RBCs and CBCs.","Dong, Xuhui; Yang, Hua; Zhou, Xiangtian; Xie, Xiaoling; Yu, Dongliang; Guo, Luming; Xu, Mei; Zhang, Wenjun; Liang, Guoqing; Gan, Lin",Cell Rep,,78

402263,Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus-induced infection (COVID-19) can be associated with a coagulopathy mainly responsible for pulmonary microvasculature thrombosis and systemic thromboembolic manifestations. The pathophysiology and management of the COVID-19 coagulopathy are likely more complex in patients with inherited bleeding diseases such as haemophilia. These individuals might indeed present with both bleeding and thrombotic complications and require simultaneous antithrombotic and haemostatic treatments. OBJECTIVE: We propose practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 coagulopathy in persons with haemophilia. RESULTS: Continuation of regular haemostatic treatment is recommended for ambulatory patients. For patients requiring hospital admission and on replacement therapy with factors VIII or IX concentrates, prophylaxis with concentrates should be intensified according to the risk of bleeding complications and associated with prophylactic doses of LMWH. For patients on nonreplacement therapy, emicizumab should be continued and possibly combined with factor VIII and prophylactic doses of LMWH depending on the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Dose escalation of LMWH tailored to the risk of thrombosis can be employed but not supported by evidence. CONCLUSIONS: These practical recommendations are based on the current literature on COVID-19 with its impact on haemostasis, indications and modalities for thromboprophylaxis mainly in nonhaemophilic patients and how that is likely to affect persons with haemophilia in different circumstances. They will need to be tailored to each patient's clinical status and validated in future studies.","Pipe, Steven W; Kaczmarek, Radoslaw; Srivastava, Alok; Pierce, Glenn F; Makris, Mike; Hermans, Cedric",Haemophilia,,78

An athlete was pushed to suit their routine activities with a new health protocol for Covid-19 prevention. Some of them were programmed to train at home with a moderate density of exercise, but others were still in a high density of exercise. This study compared the serum level of hemoglobin (Hb), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepcidin among athletes with a high versus moderate exercise density training program during the pandemic. Thirty-four indoor soccer athletes of a soccer football school in Malang voluntarily registered as a subject. Half of them received moderate exercise density exercise programs, and others received high-density exercise programs during June-July 2020. Interleukin-6 and hepcidin level mean was found significantly lower in the moderate group compared to the high-density group. Hemoglobin level mean was found not different between those groups.

We synthetically consider both the number of infected population and its changing rate as the switching condition to implement the curing measures. By using the properties of the Lambert W function, we convert the proposed switching condition to a threshold value related to the susceptible population. The classical epidemic model involving media coverage, linear functions describing injecting vaccine and treatment strategies is examined when the susceptible population exceeds the threshold value. In addition, we consider another SIR model accompanied with the vaccination and treatment strategies represented by saturation functions when the susceptible population is smaller than the threshold value. The dynamics of these two subsystems and the sliding domain are discussed in detail. Four types of local sliding bifurcation are investigated, including boundary focus, boundary node, boundary saddle and boundary saddle-node bifurcations. In the meantime, the global bifurcation involving the appearance of limit cycles is examined, including touching bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation to the pseudo-saddle and crossing bifurcation. Furthermore, the influence of some key parameters related to the three treatment strategies is explored. We also validate our model by the epidemic data sets of A/H1N1 and COVID-19, which can be employed to reveal the effects of media report and existing strategy related to the control of emerging infectious diseases on the variations of confirmed cases.","Deng, Jiawei; Tang, Sanyi; Shu, Hongying",J Theor Biol,,78

423142,Repurposing of Some Natural Product Isolates as SARS-COV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors via In Vitro Cell Free and Cell-Based Antiviral Assessments and Molecular Modeling Approaches,2021,"OBJECTIVE: An outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019. Facing this largescale infectious public health event, everyone is under great psychological pressure. The aim was to investigate the psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: The online cross-sectional study involving 922 participants (656 medical staff and 266 general population) was conducted in China between February and March, 2020. The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. RESULTS: Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (mean = 1.49) than that in general population (mean = 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.59). Female had a 1.44-fold risk of psychological health problems than male (95% CI = 1.01 to 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, 18.3% had psychological health problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. With the remission of the epidemic, the psychological health status of participants has been improved. Medical staff were likely to have higher SCL-90 scores than general population and female had more psychological problems than male. Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions for improving the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zhu, Zhen; Liu, Qi; Jiang, Xiaobing; Manandhar, Upasana; Luo, Zhongyu; Zheng, Xu; Li, Yuanyuan; Xie, Jun; Zhang, Bo",J Psychiatr Res,,78

Chinese medicine has been extensively employed in the coronavirus-related pandemic in China. We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine in treatment of coronavirus-related pneumonia with the updated results of relevant clinical trials. METHODS: Six electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP, and SinoMed will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials up to May 2020. Patients diagnosed with coronavirus-related pneumonia including severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 2019 novel coronavirus disease and administrated with Chinese medicine will be included. The primary outcome is the all cause mortality at the longest follow up available. The second outcomes include the length of stay in hospital and intensive care units, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events. The pooled effects will be analyzed and reported as risk ratios for dichotomous data using the Mantel-Haenszel method or mean differences for continuous data using the inverse-variance method. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed to test the robustness of the results and to explore the potential sources of heterogeneities.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, the most common physical activity that older adults participated in was walking. Mental well-being and socialisation were affected during the lockdown, with older adults employing several strategies to help them cope. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, physically active residents of retirement villages maintained their physical activity, but with reduced intensity and variety. In some cases, this impacted their mental and physical health.

In general, COVID-19 is an acute disease that can also be fatal, with an ongoing 10.2% case morbidity rate. Extreme illness may bring about death because of enormous alveolar damage and hemorrhage along with progressive respiratory failure. The rapidly expanding information with respect to SARS-CoV-2 research suggests a substantial number of potential drug targets. The most encouraging treatment to date is suggested to be with the help of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and many such repurposed drugs. Remdesivir has a strong in vitro activity for SARS-CoV-2, yet it is not the drug of choice as affirmed by the US Food and Drug Administration and presently is being tried in progressing randomized preliminaries. The COVID-19 pandemic has been the worst worldwide general health emergency of this age and, possibly, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical preliminaries propelled to examine potential treatments for COVID-19 feature both the need and capacity to create abundant evidence even in the center of a pandemic. No treatments have been demonstrated as accurate and dependable to date. This review presents a concise precise of the targets and broad treatment strategies for the benefit of researchers.","Singh, Priya; Mishra, Nidhi; Singh, Neelu; Nisha, Raquibun; Pal, Ravi Raj; Singh, Samipta; Maurya, Priyanka; Saraf, Shubhini A",SN Compr Clin Med,,78
443339,A cyclic peptide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,2021,"The paper aims to address the development of China's narrative power during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on world order. It argues that in the post-pandemic world, the emergence of the authoritarian sub-order would be prompted by China's more proactive narrative power, given that the climate of opinion is ambiguous when faced with the uncertainty of the pandemic. (This does not imply the end of the existing liberal order; instead, it features the coexistence of both orders.) To understand how China's narrative power has encouraged the emergence of the authoritarian sub-order to coexist in parallel with the dominant constitutional order, the article first reviews the existing literature concerning the changing world order. In this section, it also briefly defines and differentiates between the constitutional and authoritarian orders, what defines world order, and what distinguishes authoritarian from constitutional liberal order. Second it looks at the theoretical grounding. The nature, role and power of narratives are explored. Ideas about strategic narratives and the economics of attention are discussed. This theoretical background paves the way to examine China's narrative power during a pandemic. Lastly, it switches to the Chinese perspective to address its support for the plurality of orders and its awareness of the strength of narrative in influencing dominant ideas. It looks at how China's narrative power has been exercised from three perspectives (formation, projection and reception). Here, it mainly tackles how China has used its narrative power to spin the pandemic to its advantage in the reorganization of world order: improving its international image and advocating the authoritarian order as an alternative. China has been building its narrative along with its changing strategic diplomacy - from restrained and low-profile to proactive and assertive. In the conclusion, some reflections on China's narrative power and the implications for world order are considered.","Chang, Yung-Yung",J Chin Polit Sci,,78
443340,A cyclic peptide inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease,2021,"PurposeThe purpose of the present study was to develop a methodology for the creation of nutritionally balanced (NB) recipes and meals.Design/methodology/approachNutritional criteria were set for energy, fats, saturated fats, carbohydrates, sugars and salt. A sample of 50 main courses and 29 salads was evaluated and nutritionally reformulated to meet the criteria. One sample t-test, paired sample t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis were performed.FindingsThe original main courses and salads did not meet the nutritional criteria for fats and energy. Both original and NB main courses had high mean protein content. The reformulation of recipes caused a significant change on the provided energy (−50.2%), fats (−57.6%), saturated fats (−58.8%), carbohydrates (−24.2%), proteins (−35.6%) and salt (−53.8%) for the salads (p = 0.001). Accordingly, reformulation of recipes caused a significant change on provided energy (−38.4%), fats (−55.2%), saturated fats (−58.3%), proteins (−25.9%) and salt (−50%) for the main courses (p &lt; 0.001). Predictive models (linear regression analysis) for fats (R2 = 0.345), proteins (R2 = 0.876) and carbohydrates (R2 = 0.797) on the NB recipes were performed.Originality/valueThis is the first attempt to improve the nutritional value of cooking recipes, based on specific nutritional criteria. A methodological procedure for the creation of NB meals is proposed. This methodology could be a useful tool for the nutritionists and chefs, which, in a context of cooperation, could create databases and cooking books with NB recipes easily accessed to public and caterers. The recipes that constitute NB meals could guarantee the standardization of the recipes' reformulation, within a certification standard for restaurants.","Giazitzi, Katerina Boskou George",British Food Journal,,78

Both theoretical and experimental efforts are being made to find an effective treatment to suppress the virus, constituting the forefront of current global safety concerns and a significant burden on global economies. The development of innovative materials able to prevent the transmission, spread, and entry of COVID-19 pathogens into the human body is currently in the spotlight. The synthesis of these materials is, therefore, gaining momentum, as methods providing nontoxic and environmentally friendly procedures are in high demand. Here, a highly virucidal material constructed from SiO2-Ag composite immobilized in a polymeric matrix (ethyl vinyl acetate) is presented. The experimental results indicated that the as-fabricated samples exhibited high antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as well as towards SARS-CoV-2. Based on the present results and radical scavenger experiments, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the enhancement of the biocidal activity. In the presence of O2 and H2O, the plasmon-assisted surface mechanism is the major reaction channel generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). We believe that the present strategy based on the plasmonic effect would be a significant contribution to the design and preparation of efficient biocidal materials. This fundamental research is a precedent for the design and application of adequate technology to the next-generation of antiviral surfaces to combat SARS-CoV-2.","Assis, Marcelo; Simoes, Luiz Gustavo P; Tremiliosi, Guilherme C; Coelho, Dyovani; Minozzi, Daniel T; Santos, Renato I; Vilela, Daiane C B; Santos, Jeziel Rodrigues do; Ribeiro, Lara Kelly; Rosa, Ieda Lucia Viana; Mascaro, Lucia Helena; Andrés, Juan; Longo, Elson",,,78

450229,Identifying Therapeutic Compounds Targeting RNA-Dependent-RNA-Polymerase of Sars-Cov-2,2020,"Organic micropollutants enter rivers mainly with discharges of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems and water quality. A considerable knowledge gap exists for disentangling overlapping processes and driving conditions that control the fate of these pollutants. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the driving parameters for attenuation of selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, tramadol and venlafaxine) under field conditions. The presented study was performed at a small river (Ammer River, mean discharge 0.87 m3 s-1) which is hydrologically complex due to karstification, numerous artificial discharges, and engineered modifications of the channel. We applied a Lagrangian sampling scheme at two sequential river reaches. In general, for the investigated compounds and over the length of the tested reaches, the absolute net attenuation representative for 24 h was low (&#8804; 23% net attenuation), yet calculated half-lives were comparable to literature. Photodegradation is specifically relevant for the first river reach characterized by a higher net attenuation of the photosensitive compound diclofenac (14.5% ±11.3%) compared to the second section (9.8% ±13.7%). This is likely due to a spatial difference in canopy shading, which is supported by significant correlations (R2 &#8805; 0.8) of the temporally changing 'temperature' and 'solar radiation' with time-specific degradation rate constants of photosensitive compounds for consecutive hourly water parcels. In general, the presented spatially and temporally resolved approach is a suitable tool to determine the attenuation of organic micropollutants and to narrow down the interpretation of net attenuation to a few reasonable processes.","Glaser, Clarissa; Zarfl, Christiane; Werneburg, Martina; Böckmann, Matthias; Zwiener, Christian; Schwientek, Marc",Sci Total Environ,,78

456211,Promising inhibitors of main protease of novel corona virus to prevent the spread of COVID-19 using docking and molecular dynamics simulation,2020,"COVID-19 originally known as Corona VIrus Disease of 2019, has been declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. Unprecedented pressures have mounted on each country to make compelling requisites for controlling the population by assessing the cases and properly utilizing available resources. The rapid number of exponential cases globally has become the apprehension of panic, fear and anxiety among people. The mental and physical health of the global population is found to be directly proportional to this pandemic disease. The current situation has reported more than twenty four million people being tested positive worldwide as of 27th August, 2020 Therefore, it's the need of the hour to implement different measures to safeguard the countries by demystifying the pertinent facts and information. This paper aims to bring out the fact that tweets containing all handles related to COVID-19 and WHO have been unsuccessful in guiding people around this pandemic outbreak appositely. This study analyses two types of tweets gathered during the pandemic times. In one case, around twenty three thousand most re-tweeted tweets within the time span from1st Jan 2019 to 23rd March 2020 have been analysed and observation says that the maximum number of the tweets portrays neutral or negative sentiments. On the other hand, a dataset containing 226668 tweets collected within the time span between December 2019 and May 2020 have been analysed which contrastingly show that there were a maximum number of positive and neutral tweets tweeted by netizens. The research demonstrates that though people have tweeted mostly positive regarding COVID-19, yet netizens were busy engrossed in re-tweeting the negative tweets and that no useful words could be found in WordCloud or computations using word frequency in tweets. The claims have been validated through a proposed model using deep learning classifiers with admissible accuracy up to 81%. Apart from these the authors have proposed the implementation of a Gaussian membership function based fuzzy rule base to correctly identify sentiments from tweets. The accuracy for the said model yields up to a permissible rate of 79%.","Chakraborty, Koyel; Bhatia, Surbhi; Bhattacharyya, Siddhartha; Platos, Jan; Bag, Rajib; Hassanien, Aboul Ella",Appl Soft Comput,,78

458057,Rutin: A Potential Antiviral for Repurposing as a SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro) Inhibitor,2021,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) in the environment have been an increasing concern. Most recently, GCs have been shown to be an effective remedy to manage septic shock in patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, a self-made dielectric barrier discharge reactor integrating microbubbles and peroxymonosulfate (DBD/MB/PMS) was used to degrade the GCs in water. At neutral pH and ambient temperature, hydrocortisone (HC), betamethasone (BT) and fluocinolone acetonide (FA) were degraded effectively by the DBD/MB/PMS system with the 90-min degradation efficiencies of 77%, 80% and 82%, respectively (discharge power: 83.5 W;PMS:GC ratio: 20:1). In comparison, the 90-min degradation efficiencies for HC, BT and FA by DBD/MB system (discharge power: 83.5 W, pH unadjusted, flow rate 40 mg/L) were only 49%, 54% and 60% respectively;and the efficiencies by heat activated PMS (90 °C) were only 24%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. Hence, DBD/MB is an efficient approach for PMS activation, which resulted in increased removal efficiencies and energy yields for GCs degradation. The rate constants for GCs degradation also increased with the increase of PMS dosage and initial solution pH. Both SO4− and OH were prominent species for GCs degradation. Based on the results of scavenging experiment, the contributions of SO4− for HC, BT and FA degradation were roughly estimated to be 51%, 59% and 60%, respectively, and the contributions of OH were 30%, 29% and 27%, respectively. This work not only provides a novel approach in dealing with GCs contaminated water, but also highlights the synergistic effect of plasma, MB and PMS.","Miruka, Andere Clement Zhang Ai Wang Qiancheng Zhu Dahai Wang Zheng Sun Zhuyu Héroux Paul Liu Yanan",Journal of Water Process Engineering,,78

The secondary objective was to identify explanatory factors associated with outcome of critical illness defined by a composite index of in-hospital mortality and organ system support requirement. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-eight PICUs within the Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study registry from March 2020 to January 2021. PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related illness with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 394 patients, 171 (43.4%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were more likely younger (2-12 yr vs adolescents; p < 0.01), Black (35.6% vs 21.9%; p < 0.01), present with fever/abdominal pain than cough/dyspnea (p < 0.01), and less likely to have comorbidities (33.3% vs 61.9%; p < 0.01) compared with those without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Inflammatory marker levels, use of inotropes/vasopressors, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants were higher in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients (p < 0.01). Overall mortality was 3.8% (15/394), with no difference in the two groups. Diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was associated with longer duration of hospitalization as compared to nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (7.5 d[interquartile range, 5-11] vs 5.3 d [interquartile range, 3-11 d]; p < 0.01). Critical illness occurred in 164 patients (41.6%) and was more common in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children compared with those without (55.6% vs 30.9%; p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis failed to show an association between critical illness and age, race, sex, greater than or equal to three signs and symptoms, or greater than or equal to two comorbidities among the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children cohort. Among nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients, the presence of greater than or equal to two comorbidities was associated with greater odds of critical illness (odds ratio 2.95 [95% CI, 1.61-5.40]; p < 0.01).

In the set of preventive measures taken to reduce this contagion, a fundamental role in personal protection is played by equipment suitable for preventing the contaminated air inhalation. Despite this severe biological risk during the first epidemic phase, some institutional operating protocols and recommendations have shown limitations and contradictions and, therefore, they must not be repeated. It was observed a widespread inadequate use of respiratory protections, such as surgical masks, which show a low efficacy for health workers; adequate respiratory protective devices are instead rarely used, while their use should have been guaranteed more extensively than it is recommended and noticed, according to the current work hygiene legislation.","Barbieri, Pietro Gino",Epidemiol Prev,,78

491872,Structure-based lead optimization of herbal medicine rutin for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2's main protease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although an increasing body of data reports the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air, this does not correlate to the presence of infectious viruses, thus not evaluating the risk for airborne COVID-19. Hence there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. Therefore, in this systematic review, viability/stability of airborne SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses is discussed. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus to assess the stability and viability of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on air samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The initial search identified 27 articles. Following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates, 11 articles were considered relevant. Temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 25 °C and relative humidity ranging from 40% to 50% were reported to have a protective effect on viral viability for airborne SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As no data is yet available on the conditions influencing viability for airborne SARS-CoV-2, and given the genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, one could extrapolate that the same conditions would apply. Nonetheless, the effect of these conditions seems to be residual considering the increasing number of cases in the south of USA, Brazil and India, where high temperatures and humidities have been observed. CONCLUSION: Higher temperatures and high relative humidity can have a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viability in the environment, as reported in previous studies to this date. However, these studies are experimental, and do not support the fact that the virus has efficiently spread in the tropical regions of the globe, with other transmission routes such as the contact and droplet ones probably being responsible for the majority of cases reported in these regions, along with other factors such as human mobility patterns and contact rates. Further studies are needed to investigate the extent of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as this would have important implications for public health and infection-control policies.","da Silva, Priscilla Gomes; Nascimento, Maria São José; Soares, Ruben R G; Sousa, Sofia I V; Mesquita, João R",Sci Total Environ,,78

494447,"Synthesis, structural, spectral, antioxidant, bioactivity and molecular docking investigations of a novel triazole derivative",2021,"Objective: Patients affected by novel pandemic SARS-CoV-2 may develop COVID-19 related pneumonia, which is potentially fatal. To date, the role of ongoing treatments for different conditions (such as hypertension) has been clarified in terms of their impact on survival and there is no established specific therapy for the disease, although many molecules are under investigation. Aim of the present study was testing those two issues in a population of 258 consecutive patients admitted from 29 February to 30 April 2020 to General Medicine ward of the Hospital of Montichiari (Brixia). Design and method: A group of 258 patients (173 males and 85 females, aged 71 ± 14) was enrolled. Their medical record and ongoing treatment were assessed. Patients were treated according to emerging information with oxygen, anti-malarian agents, anti-viral drugs, different antibiotics (azithromycin and others), tocilizumab and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at different doses. As of June 10th, 65 deaths had been observed. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between groups was performed with Breslow and Mantel-Cox test Results: Ongoing therapy with ACE-inhibitors at the time of admission was associated with a worse prognosis (p=0.004), while no difference in survival was observed in patients under treatment with ARBs (p=0.68). Ongoing treatment with statins (p&lt;0.001), low-dose aspirin (p&lt;0.001) and steroids (p&lt;0.001) was associated with a poorer outcome as well Administration during hospitalization of LMWH (p&lt;0.001), steroids (p&lt;0.001), anti-viral drugs (p=0.002), anti-malarian drugs (p&lt;0.001) and tocilizumab (p&lt;0.001), improved prognosis, while antibiotics (azithromycin and other) didn't have any impact. Conclusions: our experience confirms most findings in ongoing trials. Surprisingly, treatment with ACE-inhibitors seems to impact negatively on survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. A possible explanation may be that patients treated with certain drugs are more comorbid and due to this, more fragile.","Bianco, G.; Boari, G. E. M.; Bonetti, S.; Chiarini, G.; Orlandini, F.

496623,A bioinformatic approach to identify core genome difference between Salmonella Pullorum and Salmonella Enteritidis In silico screening of natural compounds against COVID-19 by targeting Mpro and ACE2 using molecular docking,2020,"Exanthematous diseases are frequently of infectious origin, posing risks, especially for pregnant healthcare workers (HCWs) who treat them. The shift from cell-mediated (Th1 cytokine profile) to humoral (Th2 cytokine profile) immunity during pregnancy can influence the mother's susceptibility to infection and lead to complications for both mother and fetus. The potential for vertical transmission must be considered when evaluating the risks for pregnant HCWs treating infected patients, as fetal infection can often have devastating consequences. Given the high proportion of women of childbearing age among HCWs, the pregnancy-related risks of infectious exposure are an important topic in both patient care and occupational health. Contagious patients with cutaneous manifestations often present to dermatology or pediatric clinics, where female providers are particularly prevalent, as a growing number of these physicians are female. Unfortunately, the risks of infection for pregnant HCWs are not well defined. To our knowledge, there is limited guidance on safe practices for pregnant HCWs who encounter infectious dermatologic diseases. In this article, we review several infectious exanthems, their transmissibility to pregnant women, the likelihood of vertical transmission, and the potential consequences of infection for the mother and the fetus. Additionally, we discuss recommendations with respect to avoidance, contact and respiratory precautions, and the need for treatment following exposure.","Reddy, Vidhatha; Kollhoff, Alexander L; Murase, Jenny E; Martires, Kathryn",,,78

It is caused by a new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is imperative for relapsing current antiviral therapeutics owing to randomized genetic drift in global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A molecular mechanism behind the emerging genomic variants is not yet understood for the prioritization of selective antivirals. The present computational study was aimed to repurpose existing antivirals for Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by uncovering a hijack mechanism based on structural and functional characteristics of protein variants. Forty-one protein mutations were identified in 12 Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by analysis of genome variations across 460 genome sequences obtained from 30 geographic sites in India. Two unique mutations such as W6152R and N5928H found in exonuclease of Surat (GBRC275b) and Gandhinagar (GBRC239) isolates. We report for the first time the impact of folding rate on stabilizing/retaining a sequence-structure-function-virulence link of emerging protein variants leading to accommodate hijack ability from current antivirals. Binding affinity analysis revealed the effect of point mutations on virus infectivity and the drug-escaping efficiency of Indian isolates. Emodin and artinemol suggested herein as repurposable antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients infected with Indian isolates. Our study concludes that a protein folding rate is a key structural and evolutionary determinant to enhance the receptor-binding specificity and ensure hijack ability from the prevalent antiviral therapeutics.,"Prathiviraj, R; Saranya, S; Bharathi, M; Chellapandi, P",Comput Biol Med,,78

However, resource and personnel limitations during pandemics complicate the implementation of lung-protective protocols. Automated ventilation modes may prove decisive in these settings enabling higher degrees of lung-protective ventilation than conventional modes. METHOD: Prospective study at a Swiss university hospital. Critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients were allocated, by study-blinded coordinating staff, to either closed-loop or conventional mechanical ventilation, based on mechanical ventilator availability. Primary outcome was the overall achieved percentage of lung-protective ventilation in closed-loop versus conventional mechanical ventilation, assessed minute-by-minute, during the initial 7 days and overall mechanical ventilation time. Lung-protective ventilation was defined as the combined target of tidal volume <8 ml per kg of ideal body weight, dynamic driving pressure <15 cmH2O, peak pressure <30 cmH2O, peripheral oxygen saturation &#8805;88% and dynamic mechanical power <17 J/min. RESULTS: Forty COVID-19 ARDS patients, accounting for 1,048,630 minutes (728 days) of cumulative mechanical ventilation, allocated to either closed-loop (n = 23) or conventional ventilation (n = 17), presenting with a median paO2/ FiO2 ratio of 92 [72-147] mmHg and a static compliance of 18 [11-25] ml/cmH2O, were mechanically ventilated for 11 [4-25] days and had a 28-day mortality rate of 20%. During the initial 7 days of mechanical ventilation, patients in the closed-loop group were ventilated lung-protectively for 65% of the time versus 38% in the conventional group (Odds Ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.76-1.82; P < 0.001) and for 45% versus 33% of overall mechanical ventilation time (Odds Ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.21-1.23; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients during an early highpoint of the pandemic, mechanical ventilation using a closed-loop mode was associated with a higher degree of lung-protective ventilation than was conventional mechanical ventilation.","Wendel Garcia, Pedro David; Hofmaenner, Daniel Andrea; Brugger, Silvio D; Acevedo, Claudio T; Bartussek, Jan; Camen, Giovanni; Bader, Patrick Raphael; Bruellmann, Gregor; Kattner, Johannes; Ganter, Christoph; Schuepbach, Reto Andreas; Buehler, Philipp Karl",J Intensive Care Med,,78
514224,"Exploring the potential of novel phenolic compounds as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2, using quantum chemistry, molecular docking and dynamic studies",2021,"Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. It is responsible for the deaths of millions of people and has caused global economic and social disruption. The numbers of COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially across the world. Control of this pandemic disease is challenging because there is no effective drug or vaccine available against this virus and this situation demands an urgent need for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential medicines. In this regard, the main protease (Mpro) has emerged as an essential drug target as it plays a vital role in virus replication and transcription. In this research, we have identified two novel potent inhibitors of the Mpro (PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619) from PubChem database by pharmacophore-based high-throughput virtual screening. The molecular docking, toxicity, and pharmacophore analysis indicate that these compounds may act as potential anti-viral candidates. The molecular dynamic simulation along with the binding free energy calculation by MMPBSA showed that these compounds bind to Mpro enzyme with high stability over 50 ns. Our results showed that two compounds: PubChem3408741 and PubChem4167619 had the binding free energy of - 94.02 kJ mol-1 and - 122.75 kJ mol-1, respectively, as compared to reference X77 (- 76.48 kJ mol-1). Based on our work's findings, we propose that these compounds can be considered as lead molecules for targeting Mpro enzyme and they can be potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. These inhibitors could be tested in vitro and explored for effective drug development against COVID-19.","Pundir, Hemlata; Joshi, Tanuja; Joshi, Tushar; Sharma, Priyanka; Mathpal, Shalini; Chandra, Subhash; Tamta, Sushma",Mol. divers,,78

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of demand and occupancy data provided by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine accredited EDs in voluntary surveys at the start of June and September 2017-2020. Hospitals answering all surveys were grouped and compared by jurisdiction and role delineation. RESULTS: A total of 121 EDs were eligible, 63% supplied complete occupancy data and 53% complete demand data. Between the June 2017 and 2019 surveys, mean daily ED presentations increased by 11.4% (P = 0.0003). The number being treated at 10.00 hours rose by 27.7% (P < 0.0001) and those experiencing access block (waiting for an inpatient bed, been in ED more than 8 h) rose by 46.1% (P = 0.001). Between the June 2019 and 2020 surveys, ED presentations fell by an average of 12.6% (P < 0.0001), ward admissions were almost unchanged (-6.0%, P = NS), and patients who did not wait to be seen fell by 57.8% (P < 0.0001). Major Paediatric Referral hospitals reported a 28% decrease in presentations.

Tocilizumab has been recently added to the treatment guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data remain conflicting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane central were searched from March 1, 2020, until March 10, 2021, for randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. RESULTS: Nine studies (with 6490 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3358 patients received tocilizumab, and 3132 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, p = 0.02) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.89, p < 0.0001) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo. In addition, there was a trend towards improved median time to hospital discharge (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12-1.45, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab therapy improves outcomes of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection compared with standard therapy or placebo. Our findings suggest the efficacy of tocilizumab therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and strengthen the concept that tocilizumab is a promising therapeutic intervention to improve mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients.","Selvaraj, Vijairam; Khan, Mohammad Saud; Bavishi, Chirag; Dapaah-Afriyie, Kwame; Finn, Arkadiy; Lal, Amos; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Lung,,78

However, risk factors associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 among close contacts have not been well described. A total of 106 household contacts were included in this study, of whom 19 developed into COVID-19 cases, and the secondary attack rate was 17.9%. Multivariable analysis showed that increasing risk of occurrence of COVID-19 among household contacts was associated with female index patients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 3.84, 95% CI = 1.07-13.78), critical disease index patients (aHR = 7.58, 95% CI = 1.66-34.66), effective contact duration with index patients > 2 days (aHR = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.29-13.73), and effective contact duration > 11 days (aHR = 17.88, 95% CI = 3.26-98.01). The sex and disease severity of index patients with COVID-19 and longer effective contact duration with patients with confirmed COVID-19 could help epidemiologists to identify potential COVID-19 cases among household contacts at an early stage.","Xin, Hualei; Jiang, Fachun; Xue, Aili; Liang, Jiwei; Zhang, Jingfei; Yang, Feng; Han, Yalin",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Here, a possibility of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with air pollution particulate matter (PM) was considered. It was shown in our recent studies that water-suspended plastic and wood smoke aerosol PM and carbon-containing nanoparticles from burning organics can interact with the plasma membrane of brain nerve terminals presumably due to their lipid components. COVID-19 patients have neurological symptoms, viral particles were found in the brain, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells via fusion of lipid viral envelope with the plasma membranes of infected cells, and so viral envelop can contain lipid components of the host neuronal membranes. Therefore, interaction of SARS-CoV-2 envelope with PM is possible in water surrounding. After drying, PM can serve as a carrier for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized at their surface. Moreover, PM and SARS-CoV-2 per se can enter human organism during nasal inhalation, and they both use the same nose-to-brain delivery pathways moving along axons directly to the brain, influencing the nervous system and exocytosis/endocytosis in nerve cells. Thus, PM can aggravate neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa, due to their identical nose-to-brain delivery mechanism and possible interference of neuronal effects. In addition, different types of PM because of their ability to interact with the plasma membranes of nerve cells can facilitate unspecific SARS-CoV-2 entrance to the cells, and can influence envelope features of SARS-CoV-2. Detailed studies are required to analyze interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with PM.","Borisova, Tatiana; Komisarenko, Serhiy",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051841/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11183-3,78

To address this health emergency, countries have organized the flow of production and innovation to reduce the impact on health. This article shows the response of the Brazilian scientific community to meet the urgent needs of the public unified health system [SUS], aiming to guarantee universal access to an estimated population of 211 million. By December 2020, Brazil had recorded more than six million cases and approximately 175,000 deaths. METHODS: We collected data on research, development and innovation projects carried out by 114 public universities (plus Oswaldo Cruz Foundation [Fiocruz] and Butantan Institute), as reported on their websites. Additionally, we examined the studies on COVID-19 approved by the National Comission for Research Ethics, as well as those reported on the Ministry of Education website as of May 15, 2020. RESULTS: The 789 identified projects were classified according to research categories as follows: development and innovation (n = 280), other types of projects (n = 226), epidemiologic research (n = 211), and basic research on disease mechanisms (n = 72). Most proposals focused on the development and innovation of personal protective equipment, medical devices, diagnostic tests, medicines and vaccines, which were rapidly identified as research priorities by the scientific community. Some promising results have been observed from phase III vaccine trials, one of which is conducted in partnership with Oxford University and another of which is performed with Sinovac Biotech. Both trials involve thousands of volunteers in their Brazilian arms and include technology transfer agreements with Fiocruz and the Butantan Institute, respectively. These vaccines proved to be safe and effective and were immediately licensed for emergency use. The provision of doses for the public health system, and vaccination, started on January 17, 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The mobilized Brazilian scientific community has generated comprehensive research, development and innovation proposals to meet the most urgent needs. It is important to emphasize that this response was only possible due to decades of investment in research, development and innovation in Brazil. We need to reinforce and protect the Brazilian science, technology and innovation system from austerity policies that disregard health and knowledge as crucial investments for Brazilian society, in line with the constitutional right of universal health access and universal health coverage.","Rosa, Mário Fabrício Fleury; da Silva, Everton Nunes; Pacheco, Christina; Diógenes, Marcos Vinícius Pereira; Millett, Christopher; Gadelha, Carlos Augusto Grabois; Santos, Leonor Maria Pacheco",Health Res Policy Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478499/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00674-x,78
591152,Pinpointing the potential hits for hindering interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein with ACE2 from the pool of antiviral phytochemicals utilizing molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,2021-02-22,"Clinical studies from WHO have demonstrated that only 50–70% of patients adhere properly to prescribed drug therapy. Such adherence failure can impact therapeutic efficacy for the patients in question and compromises data quality around the population-level efficacy of the drug for the indications targeted. In this study, we applied various ensemble learning and deep learning models to predict medication adherence among patients. Our contribution to this endeavour involves targeting the problem of adherence prediction for a particularly challenging class of patients who self-administer injectable medication at home. Our prediction pipeline, based on event history, comprises a connected sharps bin which aims to help patients better manage their condition and improve outcomes. In other words, the efficiency of interventions can be significantly improved by prioritizing the patients who are most likely to be non-adherent. The collected data comprising a rich event feature set may be exploited for the purposes of predicting the status of the next adherence state for individual patients. This paper reports on how this concept can be realized through an investigation using a wide range of ensemble learning and deep learning models on a real-world dataset collected from such a system. The dataset investigated comprises 342,174 historic injection disposal records collected over the course of more than 5 years. A comprehensive comparison of different models is given in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate that the selected best performer, long short-term memory (LSTM), generalizes well by deploying it in a true future testing dataset. The proposed end-to-end pipeline is capable of predicting patient failure in adhering to their therapeutic regimen with 77.35 % accuracy (Specificity: 78.28 %, Sensitivity: 76.42%, Precision: 77.87%,F1 score: 0.7714, ROC AUC: 0.8390).","Gu, Yingqi; Zalkikar, Akshay; Liu, Mingming; Kelly, Lara; Hall, Amy; Daly, Kieran; Ward, Tomas",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556746/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98387-w,78

Thus, early predictors of clinical outcome are highly needed. We investigated markers of neural tissue damage as a possible early sign of multisystem involvement to assess their clinical prognostic value on survival or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We collected blood from 104 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 the day of admission to the emergency room and measured blood neurofilament light chair (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and total tau protein levels. RESULTS: We found that NfL, GFAP, and tau were significantly increased in patients with fatal outcome, while NfL and UCH-L1 in those needing ICU transfer. ROC and Kaplan–Meier curves indicated that total tau levels at admission accurately predict mortality.

Hereby, we provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, investigating the incidence of ischemic CVA and the mortality due to it in the setting of COVID-19. METHODS: Our search databases included Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus. We searched the databases up to July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic CVA in Covid-19 cases, while the secondary outcomes were the ratio of mortality in these cases. Standard meta-analysis methods used to measure the pooled incidence and mortality rates of ischemic CVA in Covid-19 cases. RESULTS: After excluding studies with reasons, only 20 articles were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were evaluated quantitatively in our meta-analysis. Included studies reported a pooled average incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. Mortality in patients of ischemic CVA to all COVID-19 cases was 0.5%, ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%. The mortality rate of patients with stroke to those who suffered from COVID-19 infection and ischemic CVA simultaneously was 29.2% ranging from 21.6% to 38.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity of the studies was high. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a pooled incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 29.2% amongst the COVID-19 patients who are suffering ischemic CVA.","Parsay, Sina; Vosoughi, Armin; Khabbaz, Aytak; Sadigh-Eteghad, Saeed",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360509/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105552; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720309708; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720309708?v=s5,78
592860,Identification and genome characterization of a novel feline picornavirus proposed in the Hunnivirus genus,2019-03-19,"In an attempt to maintain elimination of COVID-19, the New Zealand government has closed the border to everyone except citizens and residents. All arrivals are required to spend 14 days in government-managed isolation/quarantine and to be tested for COVID-19 on day 3 and on day 12 of their stay. We model the testing, isolation and potential transmission of COVID-19 within managed isolation facilities to estimate the risk of undetected cases and the risk of infectious cases being released into the community. We use a stochastic individual-based that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result, complete isolation of confirmed and probable cases, and secondary transmission of COVID-19 between close contacts. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with day 3 and day 12 testing reduces risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increase this risk. It is important to avoid contacts between individuals staying in quarantine to minimise the risk of secondary transmission. We calculate the ratio of cases detected on day 3 to cases detected on day 12 in the model and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of secondary transmission occurring within quarantine. We do not explicitly model transmission of COVID-19 from individuals in quarantine to staff, but this is likely to present a significant risk. This needs to be minimised by strict infection control, use of personal protective equipment by staff at all times, and avoiding close contact between staff and hotel guests.","Steyn, N.; Binny, R.

A lack of self-determination and low confidence may make orphans make more risky decisions than their nonorphan counterparts. In this study, we aimed to see how this risky behavior was reflected in investment choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A well-structured questionnaire was distributed to 230 adult investors (130 orphans and 100 nonorphans) between January 22 and March 13, 2020. RESULTS: Orphans were found to be risk-takers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as hypothesized from their childhood history. Moreover, female investors showed more sensible (less risky) behavior than male investors when investing in fixed-income securities. Income and age showed significant inverse relationships with risk tolerance, while education showed a positive but insignificant effect. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that orphan investors enjoy taking risks and their behavior toward risk remains consistent, even in abnormal conditions, such as a global pandemic. It also suggests that their risk-taking behavior remains stable from orphanhood through to adulthood, contradicting many reports that orphans make reasonable decisions in adulthood.","Ahmad, Muhammad Ishfaq; Zhuang, Weiqing; Sattar, Anika",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922098/; https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s260541,78
594065,Genetic diversity of bat orthohepadnaviruses in China and a proposed new nomenclature,2018-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of pneumonia visualized on CT scan in the setting of a normal chest radiograph is uncertain. METHODS: In a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we compared the presenting clinical features, pathogens present, and outcomes of patients with pneumonia visualized on a CT scan but not on a concurrent chest radiograph (CT-only pneumonia) and those with pneumonia visualized on a chest radiograph. All patients underwent chest radiography; the decision to obtain CT imaging was determined by the treating clinicians. Chest radiographs and CT images were interpreted by study-dedicated thoracic radiologists blinded to the clinical data. RESULTS: The study population included 2,251 adults with CAP; 2,185 patients (97%) had pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, whereas 66 patients (3%) had pneumonia visualized on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiography. Overall, these patients with CT-only pneumonia had a clinical profile similar to those with pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, including comorbidities, vital signs, hospital length of stay, prevalence of viral (30% vs 26%) and bacterial (12% vs 14%) pathogens, ICU admission (23% vs 21%), use of mechanical ventilation (6% vs 5%), septic shock (5% vs 4%), and inhospital mortality (0 vs 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Adults hospitalized with CAP who had radiological evidence of pneumonia on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiograph had pathogens, disease severity, and outcomes similar to patients who had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. These findings support using the same management principles for patients with CT-only pneumonia and those with pneumonia seen on chest radiography.","Upchurch, Cameron P.; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Wunderink, Richard G.; Williams, Derek J.; Waterer, Grant W.; Anderson, Evan J.; Zhu, Yuwei; Hart, Eric M.; Carroll, Frank; Bramley, Anna M.; Jain, Seema; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Self, Wesley H.",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2017.07.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369217313922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369217313922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802696/,78

This has caused a huge medical burden. Severe COVID-19 patients can experience multi-organ damage, including cardiac injury, kidney injury, and liver injury. About 2.0%–4.9% of COVID-19 cases involve patients with preexisting liver diseases. Additionally, preexisting liver diseases were reported and associated with severity (odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) = 1.48–1.70) and mortality (OR or RR = 1.08–2.65) among COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of liver injury was 16%–29% in COVID-19 patients. Higher prevalence of liver injury may worsen prognosis in patients (severity: OR or RR = 1.9–2.6; mortality: OR or RR = 1.1–4.0). The mechanisms of this association between liver injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection are complex, including direct cholangiocyte damage induced by SARS-COV-2, cytokine storm, and drug-induced liver injury. In particular, drug-induced liver injury may be the most important reason. This review discusses the epidemiology of COVID-19 and liver dysfunction as well as potential mechanisms underlying the association between COVID-19 and liver dysfunction or other preexisting liver diseases.

Based upon data arising from S1 sequence and phylogenetic analyses, the three IBV isolates were genetically different from other known IBV types, which represented a novel genotype (GI-29). Virus cross-neutralization tests, using γCoV/ck/China/I0111/14 as a representative, showed that genotype GI-29 was antigenically different from all other known IBV types, thus representing a novel serotype. Complete genomic analysis showed that GI-29 type viruses were closely related to and might originate from a GX-YL5-like virus by accumulation of substitutions in multiple genes. These GI-29 viral genomes are still evolving and diverging, particularly in the 3′ region, although we cannot rule out the possibility of recombination events occurring. For isolate γCoV/ck/China/I0114/14, we found that recombination events had occurred between nsps 2 and 3 in gene 1 which led to the introduction of a 4/91 gene fragment into the γCoV/ck/China/I0114/14 viral genome.

As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, there is urgent need for a rapid, yet accurate antibody test to identify infected individuals in populations to inform health decisions. We have developed a rapid, accurate and cost-effective serologic test based on antibody-dependent agglutination of antigen-coated latex particles, which uses ~5 ul plasma and takes <5 min to complete with no instrument required. The simplicity of this test makes it ideal for point-of-care (POC) use at the community level. When validated using plasma samples that are positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, the agglutination assay detected antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S-RBD) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 100% specificity and ~98% sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that the strength of the S-RBD antibody response measured by the agglutination assay correlated with the efficiency of the plasma in blocking RBD binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a surrogate neutralization assay, suggesting that the agglutination assay may be used to identify individuals with virus-neutralizing antibodies. Intriguingly, we found that >92% of patients had detectable antibodies on the day of positive viral RNA test, suggesting that seroconversion may occur earlier than previously thought and that the agglutination antibody test may complement RNA testing for POC diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, S.

However, less is written about Australian tertiary learners’ experiences of engaging with cultural competency training. The aim of this study is to explore tertiary students’ willingness or resistance to cultural competency and safety pedagogy. Qualitative student feedback to a teaching unit was collected and triangulated with data from focus groups with tutors. Results were thematically analyzed. Willingness and resistance to cultural competency and safety teaching emerged as two key themes. Willingness to engage with the unit was largely due to student interest in the content, teaching environment and relevance of cultural competency to students’ future practice. Resistance was linked to the students feeling personally attacked, or culturally confronted, with tutors noting the topics around sexuality and white privilege being more resisted. Acknowledging reasons for student resistance and developing strategies to reduce resistance can facilitate more student engagement with cultural competency topics, ultimately leading to their future provision of culturally competent healthcare.","Micheal, Sowbhagya; Ogbeide, Anita Eseosa; Arora, Amit; Alford, Stewart; Firdaus, Rubab; Lim, David; Dune, Tinashe",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501772/,78

It is viewed as a new tool that overcomes the limitation of DNA microarrays. On the basis of its application, protein microarrays fall into two major classes: analytical and functional protein microarrays. In addition, tissue or cell lysates can also be directly spotted on a slide to form the so-called “reverse-phase” protein microarray. In the last decade, applications of functional protein microarrays in particular have flourished in studying protein function and construction of networks and pathways. In this chapter, we will review the recent advancements in the protein microarray technology, followed by presenting a series of examples to illustrate the power and versatility of protein microarrays in both basic and clinical research. As a powerful technology platform, it would not be surprising if protein microarrays will become one of the leading technologies in proteomic and diagnostic fields in the next decade.","Zhu, Heng; Qian, Jiang",Advances in Genetics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123943958000049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123943958000049; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-394395-8.00004-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22989767/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3790149?pdf=render,78

In order to cope and adapt, individuals and organisations will need to work together, now more than ever. One approach that may be beneficial in these times, and beyond, is collaborative leadership. This is where a mutually beneficial relationship is established between two or more parties, who work towards common goals by sharing authority, responsibility and accountability for achieving results. When groups of individuals look beyond their personal interests and instead collaborate, they may channel their efforts to successfully achieve shared goals. However, for this to be fruitful, stakeholders (to include different individuals or groups that have a vested interest) will need to be identified and engaged, and ethical values based on the objectives of the organisation and those advocated by professional and regulatory bodies must be upheld.

RESULTS: We first propose a convolutional neural network model for automated laryngeal mass detection based on diagnostic images captured at hospitals. Thereafter, we propose a pilot system, composed of an embedded controller, a camera module, and an LCD display, that can be utilized for a home-based self-screening test. In terms of evaluating the model’s performance, the experimental results indicated a final validation loss of 0.9152 and a F1-score of 0.8371 before post-processing. Additionally, the F1-score of the original computer algorithm with respect to 100 randomly selected color-printed test images was 0.8534 after post-processing while that of the embedded pilot system was 0.7672.

Early detection of severe patients with COVID-19 is of great significance to shorten the disease course and reduce mortality. Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of 80 patients (including 56 mild and 24 severe) with COVID-19 infection treated at Beijing You'an Hospital. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to select the risk factors of severe and even fetal pneumonia and build scoring system for prediction, which was validated later on in a group of 22 COVID-19 patients. Results: Age, white blood cell count, neutrophil, glomerular filtration rate, and myoglobin were selected by multivariate analysis as candidates of scoring system for prediction of disease severity in COVID-19. The scoring system was applied to calculate the predictive value and found that the percentage of ICU admission (20%, 6/30) and ventilation (16.7%, 5/30) in patients with high risk was much higher than those (2%, 1/50; 2%, 1/50) in patients with low risk (p = 0.009; p = 0.026). The AUC of scoring system was 0.906, sensitivity of prediction is 70.8%, and the specificity is 89.3%. According to scoring system, the probability of patients in high risk group developing severe disease was 20.24 times than that in low risk group.

However, so far, developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) detection kits or vaccines has remained elusive. In this regard, the development of antiviral nanomaterials by surface engineering with enhanced specificity might prove valuable to combat this novel virus.

Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients’ ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.","Mueller, Amber L.; McNamara, Maeve S.; Sinclair, David A.",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470948/,78

IGD and PIU may be exacerbated by lifestyle changes imposed by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study investigated changes in IGD and PIU during the pandemic and risk factors for them. This study is a part of a larger online study on problematic smartphone use in Japan, originally planned in 2019, and expanded in August 2020 to include the impact of COVID-19. 51,246 adults completed an online survey during the pandemic (August 2020), in Japan. Of these, 3,938 had also completed the survey before the onset of the pandemic (December, 2019) and were used as the study population to determine how the pandemic has influenced IGD and PIU. IGD was assessed using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS). PIU was measured using the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS). The prevalence of probable IGD during COVID-19 was 4.1% [95%CI, 3.9% to 4.2%] overall (N=51,246), and 8.6% among younger people (age < 30), higher than reported before the pandemic (1 - 2.5%). Probable PIU was 7.8% [95%CI, 7.6% to 8.1%] overall, and 17.0% [95%CI, 15.9% to 18.2%] among younger people, also higher than reported before the pandemic (3.2 - 3.7%). Comparisons before and during the pandemic, revealed that probable IGD prevalence has increased 1.6 times, and probable PIU prevalence by 1.5 times (IGD: t3937 = 5.93, p < .001, PIU: t3937 = 6.95, p < .001).

The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.","Jain, Neha; Shankar, Uma; Majee, Prativa; Kumar, Amit",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.009209,78

The organism and its toxins (TcdA and TcdB), respectively, were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves. Culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive. However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture.

Therefore, an immunosuppressive effect of in utero infection has been suggested. The aim of the present study was to characterise the changes of leukocyte populations in piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. A total of 27 liveborn uninfected control piglets and 22 piglets infected transplacentally with a Danish strain of PRRSV were included. At 2 and 4 weeks of age, 21 of 22 (96%) and 7 of 14 (50%) examined infected piglets were still viremic, whereas PRRSV could not be detected in the six infected piglets examined at 6 weeks of age. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the phenotypic composition of leukocytes in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 2-, 4- and 6-week-old infected piglets and age-matched uninfected controls. The key observation in the present study is that high levels of CD8(+) cells constitute a dominant feature in peripheral blood and BALF of piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. In BALF, the average high level of CD8(+) cells in 2-week-old infected piglets (33.4±12.6%) was followed by a decline to 7.3±3.0 and 11.1±3.0% at 4 and 6 weeks of age. BALF of control piglets contained 1.6±0.9, 2.3±1.8 and 1.9±0.5% CD8(+) cells, only. In peripheral blood, however, the average number of CD8(+) cells remained at high levels in the infected piglets throughout the post-natal experimental period (2.8±1.9, 2.9±1.8 and 3.2±1.7×10(6) CD8(+) cells/ml at 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively). In the controls, the average levels of CD8(+) cells were 0.9±0.2, 1.9±1.7 and 1.6±0.5×10(6)/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of CD2(+), CD4(+)CD8(+) and SLA-classII(+) cells, respectively, in peripheral blood, together with the levels of CD2(+) and CD3(+) cells in BALF were increased in the infected piglets infected in utero compared to the uninfected controls. The kinetic analyses carried out in the present study reflect that in utero infection with PRRSV modulates immune cell populations in peripheral blood and BALF of surviving piglets. The observed changes are characterised by high levels of CD8(+) cells supporting an important role of these cells in PRRSV infection. The present results, however, do not support the existence of post-natal immunosuppression following in utero infection with PRRSV.","Nielsen, J; Bøtner, A; Tingstedt, J.-E; Aasted, B; Johnsen, C.K; Riber, U; Lind, P",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12814699/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242703000680; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242703000680,78

Through a systematic political and socio-economic analysis, it identifies seven major drivers for China's success, including (1) the SARS outbreak as a wake-up call, (2) strong public support for government intervention in health care, (3) renewed political commitment from top leaders, (4) heavy government subsidies, (5) fiscal capacity backed by China's economic power, (6) financial and political responsibilities delegated to local governments and (7) programmatic implementation strategy. Three of the factors seem to be unique to China (i.e., the SARS outbreak, the delegation, and the programmatic strategy.) while the other factors are commonly found in other countries’ insurance expansion experiences. This study also discusses challenges and recommendations for China's health financing, such as reducing financial risk as an immediate task, equalizing benefit across insurance programs as a long-term goal, improving quality by tying provider payment to performance, and controlling costs through coordinated reform initiatives.

Metal ions embedded into PPE may inactivate respiratory viruses, but confounding factors such as adsorption of viruses make measuring and optimizing the inactivation characteristics difficult. Here, we used polyamide 6.6 (PA66) fibers containing embedded zinc ions and systematically investigated if these fibers can adsorb and inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and IAV H1N1 when woven into a fabric. We found that our PA66-based fabric decreased the IAV H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 titer by approximately 100-fold. Moreover, we found that the zinc content and the virus inactivating property of the fabric remained stable over 50 standardized washes. Overall, these results provide insights into the development of reusable PPE that offer protection against RNA virus spread.","Gopal, Vikram; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; French, Hollie; Siegers, Jurre Y.; Yung, Wai-shing; Hardwick, Matthew; te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

Neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection will be recruited. The data to be collected via case report forms include demographic details, clinical features, laboratory and imaging results, as well as outcomes. Primary outcomes are the mortality of neonates with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Secondary outcomes are the birth weight, premature delivery and neurological development of neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The neurological development is assessed by the Chinese standardised Denver Developmental Screening Test at the corrected age of 6 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Children's Hospital of Fudan University ethics committee (No. (2020)31). The study findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences in order to improve the understanding of the clinical course among neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and to provide evidence-based treatment and prevention strategies for this group.

METHODS: review was based on articles published in 2020 in the PubMed, Medline, Scopus, SciELO and Cochrane databases. SUMMARY: Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome is a serious clinical disorder that affects children and adolescents and is associated with the detection of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. It is characterized by the installation of a shock picture, with a significant increase in inflammatory markers such as presentations of Kawasaki Disease or shock syndrome related to Kawasaki Disease, or even toxic shock syndrome, with the clinical picture being characterized by fever of difficult control, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, generalized pain in the extremities and gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, it is necessary to consider that some have a hyperinflammatory response. It is essential that health professionals receive information that can assist in the recognition of this clinical condition, differentiating it from other diagnoses, so that early and appropriate treatment is instituted.","Nogueira-de-Almeida, Carlos Alberto; Ciampo, Luiz Antonio Del; Ferraz, Ivan Savioli; Ciampo, Ieda Regina Lopes Del; Contini, Andrea Aparecida; Ued, Fábio da Veiga",Rev.

Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre–COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. RESULTS: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post–COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Katharine; Ostinelli, Edoardo; Macdonald, Orla; Cipriani, Andrea",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658857/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21108,78

One of the interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options. This study will contribute to paving the way towards the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially for the immunocompromised individuals.","Jee Han, Hyun; Nwagwu, Chinekwu; Anyim, Obumneme; Ekweremadu, Chinedu; Kim, San",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920337140?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107247; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920337140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307513/,78

IL-4 stimulation of STAT6 phosphorylation was blocked by IL-2, while IL-2 and IL-4 synergized to enhance STAT5 phosphorylation, IL-10 production, and the selective proliferation of IL-10-producing Tregs, leading to increased inhibition of conventional T cell activation and the reversal of asthma and multiple sclerosis in mice.

Générée par le nouveau coronavirus SARS-CoV2, elle est nommée COVID-19 pour COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. Rapidement, la diffusion de cette maladie inconnue a un retentissement planétaire : la contagiosité du virus est extrêmement importante et les suites sont potentiellement mortelles. En France, la population réagit initialement avec incrédulité, jusqu’à ce que la maladie atteigne l’Europe et que les premiers cas apparaissent sur le territoire français fin janvier 2020. Quelques semaines plus tard, le 16 mars 2020, le Président Macron déclare le pays « en guerre » contre le Covid-19. Le lendemain, la population est placée en confinement. L’activité du pays est à l’arrêt. Les écoles, les entreprises, les commerces, sont fermés. Les Français sont sidérés. Ils doivent soudainement affronter la peur : celle qu’eux ou leurs proches puissent tomber malades, celle de l’enfermement et de la restriction de libertés, celle de la précarité économique. Et surtout celle de l’inconnu. Afin de prévenir les conséquences désastreuses du séisme, des cellules d’écoute et de soutien psychologiques sont créées dans l’urgence, à l’échelon national. Elles sont destinées à soutenir le corps soignant, les malades et plus largement la population générale. Celle dédiée au département de la Gironde s’organise en quelques heures, sur le week-end du 21 mars 2020. La plateforme d’écoute COVIDPSY33 est ainsi mise en place à Bordeaux, par le Centre Hospitalier Charles Perrens, avec le soutien de l’Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). La cellule PSYCOVID-19 est créée de manière concomitante. Cette cellule de soutien d’aval travaille en collaboration avec la plateforme COVIDPSY33 et propose une aide psychologique à la population générale et aux soignants du secteur Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d’Arcins et Sud Gironde. Elle couvre ainsi un territoire équivalent à environ la moitié du plus vaste département de France métropolitaine, la Gironde. Dans cet entretien, Samantha Al Joboory et Florence Monello, psychiatre et psychologue coordinatrices de PSYCOD-19, présentent ce dispositif de soutien psychologique. Abstract In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country ""at war"" against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population.The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the AgenceRégionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d’Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France. In the present interview, Samantha Al Joboory and Florence Monello, psychiatrist and psychologist coordinating PSYCOD-19, present this psychological support unit.","Joboory, Samantha Al; Monello, Florence; Bouchard, Jean-Pierre",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720301918?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836306/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720301918,78
618081,Susceptibility of human and rat neural cell lines to infection by SARS-coronavirus,2005-08-19,"BACKGROUND: The province of Ontario, Canada, has instituted indefinite school closures (SC) as well as other social distancing measures to mitigate the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We sought to evaluate the effect of SC on reducing attack rate and the need for critical care during COVID-19 outbreaks, while considering scenarios with concurrent implementation of self-isolation (SI) of symptomatic cases. METHODS: We developed an age-structured agent-based simulation model and parameterized it with the demographics of Ontario stratified by age and the latest estimates of COVID-19 epidemiologic characteristics. Disease transmission was simulated within and between different age groups by considering inter- and intra-group contact patterns. The effect of SC of varying durations on the overall attack rate, magnitude and peak time of the outbreak, and requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the population was estimated. Secondly, the effect of concurrent community-based voluntary SI of symptomatic COVID-19 cases was assessed. RESULTS: SC reduced attack rates in the range of 7.2–12.7% when the duration of SC increased from 3 to 16 weeks, when contacts among school children were restricted by 60–80%, and in the absence of SI by mildly symptomatic persons. Depending on the scenario, the overall reduction in ICU admissions attributed to SC throughout the outbreak ranged from 3.3 to 6.7%. When SI of mildly symptomatic persons was included and practiced by 20%, the reduction of attack rate and ICU admissions exceeded 6.3% and 9.1% (on average), respectively, in the corresponding scenarios. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that SC may have limited impact on reducing the burden of COVID-19 without measures to interrupt the chain of transmission during both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. While highlighting the importance of SI, our findings indicate the need for better understanding of the epidemiologic characteristics of emerging diseases on the effectiveness of social distancing measures.","Abdollahi, Elaheh; Haworth-Brockman, Margaret; Keynan, Yoav; Langley, Joanne M.; Moghadas, Seyed M.",BMC Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01705-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709232/,78

This is reflected in trade flows but also affects the conditions for conducting dispersed production functions across countries. This “new normal” period presents the need to examine the main problems/challenges in international trade and business. PURPOSE: The article aims to establish the scope, aspects and implications of the COVID‐19 pandemic on international trade and on international production by reviewing recent articles which deal with international trade and global value chain (GVC) issues, changes that were already taking place and the challenges that began in 2020. METHODS AND APPROACH: The findings of recent articles on trade flows and changes in GVCs (mainly the period 2019–2021) are described in theoretical terms, compared and systematically reviewed. Special focus is given to the impact of the pandemic on GVCs, re‐nationalization and GVCs and the impact of the pandemic on GVC governance, and GVCs in the production of vaccines for the COVID‐19 virus. FINDINGS: Trade recorded a drop in 2020, accompanied with the introduction of protective trade policy measures. Reduced GVC activities had a negative impact on welfare and the “re‐nationalization” of GVC‐related activities is not a real solution. For the development of GVCs it is important to find a trade‐off between efficiency and resilience, starting with re‐organization (re‐engineering) of GVCs, and probably focusing on regional frameworks. Liberal trade policies are essential to ensure the involvement of GVCs in producing the COVID‐19 vaccines since the various inputs are produced in different countries. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The possible directions for the future development of GVCs are elaborated: re‐shoring, resilience in supply chains, adjustments in governance, diversification and development of risk‐management strategies. The process of internationalization is not in question, but presents challenges which create the need for adjustments in its future development. Current problems with vaccine production arise in part from imposed trade barriers and rising nationalism. There is a need for greater cross‐country co‐operation to avoid placing national short‐term interests before long‐term and broader objectives.","Kersan‐Škabić, Ines",Dev Policy Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/dpr.12560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219988/,78
618705,Exercise-induced immune system response: Anti-inflammatory status on peripheral and central organs,2020-04-29,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has spurred concern about what interventions may be effective at reducing transmission. The city and county of San Francisco imposed a shelter-in-place order in March 2020, followed by use of a contact tracing program and a policy requiring use of cloth face masks. We used statistical estimation and simulation to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions in San Francisco. We estimated that self-isolation and other practices beginning at the time of San Francisco’s shelter-in-place order reduced the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 by 35.4% (95% CI, −20.1%–81.4%). We estimated the effect of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number to be a reduction of approximately 44% times the fraction of cases that are detected, which may be modest if the detection rate is low. We estimated the impact of cloth mask adoption on reproduction number to be approximately 8.6%, and note that the benefit of mask adoption may be substantially greater for essential workers and other vulnerable populations, residents return to circulating outside the home more often. We estimated the effect of those interventions on incidence by simulating counterfactual scenarios in which contact tracing was not adopted, cloth masks were not adopted, and neither contact tracing nor cloth masks was adopted, and found increases in case counts that were modest, but relatively larger than the effects on reproduction numbers. These estimates and model results suggest that testing coverage and timing of testing and contact tracing may be important, and that modest effects on reproduction numbers can nonetheless cause substantial effects on case counts over time.","Worden, Lee; Wannier, Rae; Blumberg, Seth; Ge, Alex Y.; Rutherford, George W.; Porco, Travis C.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20125831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577672/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.09.20125831v1?rss=1,78

Here, we describe a novel aspect of coronaviral infection, whereby the master transcriptional regulator of lysosome biogenesis – TFEB – is targeted for proteasomal-mediated degradation upon viral infection. Through mass spectrometry analysis and an unbiased siRNA screen, we identify that TFEB protein stability is coordinately regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit DCAF7 and the PAK2 kinase. In particular, viral infection triggers marked PAK2 activation, which in turn, phosphorylates and primes TFEB for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Deletion of either DCAF7 or PAK2 blocks viral-mediated TFEB degradation and protects against viral-induced cytopathic effects. We further derive a series of small molecules that interfere with the DCAF7-TFEB interaction. These agents inhibit viral-triggered TFEB degradation and demonstrate broad anti-viral activities including attenuating in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, these results delineate a viral-triggered pathway that disables the endogenous cellular system that maintains lysosomal function and suggest that small molecule inhibitors of the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF7 represent a novel class of endo-lysosomal, host-directed, anti-viral therapies.","Liu, Yuan; Lear, Travis; Larsen, Mads; Lin, Bo; Cao, Qing; Alfaras, Irene; Kennerdell, Jason; Salminen, Laura; Camarco, Daniel; Lockwood, Karina; Ma, Jing; Liu, Jie; Tan, Jay; Myerburg, Michael; Chen, Yanwen; Croix, Claudette St; Sekine, Yusuke; Evankovich, John; Finkel, Toren; Chen, Bill",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-419305/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013250/,78

Conversely, 11.84% (M=52.76, SD=3.9) qualify in the criterion for severe anxiety. The independent sample t-test result revealed that there was statistically significant difference among males and females for anxiety mean score. However, there was no statistically significant difference among males and females for depressive symptom mean score. Regarding mental health across different age categories, the ANOVA with post hoc analysis revealed that there was statistically significant difference for state anxiety mean score among younger and older participants but not for depressive symptom mean score. CONCLUSION: Generally, there is gap in the prevention of COVID-19. In addition, there is an elevated level of depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak of COVID-19 that needs urgent psychological intervention.","Disasa, Begashaw; Teshome, Enishaw",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262366/; https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s287477,78

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled the identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in the identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with resident populations of 150–200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.","Gibas, Cynthia; Lambirth, Kevin; Mittal, Neha; Juel, Md Ariful Islam; Barua, Visva Bharati; Brazell, Lauren Roppolo; Hinton, Keshawn; Lontai, Jordan; Stark, Nicholas; Young, Isaiah; Quach, Cristine; Russ, Morgan; Kauer, Jacob; Nicolosi, Bridgette; Chen, Don; Akella, Srinivas; Tang, Wenwu; Schlueter, Jessica; Munir, Mariya",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838367/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146749; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721018179?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721018179,78

AMR, already a significant burden on public health and economies, is anticipated to grow even more severe in the coming decades. Several licensed vaccines, targeting both bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi) and viral (influenza virus, rotavirus) human pathogens, have already proven their anti-AMR benefits by reducing unwarranted antibiotic consumption and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and by promoting herd immunity. A number of new investigational vaccines, with a potential to reduce the spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, are also in various stages of clinical development. Nevertheless, vaccines as a tool to combat AMR remain underappreciated and unfortunately underutilized. Global mobilization of public health and industry resources is key to maximizing the use of licensed vaccines, and the development of new prophylactic vaccines could have a profound impact on reducing AMR.","Jansen, Kathrin U.; Gruber, William C.; Simon, Raphael; Wassil, James; Anderson, Annaliesa S.",Environ Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602924/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-021-01274-z,78

This analysis refers to the strand of literature on STI (Science and Technology-based Innovation) and DUI innovation modes (Innovation based on learning-by-Doing, learning-by-Using, learning-by-Interacting) that have been intensely debated over the past few years. It is a relevant area of research because it discusses the most effective innovation mode adopted by firms and their regions in the context of increasing global competition. In this scientific area, we inquire whether and how the regional context and its specific technological capabilities produce a differentiated impact of STI and DUI innovation modes on innovation outputs, alongside the nature of innovation outputs. In this respect, this study advances the literature on regional innovation systems that have not been analyzed by other scholarly contributions in this strand who have mostly discussed the differentiated impact of innovation modes across individual countries, industries, and business networks. Based on the large heterogeneity of regions across the European geography, we move beyond the set of individual country studies and develop a thorough analysis based on the Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2014) data from the Eurostat office about EU regions. Empirical evidence based on the application of a multiple treatment model suggests that both regional specificities and the nature of innovation matter.

Here we analysed immune responses following vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine(2) in elderly participants and younger healthcare workers. Serum neutralization and levels of binding IgG or IgA after the first vaccine dose were lower in older individuals, with a marked drop in participants over eighty years old. Sera from participants above eighty showed lower neutralization potency against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1. (Gamma) VOC than against the wild-type virus and were more likely to lack any neutralization against VOC following the first dose. However, following the second dose, neutralization against VOC was detectable regardless of age. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells was higher in elderly responders (whose serum showed neutralization activity) than in non-responders after the first dose. Elderly participants showed a clear reduction in somatic hypermutation of class-switched cells. The production of interferon-γ and interleukin-2 by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells was lower in older participants, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high-risk population and that specific measures to boost vaccine responses in this population are warranted, particularly where variants of concern are circulating.","Collier, Dami A.; Ferreira, Isabella A.

Since then, the disease has spread throughout the country, reaching the poorest areas. This study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 and the population’s living conditions. We aimed to identify social determinants related to the incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Brazil, in 2020. METHODS: This is an ecological study evaluating the relationship between COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates and 49 social indicators of human development and social vulnerability. For the analysis, bivariate spatial correlation and multivariate and spatial regression models (spatial lag model and spatial error models) were used, considering a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: A total of 44.8% of municipalities registered confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 14.7% had deaths. We observed that 56.2% of municipalities with confirmed cases had very low human development (COVID-19 incidence rate: 59.00/100 000; mortality rate: 36.75/1 000 000), and 52.8% had very high vulnerability (COVID-19 incidence rate: 41.68/100 000; mortality rate: 27.46/1 000 000). The regression model showed 17 indicators associated with transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 first arrived in the most developed and least vulnerable municipalities in Brazil, it has already reached locations that are farther from large urban centers, whose populations are exposed to a context of intense social vulnerability. Based on these findings, it is necessary to adopt measures that take local social aspects into account in order to contain the pandemic.","de Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire; Machado, Michael Ferreira; do Carmo, Rodrigo Feliciano",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867851/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00743-x,78

However, little work has been done measuring and interpreting stress hormones in flying-foxes. Over a 12-month period, we collected pooled urine samples from underneath roosting flying-foxes, and urine and blood samples from captured individuals. Urine and plasma samples were assayed for cortisol using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. We demonstrated a typical post-capture stress response in flying-foxes, established urine specific gravity as an attractive alternative to creatinine to correct urine concentration, and established population-level urinary cortisol ranges (and geometric means) for the four Australian species: Pteropus alecto 0.5–305.1 ng/mL (20.1 ng/mL); Pteropus conspicillatus 0.3–370.9 ng/mL (18.9 ng/mL); Pteropus poliocephalus 0.3–311.3 ng/mL (10.1 ng/mL); Pteropus scapulatus 5.2–205.4 ng/mL (40.7 ng/mL).

We investigated how perceived vulnerability to disease and personality characteristics related to support for public health measures. We analyzed survey data of 1000 Flemish (Belgium) adults, collected between March 17, 2020 and March 22, 2020. Older age, low educational attainment, gender (female) and work situation (no telecommuting) were associated with greater perceived vulnerability. Greater expectations of loneliness and more solidarity with our fellow men were associated with gender (female), younger age and work situation (telecommuting). Greater perceived vulnerability to disease was related to a greater belief that public health measures protect the population, but also to a critical stance towards the Belgian government's handling of the crisis. High agreeableness and high emotional stability were associated with respectively greater belief that health measures protect the population, and greater support for the government's crisis management.

Low-order serial correlation of growth rates is predominantly negative with cycles of two to four days for most countries. The results of fitted spatial autoregressive models suggest that there is high degree of spillover between countries. Forecast variances of many countries, in particular those with a high absolute number of infections, can to a large extent be explained by structural innovations of other countries.

Rapid diagnosis of hAdV infection is critical for appropriate and timely management. This study reports the design and validation of a sensitive and specific multiplex real‐time PCR for the detection of a broad range of hAdV serotypes in respiratory samples. The assay targets the conserved region of the hAdV hexon gene and utilizes hydrolysis probes for the detection of amplified products. The assay was evaluated using retrospectively (n = 864) and prospectively (n = 11,451) collected samples from November 2005 to July 2006. Seasonality studies and analysis of outbreaks was conducted over a 2‐year period from January 2005 to December 2006 (n = 33,067 samples). The assay gave a hAdV positive rate of 7.1% (n = 811) for specimens tested prospectively and was able to detect a broad range of hAdV serotypes with good sensitivity and specificity. A high rate of co‐infection was noted (21.7%). Adenovirus infections were more prevalent in the young with a median age of 24 months for positive patients. Sequence analysis of hAdV positives showed that serotype 7 was the most prevalent followed by serotypes 2 and 3. Association of hAdVs with respiratory outbreaks was low at 2.3% (6 of 266 outbreaks tested) and no seasonal variation was observed for hAdV infections during the 2‐year study period.

No respiratory or gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in any of the children. Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in two staff members from distinct day care centres. One was asymptomatic at the time of testing, and one was symptomatic and did not attend the facility on that day. CONCLUSION: Detection of either respiratory or gastrointestinal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in children and staff members attending day care centres was rare in the context of limited community activity and with infection prevention measures in the facilities in place.","Hoehl, Sebastian; Kreutzer, Emilie; Schenk, Barbara; Westhaus, Sandra; Foppa, Ivo; Herrmann, Eva; Ettrich, India; Leondaraki, Maria; Schaible, Alexander; Rudych, Olga; Rabenau, Holger; Berger, Annemarie; Ciesek, Sandra",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388748/,78

In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the C protein was generated with the recombinant C protein expressed in Escherichia coli as immunogen. IFA and IPMA analysis showed that the native C protein of CSFV virions was reactive to the mAb. By truncating the C protein, we identified a linear epitope recognized by the mAb, corresponding to amino acids (61)TQDGLYHNKN(70) of the CSFV C protein, which is well conserved among pestiviruses. Laser confocal analysis showed that the C protein mainly locates in the cellular nucleoplasm and nucleolus of PK-15 cells. The results have implications for further study of CSFV replication.","Zhang, Xin; Xu, Jia; Sun, Yuan; Li, Su; Li, Na; Yang, Shuo; He, Fan; Huang, Jun-Hua; Ling, Li-Jun; Qiu, Hua-Ji",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.01.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211000256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21255622/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211000256,78

Electronic learning (e-learning) became the core method of teaching the curriculum during the pandemic. After 8 weeks of only online learning, a survey was conducted to investigate perception of this type of learning among medical students. A survey was conducted by distributing an online questionnaire to Polish medical students. Data gathered from the survey were analyzed with routine statistical software. Eight hundred four students answered the questionnaire. According to respondents’ answers, the main advantages of online learning were the ability to stay at home (69%), continuous access to online materials (69%), learning at your own pace (64%), and comfortable surroundings (54%). The majority of respondents chose lack of interactions with patients (70%) and technical problems with IT equipment (54%) as the main disadvantages. There was no statistical difference between face-to-face and online learning in terms of opinions on the ability of the learning method to increase knowledge (P = .46). E-learning was considered less effective than face-to-face learning in terms of increasing skills (P < .001) and social competences (P < .001). Students assessed that they were less active during online classes compared to traditional classes (P < .001). E-learning was rated as enjoyable by 73% of respondents. E-learning is a powerful tool for teaching medical students. However, successful implementation of online learning into the curriculum requires a well thought-out strategy and a more active approach.","Bączek, Michał; Zagańczyk-Bączek, Michalina; Szpringer, Monika; Jaroszyński, Andrzej; Wożakowska-Kapłon, Beata",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607848/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000024821,78

Throughout pneumonia course, alveolar macrophages and infiltrated blood monocytes produce increasing cytokine amounts, which activates the antiviral/antibacterial immunity but can also provoke the risk of the so-called cytokine “storm” and normal tissue damage. Subsequently, the question of how the cytokine spectrum is shaped and balanced in the pneumonia context remains a hot topic in medical immunology, particularly in the COVID19 pandemic era. The diversity in cytokine profiles, involved in pneumonia pathogenesis, is determined by the variations in cytokine-receptor interactions, which may lead to severe cytokine storm and functional decline of particular tissues and organs, for example, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Cytokines and their receptors form unique profiles in individual patients, depending on the (a) microenvironmental context (comorbidities and associated treatment), (b) lung monocyte heterogeneity, and (c) genetic variations. These multidisciplinary strategies can be proactively considered beforehand and during the pneumonia course and potentially allow the new age of personalized immunotherapy.","Dukhinova, Marina; Kokinos, Elena; Kuchur, Polina; Komissarov, Alexey; Shtro, Anna",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S135961012030229X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.11.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135961012030229X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342718/,78
638332,Current perspectives on the phylogeny of Filoviridae,2011-06-30,"Many major cities that witnessed heavy air pollution by nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulate matter (PM) have experienced a high rate of infection and severity of the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). This phenomenon could be explained by the overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on epithelial cell surfaces of the respiratory tract. Indeed, ACE-2 is a receptor for coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV), and ACE-2 is overexpressed under chronic exposure to air pollution such as NO(2) and PM(2.5). In this review, we explain that ACE-2 acts as the sole receptor for the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein. The fact that respiratory and vascular epithelial cells express ACE-2 has been previously observed during the 2003 epidemic of the SARS-CoV-1 in China, and during the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia. High ACE-2 expression in respiratory epithelial cells under air pollution explains the positive correlation between the severity in COVID-19 patients and elevated air pollution, notably high NO(2) and PM(2.5) levels. Specific areas in India, China, Italy, Russia, Chile and Qatar that experience heavy air pollution also show high rates of COVID-19 infection and severity. Overall, we demonstrate a link between NO(2) emissions, PM(2.5) levels, ACE-2 expression and COVID-19 infection severity. Therefore, air pollution should be reduced in places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 are unexpectedly high.","Paital, Biswaranjan; Agrawal, Pawan Kumar",Environ Chem Lett,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-020-01091-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982622/,78

642574,SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a therapeutic target for COVID-19,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND: Despite many efforts to achieve better coordination, fragmentation is an enduring feature of the global health landscape that undermines the effectiveness of health programmes and threatens the attainment of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. In this paper we identify and describe the multiple causes of fragmentation in development assistant for health at the global level. The study is of particular relevance since the emergence of new global health problems such as COVID-19 heightens the need for global health actors to work in coordinated ways. Our study is part of the Lancet Commission on Synergies between Universal Health Coverage, Health Security and Health Promotion. METHODS: We used a mixed methods approach. This consisted of a non-systematic literature review of published papers in scientific journals, reports, books and websites. We also carried out twenty semi-structured expert interviews with individuals from bilateral and multilateral organisations, governments and academic and research institutions between April 2019 and December 2019. RESULTS: We identified five distinct yet interconnected sets of factors causing fragmentation: proliferation of global health actors; problems of global leadership; divergent interests; problems of accountability; problems of power relations. We explain why global health actors struggle to harmonise their approaches and priorities, fail to align their work with low- and middle-income countries’ needs and why they continue to embrace funding instruments that create fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Many global actors are genuinely committed to addressing the problems of fragmentation, despite their complexity and interconnected nature. This paper aims to raise awareness and understanding of the causes of fragmentation and to help guide actors’ efforts in addressing the problems and moving to more synergistic approaches.","Spicer, Neil; Agyepong, Irene; Ottersen, Trygye; Jahn, Albrecht; Ooms, Gorik",Global Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00592-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646471/,78

Recent innovations in anticancer therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitor biologics, therapeutic vaccines, small drugs, and CAR-T cell injections, mark a new epoch in cancer research, already known for faster (epi-)genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. As the long-sought after personalization of cancer therapies comes to fruition, the need to evaluate all current therapeutic possibilities and select the best for each patient is of paramount importance. This is a novel task for medical care that deserves prominence in therapeutic considerations in the future. This is because cancer is a complex genetic disease. In its deadly form, metastatic cancer, it includes altered genes (and their regulators) that encode ten hallmarks of cancer-independent growth, dodging apoptosis, immortalization, multidrug resistance, neovascularization, invasiveness, genome instability, inflammation, deregulation of metabolism, and avoidance of destruction by the immune system. These factors have been known targets for many anticancer drugs and treatments, and their modulation is a therapeutic goal, with the hope of rendering solid cancer a chronic rather than deadly disease. In this article, the current therapeutic arsenal against cancers is reviewed with a focus on immunotherapies.","Dembic, Zlatko",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25235776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297561/,78

Arrhythmias are prevalent and reportedly, the second most common complication. Several mechanistic pathways are proposed to explain the pro‐arrhythmic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. A number of treatment approaches have been trialled, each with its inherent unique challenges. This rapid systematic review aimed to examine the current incidence and available treatment of arrhythmias in COVID‐19, as well as barriers to implementation. METHODS: Our search of scientific databases identified relevant published studies from 1(st) January 2000 until 1(st) June 2020. We also searched Google Scholar for grey literature. We identified 1729 publications of which 1704 were excluded. RESULTS: The incidence and nature of arrhythmias in the setting of COVID‐19 was poorly documented across studies. The cumulative incidence of arrhythmia across studies of hospitalised patients was 6.9%. Drug‐induced long QT syndrome secondary to antimalarial and antimicrobial therapy was a significant contributor to arrhythmia formation, with an incidence of 14.15%. Torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) was reported. Treatment strategies aim to minimise this through risk stratification and regular monitoring of corrected QT interval (QTc). CONCLUSION: Patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 are at an increased risk of arrhythmias. Drug therapy is pro‐arrhythmogenic and may result in TdP and SCD in these patients. Risk assessment and regular QTc monitoring are imperative for safety during the treatment course. Further studies are needed to guide future decision making.","Malaty, Michael; Kayes, Tahrima; Amarasekera, Anjalee Thanuja; Kodsi, Matthew; MacIntyre, C Raina; Tan, Timothy C.",Eur J Clin Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33043453/; https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13428,78

646534,The risk of COVID-19 for pregnant women: Evidences of molecular alterations associated with preeclampsia in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-11-01,"The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) controls viral genome packaging and contains numerous phosphorylation sites located within unstructured regions. Binding of phosphorylated SARS-CoV N to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm was reported to regulate nucleocytoplasmic N shuttling. All seven isoforms of the human 14-3-3 are abundantly present in tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, where N can constitute up to ~1% of expressed proteins during infection. Although the association between 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent one of the key host-pathogen interactions, its molecular mechanism and the specific critical phosphosites are unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylated SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via bacterial co-expression with protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein, but not with its monomeric mutant. We demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with various efficiencies and deduce the apparent KD to selected isoforms, showing that these are in a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a critical phosphorylation site to Ser197, which is conserved among related zoonotic coronaviruses and located within the functionally important, SR-rich region of N. The relatively tight 14-3-3/pN association can regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and other functions of N via occlusion of the SR-rich region, while hijacking cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration. As such, the assembly may represent a valuable target for therapeutic intervention. Highlights SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) binds to all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms. This association with 14-3-3 strictly depends on phosphorylation of N. The two proteins interact in 2:2 stoichiometry and with the Kd in a μM range. Affinity of interaction depends on the specific 14-3-3 isoform. Conserved Ser197-phosphopeptide of N is critical for the interaction.","Tugaeva, Kristina V.; Hawkins, Dorothy E. D. P.; Smith, Jake L.

There were no statistically significant differences in weighted burden scores between cases and controls for either gene. There were no individual DNA sequence variants with a markedly different frequency between cases and controls. Whether there are small effects on severity, or whether there might be rare variants with major effect sizes, would require studies in much larger samples.

Consequently, this situation resulted in manpower and resource costs, leading to the widespread and exponential rise of infected cases at the early stage of the epidemic. To limit the spread of infection, the Chinese government adopted innovative, specialized, and advanced systems, including empowered Fangcang and Internet hospitals, as well as high technologies such as 5G, big data analysis, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The efficient use of these new forces helped China win its fight against the virus.

Considering the large amount of examinations in high case-load scenarios, an automated tool could facilitate and save critical time in the diagnosis and risk stratification of the disease. METHODS: A novel deep learning derived machine learning (ML) classifier was developed using a simplified programming approach and an open source dataset consisting of 6868 chest CT images from 418 patients which was split into training and validation subsets. The diagnostic performance was then evaluated and compared to experienced radiologists on an independent testing dataset. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Operating points with high positive (>10) and low negative (<0.01) likelihood ratios to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present were identified and validated. RESULTS: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.956 (AUC) on an independent testing dataset of 90 patients. Both rule-in and rule out thresholds were identified and tested. At the rule-in operating point, sensitivity and specificity were 84.4% and 93.3% and did not differ from both radiologists (p > 0.05). At the rule-out threshold, sensitivity (100%) and specificity (60%) differed significantly from the radiologists (p < 0.05). Likelihood ratios and a Fagan nomogram provide prevalence independent test performance estimates. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using a basic deep learning approach is feasible using open-source CT image data. In addition, the machine learning classifier provided validated rule-in and rule-out criteria could be used to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present.","Javor, D.; Kaplan, H.; Kaplan, A.; Puchner, S.B.; Krestan, C.; Baltzer, P.",Eur J Radiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X20305921?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109402; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X20305921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190102/,78

Emerging predictors for poor outcomes include advanced age, male sex, preexisting cardiovascular disease, and risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and, more recently, obesity. This article posits new obesity‐driven predictors of poor COVID‐19 outcomes, over and above the more obvious extant risks associated with obesity, including cardiometabolic disease and hypoventilation syndrome in intensive care patients. This article also outlines a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in individuals with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread, with increased shedding, immune activation, and cytokine amplification. This paper proposes studies to test this reservoir concept with a focus on specific cytokine pathways that might be amplified in individuals with obesity and COVID‐19. Finally, this paper underscores emerging therapeutic strategies that might benefit subsets of patients in which cytokine amplification is excessive and potentially fatal.","Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Caplice, Noel M.",Obesity (Silver Spring),https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314868/,78
657363,RNA-Binding Domain in the Nucleocapsid Protein of Gill-Associated Nidovirus of Penaeid Shrimp,2011-08-03,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted psychological health. Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a nonjudgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress during regular times. Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P<.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P<.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P<.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","Lim, Julian; Leow, Zaven; Ong, Jason; Pang, Ly-Shan; Lim, Eric",JMIR Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.2196/21757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33482627/,78

Various explanations have arisen for the cause of disparate vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minorities, including discussion of vaccine hesitancy. Conversely, the role of vaccine accessibility rooted in structural racism as a driver in these disparities should be further explored.

Immune responses in COVID-19 can both protect against the disease as well as drive it. Insights into these responses, and specifically the targets being recognised by the immune system, are of vital importance in understanding the side effects of COVID-19 and associated pathologies. The body’s adaptive immunity recognises and responds against specific targets (antigens) expressed by foreign pathogens, but not usually to target self-antigens. However, if the immune system becomes dysfunctional, adaptive immune cells can react to self-antigens, which can result in autoimmune disease. Viral infections are well reported to be associated with, or exacerbate, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In COVID-19 patients, both new onset MS and SLE, as well as the occurrence of other autoimmune-like pathologies, have been reported. Additionally, the presence of autoantibodies, both with and without known associations to autoimmune diseases, have been found. Herein we describe the mechanisms of virally induced autoimmunity and summarise some of the emerging reports on the autoimmune-like diseases and autoreactivity that is reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Moody, Rhiane; Wilson, Kirsty; Flanagan, Katie L.; Jaworowski, Anthony; Plebanski, Magdalena",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445670/,78

The relationships among SDGs attitude, SDGs interest, SDGs motivation, and SDGs self-efficacy were analyzed by Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance were used to explore the differences among the college student groups in terms of gender, grade, and major in relation to attitude and personal characteristics. Attitude scores based on regression analysis were used to predict college students’ interest, motivation, and self-efficacy in relation to the SDGs. According to the results, (a) the college students considered the three most important SDGs to be good health and well-being (SDG 3) (49.72%), quality education (SDG 4) (41.39%), and no poverty (SDG 1) (32.22%), while the three least important SDGs were decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) (41.11%), partnerships for the goals (SDG 17) (38.06%), and response consumption and institutions (SDG 12) (30.83%); (b) the SDGPI had a high reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.942; (c) there was a significant positive correlation between attitude and the variables of interest, motivation, and self-efficacy; (d) differences in attitudes, interest, and motivation between men and women were distinct and women scored much higher in these three subscales than men; (e) attitude could explain significant variance in interest, motivation and self-efficacy.

662053,Identification of Potential Key Agents for Targeting RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 by Integrated Analysis and Virtual Drug Screening,2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND: Professional communities such as the medical community are acutely concerned with negligence: the category of misconduct where a professional does not live up to the standards expected of a professional of similar qualifications. Since science is currently strengthening its structures of self-regulation in parallel to the professions, this raises the question to what extent the scientific community is concerned with negligence, and if not, whether it should be. By means of comparative analysis of medical and scientific codes of conduct, we aim to highlight the role (or lack thereof) of negligence provisions in codes of conduct for scientists, and to discuss the normative consequences for future codes of conduct. METHODS: We collected scientific and medical codes of conduct in a selection of OECD countries, and submitted each code of conduct to comparative textual analysis. RESULTS: Negligence is invariably listed as an infraction of the norms of integrity in medical codes of conduct, but only rarely so in the scientific codes. When the latter list negligence, they typically do not provide any detail on the meaning of ‘negligence’. DISCUSSION: Unlike codes of conduct for professionals, current codes of conduct for scientists are largely silent on the issue of negligence, or explicitly exclude negligence as a type of misconduct. In the few cases where negligence is stipulated to constitute misconduct, no responsibilities are identified that would help prevent negligence. While we caution against unreasonable negligence provisions as well as disproportionate sanctioning systems, we do argue that negligence provisions are crucial for justified trust in the scientific community, and hence that there is a very strong rationale for including negligence provisions in codes of conduct.

An important purpose of the shutdown is to avoid overstretching intensive care unit (ICU) capacity (flattening the curve). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a successful shutdown. Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short-term. Results: A successful shutdown is projected to yield an average gain between 0.02 and 0.08 life years (0.3 to 1.0 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between 2147 and 8056 euros per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 5% to 19% of the gross domestic product in 2019. Nevertheless, if herd immunity is achieved through natural infection, even a shutdown that is successful in flattening the curve is expected to yield a loss of 0.40 life years per capita compared to the situation before the pandemic. Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population. Nevertheless, questions around the affordability and underfunding of other parts of the healthcare system emerge.","Gandjour, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.20098996; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20098996v1?rss=1,78

Fragile health systems can become overwhelmed during public health crises, further exacerbating the human, economic, and political toll. Important work has been done to describe the general attributes of a health system resilient to these crises, and the next step will be to identify the specific capacities that health systems need to develop and maintain to achieve resiliency. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify recurring themes and capacities needed for health system resiliency to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards and any existing implementation frameworks that highlight these capacities. We also sought to identify the overlap of the identified themes and capacities with those highlighted in the World Health Organization’s Joint External Evaluation. Sources of evidence included PubMed, Web of Science, OAIster, and the websites of relevant major public health organizations. RESULTS: We identified 16 themes of health system resilience, including: the need to develop plans for altered standards of care during emergencies, the need to develop plans for post-event recovery, and a commitment to quality improvement. Most of the literature described the general attributes of a resilient health system; no implementation frameworks were identified that could translate these elements into specific capacities that health system actors can employ to improve resilience to outbreaks and natural hazards in a variety of settings. CONCLUSIONS: An implementation-oriented health system resilience framework could help translate the important components of a health system identified in this review into specific capacities that actors in the health system could work to develop to improve resilience to public health crises. However, there remains a need to further refine the concept of resilience so that health systems can simultaneously achieve sustainable transformations in healthcare practice and health service delivery as well as improve their preparedness for emergencies.","Nuzzo, Jennifer B.; Meyer, Diane; Snyder, Michael; Ravi, Sanjana J.; Lapascu, Ana; Souleles, Jon; Andrada, Carolina I.; Bishai, David",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7707-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623594/,78

This was a case series observed during May 2020 in two referral centers for COVID-19 treatment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 47 eyes from 25 hospitalized patients with severe or critical confirmed illness were evaluated. A handheld retinal camera was used to acquire bilateral fundus images at several time points after symptoms onset. Electronic health records were retrospectively analyzed and clinical data collected. Severe and critical diseases were noticed in 52% (13/25) and 48% (12/25) of enrolled patients, respectively. Retinal changes were present in 12% (3/25) of patients: a 35 year-old male demonstrated bilateral nerve fiber layer infarcts and microhemorrhages in the papillomacular bundle, but required mechanical ventilation and developed severe anemia and systemic hypotension, acute kidney injury and neurologic symptoms during the course of the disease (critical illness); a 56 year-old male, who required full enoxaparin anticoagulation due to particularly elevated D-dimer (>5.0 mcg/mL), demonstrated unilateral and isolated flame-shaped hemorrhages; and a 49 year-old hypertensive male showed bilateral and discrete retinal dot and blot microhemorrhages. The other 22 patients evaluated did not demonstrate convincing retinal changes upon examination. There was no correlation between disease severity and admission serum levels of CRP, D-dimer and ferritin. This was the first study to show that vascular retinal changes may be present in not insignificant numbers of severe or critical COVID-19 inpatients. These retinal changes, only seen after morbid developments, were likely secondary to clinical intercurrences or comorbidities instead of a direct damage by SARS-CoV-2, and may be important and easily accessible outcome measures of therapeutic interventions and sentinels of neurologic and systemic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic.","Lani-Louzada, Rafael; Ramos, Carolina do Val Ferreira; Cordeiro, Ricardo Mello; Sadun, Alfredo A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270751/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243346,78

Most of the beneficial cardiovascular effects have been investigated in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease (CAD). Yet, few human studies have been conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these clinically beneficial effects in patients with CAD. Accordingly, the EMPA-CARD trial was designed to focus on the molecular effects of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and CAD. METHODS: In this multicenter, triple-blind randomized controlled trial, patients with documented known T2DM and CAD will be recruited. They will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio and assigned into two groups of empagliflozin 10 mg/daily and placebo. The primary endpoint is the effect of empagliflozin on changes of plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) after 26 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints will consist of changes in other inflammatory biomarkers (Interleukin 1-beta and high-sensitive C-reactive protein), markers of oxidative stress, platelet function, and glycemic status. DISCUSSION: The EMPA-CARD trial mainly tests the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibition by empagliflozin may improve inflammatory status measured as reduction in inflammatory biomarkers in patients with T2DM and CAD. The results will provide information about the underlying mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition that mediate the beneficial effects of this medication on clinical outcomes.

668715,Structure-based identification of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors from anti-viral specific chemical libraries: an exhaustive computational screening approach,2021-04-12,"On March 16, 2020, the US Government introduced strict social distancing protocols for the United States in an effort to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This had an immediate major effect on the job market, with millions of Americans forced to find alternative ways to make a living from home. As online labor markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) play a major role in social science research, concerns have been raised that the pandemic may be reducing the diversity of subjects participating in experiments. Here, we investigate this possibility empirically. Specifically, we look at 15,539 responses gathered in 23 studies run on MTurk between February and July 2020, examining the distribution of gender, age, ethnicity, political preference, and analytic cognitive style. We find notable changes on some of the measures following the imposition of nationwide social distancing: participants are more likely to be less reflective (as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test), and somewhat less likely to be white, Democrats (traditionally over-represented on MTurk), and experienced with MTurk. Most of these differences are explained by an influx of new participants into the MTurk subject pool who are more diverse and representative – but also less attentive – than previous MTurkers.

Subsequently, all elective surgeries had to be cancelled and postponed for months. The aim of the present study was to assess the pretreatment health status before and after COVID-19-related cancellation and the psychosocial distress caused by the cancellation. METHODS: For this study, a questionnaire was developed collecting sociodemographic data and information on health status before and after the cancellation. To assess psychosocial distress, the validated depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), was implemented. PHQ-9-Scores of 10 and above were considered to indicate moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In total, 119 patients whose elective orthopaedic surgery was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed once at least 8 weeks after the cancellation. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (65%; 34 female, 43 male) completed the questionnaire and were included. The predominant procedures were total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hip arthroscopy and foot and ankle surgery. The mean pain level significantly increased from 5.5 ± 2.2 at the time of the initially scheduled surgery to 6.2 ± 2.5 at the time of the survey (p < 0.0001). The pain level before cancellation of the surgery was significantly higher in female patients (p = 0.029). An increased analgetic consumption was identified in 46% of all patients. A mean PHQ-9 score of 6.1 ± 4.9 was found after cancellation. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or above were found in 14% of patients, and 8% exhibited scores of 15 points or above. Significantly higher PHQ-9 scores were seen in female patients (p = 0.046). No significant differences in PHQ-9 scores were found among age groups, procedures or reasons for cancellation. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery resulted in pain levels that were significantly higher than when the surgery was scheduled, leading to increased analgesic use. Additionally, significant psychosocial distress due to the cancellation was identified in some patients, particularly middle-aged women. Despite these results, confidence in the national health care system and in the treating orthopaedic surgeons was not affected. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

Among the mechanisms associated with disease onset and progression, it has been hypothesized that IPF lungs might be affected either by a regenerative deficit of the alveolar epithelium or by a dysregulation of repair mechanisms in response to alveolar and vascular damage. This latter might be related to the progressive dysfunction and exhaustion of the resident stem cells together with a process of cellular and tissue senescence. The role of endogenous mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) resident in the lung in the homeostasis of these mechanisms is still a matter of debate. Although endogenous MSCs may play a critical role in lung repair, they are also involved in cellular senescence and tissue ageing processes with loss of lung regenerative potential. In addition, MSCs have immunomodulatory properties and can secrete anti-fibrotic factors. Thus, MSCs obtained from other sources administered systemically or directly into the lung have been investigated for lung epithelial repair and have been explored as a potential therapy for the treatment of lung diseases including IPF. Given these multiple potential roles of MSCs, this review aims both at elucidating the role of resident lung MSCs in IPF pathogenesis and the role of administered MSCs from other sources for potential IPF therapies.","Samarelli, Anna Valeria; Tonelli, Roberto; Heijink, Irene; Martin Medina, Aina; Marchioni, Alessandro; Bruzzi, Giulia; Castaniere, Ivana; Andrisani, Dario; Gozzi, Filippo; Manicardi, Linda; Moretti, Antonio; Cerri, Stefania; Fantini, Riccardo; Tabbì, Luca; Nani, Chiara; Mastrolia, Ilenia; Weiss, Daniel J.; Dominici, Massimo; Clini, Enrico",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290610/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.692551,78

The high efficiency of these innovations has inevitably pushed the health sector into a digital transformation process to optimize the technologies and methodologies used to optimize healthcare management systems. In this transformation, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology plays an important role, which enables many devices to connect and work together. IoT allows systems to work together using sensors, connection methods, internet protocols, databases, cloud computing, and analytic as infrastructure. In this respect, it is necessary to establish the necessary technical infrastructure and a suitable environment for the development of smart hospitals. This study points out the optimization factors, challenges, available technologies, and opportunities, as well as the system architecture that come about by employing IoT technology in smart hospital environments. In order to do that, the required technical infrastructure is divided into five layers and the system infrastructure, constraints, and methods needed in each layer are specified, which also includes the smart hospital’s dimensions and extent of intelligent computing and real-time big data analytic. As a result of the study, the deficiencies that may arise in each layer for the smart hospital design model and the factors that should be taken into account to eliminate them are explained.

However, the effectiveness of E-learning in CME interventions remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether E-learning training program can improve TB health personnel’s knowledge and behaviour in China. METHODS: This study used a convergent mixed method research design to evaluate the impact of E-learning programs for tuberculosis (TB) health workers in terms of knowledge improvement and behaviour change during the China-Gates TB Project (add the time span). Quantitative data was collected by staff surveys (baseline n = 555; final n = 757) and management information systems to measure the demographic characteristics, training participation, and TB knowledge. Difference-in-difference (DID) and multiple linear regression models were employed to capture the effectiveness of knowledge improvement. Qualitative data was collected by interviews (n = 30) and focus group discussions (n = 44) with managers, teachers, and learners to explore their learning experience. RESULTS: Synchronous E-learning improved the knowledge of TB clinicians (average treatment effect, ATE: 7.3 scores/100, P = 0.026). Asynchronous E-learning has a significant impact on knowledge among primary care workers (ATE: 10.9/100, P < 0.001), but not in clinicians or public health physicians. Traditional face-to-face training has no significant impact on all medical staff. Most of the learners (57.3%) agreed that they could apply what they learned to their practice. Qualitative data revealed that high quality content is the key facilitator of the behaviour change, while of learning content difficulty, relevancy, and hardware constraints are key barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of E-learning in CME varies across different types of training formats, organizational environment, and target audience. Although clinicians and primary care workers improved their knowledge by E-learning activities, public health physicians didn’t benefit from the interventions.

The characterization of these important populations may enable development of new therapeutics to treat acute or chronic lung disease. In this study, we aimed to establish the presence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors in ovine lungs and to characterize their potential to differentiate into specialized cells. RESULTS: Lung cells were studied using immunohistochemistry on frozen sections of the lung. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were conducted on ex-vivo derived pulmonary cells. The bronchioloalveolar progenitors were identified by their co-expression of CCSP, SP-C and CD34. A minor population of CD34(pos)/SP-C(pos)/CCSP(pos) cells (0.33% ± 0.31) was present ex vivo in cell suspensions from dissociated lungs. Using CD34 magnetic positive-cell sorting, undifferentiated SP-C(pos)/CCSP(pos) cells were purified (>80%) and maintained in culture. Using synthetic media and various extracellular matrices, SP-C(pos)/CCSP(pos) cells differentiated into either club cells (formerly named Clara cells) or alveolar epithelial type-II cells. Furthermore, these ex vivo and in vitro derived bronchioloalveolar progenitors expressed NANOG, OCT4 and BMI1, specifically described in progenitors or stem cells, and during lung development. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time in a large animal the existence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors with dual differentiation potential and the expression of specialized genes. These newly described cell population in sheep could be implicated in regeneration of the lung following lesions or in development of diseases such as cancers.","Archer, Fabienne; Abi-Rizk, Alain; Desloire, Sophie; Dolmazon, Christine; Gineys, Barbara; Guiguen, François; Cottin, Vincent; Mornex, Jean-François; Leroux, Caroline",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206786/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-224,78

A literature search was conducted using the ProQuest, Ovid, and Scopus databases. Information regarding social support (SS), psychological interventions, and training for the management of medications and behavioral changes was extracted. One hundred and nine studies were included in this review. Forums and training platforms were the main tools for ICs. The most effective platforms to improve SS include the participation of both ICs and health professionals. However, no significant improvements in objective caring skills were identified. Platforms developed specifically for ICs should be based in tools that ICs are familiar with, because many ICs have not yet incorporated Information and Communication Technologies in many activities of their daily lives. Education in the digitalization to ICs of PwD should be one of the priority objectives in telehealth interventions.","Sitges-Maciá, Esther; Bonete-López, Beatriz; Sánchez-Cabaco, Antonio; Oltra-Cucarella, Javier",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360020/,78

In the last 10 years, many national and international guidelines on the treatment of pediatric CAP have been published, in order to optimize the prescription of antibiotics and limit their cost and side effects. However, the practical implementation of these guidelines is still limited. MAIN TEXT: We analyzed the current recommendations for the therapy of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that all converge on the identification of aminopenicillins and beta-lactams as the optimal treatment for CAP. We also conducted a review of the current literature on antibiotic regimens used for pediatric CAP to identify the current state of guidelines implementation in different settings. We selected 37 studies published from 2010 to 2016, including both retrospective and prospective studies, mainly cross-sectional and hospital based. The results show a global heterogeneity in the antibiotics prescription for pediatric CAP, with application of guidelines varying from 0% to more than 91% and with important differences even within the same country. CONCLUSIONS: Our review has demonstrated that the implementation of the guidelines is still limited but also that achieving the optimal prescription is possible and can be done in both developed and developing countries.","Donà, Daniele; Luise, Dora; Da Dalt, Liviana; Giaquinto, Carlo",Int J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4239268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234355/,78

Methods: Approximately 5 g of stool specimen each was collected from 420 subjects (291 in the training cohort and 129 in the validation cohort). Stool DNA was extracted and bisulfite-converted, followed by detection of methylated level of SFRP2 and SDC2. Youden index was employed to determine the cut-off value. Results: The whole operating time for stool SpecColon test takes less than 5 hours. The limit of detection of combination of methylated SFRP2 and methylated SDC2 was as low as 5 pg per reaction. The optimized cut-off value was methylated SFRP2 analyzed by 3/3 rule and methylated SDC2 analyzed by 2/3 rule. In the training cohort, the sensitivities of stool SpecColon test for detecting AA and early stage CRC (stage 0-II) were 53.8% (95% CI: 26.1%-79.6%) and 89.1% (95% CI: 77.1%-95.5%) with a specificity of 93.5% (95% CI: 87.2%-96.9%), and the AUC for CRC diagnosis was 0.879 (95% CI: 0.830-0.928).

Though NIC is already FDA-approved, administration of the currently available oral formulation results in systemic drug levels that are too low for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the co-formulation of NIC with an endogenous protein, human lysozyme (hLYS), could enable the direct aerosol delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract as an alternative to oral delivery, thereby effectively treating COVID-19 by targeting the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. To test this hypothesis, we engineered and optimized composite particles containing NIC and hLYS suitable for delivery to the upper and lower airways via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray. The novel formulation demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo activity against two coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and may offer protection against methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and low-cost development approach will ensure rapid clinical development and wide-spread utilization.","Brunaugh, Ashlee D.; Seo, Hyojong; Warnken, Zachary; Ding, Li; Seo, Sang Heui; Smyth, Hugh D.

We aimed to assess the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of heterologous immunisations with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNtech, Mainz, Germany) compared with homologous BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCov-19 immunisation. METHODS: This is an interim analysis of a prospective observational cohort study enrolling health-care workers in Berlin (Germany) who received either homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or heterologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19–BNT162b2 vaccination with a 10–12-week vaccine interval or homologous BNT162b2 vaccination with a 3-week vaccine interval. We assessed reactogenicity after the first and second vaccination by use of electronic questionnaires on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Immunogenicity was measured by the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (full spike-IgG, S1-IgG, and RBD-IgG), by an RBD–ACE2 binding inhibition assay (surrogate SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation test), a pseudovirus neutralisation assay against two variants of concerns (alpha [B.1.1.7] and beta [B.1.351]), and anti-S1-IgG avidity. T-cell reactivity was measured by IFN-γ release assay. FINDINGS: Between Dec 27, 2020, and June 14, 2021, 380 participants were enrolled in the study, with 174 receiving homologous BNT162b2 vaccination, 38 receiving homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination, and 104 receiving ChAdOx1 nCov-19–BNT162b2 vaccination. Systemic symptoms were reported by 103 (65%, 95% CI 57·1–71·8) of 159 recipients of homologous BNT162b2, 14 (39%, 24·8–55·1) of 36 recipients of homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and 51 (49%, 39·6–58·5) of 104 recipients of ChAdOx1 nCov-19–BNT162b2 after the booster immunisation. Median anti-RBD IgG levels 3 weeks after boost immunisation were 5·4 signal to cutoff ratio (S/co; IQR 4·8–5·9) in recipients of homologous BNT162b2, 4·9 S/co (4·3–5·6) in recipients of homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and 5·6 S/co (5·1–6·1) in recipients of ChAdOx1 nCov-19– BNT162b2. Geometric mean of 50% inhibitory dose against alpha and beta variants were highest in recipients of ChAdOx1 nCov-19–BNT162b2 (956·6, 95% CI 835·6–1095, against alpha and 417·1, 349·3–498·2, against beta) compared with those in recipients of homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (212·5, 131·2–344·4, against alpha and 48·5, 28·4–82·8, against beta; both p<0·0001) or homologous BNT162b2 (369·2, 310·7–438·6, against alpha and 72·4, 60·5–86·5, against beta; both p<0·0001). SARS-CoV-2 S1 T-cell reactivity 3 weeks after boost immunisation was highest in recipients of ChAdOx1 nCov-19–BNT162b2 (median IFN-γ concentration 4762 mIU/mL, IQR 2723–8403) compared with that in recipients of homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (1061 mIU/mL, 599–2274, p<0·0001) and homologous BNT162b2 (2026 mIU/mL, 1459–4621, p=0·0008) vaccination. INTERPRETATION: The heterologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19–BNT162b2 immunisation with 10–12-week interval, recommended in Germany, is well tolerated and improves immunogenicity compared with homologous ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination with 10–12-week interval and BNT162b2 vaccination with 3-week interval. Heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategies for COVID-19 might be generally applicable.

683393,The SARS-CoV-2 main protease as drug target,2020-09-01,"With the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modelling of epidemics has been perceived and used as a central element in understanding, predicting, and governing the pandemic event. However, soon it became clear that long-term predictions were extremely challenging to address. In addition, it is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modelling of pandemic dynamics and a consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed for describing the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic together with the instantaneous reproductive ratio. Then, we introduce and use entropy-based metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and the temporal evolution of a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of the outbreak is modelled by an equation governing the probability distribution that describes a nonlinear Markov process of a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical interpretation. The time-dependent parameters are formulated by adaptive basis functions, leading to a parsimonious representation. In addition, we provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for calibration together with a coherent strategy to address data unreliability. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the susceptible–exposed–infected–removed model. Applying the model to the Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19 datasets, we discover significant difference in the absolute change of entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the instantaneous reproductive ratio.","Wang, Ziqi; Broccardo, Marco; Mignan, Arnaud; Sornette, Didier",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-020-05871-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929304/,78

The majority of fully vaccinated SOTr consisted of kidney recipients (319/459, 70%), with a minority of liver (85/459, 19%), heart (41/459, 9%), and multi-visceral transplants (11/459, 2%). Sixty-five percent was on a mycophenolate-containing regimen (Table 1) and mycophenolate with tacrolimus and prednisone was the most common regimen (33%). In response to our letter, Mossad(2) pointed out that our findings may not be generalizable to other centers whose SOTr population may be more highly immunosuppressed and/or more vulnerable to respiratory infections such as lung and multi-visceral SOTr. Furthermore, Mossad noted that SOTr with prior undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus with some level of protection from reinfection might have been included.","Malinis, Maricar; Cohen, Elizabeth; Azar, Marwan M.",Am J Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328268/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16770,78
687832,"Near-Complete Genome Sequence of GI-17 Lineage Infectious Bronchitis Virus, Circulating in Iowa",2021-05-20,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection strongly modulates the host’s immune response. The RNA silencing pathway is an intracellular innate response to viral infections. However, it is unknown whether PRRSV interacts with cellular RNA silencing to facilitate the viral infection. Here, we report for the first time the interaction between PRRSV and RNA silencing in both the porcine macrophages and African green monkey kidney cell line (MARC-145) cell line, which were derived from African green monkey kidney cells and highly permissive for PRRSV infection. Our data demonstrated that PRRSV suppressed RNA silencing induced by short-hairpin (sh) RNA, double-strand (ds) RNA and microRNA (miRNA) and downregulated the expression of argonaute protein-2 (Ago-2), which is a key protein of the RNA silencing pathway in animal cells. Further, exogenous introduction of siRNA and shRNA downregulated Dicer or Ago-2 proteins of the cellular RNA silencing apparatus in MARC-145 cells and porcine macrophages, which, in turn, increased the viral replication and titers. The viral non-structure protein 1α (nsp-1α) and nsp11 of PRRSV were identified as the suppressors for cellular RNA silencing (RSSs) to downregulate the Ago-2 protein. Our results identify that PRRSV, through its nsp proteins, suppresses the cellular RNA silencing apparatus in favor of viral infection and supports a co-evolutionary process of the virus and the cellular RNA silencing process.","Chen, Jing; Shi, Xibao; Zhang, Xiaozhuan; Wang, Li; Luo, Jun; Xing, Guangxu; Deng, Ruiguang; Yang, Hong; Li, Jinting; Wang, Aiping; Zhang, Gaiping",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7102893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512690/,78
688030,Drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain using ensemble-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations,2021-07-06,"Neoplastically transformed astrocytes express functionally active cell surface β adrenergic receptors (βARs). Treatment of glioma models in vitro and in vivo with β adrenergic agonists variably amplifies or attenuates cellular proliferation. In the majority of in vivo models, β adrenergic agonists generally reduce cellular proliferation. However, treatment with β adrenergic agonists consistently reduces tumor cell invasive potential, angiogenesis, and metastasis. β adrenergic agonists induced decreases of invasive potential are chiefly mediated through reductions in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases types 2 and 9. Treatment with β adrenergic agonists also clearly reduce tumoral neoangiogenesis, which may represent a putatively useful mechanism to adjuvantly amplify the effects of bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. We may accordingly designate βagonists to represent an enhancer of bevacizumab. The antiangiogenic effects of β adrenergic agonists may thus effectively render an otherwise borderline effective therapy to generate significant enhancement in clinical outcomes. β adrenergic agonists upregulate expression of the major histocompatibility class II DR alpha gene, effectively potentiating the immunogenicity of tumor cells to tumor surveillance mechanisms. Authors have also demonstrated crossmodal modulation of signaling events downstream from the β adrenergic cell surface receptor and microtubular polymerization and depolymerization. Complex effects and desensitization mechanisms of the β adrenergic signaling may putatively represent promising therapeutic targets. Constant stimulation of the β adrenergic receptor induces its phosphorylation by β adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK), rendering it a suitable substrate for alternate binding by β arrestins 1 or 2. The binding of a β arrestin to βARK phosphorylated βAR promotes receptor mediated internalization and downregulation of cell surface receptor and contemporaneously generates a cell surface scaffold at the βAR. The scaffold mediated activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2, compared with protein kinase A mediated activation, preferentially favors cytosolic retention of ERK1/2 and blunting of nuclear translocation and ensuant pro-transcriptional activity. Thus, βAR desensitization and consequent scaffold assembly effectively retains the cytosolic homeostatic functions of ERK1/2 while inhibiting its pro-proliferative effects. We suggest these mechanisms specifically will prove quite promising in developing primary and adjuvant therapies mitigating glioma growth, angiogenesis, invasive potential, and angiogenesis. We suggest generating compounds and targeted mutations of the β adrenergic receptor favoring β arrestin binding and scaffold facilitated activation of ERK1/2 may hold potential promise and therapeutic benefit in adjuvantly treating most or all cancers. We hope our discussion will generate fruitful research endeavors seeking to exploit these mechanisms.","Ghali, George Zaki; Ghali, Michael George Zaki",Mol Biol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05427-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303958/,78

Investigating the causes and consequences of Internet addiction is fundamental to comprehend and prevent it. Therefore, the current study provided protective and promotive factors for undesired effects of social exclusion on Internet addiction. The study examined a moderated mediation model to test whether mindfulness moderated the mediating role of self-forgiveness in the association between social exclusion and Internet addiction among young adults. The participants of the present study included 358 undergraduate students attending a state university in Turkey. They ranged in age from 20 to 28 years (M = 21.89, SD = 1.95). The participants comprised 206 (57.5%) female and 152 (42.5%) male college young adults. Overall, the study findings indicated that self-forgiveness mediated the relationship between social exclusion and Internet addiction, and mindfulness moderated the mediating role of self-forgiveness in this association. Contending with negative outcomes of social exclusion and Internet addiction, and mitigating and buffering roles of self-forgiveness and mindfulness provide important implications to design prevention and intervention services for reducing Internet-related addictive behaviors.","Arslan, Gökmen; Coşkun, Muhammet",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716585/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00506-1,78
