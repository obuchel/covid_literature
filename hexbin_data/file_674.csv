The poor community awareness and knowledge of canine rabies have thwarted the realization of zero deaths from dog mediated human rabies. This study aimed to assess the awareness and knowledge of canine rabies in Kwara state. A total of 1,460 questionnaires were administered to respondents in the three senatorial zones of the state using open data kit (ODK) on mobile phones between September 2019 to January 2020. The rabies awareness rate was 38.1%. The mean knowledge score was 3.78 ± 2.15. Only 10.6% (n = 59/557) of the respondents had satisfactory knowledge of canine rabies. Respondents had poor knowledge of the mode of transmission, symptoms, prevention, and the control measures needed to eliminate canine rabies. Only 20.1% of respondents owned at least a dog. Dog owners were 3.85× (95% CI: 2.89, 5.13; p < 0.01) more likely to be aware of canine rabies and were 1.78× (95% CI: 1.22–2.60; p = 0.003) more likely to have satisfactory knowledge about canine rabies than non-dog owners. Respondents with tertiary education were at least 6.81× (95% CI: 4.24, 10.92; p < 0.01) more likely to be aware of rabies than respondents with no formal education. The findings of this study showed very low awareness and knowledge of canine rabies among residents of Kwara state. Mass sensitization of the populace on the dangers of rabies should be intensified. Such interventions should be targeted at the general public and dog owners.","Al-Mustapha, Ahmad I.; Tijani, Abubakar A.; Bamidele, Folashade O.; Muftau, Oyewo; Ibrahim, Ahmed; Abdulrahim, Ibrahim; Osu, Muhammad Shuaib; Kia, Grace; Patrick, Nguku; Endie, Waziri N.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928438/,674

42766,nieuws,2020-12-11,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 has attracted extensive drug searching interets for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although currently several of clinically used “old” drugs have been repurposed to this new disease for the urgent clinical investigation, there is still great demand for more effective therapies for the anti-infections. Here we report the discovery that an “old” drug Emetine could potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and displayed virus entry blocking effect in Vero cells at low dose. In addition, Emetine could significantly reduce the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein level and moderately reduce the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) protein level in the M1 polarized THP-1 macrophages. In vivo animal pharmacokinetics (PK) study revealed that Emetine was enriched in the lung tissue and had a long retention time (over 12 h). With 1 mg/kg single oral dose, the effective concentration of Emetine in lung was up to 1.8 μM (mice) and 1.6 μM (rats) at 12 h, which is over 200-fold higher than the EC(50) of the drug. The potent in vitro antiviral replication efficacy and the high enrichment in target tissue, combining with the well documented safety profiles in human indicate that low dose of Emetine might be a potentially effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection therapy.

54382,Agenda de la SFMC,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: It is still unclear how SARS-CoV-2 infection affect Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and how seroconversion against the virus might take place depending upon disease states and treatments. While the clinical guidance recommended to continue the biological maintenance therapy, some suggestions advice postponing the start of biologic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of all patients undergoing biologic therapy with infliximab, adalimumab, or vedolizumab for mild-to moderate CD followed in our institution were enrolled in the analysis. Demographic parameters, disease characteristics, clinical course, concomitant medications, COVID-19 related symptoms were examined. A naso-pharyngeal swab based RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was taken and SARS-CoV-2 serology test was performed using SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay (Abbott Core Laboratory) in children treated between March 4th 2020 and March 3rd 2021. Every time before hospital admission parents or patients completed a questionnaire exploring the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of the 62 children (35 boys, 56%) aged 2-19 years, median 15 ±3,51 years, 47 (76%) were treated with infliximab, 12 (19%) with adalimumab, and 3 (5%) with vedolizumab including 23 (37%) patients on the induction regiment. Of the entire cohort 11 (18%) patients were on a concomitant immunemodulator, including 6 (55%) on thiopurines, and 5 (45%) on methotrexate. A total of 19 (30%) CD patients tested positively for SARS-CoV-2. Only 5 (26%) patients reported symptoms including fever (n=3, 16%), sore throat (n=1, 5%), cough (n=2, 11%), loss of smell (n=2, 11%), loss of taste (n=1, 5%), and 14 (74%) were asymptomatic. All symptomatic patients had mild clinical presentation, and no patients required hospitalization. Swab test was positive in 8 (13%) patients, including 3 (5%) patients with nonreactive antibody titers. Of the 19 patients, 5 (23%) had elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, while 14 (74%) had elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM. Four had elevated both IgG and IgM titers, and 2 of them had acute, mild and resolved symptoms. Biologic agent administration was postponed for 6±5,4 days in 6 patients due to positive swab test, but no other management alteration was needed. No exacerbation of CD was observed attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection during either induction or maintenance therapy in the studied cohort CONCLUSION: Many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic or presented mild symptoms, and did not develop COVID-19. Biologic therapy did not worsen CD course. Serological testing might provide an accurate estimate of the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by detecting subclinical and asymptomatic infected individuals.","Sładek, M; Krucka-Kawalec, M; Wojtas, E; Jagielski, P; Stochel-Gaudyn, A",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194686/,674

220835,COVID-19 in children: Pathogenesis and current status,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this cohort study was to evaluate measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and varicella immunity among a population of adult employees receiving primary care in an employer-sponsored health center. METHODS: Participants were eligible for MMR and varicella immunity screening if they were an employee receiving primary care in an employer-sponsored health center between January 1, 2019 and November 1, 2020 who could not provide proof of immunization and 1) had it recommended by their provider, 2) specifically requested immunity testing (often because they had heard of measles outbreaks in their country of origin), or 3) were seen for an immigration physical for their Green Card application. RESULTS: Overall, 3494 patients were screened for their MMR immunity. Of these, 3057 were also screened for varicella immunity. Among these patients, 13.9% lacked measles immunity, 0.83% lacked immunity to all 3 components of MMR, and 13.2% lacked varicella immunity. Among the 262 patients who presented specifically for immunity screening, the rates of lacking immunity were higher for all conditions: 22.7% lacked measles immunity and 9.2% lacked varicella immunity. CONCLUSION: Given declines in immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is reason to be concerned that measles and varicella-associated morbidity and mortality may rise. Employers, especially those with large foreign-born populations or who require international travel may want to educate their populations about common contagious illnesses and offer immunity validation or vaccinations at no or low cost.","Ezeji-Okoye, Stephen; Bilodeau, Brittney L; Madhusudhan, Divya K; Pruett, Eileen; Thokala, Sujith; Bravata, Dena M",J Prim Care Community Health,,674

Faced with COVID-19, the most worrying pandemic in a century, proteomics researchers have made significant progress in understanding how the causative virus hijacks the host's cellular machinery and multiplies exponentially, how the disease can be diagnosed and how it develops, as well as its severity predicted. Numerous cellular targets of potential interest for the development of new antiviral drugs have been documented. Here, we present the most striking results obtained in the proteomics field over this first semester of the pandemic. The molecular machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is much more complex than initially believed, as many post-translational modifications can occur, leading to a myriad of proteoforms and a broad heterogeneity of viral particles. The interplay of protein-protein interactions, protein abundances, and post-translational modifications has yet to be fully documented to provide a full picture of this intriguing but lethal biological threat. Proteomics has the potential to provide rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by mass spectrometry proteotyping, and to further increase our knowledge of severe respiratory syndrome COVID-19 and its long-term health consequences.

India is now the 2nd most-affected nation with more than 48,00,000 cases and 79,000 deaths. Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation the number of deaths is almost 1/3rd of the USA and ½ of Brazil. There has, however, been no experience published from non-COVID designated hospitals where the aim is to manage non-infected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. METHODS: We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (non-trauma) done in the past 5 months (March- July 2020) in our institute which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. RESULTS: We operated a total of 630 cases(non-trauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (p=0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared to the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of Rapid Antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into three zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists. CONCLUSION: We present a patient management protocol for non-COVID designated hospitals in high volume centers with the constraints of a lower-middle-income nation and demonstrate its effectiveness. Strict zoning targeted testing and effective triage can help in management during the pandemic.","Deora, Harsh; Dange, Preetham; Shashidhar, Abhinith; Tyagi, Gaurav; Srinivas, Dwarakanath",World neurosurgery (Online),,674
256188,Estudio de Sero-Epidemiología de la Infección por SARS-CoV-2 en Profesionales Sanitarios de un Departamento Sanitario,2020,"Feedback on student answers and even during intermediate steps in their solutions to open-ended questions is an important element in math education. Such feedback can help students correct their errors and ultimately lead to improved learning outcomes. Most existing approaches for automated student solution analysis and feedback require manually constructing cognitive models and anticipating student errors for each question. This process requires significant human effort and does not scale to most questions used in homework and practices that do not come with this information. In this paper, we analyze students' step-by-step solution processes to equation solving questions in an attempt to scale up error diagnostics and feedback mechanisms developed for a small number of questions to a much larger number of questions. Leveraging a recent math expression encoding method, we represent each math operation applied in solution steps as a transition in the math embedding vector space. We use a dataset that contains student solution steps in the Cognitive Tutor system to learn implicit and explicit representations of math operations. We explore whether these representations can i) identify math operations a student intends to perform in each solution step, regardless of whether they did it correctly or not, and ii) select the appropriate feedback type for incorrect steps. Experimental results show that our learned math operation representations generalize well across different data distributions.","Zhang, Mengxue; Wang, Zichao; Baraniuk, Richard; Lan, Andrew",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12047v1.pdf,674

In the context of Covid-19, frontline health care workers comprise a particularly relevant research population in light of their risks of viral exposure and psychological strain, among other factors. They may therefore be targeted for research conducted at their place of employment and benefit from participating in such research. Beyond Covid-19, there are other circumstances in which health care workers may be considered for inclusion in research conducted by or with the involvement of their colleagues and employers. As investigators, sponsors, institutional review boards, and others assess the ethical permissibility of these scenarios, as well as relevant protections, we recommend systematic consideration of social and scientific value, validity, fairness, risks and benefits, voluntary consent, respect, and independent review. There is often good reason to specifically target health care workers for inclusion in Covid-19 research (beyond convenience), and they should not be excluded from research offering the prospect of direct benefit. However, additional safeguards may be necessary in employer-based research to avoid scientific bias, promote voluntariness, and solicit stakeholder input. Research personnel should be permitted to enroll in their own Covid-19 studies only when participation offers them the prospect of unique benefits.","Lynch, Holly Fernandez; Lundin, Dawn; Meagher, Emma A",Ethics Hum Res,,674

312305,"Certificat de vaccination contre la Covid-19: un «passe» transitoire pour relancer l’activité du pays et faire adhérer à la vaccination*,**",2021,"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is one of the leading causes of pregnancy-related death. Prenatal health care providers can offer critical screening and support to pregnant people who experience IPV. During the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order, mobile apps may offer such people the opportunity to continue receiving screening and support services. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine cases of IPV that were reported on a prenatal care app before and during the implementation of COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. METHODS: The number of patients who underwent voluntary IPV screening and the incidence rate of IPV were determined by using a prenatal care app that was disseminated to patients from a single, large health care system. We compared the IPV screening frequencies and IPV incidence rates of patients who started using the app before the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order, to those of patients who started using the app during the shelter-in-place order. RESULTS: We found 552 patients who started using the app within 60 days prior to the enforcement of the shelter-in-place order, and 407 patients who used the app at the start of shelter-in-place enforcement until the order was lifted. The incidence rates of voluntary IPV screening for new app users during the two time periods were similar (before sheltering in place: 252/552, 46%; during sheltering in place: 163/407, 40%). The overall use of the IPV screening tool increased during the shelter-in-place order. A slight, nonsignificant increase in the incidence of physical, sexual, and psychological violence during the shelter-in-place order was found across all app users (P=.56). Notably, none of the patients who screened positively for IPV had mentions of IPV in their medical charts. CONCLUSIONS: App-based screening for IPV is feasible during times when in-person access to health care providers is limited. Our results suggest that the incidence of IPV slightly increased during the shelter-in-place order. App-based screening may also address the needs of those who are unwilling or unable to share their IPV experiences with their health care provider.","Krishnamurti, Tamar; Davis, Alexander L; Quinn, Beth; Castillo, Anabel F; Martin, Kelly L; Simhan, Hyagriv N",J Med Internet Res,,674

Currently, there are only limited studies focusing on a long-term effect of HBCT, which means it is essential to do more research in this study field. AIM: This study aimed at investigating a 1-year effect of a randomized controlled study using Cardiac Rehabilitation through the Global Position System (CR-GPS) compared to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Study focused on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with coronary heart disease (CAD). DESIGN: A long-term follow-up of a randomized study. SETTING: Patients were enrolled, and the intervention was performed in an outpatient or homebased model. The results were obtained and evaluated in a hospital. POPULATION: Patients who participated in the CR-GPS study were diagnosed with CAD with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the study were eligible participants who had previously completed a 12-week HBCT program using a wrist heart rate (HR) monitor or attended a traditional CBCR. Primary outcome was the change in CRF expressed in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), and the secondary outcomes were self-reported HRQL, objectively measured anthropometric characteristics, and mortality and hospitalization rates. RESULTS: 44 patients (76%) completed the long-term follow-up. The average peak of pVO2 was higher after 1-year follow-up in the telerehabilitation group (HBCT 25.5 ml / kg / min compared to the active control group CBCR 23.6 ml / kg / min p = 0.047). No statistically significant difference between the two groups was found after long-term follow-up for the parameter HRQL. For both groups, there was a significant improvement in the range of perceptions of general health. There was no death case and no difference in hospitalization rate between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the HBCT model. It has been demonstrated that it induces satisfactory long-term effects in pVO2, exercise performance, and perceived general health in CAD patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Cardiovascular telerehabilitation using wrist HR monitors is a feasible and effective rehabilitation method that can help patients eliminate barriers that prevent them from using CBCR programs. Especially in the current global situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, this topic is becoming increasingly important.","Batalik, Ladislav; Dosbaba, Filip; Hartman, Martin; Konecny, Vladimir; Batalikova, Katerina; Spinar, Jindrich",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

METHODS: The study included 63 patients, with hip or knee OA, who had been scheduled for arthroplasty that was postponed because of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated by telephone interviews during the first week after lockdown, in the fourth week, and again at the end of the lockdown. Patients rated their pain level on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) and completed WOMAC, SF-12 and Tegner activity scale (TAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: VAS and WOMAC scores increased significantly during lockdown, while physical activity significantly decreased. At the final evaluation, VAS and WOMAC showed a significant negative correlation with TAS. The SF-12 subscale scores showed a significant decrease of the physical component during the lockdown, while the mental component remained largely unchanged. Patients with knee OA showed a faster progress of pain compared to those with hip OA. 50 patients (79%) stated they wished to have arthroplasty as soon as possible.

CASE PRESENTATION: A woman in her sixties was admitted to hospital after ten days of flu-like symptoms. She was confirmed as Sars-CoV-2-positive and experienced a steady decrease in oxygen saturation (SaO2), despite being given increasing amounts of supplemental oxygen. On day three she was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She had a three-phased trajectory where ventilation was extremely challenging, prone positioning and permissive hypercapnia were necessary, and inflammation markers increased. There was no improvement in the third phase, and on day 19 on the ventilator, we decided to give her corticosteroids. Two days later she could be weaned from the ventilator. INTERPRETATION: In our patient with severe ARDS from COVID-19, we saw rapid improvement after she was given corticosteroids, and her case is a contribution to the discussion regarding use of corticosteroids for the most severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Ofstad, Eirik Hugaas; Hauglid, Tore; Tollåli, Terje; Vasiljevic, Katarina Radisavljevic; Dybwik, Knut",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,674

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health-care workers (HCWs). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCWs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. INTERPRETATION: The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCWs, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for nonurgent indications, and if necessary to perform, HCWs should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.","Wahidi, Momen M; Shojaee, Samira; Lamb, Carla R; Ost, David; Maldonado, Fabien; Eapen, George; Caroff, Daniel A; Stevens, Michael P; Ouellette, Daniel R; Lilly, Craig; Gardner, Donna D; Glisinski, Kristen; Pennington, Kelly; Alalawi, Raed",Chest,,674

The aim of this study was to investigate C. vespertilionis as a potential vector and reservoir of Borrelia species. In 2015 and 2018 in south-central Sweden, C. vespertilionis ticks were collected from a wooden bat box harboring Soprano pipistrelle bats, Pipistrellus pygmaeus. In addition, one C. vespertilionis tick found inside a house in southern Sweden in 2019 was collected. Ticks were screened for Borrelia spp. using a genus-specific quantitative PCR assay. The Borrelia species of the positive specimens were determined by conventional PCR followed by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. A total of 24% (22 of 92) of the analyzed C. vespertilionis ticks were Borrelia-positive. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the bacteria belong to the relapsing fever group of borreliae;some of them appear to be identical with Borrelia sp. CPB1, a spirochete only found twice before—in the United Kingdom and in France. Our results also indicate a temporal and spatial distribution of this Borrelia species. Since C. vespertilionis occasionally bites humans, and since it exhibits a high prevalence of Borrelia bacteria, it is possible that it presents a risk of human disease. Further studies are needed to characterize Borrelia sp. CPB1 to determine if it is human-pathogenic and to determine if C. vespertilionis is a vector and/or reservoir of this agent.","Jaenson, Thomas G. T.; Wilhelmsson, Peter",Microorganisms,,674
351143,"Horloge interne, sommeil et désynchronisation des enfants et des adolescents confinés",2020,"BACKGROUND: Many people are dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but consensus guidance on palliative care in COVID-19 is lacking. This new life-threatening disease has put healthcare systems under pressure, with the increased need of palliative care provided to many patients by clinicians who have limited prior experience in this field. Therefore, we aimed to make consensus recommendations for palliative care for patients with COVID-19 using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. METHODS: We invited 90 international experts to complete an online survey including stating their agreement, or not, with 14 potential recommendations. At least 70% agreement on directionality was needed to provide consensus recommendations. If consensus was not achieved on the first round, a second round was conducted. RESULTS: 68 (75.6%) experts responded in the first round. Most participants were experts in palliative care, respiratory medicine or critical care medicine. In the first round, consensus was achieved on 13 recommendations based upon indirect evidence and clinical experience. In the second round, 58 (85.3%) out of 68 of the first-round experts responded, resulting in consensus for the 14th recommendation. CONCLUSION: This multi-national task force provides consensus recommendations for palliative care for patients with COVID-19 concerning: advance care planning; (pharmacological) palliative treatment of breathlessness; clinician-patient communication; remote clinician-family communication; palliative care involvement in patients with serious COVID-19; spiritual care; psychosocial care; and bereavement care. Future studies are needed to generate empirical evidence for these recommendations.","Janssen, Daisy J A; Ekström, Magnus; Currow, David C; Johnson, Miriam J; Maddocks, Matthew; Simonds, Anita K; Tonia, Thomy; Marsaa, Kristoffer",Eur. respir. j,,674

The insurance risks are captured via a multidimensional jump-diffusion process with a multivariate compound Poisson process with dependent components, which allows to model claims that occur in different lines simultaneously. Using Lagrangian convex duality techniques, we provide a general verification-type result for investment-underwriting strategies that maximize expected utility from the dividend payout rate and final wealth over a finite-time horizon. We also study the precautionary effect on earnings retention of risk aversion, prudence, portfolio constraints and multivariate insurance risk. We find an explicit characterization of optimal strategies under CRRA preferences. Numerical results for two-dimensional examples with policy limits illustrate the impact of co-integration for ALM with multiple (dependent and independent) sources of insurance risk.","Serrano, Rafael; Castillo, Camilo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08466v2.pdf,674

Some airlines block their airplanes' middle seats to preserve social distancing among seated passengers. In this context, we present six new boarding methods and compare their performance with that of the two best boarding methods used to date with social distancing. We evaluate the eight boarding methods using three performance metrics related to passenger health and one operational metric (airplane boarding time) for a one-door airplane. The three health metrics reflect the risks of virus spread by passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g. headrests and seat arms) and consider the amount of aisle social distancing between adjacent boarding passengers walking towards their seats. For an airline that highly values the avoidance of window seat risk, the best method to use is one of the new methods: back-to-front by row - WilMA, though it will result in a longer time to complete boarding of the airplane. Airlines placing greater emphasis on fast boarding times- while still providing favorable values for the health metrics-will be best served by using new methods back-to-front by row - WilMA - offset 2 and - offset 3 when aisle social distancing is 1 m and 2 m respectively.","John Milne, R; Delcea, Camelia; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian",Saf Sci,,674

General precautions for infections prevention have been used, including frequent hands washing and environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures. Physical distancing in jail is extremely chal-lenging, and we deem that it was still impossible to apply it, despite the release of almost 8000 detainees, among those at greater health risk. Measures have been also ordered to limit external contacts with detainees, including a substantial or absolute sus-pension of visits from relatives, operators and lawyers, replaced by video meetings. Quarantine and isolation of suspect cases has also been ordered, including new prisoners. Despite unfavorable premises the analysis we did on available data indicates lower infection rate and lethality rate in prison than in general population. In this paper a synthetic framework of the sanitary problems in detention will be provided, then the data will be analyzed, providing possible interpretations potentially useful for the management of the pandemic at the community level. Infectious surveillance, compliance with sanitation standards, early treatment of suspected cases, lower mean age, efficacious isolation and quarantine strategies may explain the better outcomes in Italian penitentiary system, also in the impossibility to systematically apply physical distancing. © Pensa MultiMedia Editore – Rassegna Italiana di Criminologia-Anno 49° (XIV nuova serie) n. 4/2020.","Carabellese, F.; Petroni, G.; Ferracuti, S.; Ferorelli, D.; Solarino, B.; Vernaglione, S.; Pallocci, M.; Marsella, L.

BACKGROUND: Due to increasing ED visits annually, an efficient work environment has become one of the main concerns in designing EDs. According to the literature, an efficient work environment and teamwork improve healthcare outcomes and positively impact staff satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs faced various changes such as workflow and space usage. Few studies explored staff perceptions about the influence of design features on efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. METHOD: An online survey with 14 open- and closed-ended questions was distributed among ED staff members to collect data about unit design features that impact efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. RESULTS: The central nursing station was one of the preferred configurations that increased efficiency and teamwork in EDs. Decentralizing disposal rooms in small-size EDs and decentralizing the medication room in large-size EDs with more than 65 exam rooms can decrease staff walking steps. Flexibility to expand treatment spaces on demand, one-way track circulation path, and changing the air pressure in COVID-19 treatment areas were some of the staff suggestions for future EDs. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge that EDs' physical environments can impact efficiency and teamwork among staff and, consequently, healthcare outcomes. Compartmentalization of the ED layout can reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Ahmadpour, Sahar; Bayramzadeh, Sara; Aghaei, Parsa",HERD,,674

We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers.

457763,Dyspnée laryngée et Covid-19,2021,"Background: Large gatherings are associated with the spread of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19); however, transmission dynamics are not well understood. We investigated a cluster of COVID-19 cases in returning Australian residents who attended wedding events in Bali, Indonesia, during 15- 21 March 2020. Attendees participated in various social events and were in close proximity, providing multiple opportunities for transmission. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 41 attendees, of whom 17 participated in a structured interview that included history of illness, risk exposures and event attendance. We obtained data for the remaining 24 participants through corroborative histories and public health unit case investigations. Results: COVID-19 was identified in 56% of attendees (23/41), with illness onset between 21 March and 2 April 2020. One secondary case was identified in a household contact of an attendee. The median age of cases was 31 years (range 3-64). One case was hospitalised and did not require critical care. There were no deaths. No cases occurred among six attendees who left prior to the actual wedding day. Guests attended multiple events and participated in high-risk transmission behaviours such as shaking hands, kissing, dancing, sharing drinks and sharing shisha (water pipes). Attack rates ranged from 64% to 87% for different exposures. We could not identify a single risk exposure that accounted for all cases; it is therefore likely there were multiple episodes of transmission. Conclusion: Our investigation identified a high attack rate of COVID-19 among a cohort of wedding event attendees. Attendees engaged in close physical contact, shared drinks and shisha, and were in close proximity during the wedding events, which may have contributed to the high attack rate. This outbreak highlights the significant role social events can play in transmission of COVID-19 and underscores why it is important to limit gatherings and close physical contact to control the spread of the virus.","Ravindran, Bhavi; Hogarth, Freya; Williamson, Kirsten; Wright, Rose; Kirk, Martyn; Dalton, Craig",,,674

This study determines correlations between program reputation and social media activity and popularity, specifically among otolaryngology residency programs. METHODS: Accredited programs, excluding military and osteopathic, in the United States were included. Activity and popularity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram were assessed during the same 7-month period from 2016 to 2020. Doximity Residency reputation scores (dividing programs into quartiles) and US News & World Report (comparing programs affiliated with top hospitals versus those with unranked hospitals) were utilized to compare differences based on reputation. RESULTS: Of 104 programs, 91 (88%) had social media accounts. Instagram and Twitter were more commonly used than Facebook, with 78 (75%), 49 (47%), and 42 (40%) accounts, respectively. The cumulative use of all three platforms grew yearly, while Twitter (R2 = 0.9863) and Instagram (R2 = 0.9955) presence increased exponentially. Doximity's top quartile programs had more Facebook (P = .020), Twitter (P < .001), and Instagram (P = .102) accounts. First-quartile programs also adopted each platform months before fourth-quartile programs. Stratified by US News & World Report, ranked programs had more social media accounts, with 24 (53%) on Facebook (P = .028), 32 (71%) on Twitter (P < .001), and 37 (82%) on Instagram (P = .155). Programs with higher reputations were more active and exhibited increased likes and followers over time. CONCLUSION: Social media use among otolaryngology programs has grown exponentially, with Instagram and Twitter becoming the dominant platforms. Higher ranked programs are more active on social media, have more followers, and adopt social media earlier.

Prior conceptual graph construction approaches typically extract high-frequent, coarse-grained, and time-invariant concepts from formal texts. In real applications, however, it is necessary to extract less-frequent, fine-grained, and time-varying conceptual knowledge and build taxonomy in an evolving manner. In this paper, we introduce an approach to implementing and deploying the conceptual graph at Alibaba. Specifically, We propose a framework called AliCG which is capable of a) extracting fine-grained concepts by a novel bootstrapping with alignment consensus approach, b) mining long-tail concepts with a novel low-resource phrase mining approach, c) updating the graph dynamically via a concept distribution estimation method based on implicit and explicit user behaviors.

Enabled by global digital connectedness, collaboration has become a constant theme throughout the pandemic, resulting in the expedition of the scientific process (including vaccine development), rapid consolidation of global outbreak data and statistics, and experimentation with novel partnerships. To document the evolution of these collaborative efforts, the authors collected illustrative examples as the pandemic unfolded, supplemented with publications from the JMIR COVID-19 Special Issue. Over 60 projects rooted in collaboration are categorized into five main themes: knowledge dissemination, data propagation, crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence, and hardware design and development. They highlight the numerous ways that citizens, industry professionals, researchers, and academics have come together worldwide to consolidate information and produce products to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, researchers and citizen scientists scrambled to access quality data within an overwhelming quantity of information. As global curated data sets emerged, derivative works such as visualizations or models were developed that depended on consistent data and would fail when there were unanticipated changes. Crowdsourcing was used to collect and analyze data, aid in contact tracing, and produce personal protective equipment by sharing open designs for 3D printing. An international consortium of entrepreneurs and researchers created a ventilator based on an open-source design. A coalition of nongovernmental organizations and governmental organizations, led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, created a shared open resource of over 200,000 research publications about COVID-19 and subsequently offered cash prizes for the best solutions to 17 key questions involving artificial intelligence. A thread of collaboration weaved throughout the pandemic response, which will shape future efforts. Novel partnerships will cross boundaries to create better processes, products, and solutions to consequential societal challenges.","Bernardo, Theresa; Sobkowich, Kurtis Edward; Forrest, Russell Othmer; Stewart, Luke Silva; D039,; Agostino, Marcelo; Perez Gutierrez, Enrique; Gillis, Daniel",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,674

Along with their traditional relevance in helminth immunity and allergy, eosinophils have been progressively attributed important roles in a number of homeostatic and pathologic situations. This review aims at summarizing available evidence about eosinophils functions in homeostasis, infections, allergic and autoimmune disorders, and solid and hematological cancers.Their structural and biological features have been described, along with their physiological behavior. This includes their chemokines, cytokines, granular contents, and extracellular traps. Besides, pathogenic- and eosinophilic-mediated disorders have also been addressed, with the aim of highlighting their role in Th2-driven inflammation. In allergy, eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. They are also fundamentally involved in autoimmune disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In infections, eosinophils are involved in protection not only from parasites but also from fungi, viruses, and bacteria. In solid cancers, local eosinophilic infiltration is variably associated with an improved or worsened prognosis, depending on the histotype. In hematologic neoplasms, eosinophilia can be the consequence of a dysregulated cytokine production or the result of mutations affecting the myeloid lineage.Recent experimental evidence was thoroughly reviewed, with findings which elicit a complex role for eosinophils, in a tight balance between host defense and tissue damage. Eventually, emerging evidence about eosinophils in COVID-19 infection was also discussed.","Folci, Marco; Ramponi, Giacomo; Arcari, Ivan; Zumbo, Aurora; Brunetta, Enrico",Adv. exp. med. biol,,674

However, little data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide details on how medical students have been affected by the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The survey included questions about how the participants' mental status had changed from before to after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). RESULTS: Out of 717 medical students, 473 (66.0%) participated in the study. In total, 29.8% (141/473) of the students reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education would be ineffective compared with in-person learning. The participants' subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (P<.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.19-3.28) as did those who said they would request food aid (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16-3.44) and mental health care resources (OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07-6.15). CONCLUSIONS: Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend that educators inform learners that online learning is not inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.","Nishimura, Yoshito; Ochi, Kanako; Tokumasu, Kazuki; Obika, Mikako; Hagiya, Hideharu; Kataoka, Hitomi; Otsuka, Fumio",J Med Internet Res,,674

Using W-LSTM model, we have predicted the beginning and end of the current cycle of COVID-19 in several countries. Performance of the model was validated as satisfactory in 82% of the 50 test countries, while asking for prediction for 10 days beyond the period of training. Accuracy of the above prediction with days beyond training was assessed in comparison with the MAPE that the model gave with cumulative global data. The model was applied to study correlation between the growth of infection and deaths, and a number of effectors that may influence the epidemic. The model identified age groups, trade with China, air traffic, country temperature and CoV-2 virus types as the likely effectors of infection and virulence leading to deaths. The predictors likely to promote or suppress the epidemic were identified. Some of the predictors had significant effect on the shape parameters of Weibull distribution. The model can function on cloud, take inputs in real time and handle large data country wise, at low costs to make predictions dynamically.

In this work, the whole genome of the marine isolate Rhodococcus sp. I2R was sequenced and analyzed by antiSMASH for the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters. The strain was cultivated in 22 different growth media and the generated extracts were subjected to metabolomic analysis and functional screening. Notably, only a single growth condition induced the production of unique compounds, which were partially purified and structurally characterized by liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS).

Little is known about risk factors for incarceration among older adults experiencing homelessness. To develop targeted interventions, there is a need to understand their risk factors for incarceration. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and risk factors associated with incarceration in a cohort of older adults experiencing homelessness. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study with interviews every 6 months for a median of 5.8 years. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited adults ≥50 years old and homeless at baseline (n=433) via population-based sampling. MAIN MEASURES: Our dependent variable was incident incarceration, defined as one night in jail or prison per 6-month follow-up period after study enrollment. Independent variables included socioeconomic status, social, health, housing, and prior criminal justice involvement. KEY RESULTS: Participants had a median age of 58 years and were predominantly men (75%) and Black (80%). Seventy percent had at least one chronic medical condition, 12% reported heavy drinking, and 38% endorsed moderate-severe use of cocaine, 8% of amphetamines, and 7% of opioids.

METHODS: Second-year medical students enrolled in this course in 2019 (in-person) and 2020 (online). The attendance rate, satisfaction in the course evaluation survey, and academic achievement on the written final examination were utilized to compare the two different methods of course delivery. The medical students who took the online course were also asked about their preferences regarding the method of course delivery and the advantages and drawbacks of each method of online lectures. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the attendance rate and overall satisfaction between the two groups. The mean score on the written examination of the online course (84.1±19.6) showed comparable effects to the in-person course (78.0±18.3). The percentages of students who achieved high performance (55.5%) and the achieved minimum requirement (95.9%) were also maintained compared to the in-person course (14.6% and 93.6%, respectively). Medical students preferred the online course to the in-person course; in particular, they preferred prerecorded videos over live streaming online lectures. CONCLUSION: The participation, satisfaction, and the academic achievement of the online course were comparable to those of the in-person course.

Previously, we determined the virus stability on different types of surfaces under indoor and seasonal climatic conditions. SARS-CoV-2 survived the longest on surfaces under winter conditions, followed by spring/fall and summer conditions, suggesting the seasonal pattern of stability on surfaces. However, under natural conditions, the virus is secreted in various biological fluids from infected humans. In this respect, it remains unclear how long the virus survives in various types of biological fluids. This study explores SARS-CoV-2 stability in virus-spiked human biological fluids under different environmental conditions by determining the virus half-life. The virus was stable for up to 21 days in nasal mucus, sputum, saliva, tear, urine, blood, and semen; it remained infectious significantly longer under winter and spring/fall conditions than under summer conditions. In contrast, the virus was only stable up to 24 h in feces and breast milk. These findings demonstrate the potential risk of infectious biological fluids in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and have implications for its seasonality.","Kwon, Taeyong; Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Richt, Juergen A.",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10050540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946190/,674

However, these studies are rarely integrated in the nursing curriculum, and even when they are, the focus is usually on healthcare personnel who collaborated with the Nazi regime. This article aims to bridge this gap by analyzing a comprehensive requisite curriculum on the Holocaust for graduate nursing students. We emphasize the work of Jewish healthcare professionals during the Holocaust and the dilemmas they faced, as well as the trauma and resilience of Holocaust survivors, their treatment today, and implications for treating other patients. This article examines how studying these issues affected the graduate students. It analyzes the reflective accounts written by the students, using qualitative content analysis and Grounded Theory. The findings suggest that students received tools to act professionally and empathetically while demonstrating greater sensitivity to the patients’ identity, past experiences, trauma, and how the hospital as a “total institution” affects them. Many of the students developed conscious leadership. The program used a personalized pedagogical approach that contributed to experiential learning but was also emotionally challenging for the participants. We recommend including Holocaust studies as a requisite component in nursing programs worldwide.","Orr, Zvika; Romem, Anat",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501558/,674

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to describe WIC participants’ experiences with remote service delivery and recertification during the pandemic. Participants included mothers and infants who participated in a WIC-based intervention between June 2019-August 2020. All participants (N = 246) were invited to complete a follow-up survey between November 2020-February 2021; 185 mothers completed the survey. The survey assessed sociodemographics, employment, food security, experiences with remote WIC recertification and service delivery, and experiences with obtaining WIC foods during the pandemic. Average age for mothers was 29.2 ± 6.3 years and for infants was 17.7 ± .2 months; 80% (n = 147) identified as Hispanic. Approximately 34% (n = 62) of participants reported very low or low food security and 40% (n = 64) had difficulties buying WIC foods during the pandemic. Among participants who recalled providing documentation of income and address virtually, the majority felt comfortable providing information via email (60%) and text messaging (72%). Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with remote methods of service delivery, as well as overall satisfaction with the WIC program during the pandemic. While ~ 25% of study participants preferred for all WIC services to remain remote, 75% still desired at least some in-person contact with WIC staff after the pandemic. In conclusion, remote methods of WIC service delivery addressed existing barriers to WIC participation and were well-received by study participants.","Ventura, Alison K.; Martinez, Catherine E.; Whaley, Shannon E.",J Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557992/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-01026-8,674

Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have been among hospitalized patients, which may have exaggerated risk estimates of severe outcomes because all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pregnant population were not included. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective population-based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy to non-infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to ensure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. RESULTS: Among 82 682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID-19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.41) and being foreign born (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.64). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19 included obesity (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.00-7.51), smoking (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.58-13.90), infection after gestational age (GA) 22 weeks (GA 22-27 weeks: OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.16-12.29; GA 28-36 weeks: OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.60-14.12), and having asthma (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.39-14.79). We found no difference in any obstetrical or neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 20 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy required admission to hospital due to COVID-19. Risk factors for admission comprised obesity, smoking, asthma, and infection after GA 22 weeks. Severe adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were rare.","Aabakke, Anna J M; Krebs, Lone; Petersen, Tanja G; Kjeldsen, Frank S; Corn, Giulia; Wøjdemann, Karen; Ibsen, Mette H; Jonsdottir, F; Rønneberg, Elisabeth; Andersen, Charlotte S; Sundtoft, Iben; Clausen, Tine; Milbak, Julie; Burmester, Lars; Lindved, Birgitte; Thorsen-Meyer, Annette; Khalil, Mohammed R; Henriksen, Birgitte; Jønsson, Lisbeth; Andersen, Lise L T; Karlsen, Kamilla K; Pedersen, Monica L; Klemmensen, Åse; Vestgaard, Marianne; Thisted, Dorthe; Tatla, Manrinder K; Andersen, Line S; Brülle, Anne-Line; Gulbech, Arense; Andersson, Charlotte B; Farlie, Richard; Hansen, Lea; Hvidman, Lone; Sørensen, Anne N; Rathcke, Sidsel L; Rubin, Katrine H; Petersen, Lone K; Jørgensen, Jan S; Stokholm, Lonny; Bliddal, Mette",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467518/; https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14252,674
