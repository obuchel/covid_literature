DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. PATIENTS: Surgical and cardiovascular patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy during a 2-year period from December 2016 to November 2018. SETTING: Two ICUs at a single academic medical center. INTERVENTION: Physical mobility and ambulation while on continuous renal replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Therapy data including ICU Mobility Scale score, number of physical therapy sessions with and without ambulation and gait distance, along with safety data including filter life, safety events, and mortality were analyzed. The cohort of patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy during the 2-year period was 206. Of these, 172 (83.49%) received simultaneous physical therapy. The median ICU Mobility Scale was 5 (interquartile range, 4–7) over a total of 1,517 physical therapy sessions. Ambulation with concomitant continuous renal replacement therapy connected was achieved in 78 patients (37.86%). There were 377 ambulation sessions (24.85% of all sessions) with a mean of 4.83 (sds 4.94) ambulation sessions per ambulatory patient. Patients walked an average of 888.53 feet (sd 1,365.50) while on continuous renal replacement therapy and a daily average of 150.61 feet (sd 133.50). In-hospital mortality was lowest for patients who ambulated (17.95%) and highest for patients who received no therapy (73.53%). Continuous renal replacement therapy filter life was longest for patients who ambulated (2,047.20 min [sd 1,086.50 min]), and shortest in patients who received no therapy (1,682.20 min [sd 1,343.80 min]). One safety event was reported during this time (0.0007% of all physical therapy sessions). CONCLUSIONS: Ambulation while on continuous renal replacement therapy was not associated with an increased risk of safety events and was feasible with the use of nonfemoral catheters and dialysis equipment with internal batteries.","Bento, Haley A.; Dummer, Danica; Lohse, Bryan D.; Noren, Christopher; Tonna, Joseph E.",Crit Care Explor,767,1

Method Twenty-five patients with 40 liver lesions of different histological origin were retrospectively analysed. Lesions were ablated following standard protocol, using 1) conventional US-guidance, 2) manual registered volume navigation (mVNav), 3) automatic registered (aVNav) or 4) CT-guidance. In case of ultrasonographically inconspicuous lesions, conventional US-guidance was abandoned and mVNav was used. If mVNav was also unsuccessful, the procedure was either continued with aVNav or CT-guidance. The number, size and location of the lesions targeted using the different approaches were documented. Results Of the 40 lesions, sixteen (40.0 %) could be targeted with conventional US-guidance only, sixteen (40.0 %) with mVNav, three (7.5 %) with aVNav and five (12.5 %) only through the use of CT-guidance. Of the three alternatives (mVNav, aVNav and CT only) the mean size of the lesions targeted using mVNav (9.1 ± 4.6 mm) was significantly smaller from those targeted using US-guidance only (20.4 ± 9.4 mm; p < 0.001). The location of the lesions did not influence the selection of the modality used to guide the ablation. Conclusions In our cohort, mVNav allowed the ablation procedure to become less dependent on the use of CT. mVNav supported the ablation of lesions smaller than those that could be ablated with US only and doubled the application of minimally-invasive US-guided ablations.","Meershoek, Philippa; van den Berg, Nynke S; Lutjeboer, Jacob; Burgmans, Mark C; van der Meer, Rutger W; van Rijswijk, Catharina S P; van Oosterom, Matthias N; van Erkel, Arian R; van Leeuwen, Fijs W B",European journal of radiology open,767,25

The aim of this study was to reveal the clinical factors related to VE in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), and investigate the clinical significance of VE. METHODS Between February 2009 and September 2016, 363 consecutive patients with LC underwent capsule endoscopy for diagnosing portal hypertensive enteropathy at Hiroshima University Hospital. We evaluated the relationship between the presence of VE and patients' clinical characteristics, findings of esophagogastroduodenoscopy and computed tomography, and survival time. RESULTS Villous edema was observed in 131 patients (36%), and severe lesions were found in 71 (20%). The presence of VE was significantly greater in patients with Child-Pugh classification B or C, esophageal varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG), ascites, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), and splenomegaly. In multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh class B or C, esophageal varices, PVT, and splenomegaly were significant predictive factors for the presence of VE. Severe VE was significantly greater in patients with Child-Pugh class B or C, serum albumin level ≤ 3.2 mg/dL, PHG, and PVT. In multivariate analysis, PHG, Child-Pugh class B or C, PVT, were significant predictive factors for severe VE. CONCLUSIONS Clinical factors related to portal hypertension were significantly correlated with VE. In particular PVT was correlated with the appearance and exacerbation of VE. Periodic capsule endoscopy in LC patients may lead to early detection of portal hypertension and PVT.","Otani, Ichiro; Oka, Shiro; Tanaka, Shinji; Tsuboi, Akiyoshi; Kunihara, Sayoko; Nagaoki, Yuko; Aikata, Hiroshi; Chayama, Kazuaki",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,767,28

Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were frequently associated with severity of the disease. WBC and neutrophil counts showed an increase, while lymphocyte counts decreased in patients with severe infection suggesting a possible neutrophil mediated organ damage, while immune activity may be diminished with decrease in lymphocytes leading to disease severity. Increase in SGOT, SGPT and blood urea suggests the functional deficiencies of liver, heart, and kidney in patients who succumbed to the disease when compared to the group of recovered patients. The WGS analysis showed that these isolates were classified into two clades: I/A3i, and A2a (four according to GISAID: O, L, GR, and GH). Further, WGS phylogeny and travel history together indicate possible transmission from Middle East and Europe.

The proposed model describes the evolution of a class of zoonotic infections where the pathogen is shared by m host species and transmitted by p arthropod vector species. In each host, the infectious period is structured into n stages with a corresponding infectiousness parameter to each vector species. We determine the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and investigate the dynamics of the systems when this threshold is less or greater than one. We show that the dynamics of the multi-host, multi-stage, and multi-vector system is completely determined by the basic reproduction number and the structure of the host-vector network configuration. Particularly, we prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) whenever [Formula: see text] , and a unique strongly endemic equilibrium exists and is GAS if [Formula: see text] and the host-vector configuration is irreducible.

Shared room occupancy is recommended when isolation rooms are insufficient. However, there is little evidence of the applicability of shared and single room occupancy for patients with COVID‐19 to determine whether shared room occupancy is feasible. COVID‐19‐infected patients admitted to the Daegu Dongsan Hospital of Keimyung University from 21 February 2020 to 20 April 2020 were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to hospital rooms. Clinical symptoms, underlying diseases and epidemiological data of patients were analysed after dividing participants into a shared room occupancy group (group A) and a single room occupancy group (group B). Outcomes analysed included microbiological cure rates, time to clinical symptom improvement, time to defervescence and negative‐to‐positive conversion rates of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during hospitalization. A total of 666 patients were included in this study, 535 and 131 patients in groups A and B, respectively. Group B included more underlying conditions, such as pregnancy and solid organ transplantation, and was more closely associated with severe pneumonia during hospitalization. Besides, no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of negative PCR rates at HD 7 and 14, conversion rates of PCR results from negative‐to‐positive, as well as time to the improvement of clinical symptoms, and time to defervescence were observed. Our results suggest that the shared room occupancy of patients with mild symptoms could be an alternative to single room occupancy during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Yeon; Kwon, Yong Shik; Kim, Jin Young; Park, Jae Seok; Park, Sunggyun; Ryoo, Namhee; Kim, Hyun ah",Transbound Emerg Dis,767,1

At the same time, the reorganization of the pediatric medical-surgical activities and infrastructures was carried out, with the consequent suspension of the non-urgent surgical activity of Pediatric Urology. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activity in a Pediatric Urology division, as well as surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Materials and methods A systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and surgical data was carried out, including complications and readmissions of all patients operated on in the division of Pediatric Urology within the duration of the state of alarm. Five time periods have been created according to the de-escalation phases. Results Forty-nine surgical procedures were carried out on 45 patients (8 prior to the implementation of the de-escalation phases). High priority pathologies were the most frequent in the first phases, being the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction the most prevalent. Four complications were recorded (8.8%), none of them were respiratory. Conclusions The EAU recommendations for the resumption of surgical activity have allowed a correct, safe and gradual transition to the routine surgical activity in Pediatric Urology. The Clavien-Dindo classification is useful and valid for application in this division. No respiratory complications have been reported that could be attributable to the pandemic situation.","Merino-Mateo, L.; Tordable Ojeda, C.; Cabezalí Barbancho, D.; Gómez Fraile, A.",,767,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric patients with symptoms of testicular torsion may be reluctant to seek medical care which increases the likelihood of delayed presentation and the need for an orchiectomy. This observational study sought to determine whether there was a higher number of testicular torsion cases during COVID-19. METHODS: As the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our facility on March 6, 2020, we identified male children ages 1-18 years with testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 (during COVID-19) compared to the same time period between 2015 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). All patients were evaluated at our Institution's Emergency Department by a pediatric urologist. RESULTS: There were 38 cases of testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 compared to 15.8 cases on average during the same 10-month period between 2015 and 2019 (a total of 79 cases). There was a statistically significant increase in testicular torsion cases during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to equivalent time periods in 2015-2019 (38â¯vs. 15.8, pâ¯=â¯0.05). Patients with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic were younger, had a longer duration of symptoms, and had a higher number of orchiectomies (although not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an escalation in testicular torsion cases was observed. Timely assessment, diagnosis, and surgery are crucial to prevent testicular loss and potential infertility in the future. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the surge in testicular torsion and possible mechanisms.","Shields, Lisa B E; Daniels, Michael W; Peppas, Dennis S; White, Jeffrey T; Mohamed, Ahmad Z; Canalichio, Katie; Rosenberg, Shilo; Rosenberg, Eran",J. pediatr. surg,767,1

In an effort to increase access and improve the quality of care offered to patients we implemented a telehealth initiative allowing for remote orthopedic clinic visits at a major academic medical center. Here we report on our experience and early outcomes. A telehealth platform was launched for a single fellowship trained orthopedic surgeon at a major academic hospital in August 2018. New patients residing outside the metro area, all return patients and patients with an uncomplicated post-operative course were offered the option to complete patient encounters remotely via a telehealth platform. Each patient was offered a Patient Satisfaction Survey following video visit. Patient zip codes were used to estimate patient commutes. Ninety-six percent of patients agreed/strongly agreed with the statement ‘I was satisfied with my Telehealth experience’ while 51% agreed/strongly agreed with the statement ‘This visit was just as good as a face to face visit’. In all, 94% of patients agreed/strongly agreed with the statement ‘Having a telehealth visit made receiving care more accessible for me’. The median miles saved on commutes were 123.3 miles. The no show rate for telehealth visits was 8.2% versus 3.2% for in-person (P < 0.001). Telehealth video visits provided patients with a modality for completing orthopedic clinic visits while maintaining a high-quality care and patient satisfaction. Patient convenience was optimized with video visits with elimination of long commutes.

The limited capacity of low‐ and lower‐middle income countries (LMICs) to respond to the pandemic and its impact on the health of populations – particularly the most vulnerable – presents a marked challenge. In this context, countries face the enormous task of rethinking the way essential services will be delivered. A critical and essential part of solving these challenges will be using information and communication technology and digital health to enhance direct communication with the public; scale proven and innovative service delivery models; and empower the frontlines. However, if the deployment, adaptation, or expansion of these innovations are not user‐centered for the most marginalized or do not learn from past lessons, it could be highly wasteful at best. At worst, such shortcomings could exacerbate pre‐existing weaknesses in the health care system such as exclusion of peripheral populations, disempowerment of health workers, and proliferation of unregulated private providers. We provide recommendations of which innovations should be prioritized and implementation principles to address the current challenges while responding to the need to fundamentally change service delivery for accelerated impact.","Mitgang, Elizabeth A.; Blaya, Joaquin A.; Chopra, Mickey",Glob Policy,767,26
