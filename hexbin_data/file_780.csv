Antibody-based chromatographic serological tests, as an alternative to RT-PCR, offer only limited help due to high false positives. We propose to exploit our field-deployable/portable plasmonic fiber-optic absorbance biosensor (P-FAB) platform for one-step, wash-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles directly in saliva sample with minimal sample pre-processing.","Murugan, Divagar; Bhatia, Himanshu; Sai, V.

To illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each donor source, we performed a nationwide retrospective study of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) of patients with allo-HSCT-treated ATL. One-year GRFS did not significantly differ between patients who received related bone marrow transplantation (R-BMT; 26%, n = 117), related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (R-PBSCT; 22%, n = 225), unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UR-BMT; 26%, n = 619), and cord blood transplantation (CBT; 21%, n = 359; p = 0.09). This was attributable to a low incidence of systemically-treated chronic GVHD after CBT (9% at 1 year) and reduced non-GVHD/relapse mortality after R-PBSCT (9% at 1 year). Among patients transplanted in complete remission (CR), 1-year overall survival after CBT (52%, n = 132) was not inferior to that after R-BMT (55%, n = 51), R-PBSCT (57%, n = 79), and UR-BMT (58%, n = 280; p = 0.15), and relapse rates were equivalent among the four sources (p = 0.19). Our results suggest that all donor sources are feasible for CR patients and that GRFS provides important clues toward optimizing allo-HSCT for ATL.","Muranushi, Hiroyuki; Shindo, Takero; Hishizawa, Masakatsu; Tokunaga, Masahito; Wake, Atsushi; Nakano, Nobuaki; Eto, Tetsuya; Hidaka, Michihiro; Choi, Ilseung; Miyamoto, Toshihiro; Uchida, Naoyuki; Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi; Miyazaki, Yasuhiko; Fukuda, Takahiro; Ichinohe, Tatsuo; Atsuta, Yoshiko; Kato, Koji",Bone Marrow Transplant,780,0

However, cefiderocol has limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes like Bacterodies fragilis. In the APEKS-cUTI study, 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group versus 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group achieved the composite outcome of clinical and microbiological eradication of Gram-negative bacteria (treatment difference of 18.58%; 95% CI 8.23–28.92, p = 0.0004) in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). Cefiderocol was non-inferior to imipenem-cilastatin in cUTIs caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter freundii. Cefiderocol required dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment and percentage of time that free drug concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC) best correlated with clinical outcomes. The most common adverse events with cefiderocol were gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or upper abdominal pain. Two phase III clinical trials, the CREDIBLE-CR study and the APEKS-NP study, investigated the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol for the treatment of pneumonia or cUTI, and both studies showed higher all-cause mortality associated with cefiderocol. Therefore, the use of cefiderocol should be limited only to the treatment of cUTIs from Gram-negative bacteria, especially in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options.","Lee, Young Ran; Yeo, Suyeon",Clin Drug Investig,780,0

On January 30th 2020 the World Health Organization declared the COVID19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and declared it a pandemic on March 11th 2020. With over 2.4 million cases and 180,000 deaths reported by mid-June, Europe has been the second most affected region in the world. Individual countries such as Italy and the UK have been amongst the hardest hit in the world. However, the COVID19 situation in Europe is marked by wide variations both in terms of how countries have been affected, and in terms of how they have responded. The proposed workshop will provide compare and contrast the situation and response in five countries in the European region: The UK, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Sweden, moderated by a firm and charismatic chair. This interactive workshop will enable better understanding of the disease's spread and trajectory in different EU countries. International comparisons will help to describe the growth and scale of the pandemic in the selected EU countries. The choice of countries reflects those that have reported high and low incidence and mortality, as well as represent a range in the strictness of the control measures implemented, from full lockdown to the most permissive. The session will go beyond describing those and will be an opportunity to discuss the pros and cons of these different approaches and lessons learnt around the different components of the response such as case identification, contact tracing, testing, social distancing, mask use, health communication and inequalities. We plan to have short and effective 5 min presentations followed by a longer and constructively provocative moderated discussion. Importantly, the five European case studies will offer ground to discuss the public health principles behind outbreak management preparedness and balancing public health with other imperatives such as economic ones, but also social frustration. The audience will be engaged through a Q&A session. KEY MESSAGES: The approach to managing the COVID19 outbreak has varied among European countries, and the optimal approach is likely to be context specific. The effect of the pandemic will be long term and public health imperatives must take population attitudes and behavior as well as economic and indirect health effects into account.",,Eur J Public Health,780,0

The current body of literature, despite its significant growth, has not provided an overview landscape of this research area. Consequently, this study aims to fill this gap by employing the bibliometric analysis of 6902 articles from 1970 to 2019 extracted from the Web of Science database. By doing so, this paper attempts to provide an overview of the discipline's research output, social and conceptual structure, and offer strategies facilitating the scientific development within the field. The findings indicate that entrepreneurial finance is a young and growing field with an exponential increase in the number of publications (approx. 19.75 percent per year) and rising collaboration tendency among authors. The 1991–2000 period is a crucial milestone of the field thanks to the remarkable growth and impact of studies during this period as well as simultaneously occurring historical events. We also notice a sign of Western ideological homogeneity from the collaboration networks and lists of most productive authors, institutions, and countries. Additionally, using thematic mapping, five major research domains are identified: “venture capital”, “crowdfunding”, “SMEs finance”, “social entrepreneurship finance”, “IPO and corporate governance”. Based on these findings, we raise the concern of lacking diversity in entrepreneurial finance research and propose strategies for authors, journals, and policymakers to diversify the literature.","Nguyen, Minh-Hoang; Pham, Thanh-Hang; Ho, Manh-Toan; Nguyen, Huyen Thanh T.; Vuong, Quan-Hoang",SN Bus Econ,780,0

This paper is a narrative of the remarkable continuities between the past legacies of governance of informal settlements, pandemic response and emerging ideas of alternate urbanisms and their inability to address issues of inequity, exclusion and vulnerability. The pandemic and the resultant situation exposes the limits of the current policies, programming linked to informal settlements, their imagination of informality and outlines the urgent need to escape the trap of bracketing of informal settlements as an ‘issue’ within itself delinked from the dynamic and ever-changing processes of urbanization through community led policy responses and effective local governance. In the absence of effective state response, informal settlements authored their own script of coping with the challenges thrown by the pandemic; their presence, participation and centrality in scripting future policies is a much-needed transformation of the narrative.","Bhide, Amita",J,780,1

HAdV-3, -7, -4 and emergent HAdV-55 and HAdV-14 are the most important types causing severe respiratory diseases. There is no effective drug available for clinical treatment, and no vaccine available for the general population. Therefore, it is important to investigate the seroprevalence against HAdV for developing novel vaccines and vectors. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence and titer levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against HAdV-3, -4, -7, -14, -55, and -11 in total 278 healthy populations between 0 months and 49 years of age (228 children and 50 adults) from Guangzhou. In children under the age of 18 years, the seropositive rates were significantly increased against HAdV-3 at 12.07%, 33.96%, and 64.29% and against HAdV-7 at 0%, 18.87%, and 19.05% in age groups of 1–2, 3–5, and 6–17 years, respectively. The seroprevalence was very low (0% ~ 8.1%) for all other four types. In adults aged between 18 and 49 years, HAdV-3, -4, and -7 (> 50.00%) were the most common types, followed by HAdV-14 (38.00%), -55 (34.00%), and -11 (24.00%). Adults tended to have high NAb titers against HAdV-4 and -55. HAdV-55-seropositive donors tended to be HAdV-11- and HAdV-14-seropositive. These results indicated the low level of herd immunity against all six HAdV types in young children, and HAdV-14, -55, -11 in adults from Guangzhou City. Our findings demonstrate the importance of monitoring HAdV types and developing vaccines against HAdV for children and adults.","Tian, Xingui; Fan, Ye; Wang, Changbing; Liu, Zhenwei; Liu, Wenkuan; Xu, Yun; Mo, Chuncong; You, Aiping; Li, Xiao; Rong, Xia; Zhou, Rong",Virol Sin,780,0

As artists we imagine new configurations for what we understand as (social, economic, technological) networks and intelligences. With this ecosystemic approach we consider the possibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) that supports well-being in a broad sense, accommodating relationships across different layers of living worlds and involving local and global communities of all kinds. This thinking is grounded in research by theorists across disciplines, including communications and media theory, microbiology, anthropology, decolonial studies, social ecology, sociology and environmental psychology. At a time when human beings and their ecosystems face grave threats due to climate change and a global pandemic, we are rethinking the basis for our AIs, and for the resulting decision-making on behalf of societies and ecosystems. Creative projects by Cesar & Lois provide alternative conceptual models for thinking across networks, reframing the artists’ and potentially viewers’ understanding of what motivates and shapes societies. Referencing a series of artworks and the theories that underpin them, this article envisages a sociotechnical framework that takes into account ecosystems and challenges the philosophical orientations that guide society. Degenerative Cultures is an artwork in which the artists overlap microbiological organisms, AI and human systems as a speculative restructuring of networks across human and nonhuman entities. The push for ecosystemic technologies and intelligences is linked to the expansion of community to include planetary constituents, such as nonhuman beings and environments. The artists posit that such ecosystemic networks would be capable of taking into account the planet’s human societies as well as nonhuman species and their environments, broadening the concept of community well-being and shifting the technological architecture to meet the complex needs of the planet and its constituent parts. The experimental series, [ECO]nomic Revolution, layers Physarum polycephalum, or slime mold, over the mapped demographics of human cities. The species polycephalum references multi-brains, and implies a decentralized logic, which for the non-neurological microbiological network translates to the sharing of nutrients and regulated growth across a culture. Assuming a perspective based in the arts, this proposition imagines a shift from the dominant conceptions of AI as an individual intelligence and frames it as part of a network that necessarily includes ecosystems. We envision the creation of sociotechnical systems that could be modeled on networked lifeforms that have optimized themselves across millions of years, like the organism Physarum polycephalum, which occurs globally in moist environments, or like those microbial populations within and outside of human bodies, whose percussive biological processing interacts with and alters many layers of lifeforms. We argue that an environmentally responsive intelligence based on relationships across living systems potentially serves a broad community composed of diverse human populations, nonhuman beings and ecosystems.","HG Solomon, Lucie; Baio, Cesar",Int,780,32

Investors often follow the news to collect the information that will help them decide which strategy to follow. In this study, we analyze how public news and historical prices can be used together to anticipate and prevent financial losses on the Brazilian stock market. We include an extensive set of 64 securities in our analysis, which represent various sectors of the Brazilian economy. Our analysis compares the traditional Buy & Hold and the moving average strategies to several experiments designed with 11 machine learning algorithms. We explore daily, weekly and monthly time horizons for both publication and return windows. With this approach we were able to assess the most relevant set of news for investor’s decision, and to determine for how long the information remains relevant to the market. We found a strong relationship between news publications and stock price changes in Brazil, suggesting even short-term arbitrage opportunities. The study shows that it is possible to predict stock price falls using a set of news in Portuguese, and that text mining-based approaches can overcome traditional strategies when forecasting losses.","Duarte, Juvenal José; Montenegro González, Sahudy; Cruz, José César",Comput Econ,780,0

Antibodies directed against the mosquito salivary gland protein SGS1 have been shown to reduce Plasmodium gallinaceum sporozoite invasion of Aedes aegypti salivary glands, but the specific role of this protein in sporozoite invasion and in other stages of the Plasmodium life cycle remains unknown. METHODS: RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 were used to evaluate the role of A. aegypti SGS1 in the P. gallinaceum life cycle. RESULTS: Knockdown and knockout of SGS1 disrupted sporozoite invasion of the salivary gland. Interestingly, mosquitoes lacking SGS1 also displayed fewer oocysts. Proteomic analyses confirmed the abolishment of SGS1 in the salivary gland of SGS1 knockout mosquitoes and revealed that the C-terminus of the protein is absent in the salivary gland of control mosquitoes. In silico analyses indicated that SGS1 contains two potential internal cleavage sites and thus might generate three proteins. CONCLUSION: SGS1 facilitates, but is not essential for, invasion of A. aegypti salivary glands by P. gallinaceum and has a dual role as a facilitator of parasite development in the mosquito midgut. SGS1 could, therefore, be part of a strategy to decrease malaria transmission by the mosquito vector, for example in a transgenic mosquito that blocks its interaction with the parasite.","Kojin, Bianca B.; Martin-Martin, Ines; Araújo, Helena R.

MP referenced to predicted body weight (PBW) or respiratory system compliance have better predictive value for mortality than MP alone in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our objective was to assess the potential impact of consecutive changes of MP on hospital mortality among ARDS patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with severe ARDS receiving ECMO in a tertiary care referral center in Taiwan between May 2006 and October 2015. Serial changes of MP during ECMO were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients with severe ARDS rescued with ECMO were analyzed. Overall hospital mortality was 53.3%. There were no significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of baseline values of MP or other ventilator settings. Cox regression models demonstrated that mean MP alone, MP referenced to PBW, and MP referenced to compliance during the first 3 days of ECMO were all independently associated with hospital mortality. Higher MP referenced to compliance (HR 2.289 [95% CI 1.214–4.314], p = 0.010) was associated with a higher risk of death than MP itself (HR 1.060 [95% CI 1.018–1.104], p = 0.005) or MP referenced to PBW (HR 1.004 [95% CI 1.002–1.007], p < 0.001). The 90-day hospital mortality of patients with high MP (> 14.4 J/min) during the first 3 days of ECMO was significantly higher than that of patients with low MP (≦ 14.4 J/min) (70.7% vs. 46.8%, p = 0.004), and the 90-day hospital mortality of patients with high MP referenced to compliance (> 0.53 J/min/ml/cm H(2)O) during the first 3 days of ECMO was significantly higher than that of patients with low MP referenced to compliance (≦ 0.53 J/min/ml/cm H(2)O) (63.6% vs. 29.7%, p < 0.001).

BACKGROUND: Because of cognitive and behavioral disorders, patients with Alzheimer’s disease have poor coordination of treatment especially in an unfamiliar environment. Communicating with close family members through WeChat video can relieve patients' anxiety and other mental symptoms, leading to better cooperating with drug treatment and nasal feeding diet. METHODS: Patient received 1 hour daily WeChat video communication with her son at isolation ward, including psychological comfort, care and positive words. The WeChat video communication were last for 4 weeks, during this time, the elderly patient was also treated with methylprednisolone (for 5 days), immunoglobulin (for 5 days), ulinastatin, thymus methoxide (for twice a week), acetylcysteine, antibiotics, low molecular weight heparin, probiotics, nutrition and other symptomatic support therapy. RESULTS: Before WeChat video communication about 4 weeks, the patient refused medical treatment, consisting of extraction of infusion set and removal of gastric tube, which greatly affects the treatment of drugs and the nutritional intake of patients; and the state of the patient’s condition became even worse. However, after 4 weeks WeChat video communication, the patient showed a significant improvement in the Mini‐mental state examination scores from 8 to 12 (Education: illiterate) and in the Neuropsychiatric questionnaire scores from 35 to 10. Besides, after 4 weeks WeChat video communication and comprehensive therapy, the patient’s pneumonia improved significantly and the nucleic acid test turned negative. CONCLUSIONS: WeChat video communication may be a promising noninvasive approach for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease, which may help alleviate neuropsychiatric behavioral symptoms and can be more cooperative with medical workers.","Zhang, Fengxia; Lu, Yinshan; Hu, Jun; Hu, Mengting; Ma, Siliang; Zhu, Shanshan",Alzheimers Dement,780,0

Results show that different factors are influencing youth’s well being at home during the lockdown. Especially the emotional and social nature of their home environment has a very significant impact on how young respondents experience it during lockdown as well as their possibility to go outside.","Lips, Anna",Childhood Vulnerability,780,1

In this study, novel amphiphilic 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-(3-pyridyl-n-propanoyl)oxyphenyl)porphyrin tetrabromide (3a), 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-(6-pyridyl-n-hexanoyl)oxyphenyl)porphyrin tetrabromide (3b) and known 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin tetraiodide (TMePyP) were synthesized, and their dark antiviral activity in vitro against HSV-1 was studied. The influence of porphyrin’s nanosized delivery vehicles based on Pluronic F127 on anti-HSV-1 activity was estimated. All the received compounds 3a, 3b and TMePyP showed virucidal efficiency and had an effect on viral replication stages. The new compound 3b showed the highest antiviral activity, close to 100%, with the lowest concentration, while the maximum TMePyP activity was observed with a high concentration; porphyrin 3a was the least active. The inclusion of the synthesized compounds in Pluronic F-127 polymeric micelles had a noticeable effect on antiviral activity only at higher porphyrin concentrations. Action of the received compounds differs by influence on the early or later reproduction stages. While 3a and TMePyP acted on all stages of the viral replication cycle, porphyrin 3b inhibited viral replication during the early stages of infection. The resulting compounds are promising for the development of utilitarian antiviral agents and, possibly, medical antiviral drugs.","Zhdanova, Kseniya A.; Savelyeva, Inga O.; Ezhov, Artem V.; Zhdanov, Andrey P.; Zhizhin, Konstantin Yu.; Mironov, Andrey F.; Bragina, Natal’ya A.; Babayants, Alla A.; Frolova, Irina S.; Filippova, Nadezhda I.; Scliankina, Nadezhda N.; Scheglovitova, Olga N.",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),780,16

The revolution in cancer multi-“omics” and bioinformatics has uncovered clinically relevant alterations in PDAC that still need to be integrated into patients’ clinical management, urging the development of non-invasive imaging techniques against principal biomarkers to assess and incorporate this information into the clinical practice. “Immuno-PET” merges the high target selectivity and specificity of antibodies and engineered fragments toward a given tumor cell surface marker with the high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and quantitative capabilities of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging techniques. In this review, we detail and provide examples of the clinical limitations of current imaging techniques for diagnosing PDAC. Furthermore, we define the different components of immuno-PET and summarize the existing applications of this technique in PDAC. The development of novel immuno-PET methods will make it possible to conduct the non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of patients over time using in vivo, integrated, quantifiable, 3D, whole body immunohistochemistry working like a “virtual biopsy”.","González-Gómez, Ruth; Pazo-Cid, Roberto A.; Sarría, Luis; Morcillo, Miguel Ángel; Schuhmacher, Alberto J.",J Clin Med,780,0

We since established a deanery-wide trainee led VIRTUAL journal club, run by the Surgical Trainees of East of England Research collaborative (STEER) group. METHOD: Following decision in May2020, the STEER group collated curriculum topics and related landmark papers, drafting a programmed-schedule for sessions (45mins – 1hour). CPD accreditation was sought and received from RCSEd prior to some sessions. Sessions were delivered using the Microsoft Teams app (via desktop/tablet/phone). Targeted audience included FYs, CTs, STs, JCFs, SCFs (candidates preparing for MRCS/FRCS or interested in academia). Live polling / feedback forms and attendance certificates were distributed. RESULTS: Six journal club sessions have been run to-date. A minimum of 15-20 participants attended each session with spread of junior/senior trainees. Sessions were video recorded for repeat playback for those unable to attend. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with good engagement from participants. CONCLUSIONS: A deanery wide virtual journal club was positively received by trainees and benefits included: critique and dissemination of evidence (especially recently with COVID-related literature), trainee interaction and keeping up-to-date and understanding and analysing information.","Adegbola, S; Rabie, M; Currow, C; Aly, M; Patel, K; Aker, M; Patel, K; Askari, A",Br J Surg,780,0

Ill-preparedness for natural hazards, a resurgence of serious public health concerns or illusions of control over unruly technology question the extent to which we can ‘really’ shape the world around us. Human-made crises, too, test how we routinely do things. We ask how organisations and actors within them prepare for a collapse of meaning and practise radical uncertainty. Given the breadth and depth of the region’s energy (and, as some would argue, turbulences), Asia provides a fitting context for exploring accommodation to and learning from low-probability, high-impact incidents. By reviewing the business and management research on shocks in Asia, we find that there is a strong human side to dealing with the unknown. We argue that what organisations and actors within them do prior, during and after a shock event is substantially contingent upon cultural environments. To elaborate, we discuss the role of the uncertainty avoidance dimension of national culture in dealing with shock events. We further combine this dimension with the universalism-particularism dimension to discuss future research directions. Our exploration of resultant differences in preparedness, resourcefulness and learning offers a more rounded inquiry into how Asian business actors deal with shocks.","Horn, Sierk; Sekiguchi, Tomoki; Weiss, Matthias",Asian Bus Manage,780,0

I focus on values as they help cope with ethnicity and race related stress such as discrimination. Using functional neuroimaging data, I offer evidence that values operate through both explicit (controlled and conscious) processes recruiting brain regions like the dorsal prefrontal cortex, and implicit (automatic and non-conscious) processes recruiting regions like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, to help cope with exclusion and discrimination.","Firat, Rengin B.",Front Sociol,780,1

In this study, we enrolled 35 naive-treatment patients with HS and 35 controls, matched for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). HS Sartorius score was 49.0 (33.0–75.0), while according to the Harley system 12 and 23 patients presented grade 1 and grade 2 severity, respectively. HS patients had a lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) (p = 0.002), lower phase angle (PhA) (p < 0.001), and higher circulating TMAO levels (p < 0.001) than the control group.

Drone missions will increasingly rely on drone collaboration, which requires the drones to reduce communication complexity and be controlled in a decentralized fashion. Blockchain technology becomes a must in industrial applications because it provides decentralized data, accessibility, immutability, and irreversibility. Therefore, Blockchain makes data public for all drones and enables drones to log information concerning world states, time, location, resources, delivery data, and drone relation to all neighbors drones.

While such findings are often interpreted as evidence that social media causally promotes conspiracy beliefs, we theorize that this relationship is conditional on other individual-level predispositions. Across two studies, we examine the relationship between beliefs in conspiracy theories and media use, finding that individuals who get their news from social media and use social media frequently express more beliefs in some types of conspiracy theories and misinformation. However, we also find that these relationships are conditional on conspiracy thinking––the predisposition to interpret salient events as products of conspiracies––such that social media use becomes more strongly associated with conspiracy beliefs as conspiracy thinking intensifies. This pattern, which we observe across many beliefs from two studies, clarifies the relationship between social media use and beliefs in dubious ideas.

Arts graduates play important roles in an economy, through both artistic creation and in careers outside of the arts. While the Great Recession took a significant toll on the US economy generally, arts majors faced additional vulnerabilities as industries that rely on discretionary spending, like the arts and entertainment, are especially hard hit in times of economic downturn. This paper assesses the impact of graduating during or shortly after the recession relative to graduating shortly before this period on educational choices, including choice of major, double majoring, and completing an advanced degree, and career outcomes, including employment status, type of employment, hours worked, and earnings, for college graduates majoring in the arts. Graduating before or after the recession is found to have a negative impact on the share of graduates majoring in traditional arts fields, but a positive impact on the share majoring in related creative fields. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, relative to non-art college graduates, traditional arts majors graduating during or after the Great Recession are more likely to complete a double major, be self-employed, be unemployed, work longer hours, and earn less income than those graduating prior to the recession. These impacts are likely to have a negative effect on the pipeline of college-educated artists working in the arts into the future.","Paulsen, Richard J.",J Cult Econ,780,0

A total of 3426 leads were extracted; and, overall, 95% full procedural, 4% partial procedural, and 98% clinical success were demonstrated. Within the patient cohort, 1.8% (37/2049) experienced major complications, with cardiac tamponade being predominant (30/37). Cardiac tamponade was identified as the main cause of mortality, as well as the cause of all procedure-related deaths (6/2049; 0.3%). Cardiac tamponade occurred in 1.8% of atrial and 0.3% of right ventricular lead extractions, with fatal tamponade reported in 9% of atrial, 40% of ventricular, and 67% of coronary sinus lead extractions. No association between lead location and cardiac tamponade-related mortality was observed; however, lead location did affect the success of pericardiocentesis. The cardiac tamponade-related mortality rate was 37% when TLE was performed in an electrophysiology laboratory. No deaths were reported when the procedure was performed in a cardiac surgery or hybrid operating room. Long-term survival was improved when TLE was performed due to non-infectious indications, rather than pocket infection or lead-related endocarditis (P < 0.001).

In this narrative review the origins of tuberculosis are outlined, according to the evidence of paleopathology. In particular the first cases of human TB in ancient skeletal remains are presented, together with the most recent discoveries resulting from the paleomicrobiology of the tubercle bacillus, which provide innovative information on the history of TB. The paleopathological evidence of TB attests the presence of the disease starting from Neolithic times. Traditionally, it was thought that TB has a zoonotic origin, being acquired by humans from cattle during the Neolithic revolution. However, the biomolecular studies proposed a new evolutionary scenario demonstrating that human TB has a human origin. The researches show that the disease was present in the early human populations of Africa at least 70000 years ago and that it expanded following the migrations of Homo sapiens out of Africa, adapting to the different human groups. The demographic success of TB during the Neolithic period was due to the growth of density and size of the human host population, and not the zoonotic transfer from cattle, as previously hypothesized. These data demonstrate a long coevolution of the disease and its human host. Understanding the changes of TB through time thanks to the advances in the field of paleopathology can help to solve the present problems and understand the future evolution of TB.","Buzic, I; Giuffra, V",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,780,1

TissuePatchDural (TPD), a novel impermeable adhesive membrane, was used to reinforce dural closure. A comparison with one of the most commonly used dural sealing devices, DuraSeal, has been made. METHODS A retrospective, single-center study was conducted on 161 patients who underwent elective posterior fossa surgery. On surgeon's opinion, when a primary watertight closure was not possible, they received TPD or DuraSeal to reinforce dural closure. RESULTS Out of 161 patients analyzed, 115 were treated with TPD and 46 with DuraSeal. The post-operative leaks related purely to TPD or DuraSeal failure were recognized in 3 (2.6%) and 5 (10.86%) cases, respectively (P = 0.015). The presence of pre- and post-operative risk factors was associated with an increased incidence of CSF leak in both groups. TPD showed a better control in patients without these risk factors (P = 0.08). The incidence of CSF leak in patients who underwent posterior fossa surgery by craniectomy was statistically lower in TPD group compared to DuraSeal group (3.22% vs 17.8%, respectively; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS TPD seems to be a safe tool for use as an adjunct to standard dural closure in posterior fossa surgery, particularly in patients without pre- or post-oper ative risk factors, in those who did not develop hydrocephalus, and who underwent craniectomy. The CSF leak rate in TPD group was found to be lower or within the range of the more advanced alternative dural closure strategies, including polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based sealant.","Schiariti, Marco; Acerbi, Francesco; Broggi, Morgan; Tringali, Giovanni; Raggi, Alberto; Broggi, Giovanni; Ferroli, Paolo",Surgical neurology international,780,1

A study was undertaken to examine the incidence, underlying aetiology, natural history and associated healthcare resource utilisation related to ILI in the RCHE population. METHODS A prospective study of ILI in four RCHEs in Shatin, Hong Kong was conducted from April 2006 to March 2007. Each RCHE was monitored daily for the occurrence of ILI and followed up until resolution of illness or death. Clinical features were recorded and sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, blood and urine specimens were examined for underlying aetiology. RESULTS 259 episodes of ILI occurred in 194 subjects, with mild peaks in winter and summer, over a sustained level throughout the year. The infectious agent was identified in 61.4% of all episodes, comprising bacterial infection in 53.3% and viral in 46.7%. Multiple infections occurred in 16.2% of subjects. The most frequent organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Clinical features did not vary according to the underlying aetiology, the common presenting features being a decrease in general condition, cognitive and functional deterioration, and withholding of food in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms. Overall, mortality at 1 month/discharge was 9.7%. Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, low body mass index and poor function predisposed to mortality. No association was observed between influenza vaccination status and underlying aetiology, clinical features or outcome. CONCLUSIONS The clinical presentation of ILI is non-specific and is mainly due to bacterial and viral infections other than influenza in the RCHE population.","Hui, D S; Woo, J; Hui, E; Foo, A; Ip, M; To, K-W; Cheuk, E S C; Lam, W-Y; Sham, A; Chan, P K S",Thorax,780,1

METHODS A total of 612 volunteers between the ages of 18-38 enrolled in the study, 418 of them were athletes engaged in team sports or individual sports and 194 of them were non-athletes. Participants completed the Depression - Anxiety - Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ). Non-parametric methods were used for comparisons between groups. The presence of a linear relationship was tested with the Spearman Correlation Test. A value of p<0.05 was accepted statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 571 participants, 372 males and 199 females, completed the study. Depression and anxiety symptoms were lower in athletes compared to non-athletes (p<0.05). Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were similar in team athletes and individual athletes (p=0.232, p=0.444, p=0.116; respectively). The post-traumatic stress symptoms were lower in male team athletes than female team athletes (p=0.020) and non-athletes (p<0.001). Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be similar in men and women (p>0.05). There was a negative correlation between physical activity level and mental health symptoms (p<0.05). CONCLUSION The mental health status of athletes was better than non-athletes, and the positive effect of sport, which was done until the break due to the isolation period, on mental health continued. These findings show that physical activity may help to protect mental health.","Şenışık, Seçkin; Denerel, Nevzad; Köyağasıoğlu, Ogün; Tunç, Serhat",The Physician and sportsmedicine,780,29

More cases were reported during summer than autumn. The 18-month prevalence of ASF in areas under various animal movement restrictions was 18.6% among wild boar found dead or killed by vehicles and only 0.2% in hunted wild boar. Repeated introductions of the virus into the country, the primary role of wild boar in virus maintenance, and the slow spread of the disease indicate a need for enhanced biosecurity at pig holdings and continuous and intensive surveillance for fast detection of ASF.","Śmietanka, Krzysztof; Woźniakowski, Grzegorz; Kozak, Edyta; Niemczuk, Krzysztof; Frączyk, Magdalena; Bocian, Łukasz; Kowalczyk, Andrzej; Pejsak, Zygmunt",Emerging infectious diseases,780,1

It has been proposed as a non-invasive surrogate parameter for pulse pressure variation (PPV) used in the prediction of the response to volume expansion in hypovolemic patients. Many groups have reported on the DPOP parameter and its correlation with PPV using various semi-automated algorithmic implementations. The study reported here demonstrates the performance gains made by adding increasingly sophisticated signal processing components to a fully automated DPOP algorithm. A DPOP algorithm was coded and its performance systematically enhanced through a series of code module alterations and additions. Each algorithm iteration was tested on data from 20 mechanically ventilated OR patients. Correlation coefficients and ROC curve statistics were computed at each stage. For the purposes of the analysis we split the data into a manually selected 'stable' region subset of the data containing relatively noise free segments and a 'global' set incorporating the whole data record. Performance gains were measured in terms of correlation against PPV measurements in OR patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation. Through increasingly advanced pre-processing and post-processing enhancements to the algorithm, the correlation coefficient between DPOP and PPV improved from a baseline value of R = 0.347 to R = 0.852 for the stable data set, and, correspondingly, R = 0.225 to R = 0.728 for the more challenging global data set. Marked gains in algorithm performance are achievable for manually selected stable regions of the signals using relatively simple algorithm enhancements. Significant additional algorithm enhancements, including a correction for low perfusion values, were required before similar gains were realised for the more challenging global data set.","Addison, Paul S; Wang, Rui; Uribe, Alberto A; Bergese, Sergio D",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,780,1

The aim of this study was to examine the association between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 hospitalization, ventilation status, and mortality in people with rheumatic disease. METHODS US patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 entered into the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry March 24 - August 26, 2020 were included. Race/ethnicity was defined as white, Black, Latinx, Asian and other/mixed race. Outcomes included hospitalization, requirement for ventilatory support, and death. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for age, sex, smoking, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, medications taken prior to infection, and rheumatic disease activity. RESULTS A total of 1,324 patients were included, of whom 36% were hospitalized and 6% died; 26% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable models, Black (OR=2.74, 95% CI 1.90, 3.95), Latinx (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.18, 2.49), and Asian (OR=2.69, 95% CI 1.16, 6.24) patients had higher odds of being hospitalized compared to white patients. Latinx patients also had three-fold increased odds of requiring ventilatory support (OR=3.25, 95% CI 1.75, 6.05). No differences in mortality based on race/ethnicity were found, though power may have been limited to detect associations. CONCLUSION Similar to findings in the general US population, racial/ethnic minorities with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 had increased odds of hospitalization and ventilatory support. These results illustrate significant health disparities related to COVID-19 in people with rheumatic diseases. The rheumatology community should proactively address the needs of patients currently experiencing inequitable health outcomes during the pandemic.","Gianfrancesco, Milena A; Leykina, Liza A; Izadi, Zara; Taylor, Tiffany; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Harrison, Carly; Trupin, Laura; Rush, Stephanie; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Katz, Patricia; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Hsu, Tiffany Y; D'Silva, Kristin M; Serling-Boyd, Naomi; Wallwork, Rachel; Todd, Derrick J; Bhana, Suleman; Costello, Wendy; Grainger, Rebecca; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Liew, Jean W; Sirotich, Emily; Sufka, Paul; Wallace, Zachary S; Machado, Pedro M; Robinson, Philip C; Yazdany, Jinoos",Arthritis & rheumatology,780,1

However, many of these systems are resource intensive and time-consuming, have low predictive value and are associated with great social and ethical dilemmas. Often drugs appear to be effective and safe in these classical animal models, but later prove to be ineffective and/or unsafe in clinical trials. These issues have paved the way for a paradigm shift from the use of in vivo approaches, toward the 'science of alternatives'. This has fuelled several research and regulatory initiatives, including the ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals. The new paradigm has been shifted toward increasing the relevance of the models for human predictivity and translational efficacy, and this has resulted in the recent development of many new methodologies, from 3-D bio-organoids to bioengineered 'human-on-a-chip' models. These improvements have the potential to significantly advance medical research globally. This paper offers a stance on the existing strategies and practices that utilise alternatives to animals, and outlines progress on the incorporation of these models into basic and applied research and education, specifically in India. It also seeks to provide a strategic roadmap to streamline the future directions for the country's policy changes and investments. This strategic roadmap could be a useful resource to guide research institutions, industries, regulatory agencies, contract research organisations and other stakeholders in transitioning toward modern approaches to safety and risk assessment that could replace or reduce the use of animals without compromising the safety of humans or the environment.","Pant, Aditya B",Alternatives to laboratory animals : ATLA,780,14

Drawing on a review of the ECJ's case law, especially but not exclusively in public health fields, from the 1950s to 2009, this article argues that the ECJ's past and present role in the Europeanization of communicable disease control is neither that of a driver nor that of an irrelevance. Instead, the ECJ has been responsible for four important elements of the environment that over time led to the Europeanization of communicable disease control in general and the establishment of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in particular: (1) the European Union itself has responsibility for public health; (2) agencies are a constitutionally permissible institutional arrangement in the EU; (3) EU legislation that inter alia protects public health is mandatory and justiciable; and (4) such EU legislation may not be undermined by liberalizing internal market law.

However, many countries provide UV information services at a local level, which makes it impossible for individuals to acquire user-based, accurate UV information unless individuals operate UV measurement devices with expertise on the relevant field for interpretation of the measurement results. There is a limit in measuring ultraviolet rays' information by the users at their respective locations. Research about how to utilize mobile devices such as smartphones to overcome such limitation is also lacking. This paper proposes a mobile deep learning system that calculates UVI based on the illuminance values at the user's location obtained with mobile devices' help. The proposed method analyzed the correlation between illuminance and UVI based on the natural light DB collected through the actual measurements, and the deep learning model's data set was extracted. After the selection of the input variables to calculate the correct UVI, the deep learning model based on the TensorFlow set with the optimum number of layers and number of nodes was designed and implemented, and learning was executed via the data set. After the data set was converted to the mobile deep learning model to operate under the mobile environment, the converted data were loaded on the mobile device. The proposed method enabled providing UV information at the user's location through a mobile device on which the illuminance sensors were loaded even in the environment without UVI measuring equipment. The comparison of the experiment results with the reference device (spectrometer) proved that the proposed method could provide UV information with an accuracy of 90-95% in the summers, as well as in winters.","Oh, Seung-Taek; Ga, Deog-Hyeon; Lim, Jae-Hyun",Sensors,780,19

The global mortality burden of tobacco use lies predominantly in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). There is much evidence on the effectiveness of tobacco cessation RCTs in high-income nations. However, the evidence base in LMICs is far more limited. To effectively design randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that mitigate tobacco-related harms in LMICs, further understanding of RCTs in this environment will be helpful. We will provide quality evidence regarding the scope of tobacco cessation RCTs in LMICs. METHODS A scoping review of tobacco cessation RCTs will be conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science and Sociological Abstracts will be searched to capture current literature. We will review RCTs that have already been done on tobacco cessation in the LMICs. The key outcome will be tobacco cessation in adults. Examples of the key outcome include smoking abstinence and reduction of tobacco use. Study selection will conform to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and study quality assessed with a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument. DISCUSSION As researchers attempt to minimize the harms from tobacco in LMICs, they need to be aware of scientific evidence to develop RCTs to achieve their aim.

The vessel densities (VD) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and retinal peripapillary capillary plexus (RPCP) were assessed using OCT-A in patients with ED and healthy subjects. All the participants were evaluated and scanned for systemic and hormonal disorders and those with ED also underwent penile Doppler ultrasonography (PDU). After recording the data, the participants were divided into three groups: organic ED, psychogenic ED, and healthy control. The relationships between the OCT-A parameters and other clinical findings were analyzed. The right eyes of 80 patients with ED and 40 healthy volunteers were evaluated in this study. Of the ED patients, 46 were included in the organic ED group according to the results of PDU. The VDs of DCP, SCP, and the temporal sector of RPCP were significantly lower in the organic ED group than the psychogenic ED and healthy control groups. The VDs of SCP and DCP were correlated with the peak systolic velocity of both left and right penile cavernous arteries. The VDs of DCP were also correlated with the left and right resistive indexes. In conclusion, the OCT-A data of SCP and especially DCP could be helpful in evaluating ED, and provide reliable information about the origin of the disease along with the other laboratory testing and penile vascular evaluation.","Yilmaz, Hayati; Gultekin, Mehmet Hamza; Yalcin, Ahmet",International journal of impotence research,780,29

This study aimed to evaluate the risk and related factors of SICH after endovascular treatment in a real-world practice. METHODS Patients with stroke treated with stent-like retrievers for recanalizing a blocked artery in anterior circulation were enrolled from 21 stroke centers in China. Intracranial hemorrhage was classified as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones according to Heidelberg Bleeding Classification. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors for SICH. RESULTS Of the 632 enrolled patients, 101 (16.0%) were diagnosed with SICH within 72 hours after endovascular treatment. Ninety-day mortality was higher in patients with SICH than in patients without SICH (65.3% versus 18.8%; P<0.001).

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the health care for patients with classical phenylketonuria in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed the National Health Fund's reporting data concerning information on healthcare services for patients with classical phenylketonuria (PKU), which were reported to the payer by the healthcare service providers between 2009 and 2015. The analysis was prepared within the framework of mapping the health care needs of patients with metabolic diseases published in December 2016 (http://www.mapypotrzebzdrowotnych.mz.gov.pl/). RESULTS A total of 2706 patients with PKU (including 1180 children) were registered in the healthcare system in the period covered. The estimated national prevalence of PKU was 1 per 7758 live births. Paediatric patients up to 12 moths of age accounted for over 40% of all visits to outpatient clinics. Patients over 28 years of age accounted for only 1% of all PKU patients receiving specialist outpatient care. There were twice as many clinics providing health care to children than to adults. The majority of adult patients received healthcare from the same providers as children. Sixty-nine percent of adults and 64% of children were treated in the two largest outpatient centres. There were 12 deaths, with a median age of 63 years. The working-age adults accounted for 50% of the deaths. CONCLUSIONS Adult patients with PKU do not receive sufficient healthcare. The discontinuation of healthcare by adults with PKU can result from the lack of an adequate transition process from paediatric to adult care.","Szypowska, Agnieszka; Franek, Edward; J Grzeszczak, Władysław; Zięba, Mariusz; Filipow, Winicjusz; Kabicz, Paweł; Więckowska, Barbara; Sykut-Cegielska, Jolanta; Taybert, Joanna","Pediatric endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism",780,26

Common mental disorders were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results Overall, the mean age was 38 ± 14 years and 52% of the participants were women. The median diabetes duration was 18 years. The scores for insulin analogue treatment satisfaction were higher than those for previous treatments. DTSQ scores had a median value of 32 (interquartile range 29-35) and remained unchanged over time. The percentage of patients with hypoglycemia (including severe and nocturnal) was comparable across groups divided according to duration of use of insulin analogues. Most patients (n=395, 77%) screened positive for common mental disorders. Conclusion Patient satisfaction with insulin analogue treatment was high and remained unchanged with time. Episodes of hypoglycemia also remained unchanged over time among patients using insulin analogues.","Berlanda, Gabriela; Telo, Gabriela H; Krug, Bárbara Côrrea; Scheffel, Rafael Selbach; Pasinato, Bruna; Iorra, Fernando; Dos Reis, João Gabbardo; Picon, Paulo Dornelles; Schaan, Beatriz D",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,780,12

The study was carried out to test the construct validity of such a simulator by demonstrating differences between beginner and expert neurointerventionalists and to evaluate whether a training effect can be demonstrated in repeated cases for different levels of experience. METHODS In this study 4 experts and 6 beginners performed 10 diagnostic angiographies on the VIST simulator (Mentice AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Of the cases four were non-recurring, whereas three were repeated once and ten subjects performed all tasks. Additionally, another expert performed only five non-recurring cases. The simulator recorded total time, fluoroscopy time, amount of contrast medium and number of material changes. Furthermore, gaze direction and heart rate were recorded, and subjects completed a questionnaire on workload. RESULTS Beginners and experts showed significant differences in total duration time, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent (all p < 0.05). Gaze direction, dwell time and heart rate were similar between both groups. Only beginners improved during training with respect to total duration time, fluoroscopy time and amount of contrast agent. If a case was previously known to them, the total duration and fluoroscopy time were significantly shortened (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated both the construct validity of a diagnostic neuroangiography simulator as well as a significant training effect for beginners. Therefore, in particular beginner neurointerventionalists should use such simulation tools more extensively in their initial training.","Kreiser, Kornelia; Ströber, Lea; Gehling, Kim G; Schneider, Frederick; Kohlbecher, Stefan; Schulz, Christian M; Zimmer, Claus; Kirschke, Jan S",Clinical neuroradiology,780,20

Despite growing evidence that MSCs are potent anti-inflammatory mediators that can provide substantial benefits in acute organ injury, there are limited clinical trials utilizing MSCs in acute care settings, such as in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU). OBJECTIVE This article reviews the current state of MSC-based therapeutics and further explores the untapped potential role to treat various acute, life-threating injuries in the ED and ICU. DISCUSSION All clinical trials using MSCs in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) demonstrated safety. While some also demonstrate clinical efficacy, efficacy data is inconsistent, with some studies limited by sample size, cell integrity and different dosages, necessitating further studies. CONCLUSION MSCs are potentially promising novel biologic therapeutics for clinical application in AMI, ARDS, sepsis, AKI and COVID-19 that have demonstrated safety in all clinical trials. More rigorous clinical trials are necessary and warranted to determine the efficacy of MSCs as a novel therapeutic in an acute setting, such as the ED.","Premer, Courtney; Schulman, Ivonne H; Jackson, Jennifer S",The American journal of emergency medicine,780,16

Indocyanine green near-infrared video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has been adopted for objective assessment of free flap tissue perfusion but is thus far not used on a routine basis. Therefore, we investigated its intraoperative impact on decision-making and postoperative outcome. METHODS From January 2017 to June 2019, 88 consecutive adipo- or fasciocutaneus free flaps were performed in conjunction with intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA. Free flap tissue perfusion was first assessed clinically and then compared with ICG-NIR-VA findings. Based on the results, the decision for intraoperative trimming of critically perfused flap zones was made. The way of decision-making, flap success, and failure rates as well as intra- and postoperative complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS The overall free flap success rate was 92.0%. Partial flap necrosis occurred in five cases (5.7%) and total flap necrosis in two cases (2.3%). ICG-NIR-VA aided decision-making and flap design in 34 cases (38.6%) and led to complication-free postoperative courses. When ICG-NIR-VA was relied on (82 out of 88 flaps; 93.2%), there was no unpredicted postoperative tissue necrosis (overestimation). When ICG-NIR-VA was not relied on (6 out of 88 flaps; 6.8%), there were five cases of postoperative partial flap necrosis and one case of uneventful healing (underestimation). The sensitivity of ICG-NIR-VA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.6-100) and the specificity was 98.8% (95% CI: 93.3-100) with a positive predictive value of 87.5% (95% CI: 52.9-99.4) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 95.4-100). CONCLUSION Intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA objectified free flap perfusion and thus refined surgical decision-making on flap design in all cases. It could always predict tissue necrosis and subjectively improved outcomes in free flap surgery at our institution. Furthermore, it could be easily implemented in intraoperative routine, only adding minimal additional operative time.","Bigdeli, Amir Khosrow; Thomas, Benjamin; Falkner, Florian; Gazyakan, Emre; Hirche, Christoph; Kneser, Ulrich",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,780,16

To counter a lack of clinical relevance and observed method heterogenicity, a standardized, controlled and physiologically relevant ex vivo permeation model was established. This model combined the Kerski diffusion cell, process automation, novel assays for tissue integrity and viability, and sensitive LC-MS/MS analysis. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the permeation model in the sublingual formulation development of cyclobenzaprine, a promising agent for the treatment of psychological disorders. A 4.68-fold enhancement was achieved through permeation model-led focused formulation development. Here, findings from the preformulation with regard to pH and microenvironment-modulating excipients proved supportive. Moreover, monitoring of drug metabolism during transmucosal permeation was incorporated into the model. In addition, it was feasible to assess the impact of dosage form alterations under stress conditions, with the detection of a 33.85% lower permeation due to salt disproportionation. Integrating the coherent processes of disintegration, dissolution, permeation, and metabolization within a physiological study design, the model enabled successful formulation development for cyclobenzaprine sublingual tablets and targeted development of patient-oriented drugs for the oral cavity.","Majid, Haidara; Puzik, Andreas; Maier, Tanja; Merk, Raphaela; Bartel, Anke; Mueller, Hans-Christian; Burckhardt, Bjoern B",Pharmaceutics,780,4

On April 2, 2020, the first prisoner died of COVID-19, and as of April 9, 58 prisoners and 178 penitentiary police officers have tested positive for the virus. The situation in Italy is made all the more dramatic because of endemic overcrowding: As of April 3, 2020, there were 56,830 prisoners in institutions meant for a maximum of 47,000 people, that is, an occupancy level of 121.75%. The Ministry of Justice and that of Health have established two strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19 in prisons: progressive isolation from the external world and adoption of practices to identify possible cases and to treat infected subjects. The legislation has significantly reduced individual rights in order to protect public health, but in the prison context, the limitations imposed do not guarantee the achievement of the goal of the entire legislation, which is to interrupt the chain of transmission of contagion. A prison cannot be entirely cut off, because its operations depend on people who come and go daily, The effects of these strategy are discussed critically.","Cingolani, Mariano; Caraceni, Lina; Cannovo, Nunzia; Fedeli, Piergiorgio",Journal of correctional health care : the official journal of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care,780,1

METHODS Altogether 742 discharged COVID-19 patients were analyzed retrospectively and were divided into re-infected patients (n=60) and non-re-infected patients (n=682) according to whether they became nucleic acid positive again after discharge. The time form leaving the hospital to re-infection and the time form the first nucleic acid negative test results to being re-infected were recorded. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared when they were admitted to the hospital. Logistic regression analysis was carried out on disease indicators with statistical differences between the two groups. RESULTS Compared with non-re-infected patients, there were statistical differences in age, contact history, fatigue, chills, nasal congestion and runny nose, lung CT observations, clinical classification and lymphocyte count of re-infected patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that nasal congestion and a runny nose, a lymphocyte count less than 0.93×109 cells/L, and age ≥65 years were the risk factors of being re-infected. The ROC curve showed that the cut-off value of lymphocyte count was 0.847×109 cells/L, and the AUC of predicted re-infection was 0.867. CONCLUSION The symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose, lymphocyte count less than 0.93×109 cells/L and, aged more than 65 years are the risk factors for the recurrent positive rates for COVID-19 patients, and lymphocyte count has certain clinical value in predicting recurrent patients.","Dong, Yan; Huang, Hanlin; Yang, Jun; Yang, Liyuan",American journal of translational research,780,1

Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) might allow for local treatment of these complications, thereby saving patients from otherwise major surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients undergoing TES in the IJsselland Hospital (NL) since 1996 were recorded in a prospective database, of which twenty patients were treated for complications after previous rectal surgery. Data on prior treatment, surgical techniques, outcomes, and need for additional surgery were collected. RESULTS Twenty patients were identified from the database (rectourinary fistula n = 3, rectovaginal fistula n = 5, anastomotic stricture n = 8, and rectal stenosis n = 4). One of the three (33 %) rectourinary fistulas and two of five (40 %) rectovaginal fistulas were successfully treated with TES. Anastomotic strictures were successfully treated in 5/8 (63 %) patients. Strictures after local excision of rectal tumors were successfully treated in 3/4 (75 %) patients. No minor complication and one major complication occurred (rectovaginal fistula after stenoplasty eventually requiring Hartmann's procedure). CONCLUSIONS Transanal treatment of anastomotic strictures, rectal stenosis, and fistula after prior rectal surgery is safe and effective in a large proportion of patients. TES should be considered as a first step in all patients presenting with these late complications after rectal surgery.","van Vledder, Mark G; Doornebosch, Pascal G; de Graaf, Eelco J R",Surgical endoscopy,780,28

We have identified a different human cellular glycoprotein that can serve as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV. A human lung cDNA library in vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotyped retrovirus was transduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the cells were sorted for binding of soluble SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoproteins, S(590) and S(1180). Clones of transduced cells that bound SARS-CoV S glycoprotein were inoculated with SARS-CoV, and increases in subgenomic viral RNA from 1-16 h or more were detected by multiplex RT-PCR in four cloned cell lines. Sequencing of the human lung cDNA inserts showed that each of the cloned cell lines contained cDNA that encoded human CD209L, a C-type lectin (also called L-SIGN). When the cDNA encoding CD209L from clone 2.27 was cloned and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, the cells expressed human CD209L glycoprotein and became susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV. Immunohistochemistry showed that CD209L is expressed in human lung in type II alveolar cells and endothelial cells, both potential targets for SARS-CoV. Several other enveloped viruses including Ebola and Sindbis also use CD209L as a portal of entry, and HIV and hepatitis C virus can bind to CD209L on cell membranes but do not use it to mediate virus entry. Our data suggest that the large S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV may use both ACE2 and CD209L in virus infection and pathogenesis.","Jeffers, Scott A; Tusell, Sonia M; Gillim-Ross, Laura; Hemmila, Erin M; Achenbach, Jenna E; Babcock, Gregory J; Thomas, William D; Thackray, Larissa B; Young, Mark D; Mason, Robert J; Ambrosino, Donna M; Wentworth, David E; Demartini, James C; Holmes, Kathryn V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,780,17

Colostrum-derived antibodies make the detection of persistently BVDV-infected neonatal calves cumbersome and expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples from neonatal calves as a method for the early detection of persistent BVDV infection. Three hundred thirty-two 1- to 4-week-old dairy calves were screened for BVDV as part of a routine control program. Formalin-fixed skin biopsy samples were stained for BVDV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the results were compared to those of virus isolation (VI) from white blood cell preparations. Six calves were positive by both IHC and VI and remained positive for BVDV upon subsequent follow-up testing; thus, they were classified as persistently infected with BVDV. One calf was positive by VI but negative by IHC. On subsequent testing, the calf was negative by VI, suggesting that the initial VI result was due to an acute BVDV infection. One calf was positive by IHC but negative by VI. This calf remained negative by VI on follow-up testing. Immunohistochemical staining of skin biopsy samples is a reliable method for screening neonatal calves for persistent BVDV infection and would be a useful management tool as an aid for controlling and preventing BVDV infection.","Grooms, Daniel L; Keilen, Eric D",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,780,26

Xuebijing (XBJ) injection is widely used in the treatment of severe pneumonia and sepsis in China due to its anti-inflammatory effect and immunoregulation. This study investigated whether Xuebijing injection can prevent the cytokine storm and reduce the mortality from severe COVID-19. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blinded trial in which 60 eligible patients were recruited from the First people's Hospital of Jingzhou from February 16 to March 25 in 2020. A total of 57 completing the trial, 3 dropped out. Treatment group received routine medication plus Xuebijing while control group received routine plus saline. Results: The secretion of interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-8(IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;(TNF-&#945;) was suppressed significantly (P<0.05) by Xuebijing. After 14 days treatment, lymphocyte levels in Xuebijing group was substantially higher than control, C-reactive protein (CRP) level in Xuebijing group was remarkably lower. The 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the two group. After 14 days of treatment, there were significant differences in the rate of mechanical ventilation, rate of septic shock, the proportion of patients severely affected who became critically ill type, the duration of improvement of main clinical symptoms (P<0.05) and the length of ICU hospitalization stay (P<0.01) the Xuebijing group.No serious adverse reactions were found for all patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Xuebijing may suppress the CS in severe COVID-19 patients by regulating the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-6, IL-8 and TNF -&#945;.

However, its effectiveness is severely limited by the lack of quantity and diversity of known materials deposited in the current materials repositories such as ICSD and OQMD. Recent progress in machine learning and especially deep learning have enabled a generative strategy that learns implicit chemical rules for creating chemically valid hypothetical materials with new compositions and structures. However, current materials generative models have difficulty in generating structurally diverse, chemically valid, and stable materials. Here we propose CubicGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based deep neural network model for large scale generation of novel cubic crystal structures. When trained on 375,749 ternary crystal materials from the OQMD database, we show that our model is able to not only rediscover most of the currently known cubic materials but also generate hypothetical materials of new structure prototypes. A total of 506 such new materials (all of them are either ternary or quarternary) have been verified by DFT based phonon dispersion stability check, several of which have been found to potentially have exceptional functional properties. Considering the importance of cubic materials in wide applications such as solar cells and lithium batteries, our GAN model provides a promising approach to significantly expand the current repository of materials, enabling the discovery of new functional materials via screening.

We review some basic epidemiological data of this new disease, regarding its appearance, reproductive rate, ways of transmission, number of cases, death rate, usefulness of diagnostic tests, basic treatment options, and prevention and control strategies, including vaccines. RECENT FINDINGS: The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation). The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed. At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission. The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often. They include also targeted restrictions in people's mobility, and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used in Europe once more in the current strong second wave. Waiting for effective and safe vaccines and treatments, stopping the ongoing COVID-19 transmission is our only defense wall. We do not know yet which strategy or strategies worked best. We all must work as a team to give an adequate response to this pandemic. We have just one world and one health. Nobody will be safe until everybody is safe.","Vilella, Anna; Trilla, Antoni",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,780,21

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.22 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: −14.45, −9.98) and 3.55 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-4.81, −2.30). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was 2.5 the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in homicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 6.66 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:3.18, 10.15). External deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in homicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Calderon-Anyosa, Renzo J.C.; Kaufman, Jay S.",Prev Med,780,1

This would apply to dental students as well. Thus, it is important to achieve high COVID‐19 vaccination rates in this group. Further, as healthcare providers, they are entrusted with providing health recommendations and advocating for their patients, community, and profession, including vaccinations. METHODS: Using ualtrics(XM) an online platform, in 2020, a survey was administered anonymously to dental students at three dental schools to assess the attitudes of dental students to the novel COVID‐19 vaccine. Factors and reasons associated with vaccine hesitancy and acceptance toward the COVID‐19 vaccine and likelihood of recommending and giving the vaccination to patients were assessed. RESULTS: Nearly, all participants had positive attitudes toward vaccines in general, agreed they would likely be exposed to COVID‐19, and personally knew someone who had COVID‐19; however, only 56% are willing to take a COVID‐19 vaccine as soon as an FDA‐approved vaccine was available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine, 63% reported they would take it if mandated by the health systems/dental school; however, 16.3% of the overall respondents would not take the COVID‐19 vaccine even if mandated. Several factors are associated with vaccine acceptance and the likelihood of recommending the vaccination, such as trusting public health experts, concerns about side effects, and agreeing with vaccine mandates. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the need for an educational curriculum about the safety and effectiveness to promote the uptake of COVID‐19 vaccine.","Mascarenhas, Ana Karina; Lucia, Victoria C.; Kelekar, Arati; Afonso, Nelia M.",J Dent Educ,780,33
