The Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital group, particularly involved in the nursing of victims, activated its “Plan Blanc” during that tragic night and applied all previously set principles to provide logistical support to the medical care. The crisis unit gathered around the managing director of the establishment managed this implementation in various dimensions: human resources mobilization, activation of all necessary support functions (security of the site, supply of provisions, opening of reception areas for families and staff) and finally, the management of families. Retrospectively, this implementation was globally in accordance with the pre-established dispositions and efficient in terms of support to the emergency medical activity. However, it suggests a critical analysis of weak points in order to improve the procedures of the “Plan Blanc” in a particularly risky current context, as we know.","Petit, A.; Morel, S.; Benmansour, E.; Brossard Lahmy, M.; Lavollé, M. -H.; Terrine, B.; Amselli, A.; Sliwka, C.; Veillerobe, A. -M.; Marcelin, D.; Soubigou, P.; Hubin, J.; Tilleul, P.",,749,1

Infections could be a trigger of the inflammation. The main aim of this study was to describe the presence of infections in children with KD, and to analyse the clinical characteristics and the presence of coronary abnormalities in these cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed within the Kawasaki Disease network (KAWA-RACE (2011-2016). An analysis was performed that included patients with positive microbiological findings (PMF) during the acute phase, as well as those with a previous recent infection (PRI) during the 4 weeks preceding KD diagnosis. RESULTS: The study included a total of 621 children with KD, with PMF being found in 101 (16.3%) patients, and a PRI in 107 (17.2%). Significantly less echocardiographic abnormalities were found in the group with a PRI, when compared to those without a PRI (23 vs. 35%, P = .01) and also a lower proportion of overall coronary artery lesions (16 vs. 25%, P = .054). No significant differences were found in the proportion of aneurysms in either of these groups (PRI or PMF) when compared to those without infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, no differences were found in the incidence of coronary aneurysms in either of the groups, with or without PRI or PMF. Therefore, if KD is suspected, appropriate treatment should be started despite having a confirmed infection.","Fernández-Cooke, Elisa; Tascón, Ana Barrios; Antón-López, Jordi; Grasa Lozano, Carlos Daniel; Sánchez-Manubens, Judith; Calvo, Cristina",An Pediatr (Engl Ed),749,13

B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells and endothelial cells express ICOSL. Inducible costimulator (ICOS) interacts with ICOSL, and this interaction leads to signals involved in isotype switching and the development of immunological memory. Hitherto, no polymorphisms of this gene have been described. The aim of this study was to reveal variation of the ICOSL gene in normal individuals. All eight exons, except exon 1, were sequenced with flanking introns in 10 healthy blood donors. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two length polymorphisms were found. One of the SNPs was found in the coding regions of the gene. The base involved was located in exon 3 and caused a conservative amino acid change from valine (GTT) to isoleucine (ATT). Three individuals were heterozygous G/A for the exon polymorphism, while the remaining seven individuals were homozygous for the wildtype G/G. Exon 3 encodes the immunoglobulin variable (IgV)‐like domain of the molecule which is situated outside the cell. This means that the amino acid could be critical for the stability of the molecule or could constitute part of the binding site for ICOS. The results form the basis for further experiments to find possible associations of the alleles to diseases caused by immune dysregulation. Especially, the exon 3 variant is interesting and could play a role for the development of immunological diseases. Besides, it would be interesting to see whether both exon 3 alleles are expressed or only the wildtype allele is functional.","Jacobsen, K.; Ohm‐Laursen, L.; Barington, T.",Scand J Immunol,749,1

The convergence of nativism and populism has turned into a separate Neo-Nationalism spreading across Europe and America. In mapping their historical evolution through three waves and identifying common qualities, the book provides context for studying the rise of nativist populists. This chapter lays out how Neo-Nationalism of contemporary nativist populists should be understood. It identifies a winning formula of nativist populists, the dual process of instating fear and scapegoating. The chapter discusses discursive manipulations and structural inequities in the rhetoric of contemporary nativist populists. The surge of populist politics examined in this book has brought back the importance of dialectic observation, examining populism as countering mainstream politics. Another contribution here is in identifying a threefold claim which nativist populists put forth in their support of the people.","Bergmann, Eirikur",Neo-Nationalism,749,13

A fundamental shift occurred in the third wave with the Refugee Crisis heightening in 2015. Nativist populism spread further into the mainstream in European and American politics than ever before, for instance bringing Brexit to the UK, Donald Trump to power in America and Marine Le Pen qualifying to the second round in the presidential elections in France. Indeed, this was a brand-new world. The four largest democracies in the world—Brazil, Indonesia and India in addition to the US—were all governed by politicians often labelled as being populist. With the Coronavirus Crisis of 2020 nationalist sentiments were hightening again. Whichever way we attempt to slice this trend, the third wave brought a fundamental shift in the evolution of nativist populism and came to constitute a clear trend of Neo-Nationalism spreading across Europe, America and elsewhere.","Bergmann, Eirikur",Neo-Nationalism,749,1

Over the past decade, a combination of advances in MR imaging scanner technology and increased concern about the effects of ionizing radiation has led to increased utilization of MR imaging in the pediatric population. Despite this general trend, there has been slower adoption of MR imaging to evaluate the lungs and pleura due to technical limitations including motion artifact, low signal-to-noise ratios, and signal dephasing at air-tissue interfaces. As MR imaging technology advances, many of these technical hurdles are being overcome, and MR imaging of the lungs and pleura has begun to be a feasible option for many pediatric pleuropulmonary conditions. Therefore, an up-to-date understanding of these emerging applications is important to practitioners performing MR imaging in infants and children. In this chapter, an overview of MR imaging techniques to evaluate the lungs and pleura in children is discussed.

The set of ARDS biomarkers to prospectively define these phenotypes remains to be established. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the biomarkers that were multivariately associated with ARDS development or mortality. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic search in Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar from inception until 6 March 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies assessing biomarkers for ARDS development in critically ill patients at risk for ARDS and mortality due to ARDS adjusted in multivariate analyses were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We included 35 studies for ARDS development (10,667 patients at risk for ARDS) and 53 for ARDS mortality (15,344 patients with ARDS). These studies were too heterogeneous to be used in a meta-analysis, as time until outcome and the variables used in the multivariate analyses varied widely between studies. After qualitative inspection, high plasma levels of angiopoeitin-2 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were associated with an increased risk of ARDS development. None of the biomarkers (plasma angiopoeitin-2, C-reactive protein, interleukin-8, RAGE, surfactant protein D, and Von Willebrand factor) was clearly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker data reporting and variables used in multivariate analyses differed greatly between studies. Angiopoeitin-2 and RAGE in plasma were positively associated with increased risk of ARDS development. None of the biomarkers independently predicted mortality. Therefore, we suggested to structurally investigate a combination of biomarkers and clinical parameters in order to find more homogeneous ARDS phenotypes.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-dose exogenous surfactant therapy on infants suffering ARDS after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of infants diagnosed with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150) after cardiac surgery. A case was defined as a patient that received surfactant and standard therapy, while a control was defined as a patient that underwent standard therapy. The primary endpoint was the improvement in oxygenation index (OI) after 24-h of surfactant treatment; and secondary endpoints were the ventilator time and PICU time. RESULTS: Twenty-two infants treated with surfactant were matched with 22 controls. Early low-dose (20 mg/kg) surfactant treatment was associated with improved outcomes. After surfactant administration for 24-h, the surfactant group was much better compared with the control group at the 24-h in OI (difference in average change from baseline, − 6.7 [95% CI, − 9.3 to − 4.1]) (P < 0.01) and ventilation index (VI, mean difference, − 11.9 [95% CI, − 18.1 to − 5.7]) (P < 0.01). Ventilation time and PICU time were significantly shorter in the surfactant group compared with the control group (133.6 h ± 27.2 vs 218.4 h ± 28.7, P < 0.01; 10.7d ± 5.1 vs 17.5d ± 6.8, P < 0.01). Infants in the surfactant group under 3 months benefit more from OI and VI than the infants over 3 months in a preliminary exploratory analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In infants with moderate-to-severe ARDS after cardiac surgery, early low-dose exogenous surfactant treatment could prominently improve oxygenation and reduce mechanical ventilation time and PICU time. Infants younger than 3 months may get more benefit of oxygenation than the older ones. Randomized controlled trials are needed to explore the effect of surfactant to ARDS of cardiac surgical infants.","Zhang, Rongyuan; Wang, Xu; Li, Shoujun; Yan, Jun",BMC Pulm Med,749,1

Effective management of such complications is of key clinical importance. In some infants with HPP, severe tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) contributes to respiratory difficulties. The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical features, investigations and management in these patients. METHODS: We report a case series of five infants with perinatal HPP, with confirmed TBM, who were treated with asfotase alfa and observed for 3–7 years. Additionally, we reviewed respiratory function data in a subgroup of patients with perinatal and infantile HPP included in the clinical trials of asfotase alfa, who required high-pressure respiratory support (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] ≥6 cm H(2)O and/or peak inspiratory pressure ≥18 cm H(2)O) during the studies. RESULTS: The case series showed that TBM contributed significantly to respiratory morbidity, and prolonged respiratory support with high PEEP was required. However, TBM improved over time, allowing weaning of all patients from ventilator use. The review of clinical trial data included 20 patients and found a high degree of heterogeneity in PEEP requirements across the cohort; median PEEP was 8 cm H(2)O at any time and some patients presented with high PEEP (≥8 cm H(2)O) over periods of more than 6 months. CONCLUSION: In infants with HPP presenting with persistent respiratory complications, it is important to screen for TBM and initiate appropriate respiratory support and treatment with asfotase alfa at an early stage.

However, conventional PCR methods cannot determine virus infectivity. Virus infectivity is conventionally examined with methods such as the plaque assay, even though such assays require several days. Long-range reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has previously been suggested for the rapid assessment of RNA virus infectivity where the loss of infectivity is attributable to genomic fragmentation. METHODS: IAV was irradiated with 253.7 nm ultraviolet (UV) rays to induce genomic strand breaks that were confirmed by a full-length RT-PCR assay. The IAV was then subjected to plaque assay, conventional RT-qPCR and long-range RT-qPCR to examine the relationship between infectious titer and copy number. A simple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the correlation between the results of these assays. RESULTS: A long-range RT-qPCR assay was developed and validated for influenza A virus (IAV). Although only a few minutes of UV irradiation was required to completely inactivate IAV, genomic RNA remained detectable by the conventional RT-qPCR and the full-length RT-PCR for NS of viral genome following inactivation. A long-range RT-qPCR assay was then designed using RT-priming at the 3′ termini of each genomic segment and subsequent qPCR of the 5′ regions. UV-mediated IAV inactivation was successfully analyzed by the long-range RT-qPCR assay especially when targeting PA of the viral genome. This was also supported by the regression analysis that the long-range RT-qPCR is highly correlated with plaque assay (Adjusted R(2) = 0.931, P = 0.000066). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that IAV infectivity can be predicted without the infectivity assays. The rapid detection of pathogenic IAV has, therefore, been achieved with this sensing technology.","Nakaya, Yuki; Fukuda, Takashi; Ashiba, Hiroki; Yasuura, Masato; Fujimaki, Makoto",BMC Infect Dis,749,1

A standardized structured questionnaire was used to obtain additional information from the parents/guardian of the children. Chi square was used to analyze the results and significance was determined at 0.05. The results showed 31.5% prevalence of rotavirus among children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and 25.7% prevalence in the general population. The prevalence was highest (60.9%) among children 0–12 months and decreased as the age increased. Rotavirus infection was significantly higher in bottle-fed children than in those feed exclusively breast milk.

For this reason, the German government launched a corona tracing app (“Corona-Warn-App”). Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and following them up daily for 14 days from the last point of exposure. Therefore, the app warns users if they might have been in close contact with COVID-19-infected individuals. When systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission of COVID-19 and is an essential public health tool for controlling the virus. The German corona tracing app has been discussed in public, particularly as many people have strong privacy concerns. Furthermore, many people questioned the effectiveness of the tracing-app (e.g., as many older people are not willing or capable of using the app). The present study sheds light on current research on individual privacy concerns in light of the launch of the corona tracing app. Building on this, the author presents psychological determinants of individual privacy concerns that have been discussed in research so far. The author analyses in a qualitative study 967 reader comments to determine whether the previously identified individual determinants are relevant in the case of the Corona-Warn-App. The results confirm that three categories in particular are relevant in this context: The functional utility of the app (37% of codings), data protection, privacy, transparency and trust (26%) and the influence of the social environment (8%).

The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and to investigate independent risk factors for the development of CIN. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2014, all pre-hospital intubated major trauma patients with documented serum creatinine levels (SCr) undergoing a contrast-enhanced whole-body CT at admission were retrospectively analyzed. CIN was defined as a relative increase in SCr > 25% over the baseline value or an absolute SCr increase of > 44 µmol/l within 72 h. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors. A p value of < 0.01 was considered statistically significant and a p value of 0.01–0.049 suggested evidence. RESULTS: Of 284 analyzed patients, 41 (14%) met the criteria for CIN. There is suggestive evidence that age and lactate level influenced the development of CIN. Six patients (15%) had hemodialysis in the CIN-group and eight (3.3%) in the group without CIN. Complication and mortality rate was higher in patients with CIN (71% vs. 56% and 32% vs. 23%, respectively). CIN was not an independent risk factor for complications or mortality while controlling for age, gender, injury severity score, and lactate level. The length of stay was not affected by CIN. CONCLUSION: CIN occurs frequently in trauma patients, but is not an independent risk factor for complications or mortality. Therefore, contrast enhanced whole-body CT can safely be performed in trauma patients.","Kelemen, Julian Alexander; Kaserer, Alexander; Jensen, Kai Oliver; Stein, Philipp; Seifert, Burkhardt; Simmen, Hans-Peter; Spahn, Donat R.; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Neuhaus, Valentin",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,749,1

After that, DEMATELtechnique is utilised to develop the causal and effectrelationships between all the identified enablers of a coordination system in IoT based AFSC. It has been noticed that‘Top Management Support (TMS)’ is the main driver by MICMAC analysis and categorised in a cause group based on (R-C) value. Further, the coordination index of the entire model is calculated based on the Cleveland theory. This paper also discussed a case study of the sugar mill industry. This paper also discussed stakeholder theory in developing IoT based coordination system of AFSC. Further, theoretical contribution may also guide the managers of the organisation in developing their strategies by using Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis based on Cleveland index.","Yadav, Sanjeev; Luthra, Sunil; Garg, Dixit",Oper Manag Res,749,1

The lockdowns have highlighted and exacerbated the disadvantages experienced by those children who suffer from child poverty. This article focuses on food insecurity and the digital divide, or digital exclusion, and argues that these have emerged as very pressing issues during lockdowns for children suffering from child poverty. The article provides an outline of the response of the Catholic Church and Catholic schools, primarily in the United Kingdom. There have been some concerted efforts to address food insecurity by providing food and food vouchers for children and vulnerable families. It has proved more problematic to address digital exclusion and the article argues that for those children who experience digital exclusion, this can effectively mean exclusion from the religious education, religious life, community and the pastoral and spiritual support that is normally offered by the Catholic school.","McKinney, Stephen J.",j,749,1

It recommends at least twelve hours for ‘all forms of primary ITE’, challenging the current provision of many primary ITE providers. Information gathered by the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE) and others demonstrates the need to improve not only the hours taught, but also the quality of provision across all training routes. Many beginner teachers lack confidence in their RE subject knowledge and fear causing offence. If RE is to play a valid part in a twenty-first century primary curriculum, training needs to address these concerns and develop understanding of the complex knowledge the subject requires. This paper explores aspects of knowledge in RE, the importance of relating developing practical wisdom to subject knowledge and considers a project which responds directly to the Commission’s report.","Whitworth, Linda",j,749,1

These tools provide statements to produce non-deterministic values for certain variables, thus forcing the corresponding model checker to consider all possible values for these during verification. While these statements offer an effective way of verifying programs handling basic data types and simple structured types, they are inappropriate as a mechanism for nondeterministic generation of pointers, favoring the use of insertion routines to produce dynamic data structures when verifying, via model checking, programs handling such data types. We present a technique to improve model checking of programs handling heap-allocated data types, by taming the explosion of candidate structures that can be built when non-deterministically initializing heap object fields. The technique exploits precomputed relational bounds, that disregard values deemed invalid by the structure’s type invariant, thus reducing the state space to be explored by the model checker.

The omission of these speeches raises troubling questions about the public record of this administration. Donald Trump uses Twitter aggressively with the lowest average daily speech totals in 30 years. Through an examination of speeches via media markets and Electoral College results, he is a president who primarily only focuses on places with his strongest support. As a result, he has also regularly gone to some of the smallest cities for rallies in decades when compared to other presidents.","O’Brien, Shannon Bow",Donald Trump and the Kayfabe Presidency,749,1

The sophisticated features, complexities on regulatory framework, and high volatility of Cryptocurrencies would pose trading challenges to new investors and/or investors with limited knowledge. Investors generally are influenced by fund managers, financial analysts or other investors who are considered as well informed and highly knowledgeable peers. Investors mimic their behaviour to perform trading activities and such behaviour is termed as Herding. Covid 19 pandemic triggered severe uncertainties in the cryptocurrencies market and has led to wide fluctuations in prices causing severe volatility and market crashes. This paper aims to examine the herding behaviour in cryptocurrency market during the pre Covid 19 and Covid 19 pandemic period using the Cross-Sectional Standard Deviation (CSSD) approach. The findings of the paper reveal that herding was evident among all the ten crypto-currencies in normal market conditions of the entire sample period but not during market upswing or downswing. However, the herding behaviour was present in the cryptocurrencies Litecoin, Cardano and Dash during the Covid 19 pandemic period in all market conditions.","Susana, D.; Kavisanmathi, J.

However, detecting the leakage of sensitive information in networked systems is still a challenging problem, especially when adversaries use covert channels to exfiltrate sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Presently, approaches for detecting timing-based covert channels have been studied more extensively than those for detecting storage-based covert channels. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of a selection of statistical tests for detecting storage-based covert channels. We present the results of several experiments which show that complexity-based tests are effective at detecting storage-based covert channels when information is embedded into network packet header fields that are not expected to follow a particular pattern, such as the IP Identification and Time-to-Live. These results can help to guide the construction of practical detection platforms capable of effectively detecting the leakage of sensitive information via storage-based covert channels.","Sattolo, Thomas A.

Chest radiography remains an important component of the evaluation of a patient with a suspicion of pneumonia, and is usually the first examination to be obtained. The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is based on the presence of select clinical features and is supported by imaging of the lung, usually by chest radiography. Infection of the lower respiratory tract typically presents radiologically as one of 3 patterns: (a) focal nonsegmental or lobar pneumonia, (b) multifocal bronchopneumonia or lobular pneumonia, and (c) focal or diffuse ""interstitial"" pneumonia. High-resolution computed tomography allows a better depiction of the pattern and distribution of pneumonia than the radiograph but is seldom required in the evaluation of patients with suspected or proven bacterial pneumonia.

This study included 22 patients, 20 adults, and 2 children, and an overall mean age of 46 years old at the time of transplantation. Twelve patients (54.5%) received IT, and the remainder (45.5%) MVT. The mean time between transplantation and mTORs initiation was 24 months. The indication was worsening renal function in 13 patients (59%), with 9/13(69.2%) noted to have an increase in glomerular filtration rate of at least 10 mL/min/1.73m2. The indication for 4 patients (18.2%) was history of neuroendocrine tumor. After mTOR initiation, 50% of patients were reduced or weaned off tacrolimus and 13.7% off prednisone. mTORs were discontinued in 11/22 patients. Six patients (54.5%) stopped due to side effects, two (18.1%) for surgery, and one (9%) for acute cellular rejection. Side effects were edema (33.3%), headaches (33.3%), diarrhea (16.7%), and oral ulcers (16.7%). Average duration of mTORs prior to discontinuation due to side effects was 7 months. mTORs may function in their own niche of patients due to the potential renal safety profile, but use is most limited by tolerance to side effects.","Modi, Krishna; Segovia, Maria; Mavis, Alisha; Schiano, Thomas; Patel, Yuval; Boike, Justin; Sudan, Debra; Nagai, Shunji; Jafri, Syed-Mohammed",Clinical transplantation,749,12

To date, there is inconsistent evidence in the literature on whether individuals with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability (ASD-without-ID) experience difficulties in identification of spoken emotions. We conducted a meta-analysis (literature search following the PRISMA guidelines), with 26 data sets (taken from 23 peer-reviewed journal articles) comparing individuals with ASD-without-ID (N = 614) and typically-developed (TD) controls (N = 640), from nine countries and in seven languages (published until February 2020). In our analyses there was no sufficient evidence to suggest that individuals with HF-ASD differ from matched controls in the identification of simple prosodic emotions (e.g., sadness, happiness). However, individuals with ASD-without-ID were found to perform significantly worse than controls in identification of complex prosodic emotions (e.g., envy and boredom). The level of the semantic content of the stimuli presented (e.g., sentences vs. strings of digits) was not found to have an impact on the results. In conclusion, the difference in findings between simple and complex emotions calls for a new-look on emotion processing in ASD-without-ID. Intervention programs may rely on the intact abilities of individuals with ASD-without-ID to process simple emotions and target improved performance with complex emotions. LAY SUMMARY: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability (ASD-without-ID) do not differ from matched controls in the identification of simple prosodic emotions (e.g., sadness, happiness). However, they were found to perform significantly worse than controls in the identification of complex prosodic emotions (e.g., envy, boredom).

The instructor's e-feedback via Blackboard and WhatsApp platform and the follow-up interview were analyzed qualitatively. The findings indicate that (1) the highest number of instructor's e-feedback focused on global issues as compared to local issues, (2) the instructor composed his e-feedback in the form of eight main categories: explanations, suggestions, clarifications, questioning, repetitions, statements, praises, and commands, (3) the instructor used more screencasts for providing e-feedback, followed by written and audio modes respectively. The thematic analysis (4) revealed the instructor's positive impression on providing e-feedback through these interactive modes (written, audio, and screencast) and a range of challenging issues such as students' preference issues, technical issues, timing issues, financial and areal issues.

The study's aim is to characterize learning assessment proposals designed, at the beginning of the lockdown, by graduate and postgraduate health sciences teachers. These proposals were developed in the context of a University Institute teacher-training program on virtualizing education. By using a qualitative approach, this descriptive-interpretative study characterizes 51 remote learning assessment proposals made by teachers taking the course. In order to construct interpretative hypotheses, a matrix for their categorization was created to identify the prevalence of pedagogical traits in the designs. An array of different proposals were evidenced, most of which were to assess learning with the intention of certifying knowledge. Individual learning assessments prevailed, mostly favoring an active use of knowledge associated with academic and professional practices. A high percentage of teachers planned asynchronous activities by means of writing and the use of a broad array of digital tools. They also prioritized teacher interventions during the assessment process as a scaffolding for the students. Finally, there was a systematization of the emerging characteristics that structured the designs of remote learning assessment proposals. This provides an input toward reflecting on assessment practices in the context of remote teaching. We hope this contribution transcends the current scenario and helps identify potentials for the development of hybrid assessment practices in post pandemic times.","Schwartzman, Gisela Roni Carolina Berk Michelle Delorenzi Erica Sánchez Mariana Eder María Laura",Revista Iberoamericana de Educación a Distancia,749,28

UNWTO predictions indicated a decline in international tourist arrivals and the respective loss in revenues generated by tourist activity for the first year of the pandemic. Undoubtedly, such an impact may not be the same for every country, especially on a domestic level. In fact, the recovery process upon COVID-19 suggests domestic tourism as the driving force. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the tourist behavioral intentions after the first outbreak of COVID-19 with evidence from the Greek market. Design/methodology/approach: A primary survey with questionnaires distributed via online channels (email and social media) has been undertaken to focus on the travelers’ preferences when it comes to the main parts that compose the holiday travel (destination, transport mode, accommodation type). Additionally, there were questions regard to their perceptions on the international norms of health protection against the virus. Findings: The results of the survey illustrate some prima facie evidence of tourist behavioral intentions of Greeks, upon a statistical analysis, which indicates preference in domestic tourism and personalized services, issues related with travel costs and health safety awareness, toward tourism recovery process and customers’ reengagement and trust to the tourism businesses and destinations. Originality/value: As Greece is a popular destination that includes a plethora of tourism cities, this paper illustrates the intentions of Greeks toward tourism activity upon pandemic crisis, when it comes to their travel preferences, as well as their perceptions on health and safety protocols applied in destinations and tourism businesses. © 2021, International Tourism Studies Association.","Poulaki, I.; Nikas, I.

This study aimed to assess the willingness of healthcare providers in Jordan to report for duty and provide care to COVID-19 patients. Methods An online questionnaire was developed including questions about demographics, willingness to report to work and provide care to COVID-19 patients, and potential associated factors. Results A total of 253 participants completed the survey (mean age 33.8 years, 58.6% male). The sample included physicians (14.9%), nurses (61.1%) and paramedics (23%). Most participants (96.4%) were willing to come to work during the pandemic, although only 64.7% showed a willingness to provide care to COVID-19 patients. Being male (OR 3.21;95% CI: 1.75-5.90) or having adequate training on COVID-19 (OR 5.16;95% CI: 2.32-11.46) were the major predictors for willingness to care for COVID-19 patients, whereas concerns for family safety (OR 0.25;95% CI: 0.14-0.47) or lack of information about COVID-19 (OR 0.43;95% CI: 0.23-0.80) were the major predicting barriers for willingness to care for COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Although most participants were willing to report for duty, less than two-thirds were willing to care for COVID-19 patients. Being male and receiving training are associated with willingness;whereas concern for family is associated with less willingness to care for COVID-19 patients.","Alwidyan, M. T.; Oteir, A.

Thrombotic adverse events linked to Moderna, Pfizer and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been documented and described as extremely rare. While the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has received much of the attention, the other vaccines should not go unchallenged. This study aimed to determine the frequency of reported thrombotic adverse events and clinical outcomes for these three COVID-19 vaccines, namely, Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca Methods A retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted of spontaneous reports for Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines submitted to the EudraVigilance database in the period from 17 February to 14 June 2021. Findings There were 729,496 adverse events for the three vaccines, of which 3,420 were thrombotic, mainly Oxford-AstraZeneca (n=1,988; 58.1%) followed by Pfizer (n=1,096; 32.0%) and Moderna (n=336; 9.8%). As serious adverse events, there were 705 reports of pulmonary embolism for the three vaccines, of which 130 reports (18.4%) were for Moderna, 226 reports (32.1%) for Pfizer and 349 (49.5%) for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. The occurrence of pulmonary embolism is significantly associated with a fatal outcome (P=<0.001). Sixty-three fatalities were recorded (n=63/3420; 1.8%), of which Moderna (n=6), Pfizer (n=25) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (n=32).

We examined the relationships between tissue-specific expression and the epigenetics of five genes involved in these pathways, NLRP3, MMP2, MMP9, CCN2/CTGF, and AGT. The proteins encoded by these genes play major fibrosis-related roles in inflammasome formation, degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and remodeling of the extracellular matrix and vasculature, autocrine regulation of fibrosis, or cell signaling. Our analyses showed that the first four of these genes had super-enhancers (unusually strong enhancer clusters) that correlate with their very high expression in monocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, or venous cells. Expression of the gene encoding miR-223, a micro-RNA that plays an important role in downregulating NLRP3 protein levels, is also probably driven by the super-enhancer in which it is embedded. Enhancer chromatin for all these genes was inside as well as outside the gene body. While AGT, which encodes precursors of angiotensin II, lacked a super-enhancer, its tissue-specific expression profile correlates with the tissue-specific enhancer chromatin extending into its distant silent gene neighbor (CAPN9). Tissue-specific peaks of DNA hypomethylation, open chromatin (DNaseI hypersensitivity), and transcription factor binding were detected in subregions of these super-enhancers/enhancers that are likely to be the main drivers of expression of their associated gene. We found that CCN2/CTGF is co-expressed with its far-upstream neighbor LINC01013, a noncoding RNA gene, specifically in vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and chondrocytes. Evidence from chromatin looping profiling (Hi-C) suggests coregulation of these genes in HUVEC. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding the often-overlooked roles of enhancers and their hypomethylated, transcription factor-binding subregions in the regulation of expression of fibrosis-related genes in normal and fibrotic tissue.","Chandra, Sruti; Ehrlich, Kenneth C.; Lacey, Michelle; Baribault, Carl; Ehrlich, Melanie",bioRxiv,749,1

Social isolation, unemployment and financial difficulties can have an impact on mental health and trigger the use of alcohol as a form of coping. Since the beginning of this pandemic, the WHO had warned the general public of the potential risks of increased alcohol consumption, which might result in a higher incidence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) in future.ObjectivesThe aim is to do a review of the literature of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsNon-systematic review of the literature with selection of scientific articles published in the last 7 months;by searching the Pubmed databases, the following MeSH terms were used: COVID-19;alcohol consumption.ResultsA recent article in The Lancet suggested that mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic, a major public health concern, are worthy of attention. Market research showed that alcohol sales increased in several countries compared to the same time last year. However, with the closure of several drinking places, sales are not in themselves reliable enough estimates of alcohol consumption. On the other hand, economic crises can lead to a reduction in alcohol consumption, due to financial problems or the risk of unemployment.ConclusionsThe present global circumstance is unique, and there is a need for further research on the relationship between alcohol consumption and COVID-19 to understand its long-term effects and develop specific prevention programs for this population.","Gonçalves, M.

In France, after the first lockdown from March to May 2020, many parents and children were then also concerned about whether reopening plans for school could ensure the safety of students, despite data concerning children with COVID-19 seem reassuring, and very few of them develop severe forms of the disease (1, 2, 3). Objectives: Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the therapeutic management of JIA, the frequency of returning to school after the first lockdown period and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the survey. Methods: JIA patients under 18 years of age, usually treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were prospectively included during their outpatient visit and completed a standardized questionnaire. Data regarding the general characteristics of the participants, medical history, SARS-CoV-2 infection, characteristics of JIA subtypes and treatment modifications were collected. Results: A total of 173 patients from 8 different expert centers were included between May and August 2020. Their mean age was 11.6 years (± 4.1 years), and most of them 31.2% (54/173) had a rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA. Fifty percent (86/172) were treated with methotrexate, and 72.5% (124/171) were treated with bDMARDs. DMARD treatment modification in relation to the pandemic was observed in 4.0% (7/173) of participants, our results reflect good adherence of the patient/parents to their immunosuppressive treatments. 49.1% (81/165) of the patients did not return to school due to a personal/parental decision in 69.9% (55/81) of cases, due to anxiety of the patient/parents regarding COVID-19. Two patients were diagnosed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: This study suggests that JIA patients treated with DMARDs continued their treatment during the pandemic. In contrast, parents' reluctance was a major obstacle for returning to school. Therefore, more solidified school reopening strategies should be developed.","Quéré, B.; Lemelle, I.; Lohse, A.; Pillet, P.; Molimard, J.; Richer, O.; Sordet, C.; Despert, V.; Rossi-Semerano, L.; Borocco, C.; Koné-Paut, I.; Gervais, E.; Guellec, D.; Devauchelle-Pensec, V.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,749,26

A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as responsible for the lung infection, now called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Since then there has been an exponential growth of infections and at the beginning of March 2020 the WHO declared the epidemic a global emergency. An early diagnosis of those carrying the virus becomes crucial to contain the spread, morbidity and mortality of the pandemic. The definitive diagnosis is made through specific tests, among which imaging tests play an important role in the care path of the patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

This paper contributes to understanding of gender inclusive learning in face to face and virtual educational environments, specifically in the context of teamwork within engineering and computer science classes. Students' experiences and perceptions of gender inclusive teamwork before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected using an online survey (N = 217). A principal component analysis revealed five components in students' reported experiences: Psychological Safety, Perceptions of the Facilitator, Confidence, Respect for Diversity, and Perceived Fairness. A multivariate analysis of covariance with gender and semester (before or during COVID-19) as the independent variables and age as the covariance found main effects only. Students' perceived psychological safety and confidence were higher in the online teamwork during COVID-19 than in the previous semester of face-to-face teamwork. The result is reassuring, as it indicates, consistent with other literature, that inclusion in student teamwork is likely to be improved when online elements are introduced. © 2021 IEEE.","Male, S.; Marinelli, M.; Chapman, E.","2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON 2021",749,1

Understanding best practices in UV-C dose measurement for N95 respirator decontamination is essential to the safety of medical professionals, researchers, and the public. Here, we outline the fundamental optical principles governing UV-C irradiation and detection, as well as the key metrics of UV-C wavelength and dose. In particular, we discuss the technical and regulatory distinctions between UV-C N95 respirator decontamination and other applications of germicidal UV-C, and we highlight the unique considerations required for UV-C N95 respirator decontamination. Together, this discussion will inform best practices for UV-C dose measurement for N95 respirator decontamination during crisis-capacity conditions.","Geldert, A.; Balch, H. B.; Gopal, A.; Su, A.

Although a number of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, we still lack an understanding of the overall landscape of B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in COVID-19 patients. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of BCR repertoires collected over multiple time points during an infection to characterize statistical and dynamical signatures of the B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 patients with different disease severities. Based on principled statistical approaches, we determined differential sequence features of BCRs associated with different disease severity. We identified 34 significantly expanded rare clonal lineages shared among patients as candidates for a specific response to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we identified natural emergence of a BCR with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a number of patients.

As demonstration, there are centenarians showing remarkable capacity to recover after coronavirus infection.We hypothesize that centenarian's portfolio could help in identifying protective biological mechanisms underlying the coronavirus infection.The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is one of the major genetic regions associated with human longevity, due to its central role in the development of adaptive immune response and modulation of the individual's response to life threatening diseases. The HLA locus seems to be crucial in influencing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.In this hypothesis, we assume that the biological process in which HLA are involved may explain some aspects of coronavirus infection in centenarians, although we cannot rule out other biological mechanisms that these extraordinary persons are able to adopt to cope with the infection.","Guerini, Franca Rosa; Cesari, Matteo; Arosio, Beatrice",Immun Ageing,749,1

Therefore, this multinational study aimed to assess the mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the pandemic, and to explore potential associations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress and women's sociodemographic, health, and reproductive characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK between 16 June and 14 July 2020. Pregnant and breastfeeding women up to 3 months postpartum who were older than 18 years of age were eligible. The online, anonymous survey was promoted through social media and hospital websites. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to assess mental health status. Regression model analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor mental health status. RESULTS: In total, 9041 women participated (including 3907 pregnant and 5134 breastfeeding women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (EDS &#8805; 13) was 15% in the pregnancy cohort and and 13% the breastfeeding cohort. Moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD &#8805; 10) were found among 11% and 10% of the pregnant and breastfeeding women. The mean (±SD) PSS scores for pregnant and breastfeeding women were 14.1 ± 6.6 and 13.7 ± 6.6, respectively. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic illness in the postpartum period, smoking, having an unplanned pregnancy, professional status, and living in the UK or Ireland. CONCLUSIONS: This multinational study found high levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety among pregnant and breastfeeding women during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings underline the importance of monitoring perinatal mental health during pandemics and other societal crises to safeguard maternal and infant mental health.","Ceulemans, Michael; Foulon, Veerle; Ngo, Elin; Panchaud, Alice; Winterfeld, Ursula; Pomar, Léo; Lambelet, Valentine; Cleary, Brian; O039,; Shaughnessy, Fergal; Passier, Anneke; Richardson, Jonathan L; Hompes, Titia; Nordeng, Hedvig",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,749,20

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set six aspects of performance assessment for general health systems, which are hardly applicable to the PHC setup in a low- and middle-income country. The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) has prescribed a framework with five domains consisting of 36 indicators for primary healthcare performance assessment from a policy point of view. For the assessment to be realistic, it should include inputs from stakeholders involved in care delivery, so this study examines the perspectives of healthcare providers at PHCs in India. METHODOLOGY: The authors used qualitative research methodology in the form of responsive evaluations of healthcare provider's interviews to understand the indicators of PHC performance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study results showed that healthcare providers considered efficient teamwork, opportunities for enhancing provider skills and knowledge, job satisfaction, effective PHC administration, and good community relationship as PHC performance assessment. These domains of performance could be considered the 'missing link' in PHC assessment, since they are deemed important by providers and did not coincide with the WHO aspects and the PHCPI performance assessment framework.","Bangalore Sathyananda, Rajeshwari; Krumeich, Anja; Manjunath, Usha; de Rijk, Angelique; van Schayck, C P",Int. j. health plann. manage,749,1

This study aims to investigate the effective factors on the biodegradation of Iranian heavy crude oil by Bacillus licheniformis. For this purpose, oil removal from the artificial seawater was studied by response surface methodology (RSM). After the screening experiments, pH (4-10), NaCl concentration (0-10 g/L), and oil concentration (500-4500 ppm) were selected as influential factors. Moreover, to evaluate the bacterial capability in bioremediation of an actual polluted site, crude oil spill with a salinity of 35 g/L was experimentally simulated. The proposed model in this study clearly shows that both selected individual factors and their interactions are significantly effective on the crude oil biodegradation capacity. The results showed that Bacillus licheniformis was able to degrade crude oil at different concentrations of oil, especially at low concentrations, which are challenging in actual polluted sites. 15%-66% removal was achieved for 500-4500 ppm of crude oil after 14 days. Furthermore, according to the obtained results, this bacterium can tolerate the salinity up to 3.5%. At this salinity level, crude oil removal was 23.43 and 25.64% in neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. Process factors were optimized, and 54.8% of crude oil was removed at optimum conditions i.e., 3500 ppm crude oil concentration, 2.5 g/L of NaCl and pH equal to 8.5. Finally, it can be concluded that the selected bacterium of this study can be more effective in harsh environments such as hypersaline and alkaline conditions.","Khanpour-Alikelayeh, Elham; Partovinia, Ali; Talebi, Ahmad; Kermanian, Hossein",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,749,16

We then obtain aggregate vector representations of the influencers based on their tweet embeddings, which alongside retweet graphs help compute their stance and polarity with respect to these political issues. We find that influencers engage with the topics in a partisan manner, with polarized influencers being rewarded with increased retweeting and following. Moreover, we observe that specific groups of influencers are consistently polarized across all events. We conclude by discussing how our study provides insights into the political schisms of present-day India, but also offers a means to study the role of influencers in exacerbating political polarization in other contexts.","Dash, Saloni; Mishra, Dibyendu; Shekhawat, Gazal; Pal, Joyojeet",,749,20

Survey-based assessments cannot capture nuances of consultations. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with health professionals who requested ethics consults during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Healthcare professionals requesting ethics consultation between March 2020 and May 2020 at a tertiary academic medical centre were eligible to participate. We asked participants to comment on the consults they called and thematically analysed responses to identify features associated with optimal quality consultations. RESULTS: Of 14 healthcare providers, 8 (57%) were women and professions were as follows: 11 (79%) medical doctors, 1 (7%) social worker, 1 (7%) physician assistant and 1 (7%) nurse practitioner. Two aspects of quality emerged: satisfaction and value. Themes within the domain of satisfaction included: responsiveness of the ethics consultant, willingness to consult, institutional role of the ethics service and identifying areas for improvement. When describing value, respondents spoke of the intrapersonal and interpersonal worth of consultation. CONCLUSION: Participants were generally satisfied with ethics consultation services, similar to opinions of those found in pre-COVID-19 survey studies. Our qualitative approach allowed for a richer exploration of the value of ethics consultation during the pandemic and has implications for ethics consultation services more broadly. Ethics consultation-emphasising both the process and outcome-created valuable moral spaces, promoting thoughtful and ethical responses to dilemmas in patient care. Future assessments should incorporate patient and family/surrogate perspectives and explore the domain of education as an additional quality measure.","Kana, Lulia; Shuman, Andrew; De Vries, Raymond; Firn, Janice",J. med. ethics,749,16

Interferon lambda-1 is a type III interferon involved in innate antiviral responses with activity against respiratory pathogens. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon lambda in the treatment of outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned to a single subcutaneous injection of peginterferon lambda 180 µg or placebo within 7 days of symptom onset or first positive swab if asymptomatic. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation list created with a randomisation schedule in blocks of four.

The decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA was greater in those treated with peginterferon lambda than placebo from day 3 onwards, with a difference of 2·42 log copies per mL at day 7 (p=0·0041). By day 7, 24 (80%) participants in the peginterferon lambda group had an undetectable viral load, compared with 19 (63%) in the placebo group (p=0·15). After controlling for baseline viral load, patients in the peginterferon lambda group were more likely to have undetectable virus by day 7 than were those in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 4·12 [95% CI 1·15-16·73; p=0·029). Of those with baseline viral load above 106 copies per mL, 15 (79%) of 19 patients in the peginterferon lambda group had undetectable virus on day 7, compared with six (38%) of 16 in the placebo group (OR 6·25 [95% CI 1·49-31·06]; p=0·012). Peginterferon lambda was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar between groups with mild and transient aminotransferase, concentration increases more frequently observed in the peginterferon lambda group. Two individuals met the threshold of grade 3 increase, one in each group, and no other grade 3 or 4 laboratory adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Peginterferon lambda accelerated viral decline in outpatients with COVID-19, increasing the proportion of patients with viral clearance by day 7, particularly in those with high baseline viral load. Peginterferon lambda has potential to prevent clinical deterioration and shorten duration of viral shedding.

Reduced emergency room visits resulting in adverse outcomes have most recently been reported in pediatrics and cardiology. We aimed to compare patients with emergency room visits for pyelonephritis in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) and within the first wave of pandemic in 2020 (COVID-19 era) with regard to the number of visits and severe adverse disease outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre study comparing characteristics and outcomes of patients with pyelonephritis, excluding patients with hydronephrosis due to stone disease, in 10 urology departments in Germany during a 1-month time frame in March and April in each 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: The number of emergency room visits for pyelonephritis in the COVID-19 era was lower (44 patients, 37.0%) than in the pre-COVID-19 era (76 patients, 63.0%), reduction rate: 42.1% (p = 0.003). Severe adverse disease outcome was more frequent in the COVID-19 era (9/44 patients, 20.5%) than in the pre-COVID-19 era (5/76 patients, 6.6%, p = 0.046). In detail, 7 versus 3 patients needed monitoring (15.9 vs. 3.9%), 2 versus no patients needed intensive-care treatment (4.5 vs. 0%), 2 versus no patients needed drain placement (4.5 vs. 0%), 2 versus no patients had a nephrectomy (4.5 vs. 0%), and 2 versus 1 patient died (4.5 vs. 1.3%). CONCLUSION: This report of collateral damage during CO-VID-19 showed that emergency room visits were decreased, and severe adverse disease outcomes were increased for patients with pyelonephritis in the COVID-19 era. Health authorities should set up information campaign programs actively encouraging patients to utilize emergency room services in case of severe symptoms specifically during the actual second wave of pandemic.","Borgmann, Hendrik; Struck, Julian P; Mattigk, Angelika; Wenzel, Mike; Pilatz, Adrian; Kranz, Jennifer; Weiten, Richard; von Landenberg, Nicolas; Spachmann, Philipp Julian; Aksoy, Cem; Haferkamp, Axel; Boehm, Katharina",Urol Int,749,1

The quantification of MFI requires time-consuming and rater-dependent manual segmentation techniques. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained to segment seven cervical spine muscle groups (left and right muscles segmented separately, 14 muscles total) from Dixon MRI scans (n = 17, 17 scans < 2 weeks post motor vehicle collision (MVC), and 17 scans 12 months post MVC). The CNN MFI measures demonstrated high test reliability and accuracy in an independent testing dataset (n = 18, 9 scans < 2 weeks post MVC, and 9 scans 12 months post MVC). Using the CNN in 84 participants with scans < 2 weeks post MVC (61 females, 23 males, age = 34.2 ± 10.7 years) differences in MFI between the muscle groups and relationships between MFI and sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) were explored. Averaging across all muscles, females had significantly higher MFI than males (p = 0.026). The deep cervical muscles demonstrated significantly greater MFI than the more superficial muscles (p < 0.001), and only MFI within the deep cervical muscles was moderately correlated to age (r > 0.300, p &#8804; 0.001). CNN's allow for the accurate and rapid, quantitative assessment of the composition of the architecturally complex muscles traversing the cervical spine. Acknowledging the wider reports of MFI in cervical spine disorders and the time required to manually segment the individual muscles, this CNN may have diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive value in disorders of the cervical spine.","Weber, Kenneth A; Abbott, Rebecca; Bojilov, Vivie; Smith, Andrew C; Wasielewski, Marie; Hastie, Trevor J; Parrish, Todd B; Mackey, Sean; Elliott, James M",Sci Rep,749,24

The field of algorithmic contact tracing, in particular, an area of research that had previously received limited attention, has moved into the spotlight as a crucial factor in containing the pandemic. The use of digital tools to enable more robust and expedited contact tracing and notification, while maintaining privacy and trust in the data generated, is viewed as key to identifying chains of transmission and close contacts, and, consequently, to enabling effective case investigations. Scaling these tools has never been more critical, as global case numbers have exceeded 100 million, as many asymptomatic patients remain undetected, and as COVID-19 variants begin to emerge around the world. In this context, there is increasing attention on blockchain technology as a part of systems for enhanced digital algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. By analyzing the literature that has emerged from this trend, the common characteristics of the designs proposed become apparent. An archetypal system architecture can be derived, taking these characteristics into consideration. However, assessing the utility of this architecture using a recognized evaluation framework shows that the added benefits and features of blockchain technology do not provide significant advantages over conventional centralized systems for algorithmic contact tracing and reporting. From our study, it, therefore, seems that blockchain technology may provide a more significant benefit in other areas of public health beyond contact tracing.","Platt, Moritz; Hasselgren, Anton; Román-Belmonte, Juan Manuel; Tuler de Oliveira, Marcela; De la Corte-Rodríguez, Hortensia; Delgado Olabarriaga, Sílvia; Rodríguez-Merchán, E Carlos; Mackey, Tim Ken",JMIR Public Health Surveill,749,1

People with pre-existing health conditions have been markedly impacted and, in some instances, left unsupported due to reduced provision of routine healthcare services. People living with obesity (PLWO) are identified as at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence about the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO, including those accessing weight management and bariatric surgery services (WMS). Methods: 543 adults (16-80 years) with obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) were recruited between 14th May and 9th July 2020 through social media advertisements, professional and patient obesity organisations and WMS. Participants completed an online survey regarding the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown upon, mental health, well-being, health-related behaviours, risk mitigating behaviours, access to WMS and weight stigma. Findings: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, the majority of PLWO reported deterioration of their mental health and health-related behaviours such as diet, physical activity (PA) and sleep. With 55% reporting an unhealthier diet, 61% reduced PA and 80% worsening of their sleep. Higher depression and lower wellbeing scores were found to associate with the greatest adverse impact upon health-related behaviours. PLWO who were attending WMS prior to the first lockdown reported a greater deterioration of their diet, with nearly 50% reporting worsening of their diet and PA worsening compared to PLWO who were not attending WMS. Most participants took two or more risk mitigating actions (73%). PLWO attending WMS reported reduced access (44%) with insufficient information (49%) from their clinical service providers. The majority of participants reported no change in perceived weight stigma. Interpretation: This study shows the detrimental impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO in relation to health-related behaviours, mental health and access to WMS. Our findings show that PLWO with poor mental health and those attending WMS were most adversely impacted and highlights the need for greater mental health support and continued provision of support from WMS for PLWO during future lockdowns. Funding: This research was funded through National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre funding.","Brown, Adrian; Flint, Stuart W; Kalea, Anastasia Z; O039,; Kane, Mary; Williams, Simon; Batterham, Rachel L",EClinicalMedicine,749,20

However, specific anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) drugs are still under development, and patients are managed by multiple complementary treatments. We performed a retrospective analysis to compare and evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment on disease progression. For this purpose, the clinical records and laboratory indicators were extracted from electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with LMWH, and 21 without LMWH) hospitalized (Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology) from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.011). Likewise, changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products in the LMWH group before and after treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.035). Remarkably, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (P = 0.006), indicating that, besides other beneficial properties, LMWH may exert an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate in part the ""cytokine storm"" induced by the virus. Our results support the use of LMWH as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19, paving the way for a subsequent well-controlled clinical study.","Shi, Chen; Wang, Cong; Wang, Hanxiang; Yang, Chao; Cai, Fei; Zeng, Fang; Cheng, Fang; Liu, Yihui; Zhou, Taotao; Deng, Bin; Vlodavsky, Israel; Li, Jin-Ping; Zhang, Yu",Clinical and translational science (Online),749,15

The incubation and recovery rates governing the evolution of each homogenous subpopulation depend upon this trait, and no restriction is assumed on the contact matrix that defines the probability for an individual of a given trait to be infected by an individual with another trait. Our goal is to derive and study the final size equation fulfilled by the limit distribution of the population. We show that this limit exists and satisfies the final size equation. The main contribution is to prove the uniqueness of this solution among the distributions smaller than the initial condition. We also establish that the dominant eigenvalue of the next-generation operator (whose initial value is equal to the basic reproduction number) decreases along every trajectory until a limit smaller than 1. The results are shown to remain valid in presence of diffusion term. They generalize previous works corresponding to finite number of traits (including metapopulation models) or to rank 1 contact matrix (modeling e.g. susceptibility or infectivity presenting heterogeneity independently of one another).","LJLL, Lu'is Almeida; MAMBA,; Bliman, Pierre-Alexandre; Nadin, Gr'egoire; LJLL, Benoit Perthame; Vauchelet, Nicolas",,749,29

Most of these apps track pairwise encounters between individuals via Bluetooth and then use these tracked encounters to identify and notify those who might have been in proximity of a contagious individual. Unfortunately, these apps have not yet proven sufficiently effective, partly owing to low adoption rates, but also due to the difficult tradeoff between utility and privacy and the fact that, in COVID-19, most individuals do not infect anyone but a few superspreaders infect many in superspreading events. In this paper, we proposePanCast, a privacy-preserving and inclusive system for epidemic risk assessment and notification that scales gracefully with adoption rates, utilizes location and environmental information to increase utility without tracking its users, and can be used to identify superspreading events. To this end, rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones, our system utilizes Bluetooth encounters between beacons placed in strategic locations where superspreading events are most likely to occur and inexpensive, zero-maintenance, small devices that users can attach to their keyring. PanCast allows healthy individuals to use the system in a purely passive""radio""mode, and can assist and benefit from other digital and manual contact tracing systems. Finally, PanCast can be gracefully dismantled at the end of the pandemic, minimizing abuse from any malevolent government or entity.","Barthe, Gilles; Viti, Roberta De; Druschel, Peter; Garg, Deepak; Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel; Ingo, Pierfrancesco; Lentz, Matthew; Mehta, Aastha; Scholkopf, Bernhard",,749,3

Coronavirus disease has been reported to present with several symptoms. Common symptoms include new onset of fever, cough, fatigue, and myalgia. Other symptoms like sputum production, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, anosmia, nasal stuffiness, headache, and sore throat are less frequently reported, but the clinical presentation is highly variable among individuals. We review the otolaryngologic manifestations of coronavirus disease reported in the published literature to assess its importance in the early diagnosis of coronavirus disease. We searched PubMed database, MEDLINE, Web of Science, LILACS, SciELO, and Cochrane Library to find out relevant articles, using the following keywords: COVID-19, clinical features, characteristics, symptoms, clinical, manifestations, throat, cough, rhinorrhea, COVID-19 anosmia, headache, nasal, coronavirus, and coronavirus otolaryngologic. Article selection was based on their relevance to the research question. Totally, 14 articles and 2971 patients were recruited for our study. A wide variety of upper and lower airway manifestations were reported. Fever (34%–96.5%), cough (17.9%–83%), myalgia or fatigue (10%–31%), expectoration (20%–32.7%), dyspnea (7.6%–7.5%), rhinorrhea (1%–6.8%), sore throat (4%–61%), nasal congestion (3%–4.8%), and headache (3%–16.2%) were the most common symptoms reported. Our findings confirm that coronavirus disease infection presents with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation. The ear nose throat manifestations for coronavirus disease are not uncommon, but more attention should also be paid to patients with otolaryngologic symptoms which can appear early, as this could encourage an earlier diagnosis and treatment, which limits spread of the disease.","Al-Swiahb, J.

In this study we demonstrate that these chimeras are capable of packaging large amounts of human APOBEC3G (hA3G), and that an HIV-1 Gag chimera containing the carboxyl-terminal half of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N as a substitute for NC is capable of directing VLP assembly and efficiently packaging hA3G. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N and M (membrane) proteins, hA3G was efficiently incorporated into SARS-CoV VLPs. Data from GST pull-down assays suggest that the N sequence involved in N–hA3G interactions is located between residues 86 and 302. Like HIV-1 NC, the SARS-CoV or HCoV-229E N-associated with hA3G depends on the presence of RNA, with the first linker region essential for hA3G packaging into both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV VLPs. The results raise the possibility that hA3G is capable of associating with different species of viral structural proteins through a potentially common, RNA-mediated mechanism.","Wang, Shui-Mei; Wang, Chin-Tien",Virology,749,16
