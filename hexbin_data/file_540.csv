16654,nieuws,2021-04-09,"Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a novel plasma-derived serine protease structurally homologous to tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. We demonstrate that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the predominant inhibitor of tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators in plasma and tissues, is an inhibitor of FSAP as well. We detected PAI-1·FSAP complexes in addition to high levels of extracellular RNA, an important FSAP cofactor, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hydrolytic activity of FSAP was inhibited by PAI-1 with a second-order inhibition rate constant (K(a)) of 3.38 ± 1.12 × 10(5)m(–1)·s(–1). Residue Arg(346) was a critical recognition element on PAI-1 for interaction with FSAP. RNA, but not DNA, fragments (>400 nucleotides in length) dramatically enhanced the reactivity of PAI-1 with FSAP, and 4 μg·ml(–1) RNA increased the K(a) to 1.61 ± 0.94 × 10(6)m(–1)·s(–1). RNA also stabilized the active conformation of PAI-1, increasing the half-life for spontaneous conversion of active to latent PAI-1 from 48.4 ± 8 min to 114.6 ± 5 min. In contrast, little effect of DNA on PAI-1 stability was apparent. Residues Arg(76) and Lys(80) in PAI-1 were key elements mediating binding of nucleic acids to PAI-1. FSAP-driven inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation was antagonized by PAI-1, suggesting functional consequences for the FSAP-PAI-1 interaction. These data indicate that extracellular RNA and PAI-1 can regulate FSAP activity, thereby playing a potentially important role in hemostasis and cell functions under various pathophysiological conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Wygrecka, Malgorzata; Morty, Rory E.; Markart, Philipp; Kanse, Sandip M.; Andreasen, Peter A.; Wind, Troels; Guenther, Andreas; Preissner, Klaus T.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8025756/,540

23384,coronanieuws,2020-04-10,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the benefit of the Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Methods: We studied 22 children supported by NIV, aged 1 month to 15 years. The duration of the study was 4 years (January 2006- December 2009). The total number of admissions to ICU during this period was 759 (2,9% supported by NIV). The causes of the respiratory failure in these children supported by NIV were: chronic diseases-infection (n=11; 50%), neuromuscular diseases (n=4; 18,18%), renal transplantations-immunosuppression (n=3; 13,63%), leukemias (n=2; 9,09%), respiratory infections (n=2; 9,09%). We selected the Biphasic Ventilation mode (Bi-Vent) by facial mask, because our patients were in severe respiratory distress. The parameters in this mode were as follow: PIP: 10-16 cmH2O and PEEP 6-12 cmH2O. The mean duration of NIV was 4 days (3 hours to 14 days). Results: Facial mask was well tolerated and with no injuries from her use. Results showed that 19 patients (86,36%) recovered and 3 patients (13,63%) died because of their underlying disease and not from the respiratory failure. Two of our patients continued the NIV ventilation as home care treatment. Conclusions: NIV support of respiratory failure is a very useful tool in the pediatric intensivists' hands because it is good alternative to mechanical ventilation. It is well tolerated, reduces the need of sedation and the PICU stay in these patients.","Tassiou, I; Papazoglou, K; Patsoura, A; Papadatos, J",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104461/,540

The purpose is to investigate the wide spectrum of radiological pulmonary changes in COVID-19 patients and compare them to the variable CT findings reported in MERS and SARS. RESULTS: From March 15 to May 12, 2020, 50 patients in Cairo, Egypt, who have positive RT-PCR tests, were included in our study. MSCT of the chest was performed to all patients and processed in a separate work station. Two experienced radiologists assessed each study for the type and location of different pulmonary affection. The most imminent radiological finding was patchy peripheral subpleural ground glass opacity found in 42 patients (84% of cases), followed by consolidation found in 30 patients (60% of cases) and ground glass and consolidation together found in 22 patients (44% of cases). Unlike SARS, where initial chest imaging abnormalities are more frequently unilateral, COVID-19 is more likely to involve both lungs on initial imaging presented as bilateral peripheral subpleural scattered ground-glass opacities. Pleural effusion is absent in COVID-19 patients while it is not rare in MERS and might be observed in 20–33% of affected individuals. CONCLUSION: The imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are highly sensitive mainly in the outbreak pandemic. The imaging features of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 overlap, but differences still exist especially early in disease course.","Kolta, Marian Fayek; Ghonimy, Mai Bahgat Ibrahim",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453128/,540

41350,NVAB,2020-11-06,"The use of shipping containers for the transport of goods has become indispensable and a crucial factor for globalization by providing inexpensive and safe transport opportunities. It is expected that the number of globally operating containers will increase in the near future. Despite a high technical modernisation of the logistic chain, the container still faces a risk of damage at any time and any place within the transport chain. In principle, a container is taken out of service, when a damage is recognized. Different causes of damage exist and various types of damage could occur to the container, ranging from minor to substantial major ones that do not permit the continued proper use of the container. Thus, an individual decision on repair and maintenance (R&M) for each damaged container is necessary. Aside from technical aspects, it has to be decided from an economical perspective whether a repair should be performed. A profound decision should consider various criteria like, e.g., repair costs, lifespan of the container, future yields and possible sales price. Based on a regulatory, practical, and scientific view, this paper proposes a multi-criteria decision model for the economic decision on the R&M of a damaged container. Implemented in Microsoft Excel, this decision model is easily applicable. The user can deduce a first (limited) guidance for dealing with a respective damaged container based on its current state and general market conditions.","Hoffmann, Niclas; Stahlbock, Robert; Voß, Stefan",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7581502/,540

That is why some prediction methods are required to estimate the magnitude of infected cases and masses of studies on distinct methods of forecasting are represented so far. In this study, we proposed a hybrid machine learning model that is not only predicted with good accuracy but also takes care of uncertainty of predictions. The model is formulated using Bayesian Ridge Regression hybridized with an n-degree Polynomial and uses probabilistic distribution to estimate the value of the dependent variable instead of using traditional methods. This is a completely mathematical model in which we have successfully incorporated with prior knowledge and posterior distribution enables us to incorporate more upcoming data without storing previous data. Also, L(2) (Ridge) Regularization is used to overcome the problem of overfitting. To justify our results, we have presented case studies of three countries, −the United States, Italy, and Spain. In each of the cases, we fitted the model and estimate the number of possible causes for the upcoming weeks. Our forecast in this study is based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins University available until 11th May 2020.

46186,nieuws,2021-03-05,"Puddled transplanted rice (Oryza sativa L.) followed by intensively tilled wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (R–W) is the most predominant cropping system and the lifeline for billions of people in South Asia. The cultivation of R–W system requires high amounts of water, nutrients and energy, resulting in increased production costs and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. There are also increasing concerns of yield stagnation or decline in the R–W system, with increasing environmental footprints. Hence, the sustainability of the R–W system in South Asia, particularly in the northwest Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs), has been questioned and heavily debated. Based on the findings from peer-reviewed literature, this review aims to identify unsustainability issues and research gaps in the R–W system and propose possible solutions to mitigate those issues and technological interventions to close the research gaps. Among the unsustainability issues that the review has identified are declining crop, water and land productivity, deterioration of soil health, emissions of greenhouse gases due to intensive tillage and residue burning, deepening of groundwater levels and shift in weed flora and development of herbicidal resistance in crops. Potential solutions or technological interventions to mitigate the unsustainability issues include resource conservation technologies (RCTs) such as rice residue management, reduced tillage, laser land leveling, soil matric potential based irrigation scheduling, delayed rice transplanting, cultivation on permanent raised beds, direct-seeded rice (DSR), mechanical transplanting of rice and crop diversification with legumes. These interventions have the potential to reduce energy, water and carbon (C) footprints from the R–W system. Rice residue retention with Happy Seeder and adoption of zero tillage (ZT) for wheat establishment have significantly lowered the environmental footprints, with increased soil C sequestration due to additions of large amounts of plant-mediated C input. Residue mulching has helped increase root length of wheat by ~25% and root length density by ~40% below 15 cm depth, compared to no mulching. The Happy Seeder saved ~30% of irrigation water due to reduction of soil evaporation by ~42–48 mm through residue mulching. Crop cultivation on permanent raised beds is less energy-intensive and results in ~7.8–22.7% higher water use efficiency yet crop productivity in long run could be affected due to reduced root growth on beds. The puddled transplanted rice (PTR) established under wet tillage, however, can decrease the water percolation losses by 14–16% and crop water demand by ~10–25%, and it forms hard pan in soil plough (7–10 cm) layer due to increased soil bulk density. Water stagnation under continuously flooded PTR is the major source of methane emissions with serious environmental implications. Methane emissions from flooded rice can increase global warming potential by 18.1–27.6% compared to intermittently flooded rice with multiple aerations. The conventional tillage can favor the germination of grassy weeds in wheat, while the broad-leaved weeds increase under zero tillage. Zero tillage with mulch load conserved ~4.0% higher moisture due to ~2.3% lesser soil temperature and evaporated ~27.6% lesser than the conventional tillage. Delayed rice transplanting with short-duration variety has potential of saving of up to ~140 mm of irrigation water in the semiarid areas of NW IGPs. Although the DSR had lower yield potential than the PTR, it saved ~50% irrigation water. The laser land leveling technology saved ~30% irrigation water and ~25% electricity and had a yield advantage of ~4%, compared with PTR on un-leveled fields. The mechanical transplanted rice had higher grain yield and more water saving than the manual transplanting or DSR. The review demonstrates that a single technology may not be applicable everywhere and integrated approaches with the multiple criteria—productivity, economics, energy and environmental sustainability—would be required to address the unsustainability issues of the R–W system of the NW IGPs. There is a need to elucidate and disseminate various site- and context-specific RCTs appropriate for the region to address the unsustainability issues and challenges of the system. Sustainable R–W production technologies with reduced water, energy and C footprints are required for increased water and energy productivity and C sequestration for the NW IGPs of South Asia.","Bhatt, Rajan; Singh, Pritpal; Hossain, Akbar; Timsina, Jagadish",Paddy Water Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7898255/,540

We first review perspectives that offer competing evidence about the role of globalization in regard to economic development and corruption. Drawing on resource dependence and institutional theory, we test the two contingencies of the country’s stage of economic development (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high) and the globalization dimension (economic, social, political) at play to reconcile competing findings. Using a cross-lagged panel design, we show that these contingencies significantly explain when and what type of globalization can benefit a country’s economy and affect corruption. In doing so, the study provides a platform for future research, and identifies important patterns that can better guide policymaking. Among other results, we find low-income countries’ GDP and corruption benefit the most from the formal dimensions of globalization. With increased wealth, countries are more responsive to the legitimacy accrued with the informal dimensions of globalization, which we find comes at the expense of economic efficiency for high-income countries.","Aïssaoui, Rachida; Fabian, Frances",J Int Bus Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7898262/,540

54089,Actualiteit en afscheid,2021-06-18,"Studies show that companies with a strong Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) profile are more competitive than their peers, as they use resources, human capital and innovation more efficiently. High ESG-rated companies have lower exposure to systematic risk factors and low expected cost of capital, leading to higher valuations in a DCF model framework. They are typically more transparent, particularly with respect to their risk exposures, risk management and governance standards and have better long-term vision. The paper finds that higher Alpha can be harvested by restricting investment exposure to the ESG theme combined with various style characteristics, as they display low systematic and idiosyncratic tail risks. It shows that an ESG overlay on such factor-based strategies, particularly on ‘multi-factor’, ‘value’ and ‘low volatility’ in that order, reduces both systematic and idiosyncratic risks further. ESG overlay on ‘quality’ factor provides the highest return among ESG target indices, however, the underlying ‘quality’ factor provides even higher excess return.

54099,' Geruststelling en goede uitleg kan patiënten al erg helpen',2021-06-18,"This study addresses teachers’ activity when working with digital technologies (DT) in their classrooms. We build upon a model that considers teaching as managing open dynamic situations. Within the model, teachers’ activity is viewed as diagnosing students’ mathematical activity, managing uncertainties due to the characteristics of the situation and decision-making about didactic interventions. The study extends our earlier work and focuses on teachers’ interventions in DT-based lessons, as they manage disturbances caused by unexpected difficulties. Our first observation is that there is a substantial change in how teachers diagnose these difficulties compared to paper-and-pencil environments. Notably, they need to make more inferences about the pedagogical support that is provided. Second, we show that in such conditions, rather than facing the single dynamicity of the class as a whole, the teacher has to deal with multiple, open dynamic situations (small groups named mini-classes), which are themselves intertwined in the dynamics of students’ interactions with technology. Moreover, even if teachers are able to make reliable inferences concerning an individual student’s current difficulties, they must also be able to make inferences about the scope of such difficulties within the class as a whole. We present four case studies that illustrate the diverse approaches that teachers take when managing such open dynamic situations and use them to illustrate the concepts and analytical tools that are introduced.","Abboud, Maha; Rogalski, Janine",Can,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8186023/,540
57287,Hoe pak je vaccinatie-twijfels aan?,2021-09-03,"STUDY QUESTION: Are pregnant women in the community with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV–2 infection, at increased risk of an early miscarriage? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women diagnosed with COVID–19 in their first trimester were not at increased risk of an early miscarriage. What is known already: In the earliest stages of the pandemic, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, independently advised against starting assisted reproductive treatments. At the time of this recommendation, among other reasons, there were concerns about the complications of SARS-CoV–2 during pregnancy and the potential for vertical transmission. We now having growing evidence that pregnant women are at an increased risk of severe illness along with higher rates of preterm births in those with severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, data on the impact of community infections of SARS-CoV–2 in early pregnancy has been sparse. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is an online survey study undertaken in the UK between May and November 2020. Pregnant women at any stage in their pregnancy were invited to participate in the study. Study participants were asked to complete online surveys at the end of each trimester. 10, 430 women were recruited to take part in the study. Participants/materials, setting, methods: We analysed pregnancy outcomes from women who were under 13 weeks gestation at the time of registration. We compared miscarriage rates among women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV–2 infection to healthy controls. Those in the control group had not been diagnosed with or had symptoms of SARS-CoV–2 infection nor did they have any household contacts that were diagnosed with or had symptoms of SARS-CoV–2 infection. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: 10, 430 pregnant women were recruited to participate in the study. 2934 were under 13 weeks gestation at the time of registration. The median age was 32.6 [IQR 29.8–35.6]. The median gestational age at registration was 8 weeks [IQR [6–10]. 246 women reported a miscarriage before 13 weeks of gestation. The overall miscarriage rate before 13 weeks of gestation was 8.4% (95% CI 7.3%–9.4%). 68 women reported a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV–2 infection in their first trimester. The overall rate of confirmed SARS-CoV–2 infections in the first trimester was 2.3% (95% CI 1.8–2.9%). 3/68 (4.4%) were asymptomatic. Among those reporting symptoms, the commonest symptoms were fatigue (82%), headache (69%) and loss of smell/taste (69%). Only 38% of those with a confirmed diagnosis reported a fever. None of the 68 women with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV–2 infection were hospitalised. The rate of miscarriage before 13 weeks of gestation in women who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV–2 infections was not significantly higher compared to healthy controls (11.8% versus 9.3%, p = 0.35). A further 35 women had household contacts with confirmed SARS-CoV–2 infection although they themselves had not been diagnosed. No miscarriages were reported in this group. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: None of the 68 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV–2 were hospitalised. We do not know whether the rate of miscarriage among hospitalised women with SARS-CoV–2 infection is the same as those with community infections. Wider implications of the findings: The overall rate of miscarriage during the pandemic was not higher than rates occurring outside of the pandemic. The rate of miscarriage among women diagnosed with SARS-CoV–2 infection was not significantly higher compared to healthy controls.

57288,Nieuws: Actuele zaken en opvallende ontwikkelingen.,2021-09-03,"STUDY QUESTION: Could the transcriptomic and functional landscape of the window of implantation be compromised by SARS-COV–2 infection? SUMMARY ANSWER: Some of the main genes and pathways involved in the window of implantation are affected in blood of COVID–19 patients and receptivity could be affected. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is a concern whether SARS-COV–2 can disrupt assisted reproduction treatments (ARTs) and fertility in short and long terms. In the endometrium, it was found that genes related to the viral infection (ACE2, TMPRSS2/4, CTSL/B) are involved in menstrual cycle progression, especially in the Window of Implantation (WOI). However, there are no studies describing the transcriptome changes after the infection, and the changes that could affect receptivity and embryo implantation. Currently transcriptomic datasets are publicly available regarding virus infection effects in blood. The aim of this study was to integrate these blood effects with the gene expression during the WOI. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A public dataset with blood transcriptome of 231 female COVID–19 patients and 30 female controls was downloaded from GEO. Meanwhile, 5 transcriptomic endometrial datasets in the WOI with patients without endometrial pathologies were also retrieved (n = 44). Gene expression correlations (potential activations and inhibitions) were calculated in endometrium and filtered by blood differentially expressed genes for predicting the potential effects of COVID–19 in endometrial factor. Additionally, we discovered new endometrial genes involved in the infection repercussions. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A gene co-expression network was built in Cytoscape with the WOI dataset [Pearson correlation = 0.65, only significant correlations; Power fit law R2 > = 0.8]. Differential expression was done for COVID–19 patients versus controls with limma and significant genes in blood were highlighted in the endometrial WOI network. Topological parameters were calculated by CytoHubba and network modules and related functions were analysed performing a Functional enrichment (BINGO). Statistical significance cut off was stablished in FDR<0.05. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After filtering by blood affected genes, 2051 genes were found differentially expressed in COVID–19 females in blood and mapped in the co-expression WOI network. Nine modules were highlighted being enriched in translational elongation, intracellular protein transport, endosome organization, vitamin D receptor binding, actin cytoskeleton organization, RNA splicing, among others. Important hubs in the endometrium that correlated with TMPRSS4 were: COBL, a gene that promotes formation of cell ruffles which are important or embryo adhesion (FC = –3.99, degree = 209); PKP2 (FC = –1.5, degree = 188) which could play a role in junctional plaques and knockdown in mice was reported to inhibit implantation; SOCS3, linked to unexplained infertility and pregnancy loss, (FC –4.3, degree = 177); GPX3 involved in detoxification and usually highly upregulated during WOI was downregulated (FC –3.7, degree = 173). GPX3 also correlated with CTSB. TPRC/CD45, related to unexplained pregnancy loss and concentration of NK cells, was an upregulated gene (FC = 5, degree = 161) that correlated with CTSL. Upregulated genes with main connections in the network were: SERPING1 (FC = 5), which regulates complement activation and embryo-maternal immune modulation and SMARCAD1 (FC 1.5), involved in DNA repair and heterochromatin organization. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an in-silico descriptive study where differentially expressed genes in blood samples of COVID–19 patients were analysed in an endometrial co-expression network context. Studying a COVID–19 infected endometrium during WOI would help to confirm the results of this study. Wider implications of the findings: Although ACE2 has been reported as not highly expressed during the WOI, this study describes potential genes and functions very important for embryo implantation affected after SARS-COV–2 infection. These findings evidenced how SARS-COV–2 could impact the efficacy of ARTs and should be taken into consideration for further research and implications.

57289,'Aandacht voor goed werk kan tsunami aan psychische klachten voorkomen',2021-09-03,"STUDY QUESTION: Does systematic dydrogesterone supplementation in artificial cycles (AC) for frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) during Covid–19 pandemic modify outcomes compared to prior individualized supplementation adjusted on serum progesterone (P) levels ? SUMMARY ANSWER: Systematic dydrogesterone supplementation in AC for FET is associated with similar outcomes compared to prior individualized supplementation in patients with low P levels. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In AC for FET using vaginal P for endometrial preparation, low serum P levels following P administration have been associated with decreased pregnancy and live birth rates. This deleterious effect can be overcome by addition of other routes of P administration. We obtained effective results by adding dydrogesterone to vaginal P and postponing FET by one day in patients with low P levels. However, in order to limit patient monitoring visits and to schedule better FET activity during Covid–19 pandemic, we implemented a systematic dydrogesterone supplementation without luteal P measurement in artificial FET cycles. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective study aimed to analyse outcomes of 394 FET after 2 different protocols of artificial endometrial preparation. From September 2019 to Covid–19 lockdown on 15th March 2020, patients had serum P level measured on D1 of vaginal P administration. When P levels were < 11 ng/ml, dydrogesterone supplementation was administered and FET was postponed by one day. From May to December 2020, no P measurement was performed and dydrogesterone supplementation was systematically used. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In our university hospital, endometrial preparation was performed using sequential administration of vaginal estradiol until endometrial thickness reached >7 mm, followed by transdermal estradiol combined with 800 mg/day vaginal micronized P started in the evening (D0). Oral dydrogesterone supplementation (30 mg/day) was started concomitantly to vaginal P in all patients during Covid–19 pandemic and only after D1 P measurement followed by one day FET postponement in patients with P levels <11 ng/ml before the lockdown. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: During the Covid–19 pandemic, 198 FET were performed on D2, D3 or D5 of P administration with dydrogesterone supplementation depending on embryo stage at cryopreservation. Concerning the 196 FET before lockdown, 124 (63%) were performed after dydrogesterone addition from D1 onwards and postponement by one day in patients with serum P levels <11 ng/ml at D1 while 72 were performed in phase following introduction of vaginal P without dydrogesterone supplementation in patients with P > 11 ng/ml. Characteristics of patients in the 2 time periods were similar for age (34.5 + 5 vs 34.1 + 4.8 years), endometrial thickness prior to P introduction (9.9 + 2.1 vs 9.9 + 2.2 mm), number of transferred embryos (1.3 + 0.5 vs 1.4 + 0.5) , embryo transfer stage (D2/D3/blastocyst: 8/16/76% vs 3/18/79%). No significant difference was observed between both time periods [nor between “dydrogesterone addition and postponement by 1 day” and “in phase” FET before lockdown] in terms of positive pregnancy test (39.4% vs 39.3% [44% vs 30.5%]), heartbeat activity at 8 weeks (29.3% vs 28% [29% vs 26.4%]) and ongoing pregnancy rates at 12 weeks (30.7% but truncated at end of October 2020 vs 25.5% [26.6% vs 23.6%]). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Full results of the Covid–19 period will be further provided concerning ongoing pregnancy rates as well as comparison of live birth rates and obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Wider implications of the findings: These results suggest that systematic dydrogesterone supplementation is as effective as individualized supplementation according to serum P levels following administration of vaginal P. This strategy enabled us to schedule easier FET and limit patient visits for monitoring while maintaining optimal results for FET in AC during the Covid–19 pandemic.

57290,"Over werken, niet werken, terugwerken en thuiswerken: Terugblik online symposium Re-integratie werkt! van Universiteit Gent",2021-09-03,"STUDY QUESTION: Can whole exome sequencing (WES) before PGT-M identify previously unknown mutations for consanguineous couples having an increased risk of carrying more than one genetic disease? SUMMARY ANSWER: WES has been successfully applied in combination with PGT-M by identifying new pathogenic mutations in addition to known gene mutations, extending the scope of PGT-M. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most couples ignore their risk of being a carrier of an inherited genetic disease until they have an affected child. Rare, atypical, and undiagnosed autosomal-recessive disorders frequently occur in the offspring of consanguineous couples. Routine single gene diagnostic tests fail to detect any possible gene defects other than the clinically apparent one. Prospective WES or genetic carrier screening testing of consanguineous couples could identify couples who both are carriers of autosomal recessive diseases and thus encourage them to make informed reproductive decisions. Screening tests using NGS technology simultaneously sequence exons and exon-intron boundaries to determine disease carrier status. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between January 2017 and October 2020, a total of 206 PGT-M couples applied to Istanbul Memorial Hospital ART Center. Of these couples, multigene PGT-M workups were carried for twelve couples who were carriers of more than one inherited disease. Eight couples were found to be carriers for two different diseases and four couples were carrying three diseases. All biopsies were performed at the blastocyst stage. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: For the 12 couples with multigene PGT-M workups the average female age was 31.0 ± 6.2. Nine of them initiated an ART cycle and the mean number of cumulus-oocyte complexes, metaphaseII oocytes, biopsied blastocysts and transferrable PGT-M embryos were 15 ± 6.9, 13.3 ± 6.3, 5.9 ± 2.0 and 2.9 ± 1.9, respectively. PGT-A was routinely performed for all couples with transferrable PGT-M tested embryos except one couple who refused PGT-A. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 28 different gene workups were completed for 26 genes. The inheritance mode of the 26 conditions was as follows: 20 autosomal recessive, four autosomal dominant and two X-linked recessive. Out of 12 couples, 9 of them initiated an ART cycle and transferrable embryos were found after PGT-M followed by PGT-A. Eight women had frozen embryo transfers resulting in five healthy babies (3 singletons and 1 twin), two pregnancies still ongoing and one biochemical miscarriage at the time of data collection. The couple who declined PGT-A testing prior to their frozen embryo transfer had anegative bhCG test. Three couples completed their workups but postponed their ART and PGT-M cycle due to Covid–19 pandemic. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The probability of finding at least one transferrable embryo after PGT-M is influenced by the inheritance mode of the disease. Late-onset diseases presumed to be caused by variants of unknown significance and polygenic diseases that are possibly influenced by environmental factors were not included in this study. Wider implications of the findings: With decreasing costs and improved availability of WES and genetic carrier screening panels, couples, especially consanguineous couples, who were previously shown to have one inherited disease may be offered to be screened for additional undiagnosed inherited diseases that may pose a threat for their offspring.

57292,22 aios NSPOH over hun onderzoek: Mini-symposia 2 februari en 11 maart 2021,2021-09-03,"STUDY QUESTION: Can severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV–2) be detected in the semen of SARS-CoV–2 positive men, and does SARS-CoV–2 infection affect male reproductive function? SUMMARY ANSWER: No SARS-CoV–2 RNA was detected in semen. An impact of SARS-CoV–2 infection on semen quality and reproductive hormone profile awaits evaluation at 3 + 6 months follow-up. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: SARS-CoV–2 may use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 as an entry point into the cell. As ACE2 is expressed in testicular tissue, it has been speculated that SARS-CoV–2 may affect the male reproductive system. A cohort study including 38 male COVID–19 patients showed that SARS-CoV–2 was present in the semen of six patients (15.8%) [Li et al., 2020]. Later studies including a total of 223 patients have not provided evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV–2 via semen. There are to date no available longitudinal studies on semen quality following SARS-CoV–2 infection. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Longitudinal cohort study including 50 non-hospitalized men from the general population in the Capital Region of Denmark. All participants had a confirmed SARS-CoV–2 infection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on oropharyngeal swab material within the last week. The presence of SARS-CoV–2 in semen samples by RT-PCR, semen parameters and reproductive hormone profile were assessed at inclusion and at 3 + 6 months follow-up. SARS-CoV–2 antibody levels were assessed 3–5 weeks after inclusion. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: SARS-CoV–2-positive males (age 18–60 years) were included. Oropharyngeal and semen samples were tested by RT-PCR applying the E-Sarbeco primers and probe published by Corman et al. 2020 and adapted to TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step master mix and LightCycler 480 as previously reported by Jørgensen et al. 2020. SARS-CoV–2 antibodies were detected using the serological immunoassay from Shenzhen YHLO Biotech on the iFlash 1800. Semen quality parameters were analysed according to World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: To date, 25 men with a mean age of 35 years have been included in the study. SARS-CoV–2 RNA could not be detected in the semen samples of any of the 25 men at the time of inclusion. Twenty-one of the 25 men (84,0%) had a same day RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV–2 infection in an oropharyngeal swab. RT-PCR cycle threshold (ct) values were distributed as follows: four (19,0%) were strongly positive (ct < 25), 16 (76,2%) intermediately positive (ct 25–35) and one (4,8%) weakly positive (ct 35–45). The four men without PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV–2 infection all had a positive IgG response to SARS-CoV–2 at the time of inclusion. Longitudinal semen and reproductive hormone profiles analyses will be performed. Further studies are needed to prove whether SARS-CoV–2 can be transmitted to the male reproductive tract and whether SARS-CoV–2 infection may cause alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Strengths of this study are the unselected population of men examined within a week after confirmed SARS-CoV–2 infection and the follow-up of semen parameters and endocrine profile. Limitations are the limited sample size and the fact that semen quality was not known before the participants were diagnosed with COVID–19. Wider implications of the findings: Knowledge of viral detection and semen persistence of SARS-CoV–2 is essential for clinical practice and public health. There is a need for evidence-based counselling on the impact of SARS-CoV–2 infection for patients undergoing assisted reproduction technology and patients who have a need for semen cryopreservation.

We aimed to compare the outcomes, the clinical characteristics and the adverse effects of COVID-19 patients to a retrospective cohort of influenza patients.This retrospective case-control study was conducted in the ICUs of Lille and Rouen University Hospitals between January 2014 and May 2020. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS requiring V-V ECMO infected with either COVID-19 (n =30) or influenza (n=22) were compared. A 3-month follow-up was completed for all patients.Median age of COVID-19 and influenza patients was similar (57 vs. 55 years; p=0.62). The 28-day mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 (43.3%) and influenza patients (50%, p=0.63). There was no significant difference considering the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning, hospital discharge and 3-month survival.

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is just one component of BRD complex. Because BRD is moderately heritable, it may be possible to reduce the incidence of BRD through genetic selection. The objectives of this study were to determine the heritability and associative genetic relationships among immune system traits (i.e., cortisol, total IgG, IgG isotypes, and IL-8) in cattle monitored for BRD incidence. At an average of 83 d after weaning (219 d age and mean = 221.7 kg [SD 4.34]), crossbred Bos taurus steer calves (n = 2,869) were received at a commercial feedlot in southeastern Colorado over a 2-yr period. At receiving, jugular blood samples were collected at 212 (yr 1) and 226 d (yr 2) of age for immune trait analyses. The BRD phenotype was defined as a binomial variable (0 = no and 1 = yes) and compared with immune system traits measured at receiving (prior to illness onset). An animal identified as BRD positive exhibited ≥ 2 clinical signs (i.e., eye or nasal discharge, cough, lethargy, rapid breathing, acute interstitial pneumonia, or acute upper respiratory syndrome and/or a rectal temperature > 39.7°C). Heritability and genetic correlation estimates for categorical variable BRD, cortisol, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IL-8 were estimated from a sire model using ASREML. Heritability estimates were low to moderate for BRD (0.17 ± 0.08), cortisol (0.13 ± 0.05), IgG (0.15 ± 0.05), IgG1 (0.11 ± 0.05), IgG2 (0.24 ± 0.06), and IL-8 (0.30 ± 0.06).

Influenza is not causally associated with COVID-19, but shares population-based determinants, such as similar incidence/mortality trends, transmission patterns, efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, comorbidities and underdiagnosis. We investigated the ecologic association between influenza mortality rates and COVID-19 mortality rates in the European context. We considered the 3-year average influenza (2014–2016) and COVID-19 (31 May 2020) crude mortality rates in 34 countries using EUROSTAT and ECDC databases and performed correlation and regression analyses.

Common significant determinants of both COVID-19 and influenza mortality rates were life expectancy, influenza vaccination in the elderly (direct associations), number of hospital beds per population unit and crude cardiovascular disease mortality rate (inverse associations).
