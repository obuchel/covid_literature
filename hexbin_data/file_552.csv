9970,Department of Error,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients often develop acute respiratory failure. Optimal ventilator strategies in this setting are not well established. We performed an international survey to investigate the practice in the ventilatory management of TBI patients with and without respiratory failure. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire, including 38 items and 3 different clinical scenarios [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2))/inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO(2)) > 300 (scenario 1), 150–300 (scenario 2), < 150 (scenario 3)], was available on the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) website between November 2018 and March 2019. The survey was endorsed by ESICM. RESULTS: There were 687 respondents [472 (69%) from Europe], mainly intensivists [328 (48%)] and anesthesiologists [206 (30%)]. A standard protocol for mechanical ventilation in TBI patients was utilized by 277 (40%) respondents and a specific weaning protocol by 198 (30%). The most common tidal volume (TV) applied was 6–8 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) in scenarios 1–2 (72% PaO(2)/FIO(2) > 300 and 61% PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150–300) and 4–6 ml/kg/PBW in scenario 3 (53% PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150). The most common level of highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) used was 15 cmH(2)O in patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 300 without intracranial hypertension (41% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150–300 and 50% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150) and 10 cmH(2)O in patients with intracranial hypertension (32% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150–300 and 33% if PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150). Regardless of the presence of intracranial hypertension, the most common carbon dioxide target remained 36–40 mmHg whereas the most common PaO(2) target was 81–100 mmHg in all the 3 scenarios. The most frequent rescue strategies utilized in case of refractory respiratory failure despite conventional ventilator settings were neuromuscular blocking agents [406 (88%)], recruitment manoeuvres [319 (69%)] and prone position [292 (63%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilatory management, targets and practice of adult severe TBI patients with and without respiratory failure are widely different among centres. These findings may be helpful to define future investigations in this topic.","Picetti, Edoardo; Pelosi, Paolo; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Citerio, Giuseppe; Mancebo, Jordi; Robba, Chiara",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165367/,552

METHODS: The ninety C57BL/6 J male mice randomly divided into five groups: control, model and CEE (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) groups for 7 days oral administration. At the last administration, all mice except control were intratracheal instilled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3 mg/kg) for establish the acute lung injury. Then lung histopathologic, lung wet/dry weight, white blood cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils were detected. The pro-inflammation cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), IL-10 and the marker of antioxides ability total-antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA) in lung tissue were measured. RESULTS: The result showed that CEE could improve lung histopathological injury, reduce the ratio of wet/dry lung weight and lung index, inhibit the increased number of white blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils, and reduce the increased levels of TNF-α and IL-6. While CEE also significantly increased the levels of TGF-β1 and IL-10. Furthermore, CEE also markedly increased the activity of T-AOC, and decreased the contents of MDA with a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The study exhibited that CEE has a potential protective effect on lipopolysaccharide induced acute lung injury in mice, the action mechanism of CEE may through balance of the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, and the oxygen free radicals inhibition.","Liu, Gang; Zheng, Qingxiu; Pan, Kunlei; Xu, Xiaoxiao",BMC Complement Med Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381867/,552

WENV has been found in wild rodent animals around the world while its standing is barely understood in Guangzhou city, where is known as a region of outbreak hotspot for zoonotic emerging infectious diseases. To investigate the prevalence and genomic characteristics of mammarenavirus in Guangzhou City, lung tissue samples from wild rodent species were collected from five districts of Guangzhou City in the year 2015 and 2016. The viral RNA was extracted and then subjected to mammarenavirus-specific PCR. The result revealed approximately 1.0% (3/306) nucleic acid positivity for lung tissue samples obtained from three rodent species: Mus musculus, Rattus flavipectus, and Rattus norvegicus. Viral metagenomic sequencing of three samples was then carried out and two full segment L and three full segment S sequences were obtained. Phylogenetics analysis indicated the sequences of the new mammarenavirus strain have 76.2% - 94.4% similarity to known WENV encoded genes, with the highest similarity to the WENV 9–24 strain. Population structure analysis grouped all known WENV into seven lineages, and this WENV Guangzhou strain was grouped with WENV 9–24 as well. Though the seroprevalence result was not available, our data provides the first nucleic acid evidence of circulating WENV in Guangzhou city, and it suggested WENV had a broader host tropism than previously known.","Wu, Jian-Yong; Guo, Cheng; Xia, Yao; Bao, Hui-Min; Zhu, Yan-Shan; Guo, Zhong-Min; Wei, Yue-Hong; Lu, Jia-Hai",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8214141/,552

The observed successes and failures of health care systems during recent mass-casualty events and the concern that these assumptions are not evidence based prompted this review. METHOD The aims of this systematic review were to explore the factors associated with the intention of health care personnel (HCP) to respond to uncommon events, such as a natural disaster or pandemic, determine the state of the science, and bolster evidence-based measures that have been shown to facilitate staff response. RESULTS Authors of the 70 studies (five mixed-methods, 49 quantitative, 16 qualitative) that met inclusion criteria reported a variety of variables that influenced the intent of HCP to respond. Current evidence suggests that four primary factors emerged as either facilitating or hindering the willingness of HCP to respond to an event: (1) the nature of the event; (2) competing obligations; (3) the work environment and climate; and (4) the relationship between knowledge and perceptions of efficacy.

80081,Department of Error.,2021-02-20,"Craniofacial neuropathic pain affects millions of people worldwide and is often difficult to treat. Two key mechanisms underlying this condition are a loss of the negative control exerted by inhibitory interneurons and an early microglial reaction. Basic features of these mechanisms, however, are still poorly understood. Using the chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-IoN) model of neuropathic pain in mice, we have examined the changes in the expression of GAD, the synthetic enzyme of GABA, and GlyT2, the membrane transporter of glycine, as well as the microgliosis that occur at early (5 days) and late (21 days) stages post-CCI in the medullary and upper spinal dorsal horn. Our results show that CCI-IoN induces a down-regulation of GAD at both postinjury survival times, uniformly across the superficial laminae. The expression of GlyT2 showed a more discrete and heterogeneous reduction due to the basal presence in lamina III of 'patches' of higher expression, interspersed within a less immunoreactive 'matrix', which showed a more substantial reduction in the expression of GlyT2. These patches coincided with foci lacking any perceptible microglial reaction, which stood out against a more diffuse area of strong microgliosis. These findings may provide clues to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying allodynia in neuropathic pain syndromes.","García-Magro, Nuria; Martin, Yasmina B; Negredo, Pilar; Zafra, Francisco; Avendaño, Carlos",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925417/,552

The goal of this study was to examine the effects of small amounts of aspirated liquid thickener on the lungs. STUDY DESIGN Animal model. Prospective small animal clinical trial. METHODS Adult Sprague Dawley rats (n = 19) were divided into two groups and underwent three intratracheal instillations of either xanthan gum-based nectar-thick water (0.1-0.25 mL/kg) or water-only control over the course of 8 days. Blood was collected from a peripheral vein on days 1 and 8 and submitted for complete blood count (CBC) analysis. Rats were euthanized 10 days after the last instillation, and the lungs were harvested. Histopathology was conducted on lung specimens by a blinded licensed veterinary pathologist and scored for evidence of lung injury and pneumonia. RESULTS Fifteen animals (8 nectar-thickener group, 7 control group) survived until the endpoint of the study (day 18). Serum CBC did not show abnormalities at any timepoint in either group. Histological evidence of lung inflammation and edema were significantly greater in the nectar-thick group compared to controls (P < .05). Signs of inflammation included aggregates of foamy macrophages, expansion of bronchiolar lymphoid tissue, and large numbers of eosinophilic intraalveolar crystals. Histiocytic and neutrophilic pneumonia was noted in one animal that received thickened liquids.

138046,Department of Error.,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND Many patients develop discomfort after open repair of a groin hernia. It was hypothesized that suture fixation of the mesh is a cause of these symptoms. METHODS This patient- and assessor-blinded randomized multicentre clinical trial compared a self-gripping mesh (Parietene Progrip(®)) and sutured mesh for open primary repair of uncomplicated inguinal hernia by the Lichtenstein technique. Patients were assessed before surgery, on the day of operation, and at 1 and 12 months after surgery. The primary endpoint was moderate or severe symptoms after 12 months, including a combination of chronic pain, numbness and discomfort. RESULTS The intention-to-treat population comprised 163 patients with self-gripping mesh and 171 with sutured mesh. The 12-month prevalence of moderate or severe symptoms was 17·4 and 20·2 per cent respectively (P = 0·573). There were no significant differences between the groups in postoperative complications (33·7 versus 40·4 per cent; P = 0·215), rate of recurrent hernia within 1 year (1·2 per cent in both groups) or quality of life. CONCLUSION The avoidance of suture fixation using a self-gripping mesh was not accompanied by a reduction in chronic symptoms after inguinal hernia repair.

This Institutional Review Board approved, Health Information Portability and Accountability Act compliant, prospective study enrolled BI-RADS four and five patients from 2008 to 2010. Eighty-seven subjects had noncontrast breast CT, 42 had contrast-enhanced breast CT (CE-breast CT) with 70 pathologically confirmed cancer diagnoses. All 70 comprise the study cohort for noncontrast breast CT, and 23 who had CE-breast CT comprise the cohort for CE-breast CT. All had diagnostic work-up. Patient age, breast density, lesion size and characteristics, biopsy method, and core pathology were recorded. A Fisher's exact test was used to detect a difference in detectability. For agreement in size measurement between the imaging modalities, a paired t-test was employed. Reported p-values were based on 2-sided tests. Two one-sided tests were calculated to determine equivalence within ±0.3 cm at a 90% significance level. Noncontrast breast CT identified 67 of 70 malignant lesions, detected by diagnostic work-up. CE-breast CT identified 23 of 23 index malignant lesions and in addition, found three malignant lesions in three cases not previously detected. Noncontrast breast CT demonstrated the index lesion in 67 of 70 cases and CE-breast CT demonstrated the index lesion in all 23 cases. An additional three new malignant lesions not seen with conventional diagnostic work-up were detected. In this preliminary study, breast CT with or without contrast was shown to be accurate at identifying malignant breast lesions in the diagnostic setting.","Seifert, Posy; Conover, David; Zhang, Yan; Morgan, Renee; Arieno, Andrea; Destounis, Stamatia; Somerville, Patricia; Murphy, Philip F",The breast journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbj.12285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934253/,552

204391,Department of Error,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, designated a variant of concern (VOC-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. DESIGN: Matched cohort study. SETTING: Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection). PARTICIPANTS: 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS: The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases. CONCLUSIONS: The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.","Challen, Robert; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Read, Jonathan M; Dyson, Louise; Tsaneva-Atanasova, Krasimira; Danon, Leon",BMJ,,552

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible adults residing in the area under study were chosen by simple random sampling and interviewed using a predesigned and pretested data collection schedule to assess awareness and perception. Based on their total awareness score, the participants were classified as having good awareness or poor awareness toward eye donation. RESULTS: Among 423 participants, 52.0% were male, 34.0% were 18 to 30 years old, 38.3% were educated up to secondary level, and 85.6% had eye disease in their family. Of total participants, 70.2% had heard about eye donation, with 59.9% of this group having knowledge of eye donation only after death and 57.9% having knowledge that donation must occur within 6 hours of death. In addition, 52.9% were aware about donation from home, 30.6% said only the cornea is transplantable, and 52.2% knew it can be preserved. Participants with higher education, higher socioeconomic status, and outside of the house occupational engagement had significantly higher chance of good eye donation awareness. Of total participants, 32.0% said that COVID-19 could be transmitted through eye donation, with 58.2% of participants opining that the pandemic was not a suitable time to consider donation of eyes.

This work could bring information on its acceptance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transversal study with 253 individuals. A questionnaire was performed using Likert scale (1-very unsatisfied, 5-very satisfied) on patients with diabetes, hypertension and in subjects with other pathologies, whose consultations occurred between 01/04/2020 and 01/05/2020. Collected data included sociodemographics, previous telemedicine appointments, satisfaction levels of teleconsultation and doubt clarification, and interest in further telemedicine follow-up. In addition, a comparative analysis was performed between the periods January-February and April-May of 2020 in relation to age, sex, hypertension, diabetes and the type of contact (presential or remote). Statistics were performed using SPSS® and Excel®. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Diabetes follow-up appointments accounted for 34.4% of total consultations. Globally there was a high level of satisfaction and interest in future telemedicine follow-up. However, diabetic and older patients were less interested in this type of follow-up. Statistically significant differences about satisfaction were found in age, sex and presence/absence of diabetes. 70.6% of healthy patients preferred contact by e-mail over telephone. A selection bias is present because no randomization was made. The higher prevalence of diabetes consultations and the lack of adjustment for confounding factors can also affect results. Number of consults between January-February and April-May was compared and the main result was the significant reduction in the number of face-to-face consultations for diabetes (-50.1%) and hypertension (-94.1%). Presential consultations decreased by 72.6% and non-presential consultations increased by 61.9%. There was a selection bias because the sample was not random.

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the level in the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than among COVID-19-negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%) (P < 0.001). COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, which, when excluded, reduced the bacteremia rate to 1.6%.

Methods: During December 2019-April 2020, the sequential CT images of 30 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed from admission to follow-up. The qualitative evolution tendency of lung abnormalities and semi-quantitative CT scores were analyzed for temporal change. Results: The mean hospitalized period was 24.5 ± 9.6 days (range 6-49 days). The average time from the first, second, third, fourth and follow-up CT examination to the initial symptom onset were 4.2 ± 3.1 days, 10.7 ± 4.4 days, 17.1 ± 3.9 days, 24.6 ± 7.5 days, and 42.4 ± 15.6 days, respectively. During illness day 0-5, groundglass opacity (GGO) was the main pattern. The following illness day 6-11, the main CT pattern was consolidation and reticular pattern. The consolidation and reticular pattern gradually dissipate during illness day 12-23, and the reticular pattern and light GGO increased. When illness day was &#8805; 24 days, the reticular pattern and light GGO gradually decrease until complete dissipation. The highest CT score was at illness day 6-11.

601712,Department of Error.,2020-08-15,"Human enteroviruses are responsible for diverse diseases, from mild respiratory symptoms to fatal neurological complications. Currently, no registered antivirals have been approved for clinical therapy. Thus, a therapeutic agent for the enterovirus-related disease is urgently needed. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a novel monophosphoramidate adenosine analog prodrug that exhibits potent antiviral activity against diverse RNA virus families, including positive-sense Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae and negative-sense Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Pneumoviridae. Currently, remdesivir is under phase 3 clinical development for disease COVID-19 treatment. Here, we found that remdesivir impeded both EV71 viral RNA (vRNA) and complementary (cRNA) synthesis, indicating that EV71 replication is inhibited by the triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir. Moreover, remdesivir showed potent antiviral activity against diverse enteroviruses. These data extend the remdesivir antiviral activity to enteroviruses and indicate that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment for EV71 and other enterovirus infections.","Ye, Wei; Yao, Min; Dong, Yangchao; Ye, Chuantao; Wang, Dan; Liu, He; Ma, Hongwei; Zhang, Hui; Qi, Libin; Yang, Yuewu; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Liang; Cheng, Linfeng; Lv, Xin; Xu, Zhikai; Lei, Yingfeng; Zhang, Fanglin",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595613/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01105,552

631726,Department of Error,2021-03-19,"Since the emergence of the virus that causes COVID-19 (the SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan in December 2019, societies all around the world have had to change their normal life patterns due to the restrictions and lockdowns imposed by governments. These changes in life patterns have a direct reflection on energy consumption. Thanks to Smart Grid technologies, specifically to the Advance Metering Infrastructure at secondary distribution network, this impact can be evaluated even at the customer level. Thus, this paper analyzes the consumption behavior and the impact that this crisis has had using Smart Meter data. The proposed approach includes the selection and normalization of features, automatic clustering, the obtaining of the estimated consumption without considering the crisis (at short and mid-terms) and the impact evaluation. The proposed approach has been tested on a case with a real Smart Meter infrastructure from Manzanilla (Huelva, Spain). The results of this use case showed that residential customers have increased their consumption around 15% during full lockdown and 7.5% during the reopening period. In contrast, globally, non-residential customers have decreased their consumption 38% during full lockdown and 14.5% during the reopening period. However, referring to non-residential customers, five different consumption profiles were found with different short-term and mid-term behaviors during the COVID crisis. The different behavior found shows customers who have maintained their normal consumption during the lockdown, others who have reduced it (to a greater or lesser extent) and have not recovered it after the removal of the restrictions, and others who have reduced the consumption but then they recovered it when the restrictions were removed. The metadata of the customers in each behavior cluster found are highly correlated to the restrictions imposed to control the spread of the virus. This study shows evidence about the proposed approach usefulness to analyze the behavior and the impact at customer level during the COVID-19 crisis.","García, Sebastián; Parejo, Antonio; Personal, Enrique; Ignacio Guerrero, Juan; Biscarri, Félix; León, Carlos",Appl Energy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536699/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921000969?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116547; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261921000969,552
