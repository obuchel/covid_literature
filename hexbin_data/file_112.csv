2175,2175,2175,Low-Fidelity Polymerases of Alphaviruses Recombine at Higher Rates To Overproduce Defective Interfering Particles,10.451807,6.9070277,2016-02-11,"Low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for many RNA virus mutators have been shown to confer attenuated phenotypes, presumably due to increased mutation rates. Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine strains.","Poirier, Enzo Z.; Mounce, Bryan C.; Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Hooikaas, Peter Jan; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Vignuzzi, Marco",J Virol,112,1

They do not spread to other areas of the body, and they usually do not pose a serious health risk. In fact, in most cases, benign liver tumors are not diagnosed because patients are asymptomatic. When they are detected, it’s usually because the person has had medical imaging tests, such as an ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for another condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the literature was made using cancer literature and the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS) database for the following keywords: “hepatic benign tumors”, “hepatic cystic tumors”, “polycystic liver disease”, “liver macroregenerative nodules”, “hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma”, “hepatic angiomyolipoma”, “biliary cystadenoma”, and “nodular regenerative hyperplasia”. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in some areas of the world; there is an increasing incidence worldwide. Approximately 750,000 new cases are reported per year. More than 75 % of cases occur in the Asia-Pacific region, largely in association with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The incidence of HCC is increasing in the USA and Europe because of the increased incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unlike the liver HCC, benign tumors are less frequent. However, they represent a chapter always more interesting of liver disease. In fact, a careful differential diagnosis with the forms of malignant tumor is often required in such a way so as to direct the patient to the correct therapy. In conclusion, many of these tumors present with typical features in various imaging studies. On occasions, biopsies are required, and/or surgical removal is needed. In the majority of cases of benign hepatic tumors, no treatment is indicated. The main indication for treatment is the presence of significant clinical symptoms or suspicion of malignancy or fear of malignant transformation.","Bertino, Gaetano; Ardiri, Annalisa; Demma, Shirin; GiuseppeCalvagno, Stefano; Toro, Adriana; Basile, Elisa; Campagna, Davide; Ferraro, Giorgia; Frazzetto, Evelise; Proiti, Maria; Malaguarnera, Giulia; Bertino, Nicoletta; Malaguarnera, Mariano; Malaguarnera, Michele; Amaradio, Maria Domenica; Pricoco, Gabriele; Di Carlo, Isidoro",J Gastrointest Cancer,112,1

Our objective was to examine relationships between floodplain lake fish communities and environmental variables associated with lake morphology, water chemistry, and river‐floodplain connectivity in a large river‐floodplain ecosystem. Multivariate direct‐gradient analyses indicated that lake surface area, lake depth, water clarity, and (to a lesser extent) dissolved oxygen were the most important factors in the structuring of lake fish communities. Results further suggested that floodplain lakes could be placed into groups that contained distinctive fish communities. Fish community structure was not strongly related to river‐floodplain connectivity, though fish species richness in individual lakes was positively correlated with degree of flooding in those lakes. Fish species diversity in lakes was positively correlated with linear distance between lakes and the main river channel; lakes that were furthest from the main river channel had more diverse fish communities. The diversity of environmental conditions in floodplain lakes is essential for maintaining net ecosystem diversity in large river ecosystems.","Lubinski, Benjamin J.; Jackson, John R.; Eggleton, Michael A.",Trans Am Fish Soc,112,28

In the present study, to identify the M1/M2 marker genes in the carcinogenesis and progression of cervical cancer, the microarray datasets GSE9750 and GSE7803 were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena browser. Survival analysis revealed that M1 markers (IL-12) were involved in anti-tumour progression, and M2 markers (IL-10) were involved in the carcinogenesis and invasion of cervical cancer. The expression of M1 markers (IL-12, inducible nitric oxide synthase and CD80) and M2 markers (IL-10 and arginase) was examined to determine whether BCG affects the polarization of macrophages and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that BCG promoted macrophage polarization towards the M1 phenotype and enhanced the transition of M2 to M1 macrophages. The results also revealed that polarized M1 macrophages induced by BCG decreased the protein expression of phosphorylated (p-)retinoblastoma (Rb)/E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of HeLa cells. On the whole, these results demonstrated that BCG promoted the anti-tumour progression of M1 macrophages and inhibited the pro-tumour activation of M2 macrophages via the Rb/E2F1 signalling pathway in HeLa cells. This suggests the possibility of a direct translation of this combination strategy to clinical practice for the treatment of cervical cancer.","Liu, Limin; Shi, Wenjuan; Xiao, Xiao; Wu, Xuemei; Hu, Haiyan; Yuan, Shixin; Liu, Kai; Liu, Zhihua",Oncol Rep,112,20

The starting point is the constitutional reform of January 28, 1992, to Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130, which are the basis for the development of a Law of Religion in a positive sense. This reform contains the principles that guarantee the freedom of religion in Mexico: separation between State and churches and Laicity of State. “Mexican Law of Religion” means the totality of state legal norms that include the religious factor linked to individual, corporate, and collective religious needs and interests under the fundamental principles of religious freedom, secularism (laicity), and separation of the State and religious communities. In this sense, the holders of the religious factor are not only the individual person and the religious communities or religious associations but also the indigenous peoples. For the analysis, I will focus my remarks on some fundamental topics: the amendments to Articles 24 and 40 of the Political Constitution and the New Constitution of Mexico City; development and legal protection of the dimensions of religious freedom; management of religious diversity as public policy and recent cases, such as the Native American Church case and the Blood Transfusion case, since these illustrate the Supreme Court’s readiness to protect the right of religious freedom. One of the most difficult issues to resolve with respect to the register of religious associations has been how to define “notorio arraigo.” The Basic Law strives to protect religious freedom and to establish a society tolerant of religious difference. Furthermore, increased protection of religious minorities may signal a change in Mexican cultural perceptions of religious minorities.","Medina González, María Concepción",Latin American Perspectives on Law and Religion,112,1

This academic year saw “test pollution” with the switch to online instruction, and student learning was significantly impacted by stress, anxiety, illness, being forced to learn in a vastly different method than previously experienced, and the increased potential to fall behind due to lack of access to materials. Classroom assessment, teaching and learning, and measurement and interpretation of student growth are among the numerous areas that have been affected by the sudden switch of schools to online instruction that will require much thought in order to examine the impact of the significant deviation from the classroom norms on which much of previous research has been based. Educators, educational researchers, and policymakers have been presented with a challenge that does not have a definitive answer. There are many unknowns that remain as schools plan to move forward with instruction.

These types are Economic and Legal CSR, Philanthropic CSR, and Ethical CSR. The main objective of this study is to determine which CSR type is better to reduce the corporate cynical impression on corporate image and the purchase intentions of consumers. In the study design, the bootstrap approach and AMOS 24 were employed to deal with mediation. The researchers recruited 500 individuals from different educational institutions in China using a simple random selection process. The outcomes of this study indicated that all three types of CSR are successful in mitigating the detrimental effects of corporate cynicism on the image of a firm and the purchase intentions of consumers. A more effective technique of boosting the corporate image of a company and purchase intention of a consumer is via charitable CSR, which may help restore the image of a company and the purchase intention of a consumer that has been affected by corporate cynicism among its target customers.","Avotra, Andrianarivo Andriandafiarisoa Ralison Ny; Chengang, Ye; Wei, Xu; Ming, Jiang; Marcelline, Tsimisaraka Raymondo Sandra",Front Public Health,112,8

This study aimed to assess anxiety, hyperarousal stress, the resilience of the Iranian population, and their related factors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 31 provinces in Iran between March 18 and 25, 2020. A four-part questionnaire, including the demographic information, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-y1—a 20-item standard questionnaire for obvious anxiety), the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC—a 25 item standard questionnaire), and the stress hyperarousal subscale from the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), was used to collect data. The ordinal multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to identify correlates of the psychological factors mentioned above. The Fisher exact test was used to investigate the relationship between anxiety, stress, resilience, and the COVID-19 outbreak. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 26 and GIS 10.71. Results: The findings show that most people had moderate-to-severe anxiety (80.17%) and a high level of resilience (96.4%) during the COVID-19 epidemic. The majority of participants had a moderate level of stress (58.9%). The lowest and highest prevalences of psychiatric disorders were in Sistan and Baluchestan (3.14 cases per 100,000 people) and Semnan (75.9 cases per 100,000 people) provinces, respectively. Men and unmarried people were the only variables significantly associated with anxiety and resilience. Age, gender, and education were significantly associated with hyperarousal stress. Conclusion: The high and moderate levels of anxiety and stress in Iranians can have negative effects on the well-being and performance of the people and can lead to serious problems. Also, high resilience during negative life events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) is associated with the well-being in the lives of people. The results of this study can be used in interventions and other psychological studies.","Sharif Nia, Hamid; Akhlaghi, Elham; Torkian, Samaneh; Khosravi, Vahid; Etesami, Reza; Froelicher, Erika Sivarajan; Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed",Front Psychol,112,16

The birds fasted for18-24 hours prior to the procedure. Induction was followed by 4 distinct progressive responses of the birds to the anesthetic effect, including onset of initial effects at 2.0 ± 1.7 minutes (x̄ ± SD), sternal recumbency with the head still elevated at 2.2 ± 1.6 minutes, lowering and placing the beak tip to the ground at 3.6 ± 3.4 minutes, and lateral positioning of the neck and head at 4.2 ± 3.4 minutes. A general state of sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia were noted 10.0 ± 2.8 minutes postinjection. However, according to an established scoring system for the assessment of anesthetic depth in avian patients, a surgical plane of anesthesia was not achieved. Muscle relaxation determined by the same scoring system lasted for 31.4 ± 17.1 minutes. The penguins' mean respiratory rate did not demonstrate significant change and spontaneous ventilation was present throughout the procedure. Relative peripheral arterial oxygen saturation decreased significantly from 92.83 ± 5.77% at 10 minutes to 90.91 ± 5.77% at 40 minutes following induction. The birds' heart rate also decreased significantly from 112.55 ± 23.97 beats/min at 10 minutes to 101.65 ± 25.42 beats/min at 40 minutes. The measured cloacal temperatures were maintained within normal range despite ambient temperatures of up to 28.3°C (82.9°F). Reversal of medetomidine with 0.25 mg/kg atipamezole was conducted after 45.1 ± 7.3 minutes. Recovery was smooth but of variable duration with patients being able or willing to stand steadily in an upright position after 50.1 ± 34.6 minutes. One penguin died during recovery from a ruptured left ventricle and consecutive pericardial tamponade, but no predisposing factors were identified. The anesthetic protocol proved to be effective for noninvasive and minor painful procedures (eg, diagnostic imaging, blood collection). Disadvantages to the administration of the combined anesthetic agents in the penguins included a short period of muscle relaxation and smooth but potentially prolonged recovery. The safety of the anesthetic protocol described for Humboldt penguins in this report has to be evaluated critically against the the death of 1 penguin during recovery.","Widmer, Dimitri Roberto; Tacke, Sabine; Ternes, Kerstin; Marcordes, Sandra; Kempf, Hermann",Journal of avian medicine and surgery,112,24

Age-related changes in muscle mass and body composition along with medical comorbidities including stroke, dementia, and depression place elderly adults at high risk for developing malnutrition and frailty. This loss of function and decline in muscle mass (ie, sarcopenia) can be associated with reduced mobility and ability to perform the task of daily living, placing the elderly at an increased risk for falls, fractures, and subsequent institutionalization, leading to a decline in the quality of life and increased mortality. There are a number of modifiable factors that can mitigate some of the muscle loss elderly experience especially when hospitalized. Due to this, it is paramount for providers to understand the pathophysiology behind malnutrition and sarcopenia, be able to assess risk factors for malnutrition, and provide appropriate nutrition support. The present review describes the pathophysiology of malnutrition, identifies contributing factors to this condition, discusses tools to assess nutritional status, and proposes key strategies for optimizing enteral nutrition therapy for the elderly.","Mundi, Manpreet S; Patel, Jayshil; McClave, Stephen A; Hurt, Ryan T",Clinical interventions in aging,112,1

Our approach has been to offer surgery to mitigate the risk of infection and possible malignancy. All patients routinely undergo a CT scan of the chest postnatally and once the diagnosis is confirmed, minimal access surgery is offered. Our anesthetists provide single-lung ventilation to enhance the operative view. We conducted a retrospective review over a 10-year period, during which 91 patients were prenatally suspected to have a cystic lung lesion. There were 88 live births of which 29 (33%) cases were initially managed conservatively based on CT findings. Five of these patients, however, became symptomatic needing surgery. A total of 64 (73%) patients underwent surgery with the most common lesions being congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) (24), hybrid lesions (19), and pulmonary sequestrations (12). The median age at surgery was 5 months (1 day to 17 months). Using a minimal access approach, 41 (64%) cases were completed with 17 performed open from the onset. Open surgery was indicated in neonates who became symptomatic within the first few weeks of life as well as patients in respiratory distress that would not tolerate either single-lung ventilation or gas insufflation. There were six further conversions to open from minimal access surgery due to poor visualization or technical difficulties. One patient needed a perioperative blood transfusion and one patient had a more prolonged stay due to persistent air leak managed conservatively. Among asymptomatic patients, evidence of microscopic disease was seen, which included infection as well as two cases of tumors, one pleuropulmonary blastoma seen as part of a CPAM, and one rhabdomyomatous dysplasia seen in the CPAM component of a hybrid lesion. In our experience, excising asymptomatic lesions is safe with minimal complications. Single-lung ventilation in combination with thoracoscopy provides excellent vision. There is a risk of infection and a definite, albeit low, risk of malignancy, which may outweigh the benefits of conservative management.","Thakkar, Hemanshoo Sudhir; Durell, Jonathan; Chakraborty, Subhasis; Tingle, Bianca-Lea; Choi, Arnwald; Fowler, Darren J; Gould, Steve J; Impey, Lawrence; Lakhoo, Kokila",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Approach and Results: We used Cox proportional hazards models to characterize the associations of each of the fasting lipid measures (total cholesterol, LDL-C [low-density lipoprotein cholesterol], HDL-C [high-density lipoprotein cholesterol], triglycerides, RLP-C [remnant lipoprotein cholesterol], LDL-TG [LDL-triglycerides], sdLDL-C [small dense LDL-C], and Apo-E-HDL [Apo-E-containing HDL-C]) with incident PAD identified by pertinent International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) hospital discharge codes (eg, 440.2) among 8330 Black and White ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) participants (mean age 62.8 [SD 5.6] years) free of PAD at baseline (1996-1998) through 2015. Since lipid traits are biologically correlated to each other, we also conducted principal component analysis to identify underlying components for PAD risk. There were 246 incident PAD cases with a median follow-up of 17 years. After accounting for potential confounders, the following lipid measures were significantly associated with PAD (hazard ratio per 1-SD increment [decrement for HDL-C and Apo-E-HDL]): triglycerides, 1.21 (95% CI, 1.08-1.36); RLP-C, 1.18 (1.08-1.29); LDL-TG, 1.18 (1.05-1.33); HDL-C, 1.39 (1.16-1.67); and Apo-E-HDL, 1.27 (1.07-1.51). The principal component analysis identified 3 components (1: mainly loaded by triglycerides, RLP-C, LDL-TG, and sdLDL-C; 2: by HDL-C and Apo-E-HDL; and 3: by LDL-C and RLP-C). Components 1 and 2 showed independent associations with incident PAD. CONCLUSIONS Triglyceride-related and HDL-related lipids were independently associated with incident PAD, which has implications on preventive strategies for PAD. However, none of the novel lipid measures outperformed conventional ones.","Kou, Minghao; Ding, Ning; Ballew, Shoshana H; Salameh, Maya J; Martin, Seth S; Selvin, Elizabeth; Heiss, Gerardo; Ballantyne, Christie M; Matsushita, Kunihiro; Hoogeveen, Ron C","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",112,24

Primary outcome was death or major disability (modified Rankin scale of 3-6) at 90 days. Off-hour admission was defined as night-time (4:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m.) on weekdays, weekends (Saturday and Sunday), and public holidays in each participating country. RESULTS Of 2,794 patients with information on the primary outcome, 1,770 (63%) were admitted to study centers during off-hours. Off-hour admission was not associated with risk of poor outcome at 90 days (53% off-hour vs. 55% on-hour; p = 0.49), even after adjustment for comorbid risk factors (odds ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.76-1.12). Consistency exists in the effects of intensive BP lowering between off- and on-hour admission (p = 0.85 for homogeneity). CONCLUSIONS Off-hour admission was not associated with increased risks of death or major disability among trial protocol participants with acute ICH. Intensive BP lowering can provide similar treatment effect irrespective of admission hours.","Sato, Shoichiro; Arima, Hisatomi; Heeley, Emma; Hirakawa, Yoichiro; Delcourt, Candice; Lindley, Richard I; Robinson, Thompson; Huang, Yining; Morgenstern, Lewis; Stapf, Christian; Wang, Jiguang; Chalmers, John; Anderson, Craig S",Cerebrovascular diseases,112,16

In this systematic review and study, the clinicopathologic features of endometrial cancer in patients with MMR-intact, MLH1 methylation positive, MMR-deficient or Lynch syndrome are evaluated. A systematic search of online databases between 1990 and 2018 identified studies of endometrial cancer patients with tumour testing (MMR protein immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability) and germline assessment for Lynch syndrome. Extracted data included tumour testing, germline genetic testing, age, body mass index (BMI), family history, tumour stage, grade and histologic type. Associations between MMR-intact, MLH1 methylation positive, MMR-deficient and Lynch syndrome groups were analysed using descriptive statistics. The comprehensive search produced 4,400 publications, 29 met inclusion criteria. A total of 7,057 endometrial cancer cases were identified, 1,612 with abnormal immunohistochemistry, 977 with microsatellite instability. Nine-hundred patients underwent germline genetic testing, identifying 212 patients with Lynch syndrome. Patients in the Lynch syndrome and MMR-deficient groups were significantly younger than patients in the MMR-intact and MLH1 methylation positive groups. Patients with MMR-intact tumours had the highest BMI, followed by MMR-deficient, then Lynch syndrome. MMR-intact tumours were more likely to be grade I at diagnosis than other groups. Patients with Lynch syndrome and MMR-deficient tumours were less likely to have stage I disease as compared to patients with MMR-intact tumours. Endometrial cancer patients with MMR-deficient tumours have similar features to those with germline Lynch syndrome mutations, including age, grade, histology and stage. Even in the absence of a germline mutation, tumour evaluation for MMR status may have important clinical implications.","Gordhandas, Sushmita; Kahn, Ryan M; Gamble, Charlotte; Talukdar, Nizam; Maddy, Brandon; Nelson, Becky Baltich; Askin, Gulce; Christos, Paul J; Holcomb, Kevin; Caputo, Thomas A; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Frey, Melissa K",Ecancermedicalscience,112,17

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with inflammatory changes to the olfactory bulb, and treatments with anti-inflammatory properties are hypothesized to attenuate viral injury and promote recovery of olfaction after infection. Our study investigated the efficacy of a supplement with Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Luteolin to support recovery of olfaction in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a randomized-controlled pilot study in outpatients with history of confirmed COVID-19 with post-infection olfactory impairment that persisted ≥ 90 days after SARS-CoV-2 negative testing. Patients were randomized to two times a day olfactory rehabilitation alone or weekly olfactory rehabilitation plus daily oral supplement with PEA and Luteolin. Subjects with preexisting olfactory disorders were excluded. Sniffin' Sticks assessments were performed at baseline and 30 days after treatment. Data on gender, age, and time since infection were collected. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test was used to compare variances of Sniff scores between groups over time, and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess for correlations between Sniff Score and gender or duration of infection. RESULTS Among 12 patients enrolled (n=7, supplement; n=5, controls), patients receiving supplement had greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification score versus controls (p=0.01). Time since infection was negatively correlated with Sniff Score, and there was no correlation between gender. CONCLUSIONS Treatment combining olfactory rehabilitation with oral supplementation with PEA and Luteolin was associated with improved recovery of olfactory function, most marked in those patients with longstanding olfactory dysfunction. Further studies are necessary to replicate these findings and to determine whether early intervention including olfactory rehabilitation and PEA+Luteolin oral supplement might prevent SARS-CoV-2 associated olfactory impairment.","D'Ascanio, L; Vitelli, F; Cingolani, C; Maranzano, M; Brenner, M J; Di Stadio, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,112,1

Spike (S) glycoproteins on the viral membrane bind to ACE2 receptors on the host cell membrane and initiate fusion, and S protein is currently among the primary drug target to inhibit viral entry. The S protein can be in a receptor inaccessible (closed) or accessible (open) state based on down and up positions of its receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. However, conformational dynamics and the transition pathway between closed to open states remain unexplored. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from closed and open states of the S protein trimer in the presence of explicit water and ions. MD simulations showed that RBD forms a higher number of interdomain interactions and exhibits lower mobility in its down position than its up position. MD simulations starting from intermediate conformations between the open and closed states indicated that RBD switches to the up position through a semi-open intermediate that potentially reduces the free energy barrier between the closed and open states. Free energy landscapes were constructed, and a minimum energy pathway connecting the closed and open states was proposed. Because RBD-ACE2 binding is compatible with the semi-open state, but not with the closed state of the S protein, we propose that the formation of the intermediate state is a prerequisite for the host cell recognition.","Gur, Mert; Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Zeynep; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Golcuk, Mert",The Journal of chemical physics,112,16

As various elements of the trigeminal system are known to be organised in a somatotopic fashion, the question arose whether the fibres within the trigeminal root show specific distributions patterns in their contribution to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract specifically. METHODS This study investigated the arrangement of the fibres in the trigeminal root by combining various imaging methods in the pons of 11 post-mortem specimens. The pons were investigated by polarised light imaging (PLI) (n = 4; to quantify fibre orientation; 100 µm interslice distance), histochemical staining methods (n = 3; to visualise the internal myeloarchitecture; 60 µm) and ultra-high field, post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 4; for tractography; 500 µm interslice distance). RESULTS This study shows that the fibres, from the point where the trigeminal root enters the brainstem, are distinctly arranged by their contribution to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract. This finding is supported by both post-mortem, ultra-high dMRI and different light microscopy techniques. CONCLUSION The data from this study suggest that the fibres in the superior half of the root contribute mainly to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract, whereas the fibres in the inferior half mainly contribute to the dorsal trigeminothalamic tract. Such a somatotopic organisation could possibly create new insights into the anatomical origin of trigeminal neuralgia and the clinical relevance of this somatotopic organisation should therefore be further explored.","Guberinic, Alis; Souverein, Veerle; Volkers, Ruben; van Cappellen van Walsum, Anne-Marie; Vissers, Kris Cp; Mollink, Jeroen; Henssen, Dylan Jha",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,112,31

Case 1: A left renal tumor was incidentally detected in a 52-year-old female on ultrasonography. Case 2: A right renal tumor was detected in a 67-year-old male with epigastric pain on computed tomography. They were referred for further examination and diagnosed with RCC (clinical T1bN0M0 and clinical T2aN0M0, respectively). Senhance® assisted LRN was completed without conversion to conventional LRN or open surgery in both cases. The pneumoperitoneum time, console time and estimated blood loss in case 1 and case 2 were 173 min, 143 min and 3 mL, and 154 min, 122 min and 50 mL, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful. Senhance® assisted LRN for RCC was safely and precisely performed. Furthermore, the operator was comfortable during the surgery. Although further surgical experience and long-term follow-up are required to assess surgical and oncological outcomes, Senhance® assisted LRN for RCC may be a promising procedure.

The present study is focused on bryophyte development occurring in the show cave that was responsible of limestone biodeterioration. In order to understand the colonization process of limestone, we have maintained limestone blocks under optimal Lampenflora growth conditions. Moreover, some limestone blocks were painted with several pigments that were used in the prehistory (e.g., red ocher, bone char). Microorganisms and bryophyte growth were monitored during 1 year, and then, the block samples were treated using UV-C light (254 nm). Thus, obtained results were compared with in situ treatment in La Glacière cave. Results have showed dense bryophyte propagation on the several blocks. However, the growth rate was correlated with the chemical composition of the pigment. In fact, the presence of some chemical elements such as As, Cr, Ti, and Co contributed to reduce bryophyte growth. Finally, moss treatment using UV-C light has demonstrated high efficiency under in situ condition, while a fast recolonization has been observed for samples maintained in laboratory. This difference was explained by the high bryophyte density under laboratory conditions that make UV-C light penetration difficult.","Pfendler, Stéphane; Einhorn, Olympe; Alaoui-Sossé, Laurence; Bousta, Faisl; Alaoui-Sossé, Badr; Aleya, Lotfi",Environmental science and pollution research international,112,28

Seventy-five consecutive trauma patients who presented to a level one trauma center over a 6-month period were scanned with a standardized whole body trauma CT protocol including both DS-HP chest (pitch = 2.1-2.5) and SS abdominal CT scans. Subjective analysis of diaphragmatic motion was performed by two readers using a four-point motion scale in seven regions of the diaphragm on coronal and axial slices. An overall confidence score to exclude a diaphragmatic tear was determined (1 to 10, 10: completely confident and 1: impossible to exclude). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Mean confidence score of 9.85 for DS-HP was significantly better than the mean score of 7.66 for SS images (p < 0.0001). Diaphragmatic motion scores and subjective diaphragmatic motion artifact on coronal and axial images were significantly better for DS-HP images in all areas when compared individually (p < 0.0001) and overall (p < 0.0001). Regions of DS-HP (99.2 %) were diagnostic, whereas only 87.0 % % regions on SS were. Complete agreement of motion scores was present in 92 % of cases, with moderate overall agreement for confidence to exclude a diaphragmatic tear (κ = 0.45). Dual-source high-pitch CT scanning is advantageous as it allows for significantly better evaluation of diaphragmatic structures by minimizing motion artifacts on images of freely breathing trauma patients.","Liang, Teresa; McLaughlin, Patrick; Arepalli, Chesnal D; Louis, Luck J; Bilawich, Ana-Maria; Mayo, John; Nicolaou, Savvas",Emergency radiology,112,1

Recognizing that these fomites can be a secondary route for disease transmission, exploring the deposition pattern of such sessile respiratory droplets on daily-use substrates thus becomes crucial. EXPERIMENTS The used surrogate respiratory fluid is composed of a water-based salt-protein solution, and its precipitation dynamics is studied on four different substrates (glass, ceramic, steel, and PET). For tracking the final deposition of viruses in these droplets, 100 nm virus emulating particles (VEP) are used and their distribution in dried-out patterns is identified using fluorescence and SEM imaging techniques. FINDINGS The final precipitation pattern and VEP deposition strongly depend on the interfacial transport processes, edge evaporation, and crystallization dynamics. A constant contact radius mode of evaporation with a mixture of capillary and Marangoni flows results in spatio-temporally varying edge deposits. Dendritic and cruciform-shaped crystals are majorly seen in all substrates except on steel, where regular cubical crystals are formed. The VEP deposition is higher near the three-phase contact line and crystal surfaces. The results showed the role of interfacial processes in determining the initiation of fomite-type infection pathways in the context of COVID-19.","Rasheed, Abdur; Sharma, Shubham; Kabi, Prasenjit; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",Journal of colloid and interface science,112,4

METHODS From 1 April 2007 through 31 March 2008, we used a low-cost surveillance strategy to identify new onset of respiratory symptoms in patients hospitalized for >72 h and in health care workers in medicine and pediatric wards at 3 public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. RESULTS During 46,273 patient-days of observation, we recorded 136 episodes of hospital-acquired respiratory disease, representing 1.7% of all patient hospital admissions; rates by ward ranged from 0.8 to 15.8 cases per 1000 patient-days at risk. We identified 22 clusters of respiratory disease, 3 of which included both patients and health care workers. Of 226 of heath care workers who worked on our surveillance wards, 61 (27%) experienced a respiratory illness during the study period. The cost of surveillance was US$43 per month per ward plus 30 min per day in data collection. CONCLUSIONS Patients on these study wards frequently experienced hospital-acquired respiratory infections, including 1 in every 20 patients hospitalized for >72 h on 1 ward.

In addition, different evidence types had different associations with subsequent disease prevention behaviors and satisfaction with the US government's action to address the pandemic. Finally, discrete emotions varied in their influences on the use of evidence types, behaviors, and satisfaction. The findings provide potentially valuable contributions to science and health communication theory and practice.","Lu, Hang; Chu, Haoran; Ma, Yanni",Public understanding of science,112,20

At december 2020 in Italy, more than 2 million people have contracted the virus and 78,755 people have died. The scientific community is studying and testing numerous compounds that can be effective and safe for treating people with covid-19. AIM To synthesize and evaluate the quality of evidence of efficacy and safety for the treatment. The available evidence is summarized in a living systematic review, a review that is constantly updated on the basis of the results of the new clinical studies. METHODS A bibliographic search is launched weekly on the electronic databases and on the main clinical trial registers. Two researchers independently select the articles and assess the quality of the studies using the criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, the certainty of the overall quality of the evidence is assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS At 31/12/2020, 101 randomized controlled studies were included that consider 72 different comparisons and include a total of 55,281 patients. 37 drugs are tested with respect to the standard treatment, 6 are evaluated against placebo and finally 29 compare different drugs with each other. By selecting studies that evaluate the efficacy and safety of a drug compared to standard treatment, which include at least 2 studies and which have low to high certainty of evidence, results show that corticosteroids, remdesivir, favipiravir, immunoglobulins, colchicine, and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion could reduce overall mortality. No differences for the risk of any adverse events are observed between convalescent plasma and remdesivir compared to standard treatment. Remdesivir probably reduces the risk of serious adverse events; a similar effect, although less strong, is also noted for tocilizumab and the lopinavir-ritonavir combination. In contrast, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and convalescent plasma transfusion are associated with safety concerns with respect to the risk of serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS The 101 studies included consider 72 comparisons and numerous outcomes, the results often coming from single studies and of small dimensions, and for 61% with a very low certainty of evidence, are difficult to summarize and the final result is to increase the uncertainty rather than providing useful information to the clinic and research. From all the work carried out it seems to us that the pandemic has highlighted the many shadows of scientific literature as tool to improve knowledge.","Cruciani, Fabio; Amato, Laura; De Crescenzo, Franco; Mitrova, Zuzana; Saulle, Rosella; Vecchi, Simona; Davoli, Marina",Recenti progressi in medicina,112,12

Our objective was to characterize the range and context of interventions to support second victims in acute care settings. METHODS We performed a scoping study using Arksey and O'Malley's process. A library scientist searched PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in September 2017, and updated the search in November 2018. We sought gray literature (Canadian Electronic Library, Proquest and Scopus) and searched reference lists of included studies. Stakeholder organizations and authors of included studies were contacted. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles and abstracts and extracted data. A qualitative approach was used to categorize the context and characteristics of the 22 identified interventions. RESULTS After screening 5634 titles and abstracts, 173 articles underwent full-text screening. Twenty-two interventions met the criteria and were categorized as providing peer support (n = 8), proactive education (n = 6), or both (n = 8). Programs came from Canada (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), and the United States (n = 18). A specific traumatic event triggered the development of 5 programs. Some programs used a standard definition of second victims, (n = 6), whereas other programs had a broader scope (n = 12). Confidentiality was explicitly assured in 9 peer support programs. Outcome measures were often not reported. CONCLUSIONS This is a new area of study with little qualitative data from which to determine whether these programs are effective. Many programs had a similar design, based on the structure proposed by the same small group of experts in this new field.

The prevalence of skeletal muscle channelopathies is approximately 1 in 100,000, and the prevalence of SCM is much lower. To our knowledge, this is the first report on anesthetic management of a patient with SCM. CASE PRESENTATION A 23-year-old woman with congenital nasal dysplasia and SCM was scheduled to undergo rhinoplasty with autologous costal cartilage. Total intravenous anesthesia without muscle relaxants was administered followed by continuous intercostal nerve block. Although transient elevation of potassium level in the blood was observed during surgery, the patient did not show exacerbation of myotonic or paralytic symptoms in the postoperative period. CONCLUSION Total intravenous anesthesia and peripheral nerve block can be administered safely to a patient with SCM. However, careful monitoring of the symptoms and electrolytes is recommended.","Matsumoto, Naohisa; Nishimoto, Rei; Matsuoka, Yoshikazu; Takeda, Yoshimasa; Morimatsu, Hiroshi",JA clinical reports,112,1

Meanwhile, physical activity has been demonstrated to maintain blood glucose. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of physical activity on cognition in patients with diabetes and provide evidence for the treatment of cognition impairment among them. METHODS We searched studies published in five databases from 1 January 1984 to 29 August 2020. A random-effect or fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled effect of physical activity on the change of cognition throughout intervention duration and post-intervention cognition scores by standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We used funnel plots to evaluate the publication bias, I2 statistic to evaluate the heterogeneity and did subgroup analysis stratified by sample size and follow-up time. RESULTS Five eligible studies involving 2581 patients with diabetes were included. The pooled effect of physical activity on cognition improvement in patients with diabetes was significant (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.34-1.62), while the effect on post-intervention cognition scores was not significant (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI: -0.04-0.73). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled effect was significantly higher in studies of follow-up time less than 1 year (SMD = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.63-2.64), while observing no significant effect in studies of follow-up time over 1 year (SMD = 0.10, 95% CI: -0.11-0.32). CONCLUSIONS Physical activity is beneficial to improving cognition in patients with diabetes.

We aimed to compare performances on neuropsychological measures across in-person and videoconference-based administrations in community-based survivors of stroke. METHOD Participants were recruited through a stroke-specific database and community advertising. Stroke survivors were eligible if they had no upcoming neuropsychological assessment, concurrent neurological and/or major psychiatric diagnoses, and/or sensory, motor, or language impairment that would preclude standardised assessment. Thirteen neuropsychological measures were administered in-person and via videoconference in a randomised crossover design (2-week interval). Videoconference calls were established between two laptop computers, facilitated by Zoom. Repeated-measures t tests, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare performance across conditions. RESULTS Forty-eight participants (26 men; Mage = 64.6, SD = 10.1; Mtime since stroke = 5.2 years, SD = 4.0) completed both sessions on average 15.8 (SD = 9.7) days apart. For most measures, the participants did not perform systematically better in a particular condition, indicating agreement between administration methods. However, on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised, participants performed poorer in the videoconference condition (Total Recall Mdifference = -2.11). ICC estimates ranged from .40 to .96 across measures. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary evidence that in-person and videoconference assessment result in comparable scores for most neuropsychological tests evaluated in mildly impaired community-based survivors of stroke. This preliminary evidence supports teleneuropsychological assessment to address service gaps in stroke rehabilitation; however, further research is needed in more diverse stroke samples.","Chapman, Jodie E; Gardner, Betina; Ponsford, Jennie; Cadilhac, Dominique A; Stolwyk, Renerus J",Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,112,1

Methods Cats with pleural, abdominal or pericardial effusion were prospectively enrolled. Cats were classified as having or not having FIP based on immunohistochemistry (if available) or a sophisticated statistical method using machine learning methodology with concepts from game theory. Cats without FIP were further subdivided into three subgroups: cardiac disease, neoplasia and other diseases. Serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were measured in serum and effusion, using assays previously validated in cats. Results Serum and effusion samples were available for the measurement of APPs from 88 and 67 cats, respectively. Concentrations of the APPs in serum and effusion were significantly different in cats with and without FIP ( P <0.001 for all three APPs). The best APP to distinguish between cats with and without FIP was AGP in the effusion; a cut-off value of 1550 µg/ml had a sensitivity and specificity of 93% each for diagnosing FIP. Conclusions and relevance AGP, particularly if measured in effusion, was found to be useful in differentiating between FIP and other diseases, while SAA and Hp were not. The concentration of all three APPs in some diseases (eg, septic processes, disseminated neoplasia) was as high as in cats with FIP; therefore, none of these can be recommended as a single diagnostic test for FIP.","Hazuchova, Katarina; Held, Susanne; Neiger, Reto",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,112,30

The minimal invasive cap-based refractive procedure, small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), has been proposed to affect corneal integrity less than flap-based procedures, due to the fibre-sparing incision of the strong anterior corneal lamellae. Flap-based procedures include laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) and femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate corneal biomechanical changes by noncontact air pulse tonometry after treatment of myopia/myopic astigmatism with SMILE compared to flap-based refractive surgery. A total of 220 publications were identified through a systematic search in PubMed and Embase. Two levels of screening identified nine studies (three randomised controlled trials (RCT) and six nonrandomised clinical trials) eligible for the review. All the nonrandomised clinical trials were graded to have an overall serious risk of bias. Measurements with the Corvis ST were not included in any of the eligible studies. The RCTs found no statistical significant differences between SMILE or flap-based procedures concerning corneal hysteresis (CH) or corneal resistance factor (CRF), as measured with the Ocular Response Analyzer. However, a greater reduction in CRF and CH was found in the flap-based group in five and two of the nonrandomised studies, respectively. The findings in this review illustrate that the presumed biomechanical advantages of a cap-based small incision could not be demonstrated in existing studies and by commercially available technology. However, studies with lower levels of evidence suggest less affection of corneal viscoelastic properties after SMILE when evaluating corneal stability by noncontact tonometry.","Raevdal, Pernille; Grauslund, Jakob; Vestergaard, Anders Højslet",Acta ophthalmologica,112,25

Osteoarthritis has acidic and inflammatory environment. Our aim was to load celastrol into HMSNs and capped with chitosan to construct a pH-responsive nanoparticle medicine (CSL@HMSNs-Cs), which is of high solubility for osteoarthritis intra-articular injection treatment. METHODS The CSL@HMSNs-Cs were assembled and the characteristics were measured. The CSL@HMSNs-Cs was applied in vitro in the chondrocytes collected from rats cartilage tissue and in vivo in the MIA induced knee osteoarthritis rats via intra-articular injection. Cytotoxicity assay, pH-responsive release, pain behavior, MRI, safranin o fast green staining, ELISA and western blot analysis were applied to evaluate the bioavailability and therapeutic effect of CSL@HMSNs-Cs. RESULTS CSL@HMSNs-Cs was stable due to the protection of the chitosan layers in alkaline environment (pH = 7.7) but revealed good solubility and therapeutic effect in acidic environment (pH = 6.0). The cytotoxicity assay showed no cytotoxicity at relatively low concentration (200 μg/mL) and the cell viability of chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1β was increased in CSL@HMSNs-Cs group. Paw withdrawal threshold in CSL@HMSNs-Cs group is increased, and MRI and Safranin O Fast Green staining showed improvements in articular surface erosion and joint effusion. The upregulated expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-3 and MMP-13 and NF-κB signaling pathway of chondrocytes were inhibited in CSL@HMSNs-Cs group. CONCLUSION Hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles were an ideal carrier for natural drugs with poor solubility and were of high biocompatibility for intra-articular injection.

Animal models featuring complex aneurysm architecture are needed to test endovascular innovations and train interventionalists. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven adult female New Zealand rabbits were assigned to 3 experimental groups. Complex bilobular, bisaccular, and broad-neck venous pouch aneurysms were surgically formed at an artificially created bifurcation of both CCAs. Three and 5 weeks postoperatively, the rabbits underwent 2D-DSA and CE-3D-MRA, respectively. RESULTS Mortality was 0%. We observed no neurologic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal complications. The aneurysm patency rate was 91% (1 aneurysm thrombosis). There was 1 postoperative aneurysm hemorrhage (9% morbidity). The mean aneurysm volumes were 176.9 ± 63.6 mm(3), 298.6 ± 75.2 mm(3), and 183.4 ± 72.4 mm(3) in bilobular, bisaccular, and broad-neck aneurysms, respectively. The mean operation time was 245 minutes (range, 175-290 minutes). An average of 27 ± 4 interrupted sutures (range, 21-32) were needed to create the aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating complex venous pouch bifurcation aneurysms in the rabbit with low morbidity, mortality, and high short-term aneurysm patency. The necks, domes, and volumes of the bilobular, bisaccular, and broad-neck aneurysms created are larger than those previously described. These new complex aneurysm formations are a promising tool for in vivo animal testing of new endovascular devices.","Marbacher, S; Erhardt, S; Schläppi, J-A; Coluccia, D; Remonda, L; Fandino, J; Sherif, C",AJNR.

However, this is challenging when the contrast with neighboring tissues is low, necessitating labeling with contrast agents (CAs), but current CAs have limitations (i.e., toxicity, negative contrast, label instability, and/or inappropriate size). Therefore, a naturally derived hemin-L-lysine (HL) complex is used as a potential CA to label collagen-based templates for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Labeling does not change the basic characteristics of the collagen templates. When hybrid templates composed of collagen type I reinforced with degradable polymers are subcutaneously implanted in mice, longitudinal visualization by MRI is possible with good contrast and in correlation with template remodeling. In contrast, unlabeled collagen templates are hardly detectable and the fate of these templates cannot be monitored by MRI. Interestingly, tissue remodeling and vascularization are enhanced within HL-labeled templates. Thus, HL labeling is presented as a promising universal imaging marker to label tissue-engineered implants for MRI, which additionally seems to accelerate tissue regeneration.","Janke, Heinz P; Güvener, Nihan; Dou, Weiqiang; Tiemessen, Dorien M; YantiSetiasti, Anglita; Cremers, Jozef G O; Borm, Paul J A; Feitz, Wout F J; Heerschap, Arend; Kiessling, Fabian; Oosterwijk, Egbert",Advanced healthcare materials,112,1

Consequently, there is growing evidence that the microbiome could be utilized in medical diagnosis and patient stratification. Moreover, multiple gut microbes and their metabolic products may be bioactive, thereby serving as future potential microbiome-targeting or -associated therapeutics. Such therapies could include new generation probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantations, postbiotics, and dietary modulators.

The overall low homology to ICV, lack of antibody cross-reactivity to ICV in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel immunodiffusion assays, and inability to productively reassort with ICV led to the proposal that these viruses represented a new genus of influenza virus, influenzavirus D (IDV). To further our understanding of the epidemiology of IDV, real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on a set of 208 samples from bovines with respiratory disease. Ten samples (4.8%) were positive and six viruses were successfully isolated in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of full-genome sequences of these six new viruses and four previously reported viruses revealed two distinct cocirculating lineages represented by D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660), which frequently reassorted with one another. Antigenic analysis using the HI assay and lineage-representative D/OK and D/660 antiserum found up to an approximate 10-fold loss in cross-reactivity against heterologous clade antiserum. One isolate, D/bovine/Texas/3-13/2011 (D/3-13), clustered with the D/660 lineage, but also had high HI titers to heterologous (D/OK) clade antiserum. Molecular modeling of the hemagglutinin esterase fusion protein of D/3-13 identified a mutation at position 212 as a possible antigenic determinant responsible for the discrepant HI results. These results suggest that IDV is common in bovines with respiratory disease and that at least two genetic and antigenically distinct clades cocirculate. IMPORTANCE A novel bovine influenza virus was recently identified. Detailed genetic and antigenic studies led to the proposal that this virus represents a new genus of influenza, influenzavirus D (IDV). Here, we show that IDV is common in clinical samples of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), with a prevalence similar to that of other established BRDC etiological agents. These results are in good agreement with the near-ubiquitous seroprevalence of IDV previously found. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences found evidence for two distinct cocirculating lineages of IDV which freely reassort. Significant antigenic differences, which generally agreed with the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin esterase phylogeny, were observed between the two lineages. Based on these results, and on the ability of IDV to infect and transmit in multiple mammalian species, additional studies to determine the pathogenic potential of IDV are warranted.","Collin, Emily A; Sheng, Zizhang; Lang, Yuekun; Ma, Wenjun; Hause, Ben M; Li, Feng",Journal of virology,112,20

This research provides quantitative molecular understanding of the role of the DES thickness and also the type of solid support in CO2 sorption and diffusion using molecular dynamics simulations. In general, the proposed model based on supported DESs immobilized on different supports was developed to correlate the solubility of CO2 in DESs based on choline chloride. The simulated systems illustrate that CO2 molecules mainly accumulate at the gas/DES interface in short times, whereas diffusion of CO2 to the bulk DESs is slower as the thickness of the immobilized DES increases. In addition, the CO2 absorption capacity of both DESs coated on the TiO2 surface is larger than that on the graphite surface. Structural and dynamic characteristics were determined using density profiles, distribution functions, orientational analysis, and mean-square displacements. We further demonstrate the effective interaction parameters associated with CO2 capture by DESs via density functional theory.","Heydari Dokoohaki, Maryam; Zolghadr, Amin Reza",The journal of physical chemistry.

Our hypothesis was that the SPW might be a critical component of most colonic motor functions, and hence might act as a biomarker for healthy colon motility. To that end, we performed high-resolution colonic manometry (HRCM), for the first time using an 84-sensor (1 cm spaced) water-perfused catheter, in 17 healthy volunteers. Intraluminal pressure patterns were recorded during baseline, proximal and rectal balloon distention, after a meal and following proximal and rectal luminal bisacodyl administration. Quantification was performed using software, based on Image J, developed during this study. Gas expulsion was always associated with SPWs, furthermore, SPWs were associated with water or balloon expulsion. SPWs were prominently emerging at the termination of proximal high amplitude propagating pressure waves (HAPWs); we termed this motor pattern HAPW-SPWs; hence, SPWs were often not a pan-colonic event. SPWs and HAPW-SPWs were observed at baseline with SPW amplitudes of 12.0 ± 8.5 mmHg and 20.2 ± 7.2 mmHg respectively. The SPW occurrence and amplitude significantly increased in response to meal, balloon distention and luminal bisacodyl, associated with 50.3% anal sphincter relaxation at baseline, which significantly increased to 59.0% after a meal, and 69.1% after bisacodyl. Often, full relaxation was achieved. The SPWs associated with gas expulsion had a significantly higher amplitude compared to SPWs without gas expulsion. SPWs could be seen to consist of clusters of high frequency pressure waves, likely associated with a cluster of fast propagating, circular muscle contractions. SPWs were occasionally observed in a highly rhythmic pattern at 1.8 ± 1.2 cycles/min. Unlike HAPWs, the SPWs did not obliterate haustral boundaries thereby explaining how gas can be expelled while solid content can remain restrained by the haustral boundaries. In conclusion, the SPW may become a biomarker for normal gas transit, the gastrocolonic reflex and extrinsic neural reflexes. The SPW assessment reveals coordination of activities in the colon, rectum and anal sphincters. SPWs may become of diagnostic value in patients with colonic dysmotility.","Chen, Ji-Hong; Parsons, Sean P; Shokrollahi, Mitra; Wan, Andrew; Vincent, Alexander D; Yuan, Yuhong; Pervez, Maham; Chen, Wu Lan; Xue, Mai; Zhang, Kailai K; Eshtiaghi, Arshia; Armstrong, David; Bercik, Premsyl; Moayyedi, Paul; Greenwald, Eric; Ratcliffe, Elyanne M; Huizinga, Jan D",Frontiers in physiology,112,24

These effects are largely coordinated through the actions of reproductive hormones (eg, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone). Here, the utility and limitations of minimally invasive sampling techniques are explored, providing a novel perspective on how reproductive hormone measurements can enhance reproductive endocrinology research. Salivary steroid measures are most commonly used, although several dried blood spot and urine assays are also available, and researchers continue to explore the efficacy of other sample types. These relatively simple measures have facilitated the collection of multiple samples from a single participant, allowing researchers to more accurately track the diurnal and cyclical variation exhibited by many reproductive hormones. Ultimately, the ability to collect fine-grained participant data allows biological anthropologists to better test questions central to human reproductive ecology, life history theory, and public health. For example, fieldwork using these techniques suggests that testosterone profile variation across populations is influenced by energetic constraints and reproductive status. Moreover, hormone concentrations shape the development of sex characteristics, with implications for evolutionary questions related to sexual selection. Hormone levels also can be used to identify a range of medical concerns (eg, suppressed hormone production levels linked with psychosocial stress). These findings highlight how minimally invasive collection techniques can be applied to test diverse evolutionary hypotheses and identify important health concerns. Still, more work is needed to standardize collection and laboratory analysis procedures, thereby enabling more direct data comparisons between researchers.","Gildner, Theresa E",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,112,5

The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain after a videothoracoscopic lobectomy versus a mini-thoracotomy approach. METHODS Between April 2011 and January 2013 we enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized study 145 patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy with lymphadenectomy for Stage I lung cancer. In 75 cases (Group A), surgery was performed through a videothoracoscopic approach. In 70 cases (Group B), surgery was undertaken through a conservative mini-thoracotomy. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale and lung function by spirometry and six-minute walking test (6MWT) before surgery, at 48 h and 1 month after surgery. RESULTS Patients were stratified by age, sex, lung function, type and duration of surgery. Length of hospital stay (median, days) was 4 for Group A and 6 for Group B (P = 0.088). The differences between mean postoperative pain values were significant at 1, 12, 24 and 48 h (6.24 vs 8.74, 5.16 vs 7.66, 4.19 vs 6.89 and 2.23 vs 5.33; P = 0.000). In Group A, mean preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second values were 2.65 ± 0.61, and 1.83 ± 0.65 and 2.09 ± 0.65, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month (P = 0.028); in Group B, they were 2.71 ± 0.71 preoperatively and 1.33 ± 0.52 and 1.82 ± 0.63, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month. In Group A, mean preoperative 6MWT values (m) were 426.85 ± 51.18, and 371.23 ± 55.36 and 392.07 ± 56.12, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month; in Group B, they were 421.76 ± 56.65 preoperatively and 312.03 ± 48.54 and 331.83 ± 47.99, respectively, at 48 h and 1 month (P = 0.000).

However, there is controversy as to how long these patients should be followed up after coiling to detect reopening. We aimed to identify the rate of late reopening and the risk factors for reopening in a large single-center cohort of ruptured aneurysms that appeared adequately occluded at 6 months. We also aimed to assess whether rates of recurrence have altered over time with improving coil and angiographic technology. METHODS Patients treated between 1996 and 2010 were assessed and those with both 6-month initial and subsequent long-term follow-up with either digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography were included. Aneurysms were stratified by features such as size, neck width, anatomical location and time of treatment: 1996-2005 (cohort 1) and 2006-2010 (cohort 2). ORs for risk of recurrence were calculated for aneurysm features and rates of recurrence in each cohort were compared using a χ(2) test. RESULTS 437 patients with 458 adequately occluded aneurysms at 6 months had mean long-term follow-up of 31 months; 57 (12.4%) were large (≥ 10 mm) and 104 (22.7%) were wide-necked (>4 mm). Nine aneurysms (2%) showed significant late anatomical deterioration whereby retreatment was considered or undertaken. The risk was greater for large aneurysms (≥ 10 mm) (OR 15.61, 95% CI 3.79 to 64.33, p=0.0001) or wide-necked aneurysms (>4 mm) (OR 12.70, 95% CI 2.60 to 62.13, p=0.0017). The frequency of significant late anatomical deterioration and retreatment was also less common in those treated in cohort 2 (p<0.05). No completely occluded aneurysm at 6 months demonstrated significant late recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Most aneurysms adequately occluded at 6 months did not show evidence of late recurrence. Large and wide-neck aneurysms are, however, at greater risk of later recurrence.","Mortimer, Alex M; Marsh, Hannah; Klimczak, Katherine; Joshi, Dhiraj; Barton, Helena; Nelson, Richard J; Bradley, Marcus D; Renowden, Shelley A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,112,1

In analogy with transformation of the traditional equations into linear form giving populations and time in parametric form, approximation of the delay equations results in a simple accurate finite recursive solution.

Examples contrasting asymptotically-linked traditional and delay models are given.","Bartley, D.",,112,1

The rapid shift to an online learning environment demanded the development of effective teaching strategies to support student learning. This work describes teaching strategies developed to teach physics during the COVID-19 period. The strategies included posting recorded lectures and live demonstrations, providing timely resources and feedback on student graded items, enhancing communication, providing additional interactive opportunities, offering extra help sessions and extra credit opportunities to students. Other factors that played a significant role for student success were faculty empathy, flexibility, and willingness to adjust teaching strategies. All students who completed the courses (without withdrawing) earned grades of C or better. Over a total of 12 physics class sections, grade distributions in Fall 2020 were better than those of Fall 2019. Only a handful of students received incomplete grades because they were directly or indirectly affected by the COVID virus. Even though student withdrawal rates were higher during the COVID pandemic, the teaching strategies adopted helped improve student grades across all sections.

This model of economic activity, which is strongly influenced by current technological trends, will certainly be the future of the world economy, as part of the 4.0 industrial revolution. For example: mobile apps based on e-commerce. Based on design thinking process, this paper proposes a practical interface design for mobile apps design. In this research, the researcher designing Graphical User Interface (GUI) for mobile apps based on e-commerce “Tuku Sayur” to marketing and distribute agriculture products during pandemic. GUI is one of the most important issues in development of mobile apps. The major problem in the interface design mostly caused by unique feature of mobile device. This is quite challenging for designer how to present clear user interface on a limited screen without overload. The Semantic Differential method was used to understand the impression captured by respondents on the GUI design of Tuku Sayur application. This research is very important to help farmers to marketing and distributing agriculture products through mobile apps. Hopefully, this research can be used as a reference to published mobile apps to support less contact economy in order to makes the economy relatively productive during the pandemic.","Kusumawati, Yudhistya Ayu Miranti Nurul Huda Satrya Dirgantara Carvenoriega Obbyta Adzandy",IOP Conference Series.

Until now, several characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not confirmed such as exact mode of transmission, animal origins, and antiviral therapeutics. However, it is now well known that this virus infects lungs, causes difficulties in breathing process, and affects taste and smell. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite all the investigations and strategies developed, it is deemed necessary that new protocols should be launched for the development and evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.

The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a concern of major public health emergency globally. The virus is highly contagious, enters through nasopharyngeal route into lungs and infects respiratory tracts and later disseminate to other organs in the body. If body immune response fails to eliminate or over responds to infection in affected persons, the condition turns to severe acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia, multiple organ failure, septic shock and finally end-up with life in critical cases. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available to eradicate the complete infection and the only treatment available to patients with critical illness is providing oxygen supply through ventilators along with few antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve from the symptoms. Recently developed COVID-19 vaccines are available to the public in several countries for protecting against SARS-CoV-2. Further, researchers are vigorously being focused on development of novel vaccines, recombinant interferons, monoclonal antibodies against virus, finding of antiviral drugs to block coronaviral specific structural proteins or multiplication in infected persons, drugs for suppression of over production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the human body and disease mechanisms of virus. However, because of combined treatment strategies and reduced pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, the current mortality rate has been reduced to less than 1-1.5% globally from 5 to 6% of initial COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, sudden increase in number of cases in several countries and evolution of new pathogenic strains of SARS-CoV-2 variants from existing strains make another challenging task both for public and scientific communities. Hence, public health officials are recommending public to continue social distancing, avoid contact with infected persons, isolation and quarantine of exposed persons till COVID-19 prevention is under control.

Emerging evidence suggests the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 may also spread by airborne transmission. This is more likely in indoor environments, particularly with poor ventilation. In the context of potential airborne transmission, a vital mitigation strategy for the built environment is heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC features could modify virus transmission potential. A systematic review following international standards was conducted to comprehensively identify and synthesize research examining the effectiveness of filters within HVAC systems in reducing virus transmission. Twenty-three relevant studies showed that: filtration was associated with decreased transmission; filters removed viruses from the air; increasing filter efficiency (efficiency of particle removal) was associated with decreased transmission, decreased infection risk, and increased viral filtration efficiency (efficiency of virus removal); increasing filter efficiency above MERV 13 was associated with limited benefit in further reduction of virus concentration and infection risk; and filters with the same efficiency rating from different companies showed variable performance. Increasing filter efficiency may mitigate virus transmission; however, improvement may be limited above MERV 13. Adapting HVAC systems to mitigate virus transmission requires a multi-factorial approach and filtration is one factor offering demonstrated potential for decreased transmission.","Fleck, B.

But America has long been an outlier;the stockpile of private guns climbed to almost 300 million in 2017. Scholars use multiple theories to explain why gun sales have tripled since the early 2000s, and why disruptions like the pandemic might cause gun sales. However, scholars have difficulty evaluating these theories with existing retrospective estimates of gun sales and other measures, limiting their ability to test theory or suggest policy changes. This study uses the known increase in gun sales during the COVID-19 pandemic to introduce and experimentally validate a novel measure of gun desirability. With a sample of 4,240 U.S. residents, this project demonstrates that gun desirability is a valid measure of inclination toward gun ownership, and that a pandemic video vignette significantly increases overall gun desirability relative to a control video vignette. These results serve as a foundation for future scholarship to (1) discern gun desirability trends, (2) evaluate theorized causes of gun desirability, and (3) consider interventions on those conditions that arouse desire for gun ownership.","Sola, Justin Lucas",Sociological Perspectives,112,16

Thus, the aim of this prospective clinical trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy after two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in five selected groups of immunocompromised patients and healthy controls. Methods: 539 study subjects (449 patients and 90 controls) were included in the clinical trial. The patients had either primary (n=90), or secondary immunodeficiency disorders due to human immunodeficiency virus infection (n=90), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation/chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (n=90), solid organ transplantation (SOT) (n=89), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=90). The primary endpoint was seroconversion rate two weeks after the second dose. The secondary endpoints were safety and documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings: Adverse events were generally mild, but one case of fatal suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction occurred. 72.2% of the immunocompromised patients seroconverted compared to 100% of the controls (p=0.004). Lowest seroconversion rates were found in the SOT (43.4%) and CLL (63.3%) patient groups with observed negative impact of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and ibrutinib, respectively. Interpretation: The results showed that the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine was safe in immunocompromised patients. The rate of seroconversion was substantially lower than in healthy controls, with a wide range of rates and antibody titres among predefined patient groups and subgroups. This clinical trial highlights the need for additional vaccine doses in certain immunocompromised patient groups and/or subgroups to improve immunity.","Bergman, P.; Blennow, O.; Hansson, L.; Mielke, S.; Nowak, P.; Chen, P.; Soderdahl, G.; Osterborg, A.; Smith, C.

Beliefs that the risks from the vaccine outweigh the risks from getting COVID-19 and concerns that the vaccine development process was rushed and lacking rigor have been identified as important drivers of hesitancy and refusal to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We tested whether messages designed to address these beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Method. An online survey fielded between March 8-March 23, 2021 with US Veteran (n=688) and non-Veteran (n=387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or to read one of two intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing the risks of getting COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styled message describing the development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Results. Most respondents (60%) wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17% expressed hesitancy and 23% did not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The fact-box styled message and the timeline message did not significantly improve vaccination intentions, F(2,359)=0.91, p=.402, partial eta squared=.005, or reduce the time respondents wanted to wait before getting vaccinated, F(2,307)=0.76, p=.468, partial eta squared=.005, compared to no messages. Discussion. We did not find an impact on vaccine intention based on providing information about vaccine risks and development.

Although outbreaks have emerged amongst communities of international migrant workers worldwide, little is known about how they perceive the government's response or their exposure to rumors. Methods: Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, we surveyed 1011 low-waged migrant workers involved in dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Participants reported their confidence in the government; whether they had heard, shared, or believed widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors; and their socio-demographics. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with confidence and rumor exposure. Results: 1 in 2 participants (54.2%, 95% CI: 51.1-57.3%) reported that they believed at least one COVID-19 rumor. This incidence was higher than that observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). Nonetheless, most participants (90.0%, 95% CI: 87.6-91.5%) reported being confident that the government could control the spread of COVID-19. Age was significantly associated with belief in rumors, while educational level was associated with confidence in government. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that language and cultural differences may limit the access that migrant workers have to official COVID-19 updates. Correspondingly, public health agencies should use targeted messaging strategies to promote health knowledge within migrant worker communities.","Tan, E. Y.; Albarazi, D.; Saw, Y.

A recent U.S. study found 33% of people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) experience FI. We sought to understand the needs for those seeking assistance with food through Compass and how these needs changed due to COVID-19. CF Foundation Compass is a free, personalised case management service to help with insurance, financial, legal, and other issues PwCF are facing. Methods: We identified Compass calls between January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 related to food assistance. We reviewed whether callers had an additional need reported during the call. For 2020 calls, we also determined whether their needs could be met by community resources;2019 referral data was not available. Results: Compass received 174 requests for food assistance. Food requests almost tripled between 2019 (47) and 2020 (127). Of the 174 food requests, 60% of callers had an additional need and 38% had 2 or more additional needs. 75% of the additional needs related to other social factors including utility costs (33%), housing (27%), medical needs (13%), and car issues (5%). In 2020, half of food needs (44%) were not met by community resources. 17% of callers did not follow Compass recommendations. Conclusions: Given the unique caloric needs of PwCF, lack of food is a concern. Food access in the U.S. has been impacted by COVID-19 and community resources are scarce. People facing FI are more likely to have other social needs, such as affordable housing. CF clinicians are uniquely positioned to have sensitive conversations and address these factors to understand the need and improve quality of life for their patients. This can be accomplished by screening for social factors and collecting and evaluating the data. The CF Foundation has enhanced Compass training for responding to food inquiries and put together a Food Security Committee of clinicians and community members focused on research, education, quality improvement, and advocacy.","Clemm, C.; Stocks, A.; Reno, K.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,112,1

There are many factors that determine competitiveness, and they change with the development of globalization, and even today, under the conditions of Industry 4.0. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has also provoked a situation in which both policies to foster competitiveness need to be adapted. In order to achieve competitiveness, countries must create factors and develop policies that will create the conditions for better positioning in the global market. In order to successfully integrate into new markets, but at the same time highlight and continue economic development, reevaluation of competitiveness determinants, as well as past positioning strategies, is necessary. The paper analyses the theoretical settings and determinants of competitiveness, as well as the challenges of today that economies should respond to. Understanding new features of the competitiveness can help policymakers develop approaches for enhancing their economic performance.","Bilas, V.; Sopta, M.",Casopis Za Ekonomiju I Trzisne Komunikacije,112,1

One of the most effective measures to reduce virus transmission is partitioning students into discrete cohorts. In primary and middle schools, it is easy to create these cohorts (also known as “learning groups”), since students in each grade take the same set of required courses. However, in high schools, where there is much diversity in course preferences among individual students, it is extremely challenging to optimally partition students into cohorts to ensure that every section of a course only contains students from a single cohort. In this paper, we define the Student Cohort Partitioning Problem, where our goal is to optimally assign cohorts to students and course sections, to maximize students being enrolled in their desired courses. We solve this problem by modeling it as an integer linear program, and apply our model to generate the Master Timetable for a Canadian all-boys high school, successfully enrolling students in 87% of their desired courses, including 100% of their required courses. We conclude the paper by explaining how our model can benefit all educational institutions that need to create optimal student cohorts when designing their annual timetable. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hoshino, R.; Fabris, I.","18th International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research, CPAIOR 2021",112,1

The effect of the Coronavirus for sufferers is a disturbance in the respiratory system. Several days later, the disruption from the lung infection got worse. To identify the cause of this disease, the doctor performs a computed tomography scan and manually observes the changes that occur in the lungs through an X-ray. Image identification using machine learning is the latest trend these days to assist medical analysts. If the number of patients treated is large enough, this is very helpful in the analysis. The choice of Convolutional Neural Network is due to the many architectural algorithms being developed at this time. This method works with multiple layers. But the drawback is that the computation time for the training process takes a long time. The purposed way in this research is a custom layer using 18-34 layers. There is four class in the test, namely Normal lung conditions, COVID19, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Data augmentation is used to add variation to data. The results showed that the method offered could be used to identify pneumonia with an average identification accuracy of 98.7% - 100%. The average value of error the MSE 18-34 layer is 0.0539, RMSE 0.1981, and MAE 0.0319. The average consumption time for the training process is 2.25 seconds.

Guided by the finding that large households function as hubs for the propagation of COVID-19, we developed a data-driven individual-based epidemiological network-model to assess the intervention efficiency of targeted testing of large households. For an outbreak with reproductive numbers R between 1.1 and 2, our results suggest that the intervention effect of weekly pooled testing of the 10% largest households in an urban area is on par with the effect of imposing strict lockdown measures. By testing no more than 20% of households every 4 days, the model predicts that one can reduce R from 1.6 to below unity over a few weeks, lowering the prevalence by 75%. Pooled household testing appears to be a powerful alternative to more invasive measures as a localized early response to contain epidemic outbreaks.","Voigt, A.; Martyushenko, N.; Karlsen, E.; Hall, M.; Nyhamar, K.; Omholt, S.

Mobile health (mHealth) quickly gained recognition as a cost-effective way to deliver healthcare and provide patients with tools to manage acute and chronic illnesses in their own homes. However, despite the increasing availability of this technology, some older adults may encounter barriers to access-ing this type of care. Objective: This review aims to explore the factors that influence the adoption of mHealth among older adults. Method: A search of the existing literature was conducted using Scopus and PubMed which uncovered 3124 studies. After applying our inclusion criteria, 23 original studies were identified for review. Results: Technology adoption by older adults is multifactorial with three overarching themes, these being: (1) dispositional barriers, (2) usability features of mobile devices, and (3) social influence. Dispositional barriers including low self-efficacy and mistrust of technology lead to anxiety surrounding mHealth uptake among older adults. Furthermore, age-related physical and cognitive impairment may also impede the use of mHealth. Old-er adults who overcome these barriers rely on social support from family and healthcare providers to recognise mHealth as a potential health-optimization tool. Involving older adults in the designing process is recommended to anticipate and overcome the obstacles to mHealth adoption that are unique to this group. Conclusion: Research into technology adoption has elucidated various targets for initiatives and areas of research to improve mHealth adoption. Future research should include experi-mental models with older adults to look at interventions that enable regular and ongoing use of mHealth. Seeking input from end-users will ensure that modifications in healthcare delivery do not inadvertently disadvantage the same populations they are intended to serve. © 2021.

This has warranted the development of heparin from alternate sources such as bovine and ovine mucosa which is abundantly available for this purpose. On a mass basis, commercially available porcine heparins exhibit a similar potency (200 units/mg) to their ovine counterpart (190 units/mg) and a higher potency in contrast to their bovine counterpart (130-150 units/mg). Therefore, at gravimetric levels, the porcine heparins exhibit stronger biochemical and pharmacological effects in various laboratory assays in comparison to bovine heparin and similar effects in comparison to ovine heparins. Since heparin is standardized in biologic units and cross referenced against USP or EP Standard, it is hypothesized that potency equated porcine, ovine, and bovine heparin will exhibit similar biologic activities in laboratory assays carried out in the in vitro setting. The purpose of this study is to compare the biologic properties of the porcine, ovine, and bovine heparin at USP potency equated levels in standardized laboratory assays. Materials and Methods: Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) of porcine mucosal heparin (200 units/mg) of U.S. origin was commercially obtained from Medefil Inc. (Glendale Heights, IL). Ovine heparin was obtained from Ronnsi Pharmaceutical (Jiangsu, China). Bovine heparin (140 units/mg) was obtained from Kin Master Pharmaceuticals (Posso Fundo, Brazil). All heparins were diluted at a concentration of 100 units/mL in saline. The anticoagulant effect of all heparins were evaluated using the whole blood clotting assays such as the ACT and thromboelastographic methods. Heparins were diluted in citrated human plasma yielding a final concentration range of 0-1 unit/mL. Clot based assays such as aPTT, TT, and prothrombinase induced clotting time (PiCT) were measured. Thrombin generation inhibition assay was carried out using a kinetic assay (CAT system, Diagnositca Stago, Paris, France). Protamine and heparinase neutralization profiles of these agents were also investigated in the plasma-based systems. These assays were then repeated at gravimetric dosages at final concentrations of 0-10 ug/mL. The results collected from these trials were then mathematically converted to units and compared to the results collected from the potency adjusted trials. All results were tabulated and compared, and applicable statistical methods were applied. Results: The USP potency adjusted heparin exhibited comparable anticoagulant effects in both the ACT and TEG assays. At equigravimetric levels porcine and ovine heparins produced comparable anticoagulant effects and bovine heparin produced weaker anticoagulant effect in both assays. In the citrated plasma supplementation studies, all drugs produced similar anticoagulant effects at potency adjusted dosages. In the chromogenic anti-Xa and anti-IIa assays, the behaviors of the agents were also comparable. In the thrombin generation assays, in terms of peak thrombin generation, area under the curve, and lag time, the porcine, ovine, and bovine heparins showed comparable effects. The protamine neutralization profiles of the porcine, ovine, and bovine heparin exhibited variable assay dependent results. Potency adjusted bovine heparin required higher amount of protamine for the complete neutralization of the biologic effects in comparison to the porcine heparin. At gravimetric concentrations, bovine heparins exhibited lower potencies than both the porcine and ovine heparins, which produced similar results. Summary and Conclusion: These results show that at potency adjusted concentrations, the porcine, ovine, and bovine heparin exhibit comparable biochemical and anticoagulant responses in the plasma-based systems. Therefore, the hypothesis that potency equated porcine, ovine, and bovine heparins exhibit comparable biochemical and anticoagulant activities is validated. Thus, the proposed ap roach to standardize heparins against a common standard in a biologic assay such as the USP method is valid. Furthermore, these results warrant regulatory considerations to fast track the review process for the re-introduction of bovine heparin and approval of bovine heparin as a biosimilar anticoagulant to porcine heparin.

We assessed performance and safety of induced sputum (IS) collection in this population, embedded in a prospective study evaluating respiratory cryptosporidiosis in Malawian children with diarrheal disease. Methods We assessed sputum quality and correlation with detection of cryptosporidium, and evaluated safety and adverse events in 162 children. Results Among 159 stool specimens tested, 34 (21%, 95% CI 15.0 - 28%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. There were 160 IS and 161 nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens collected. The majority of IS specimens 122/147 (83%) were clear in appearance, and 132/147 (90%) were of good quality. Among the respiratory specimens tested, 10 (6.3%, 95% CI 2.5 - 10) IS and 4 (3% (95% CI 0 - 5)) NP were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. When stool cryptosporidium PCR was the gold standard, IS PCR sensitivity was higher (29 %, 95% CI 22 - 37) compared to NP PCR (12%, 95% CI 7 - 17) for detection of Cryptosporidium spp. One (0.4%) adverse event occurred, a drop in oxygen saturations at 30-minute post procedure evaluation. Consciousness - level, median respiratory rate and oxygen saturations were unchanged, before or after IS. Conclusions IS provides good quality specimens, is more sensitive than NP specimens for diagnosis of respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and collection can be done safely in children hospitalized with diarrheal disease.","Nyangulu, W.

After COVID-19 era, virtual science contributes remarkably to increase networking and professional collaboration across the globe. Up to our knowledge there is no data regarding global contributions to cardiology conferences in general and how COVID-19 might impact the landscape of these contributions in particular, especially in the context of contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LIC and MIC). Purpose Current analysis aimed to determine the global diversity in abstracts presented at European Heart Failure congress according to the continent and world bank class of the country of the first author. Methods Cross sectional analysis of the European Heart Failure congress abstracts published in the (European Journal of Heart Failure) in 2019 and 2020 which represented the before and during COVID-19 era respectively. The analysis was done according to the continent and world economic classification of the first authors' country. Results Total n. of abstracts analysed were 2779 with 17.6% decline rate during pandemic contributions (1634 in 2019 vs 1145 in 2020). Europe followed by Asia had the highest total abstract contributions;1701 and 740 abstracts respectively. Europe contributions proportion increased during pandemic (60.52% in 2019 to 62.18% in 2020) while Asia contributions proportion declined during pandemic (28.33% in 2019 vs 24.19% in 2020), p=0.03, see figure 1. Russia had the highest number of contributions (11.68% in 2019 vs 12.22% in 2020), this is followed by Spain (7.34% in 2019 vs 11.35% in 2020) and Portugal (5.87% in 2019 vs 11.44% in 2020). A total of 1899 (68.33%) abstracts were from high-income countries (HIC) vs 880 (31.67%) from MIC and none from LIC in the sum of both years. Contributions from MIC increased during COVID-19 era from 30.23% in 2019 to 33.71% in 2020, while contributions from HIC declined from 69.76% in 2019 to 66.28% during COVID-19 era in 2020, p=0.052, see figure 1. Conclusions About third of contributions to European Heart Failure congress were from MIC and none from LIC, however, there is modest increase of contributions from MIC during COVID-19 era which can be explained by more presentations from these countries due to feasible virtual meetings and waiving of conference fees in 2020 (HFA Discoveries Platform). Further networking and collaborations with researchers from these countries should be encouraged especially with the high cardiovascular disease burden in these countries which necessitated sharing their perspectives and experiences to decrease cardiovascular disease burden worldwide especially by using the hybrid approach and virtual science. Increasing research, travel and educational grants (especially for researchers from LIC) along with calling for action to remove other barriers like VISA issues can help to bridge the conference equity gap and achieve solidarity in science.","Dakhil, Z.",Heart,112,19

We screened six databases from their inception to January 15, 2021. Study population were neonates, infants, children and adolescents less than 18 years old with suspected or confirmed PS disease. Outcomes included sequelae types, prognostic factors, pooled death estimate and length of hospital stay (LOS) for survivors and deceased patients. Quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal checklists. Results: We screened 981 abstracts, and 24 full-text articles for final review. Septic shock was the most prevalent physical sequelae reported (13%, n=1492 patients). No functional, cognitive or neurological sequelae were reported in included studies. Meta-analysis of pooled mortality estimate was 14.6% (95%CI: 9.9 -19.4%).

METHODS A list of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities commonly used to manage knee, hip, and hand OA as well as clinical scenarios representing patients with symptomatic hand, hip, and knee OA were generated. Systematic evidence-based literature reviews were conducted by a working group at the Institute of Population Health, University of Ottawa, and updated by ACR staff to include additions to bibliographic databases through December 31, 2010. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, a formal process to rate scientific evidence and to develop recommendations that are as evidence based as possible, was used by a Technical Expert Panel comprised of various stakeholders to formulate the recommendations for the use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic modalities for OA of the hand, hip, and knee. RESULTS Both “strong” and “conditional” recommendations were made for OA management. Modalities conditionally recommended for the management of hand OA include instruction in joint protection techniques, provision of assistive devices, use of thermal modalities and trapeziometacarpal joint splints, and use of oral and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tramadol, and topical capsaicin. Nonpharmacologic modalities strongly recommended for the management of knee OA were aerobic, aquatic, and/or resistance exercises as well as weight loss for overweight patients. Nonpharmacologic modalities conditionally recommended for knee OA included medial wedge insoles for valgus knee OA, subtalar strapped lateral insoles for varus knee OA, medially directed patellar taping, manual therapy, walking aids, thermal agents, tai chi, self management programs, and psychosocial interventions. Pharmacologic modalities conditionally recommended for the initial management of patients with knee OA included acetaminophen, oral and topical NSAIDs, tramadol, and intraarticular corticosteroid injections; intraarticular hyaluronate injections, duloxetine, and opioids were conditionally recommended in patients who had an inadequate response to initial therapy. Opioid analgesics were strongly recommended in patients who were either not willing to undergo or had contraindications for total joint arthroplasty after having failed medical therapy. Recommendations for hip OA were similar to those for the management of knee OA. CONCLUSION These recommendations are based on the consensus judgment of clinical experts from a wide range of disciplines, informed by available evidence, balancing the benefits and harms of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic modalities, and incorporating their preferences and values. It is hoped that these recommendations will be utilized by health care providers involved in the management of patients with OA.","Hochberg, Marc C; Altman, Roy D; April, Karine Toupin; Benkhalti, Maria; Guyatt, Gordon; McGowan, Jessie; Towheed, Tanveer; Welch, Vivian; Wells, George; Tugwell, Peter",Arthritis care & research,112,28

The COVID-19 pandemic worsened death notification delays, thus biasing downwards the daily (cumulative) excess mortality estimates produced by MoMo. The goal of this study is to find the best model to correct these estimates for the effect of death notification delays. METHODS The process followed was: 1) estimates for the excess mortality accumulated in Spain since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic are published daily by MoMo and gathered in this study for the period 15/04/2020-25/05/2020. 2) the intensity of daily revisions is computed as the ratio of the estimate published each day divided by the estimate published the day before. 3) Adjusted excess mortality estimates result from applying to these ratios five different correcting models (a simple arithmetic mean or a weighted average, as well as linear, quadratic and cubic regressions). 4) The performance of these corrected estimates is compared with the definite values using the root mean square error (RMSE). RESULTS The intensity of daily revisions for the cumulative excess of deaths fell to 1 (no revision) as the publication date left behind the date of death. The correcting estimates based on polynomial regressions reduced the error with respect to the definite observed values by 18-25%. CONCLUSIONS To improve the validity of the daily estimates for the cumulative excess of deaths from MoMo, it is recommended to correct the notification delay of deaths using polynomial regression models estimated with data on previous revisions.","Equiza-Goñi, Juan",Revista espanola de salud publica,112,24

It is therefore important to evaluate the surgical advantages of this technique in this patient group. METHODS Between August 2010 and July 2015, 165 patients underwent RPGs at our hospital, performed by a single surgeon. Of these patients, 88 underwent reduced-port laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (RPLDG) and 77 underwent reduced-port laparoscopic total gastrectomy (RPLTG). In addition to short-term surgical outcomes after RPG, survival times and the surgical learning curve were also evaluated. RESULTS Blood losses during lymph node dissection in the RPLDG and RPLTG groups were not significantly different (p = 0.160). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in only two patients. Postoperative morbidities were observed in 14.8 % of the RPLDG group and 14.3 % of the RPLTG group, but there were no deaths. Most patients expressed high cosmetic satisfaction in both groups. In the RPLDG group, operation time during reconstruction decreased over the first 50 cases and then plateaued, as the surgeon's experience of the technique increased. In contrast, in the RPLTG group, operation times dropped with surgical experience for both lymph node dissection, plateauing after 40 cases, and for reconstruction, plateauing after 30 cases. Only three patients died of gastric cancer in the follow-up period and three patients died of other diseases. Five-year overall survival and 5-year disease-specific survival were 95.6 and 98.0 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that reduced-port gastrectomy (RPG) could be an acceptable and satisfactory procedure for treating gastric cancer for an experienced laparoscopic gastric surgeon who has sufficient previous experience of conventional laparoscopic gastrectomies.","Kunisaki, Chikara; Makino, Hirochika; Yamaguchi, Naotaka; Izumisawa, Yusuke; Miyamato, Hiroshi; Sato, Kei; Hayashi, Tsutomu; Sugano, Nobuhiro; Suzuki, Yoshihiro; Ota, Mitsuyoshi; Tsuburaya, Akira; Kimura, Jun; Takagawa, Ryo; Kosaka, Takashi; Ono, Hidetaka Andrew; Akiyama, Hirotoshi; Endo, Itaru",Surgical endoscopy,112,20

For example, for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), how is a case defined? Hubei province in China changed its case definition twice in a fortnight-from laboratory-confirmed cases to clinically-confirmed cases without laboratory tests, and back to laboratory-confirmed cases. This caused confusion in the reported number of cases. If a confirmed case requires laboratory testing, what is the population who are laboratory-tested? Due to limited laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of an emerging epidemic, only ""suspected cases"" are laboratory-tested in most countries. This will result in underdiagnosis of confirmed cases and also raises the question: how is a ""suspect case"" defined? With the passage of time and increased capability to perform laboratory tests, more people can be screened and the number of confirmed cases will increase. What are the technical considerations of laboratory testing? This includes specimen collection (variable collection methods), samples collected (upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens), time of collection in relation to course of disease, different laboratory test methods and kits (not all of which may be standardised or approved by authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration). Are approved laboratory facilities and trained manpower available, and how are test results interpreted and false-negatives excluded? These issues will affect the accuracy of disease counts, which in turn will have implications on how we mount an appropriate response to the outbreak.","Koh, David; Cunningham, Anne Catherine","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",112,1

The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and probably originated either from bats or pangolins. SARS-CoV-2 is an etiological agent of COVID-19, causing mild to severe respiratory disease which escalates to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi-organ failure. The virus was first reported from the animal market in Hunan, Hubei province of China in the month of December, 2019, and was rapidly transmitted from animal to human and human-to-human. The human-to-human transmission can occur directly or via droplets generated during coughing and sneezing. Globally, around 53.9 million cases of COVID-19 have been registered with 1.31 million confirmed deaths. The people > 60 years, persons suffering from comorbid conditions and immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. The virus primarily targets the upper and the lower respiratory tract and quickly disseminates to other organs. SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates immune signaling pathways which generate cytokine storm and leads to the acute respiratory distress syndrome and other multisystemic disorders.","Rastogi, Meghana; Pandey, Neha; Shukla, Astha; Singh, Sunit K",Respir Res,112,26

Although the overall outcome of COVID-19 was favorable in SCD children, a high rate of pediatric intensive care unit admission should be considered in managing these patients. To explain COVID-19 outcome in SCD patients, the possible benefits of hydroxyurea therapy could be considered. The obtained results should be interpreted, considering low cases from sub-Saharan people, younger age of SCD patients compared to general population, a bias toward registry of the more severe form of disease, the effect of pre-existing comorbidities with multisystem organ damage, and the role of health socio-economic determinants.","Sayad, Babak; Karimi, Mehran; Rahimi, Zohreh",Pediatr Blood Cancer,112,20

Necropsy studies are increasingly revealing underlying endothelial vasculopathies in the form of micro-haemorrhages and micro-thrombi. Intertwined with defective antiviral responses, dysregulated coagulation mechanisms, abnormal hyper-inflammatory reactions and responses, COVID-19 is disclosing a wide pathophysiological palette. An additional property in categorising the disease is the combination of tissue (e.g. neuro- and vasculo-tropism) with organ tropism, whereby the virus preferentially attacks certain organs with highly developed capillary beds, such as the lungs gastrointestinal tract, kidney and brain. These multiple clinical presentations confirm that the acute respiratory syndrome as described initially is increasingly unfolding as a more complex nosological entity, a multiorgan syndrome of systemic breadth. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19, the focus of this review, reflect this manifold nature of the disease.","Barrantes, Francisco J",Brain Behav Immun Health,112,24

While most studies tend to focus on lack of access to contraceptive information and services, and poverty as the main contributing factor to early-unintended pregnancies, the influence of sexual violence has received limited attention. Understanding the link between sexual violence and unintended pregnancy is critical towards developing a multifaceted intervention to reduce unintended pregnancies among AGYW in South Africa, a country with high teenage pregnancy rate. Thus, we estimated the magnitude of unintended pregnancy among AGYW and also examined the effect of sexual violence on unintended pregnancy. METHODS: Our study adopted a cross-sectional design, and data were obtained from AGYW in a South African university between June and November 2018. A final sample of 451 girls aged 17-24 years, selected using stratified sampling, were included in the analysis. We used adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of sexual violence on unintended pregnancy. RESULTS: The analysis shows that 41.9% of all respondents had experienced an unintended pregnancy, and 26.3% of those unintended pregnancies ended in abortions. Unintended pregnancy was higher among survivors of sexual violence (54.4%) compared to those who never experienced sexual abuse (34.3%). In the multivariable analysis, sexual violence was consistently and robustly associated with increased odds of having an unintended pregnancy (AOR:1.70; 95% CI: 1.08-2.68). CONCLUSION: Our study found a huge magnitude of unintended pregnancy among AGYW. Sexual violence is an important predictor of unintended pregnancy in this age cohort. Thus, addressing unintended pregnancies among AGYW in South Africa requires interventions that not only increase access to contraceptive information and services but also reduce sexual violence and cater for survivors.","Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Ezegbe, Henrietta Chinelo",BMC Public Health,112,15

In this study, salivary samples of COVID-19 patients collected from 6 patients with the median age of 58.5 years, ranging from 34 to 72 years (2 females and 4 males) were analyzed using an Au/fiber Bragg grating (FBG) probe decorated with GO. The probe measures the prevalence of positivity in saliva and the association between the virus density and changes to sensing elements. When the probe is immersed in patients' saliva, deviation of the detected light wavelength and intensity from healthy saliva indicate the presence of the virus and confirms infection. For a patient in the hyperinflammatory phase of desease, who has virus density of 1.2 × 108 copies/mL in saliva, the maximum wavelength shift and intensity changes after 1600 s were shown to be 1.12 nm and 2.01 dB, respectively. While for a patient in the early infection phase with 1.6 × 103 copies/mL, these values were 0.98 nm and 1.32 dB. The precise and highly sensitive FBG probe proposed in this study was found a reliable tool for quick detection of the COVID-19 virus within 10 s after exposure to patients' saliva in any stage of the disease.","Samavati, Alireza; Samavati, Zahra; Velashjerdi, M; Fauzi Ismail, Ahmad; Othman, M H D; Eisaabadi B, G; Sohaimi Abdullah, Mohd; Bolurian, Marzieh; Bolurian, Mohammadreza",Chem Eng J,112,16

However, its severe cardiotoxicity often makes it life threatening even long after DOX therapy during childhood. We recently reported interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) necessary for DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity in a p38 dependent way and, asked here for the potential of IFN-Î³ blockade to prevent DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity during tumor therapy. In our model system, mice without or with growing tumors repeatedly received DOX treatment. Simultaneous injection of anti-IFN-Î³ antibody R46-A2 with DOX to block IFN-Î³ signal efficiently protected the cardiac function of DOX treated recipients. Importantly, a single late injection of R46-A2 after DOX exposure also ameliorated DOX induced cardiac dysfunction in tumor-bearing mice. The anti-IFN-Î³ treatment did not affect the DOX-mediated tumor suppression effect and it left the main cellular immune response intact. Therefore, temporary blockade of IFN-Î³ may represent a novel strategy to ameliorate established DOX induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) or prevent its development in tumor therapy.","Ma, Pan; Qin, Yue; Cao, Hong; Erben, Ulrike; Ni, Chen; Qin, Zhihai",Biomed Pharmacother,112,29

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the keys to the entry of SARS-CoV-2. We therefore hypothesized that air pollution exposure and IPF may increase the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung alveolar region. We measured their expression levels in lung tissues of control non-IPF and IPF patients, and used murine animal models to study the deterioration of IPF caused by particulate matter (PM) and the molecular pathways involved in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: In non-IPF patients, cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were limited to human alveolar cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were largely upregulated in IPF patients, and were co-expressed by fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP-1) + lung fibroblasts in human pulmonary fibrotic tissue. In animal models, PM exposure increased the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also expressed in FSP-1+ lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and when combined with PM exposure, they were further upregulated. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis and the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 caused by PM exposure were blocked by deletion of KC, a murine homologue of IL-8, or treatment with reparixin, an inhibitor of IL-8 receptors CXCR1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity increased by air pollution exposure and underlying IPF. It can be mediated through upregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pulmonary fibroblasts, and prevented by blocking the IL-8/CXCR1/2 pathway.","Li, Hsin-Hsien; Liu, Chen-Chi; Hsu, Tien-Wei; Lin, Jiun-Han; Hsu, Jyuan-Wei; Li, Anna Fen-Yau; Yeh, Yi-Chen; Hung, Shih-Chieh; Hsu, Han-Shui",Part Fibre Toxicol,112,32

To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing distance. In this paper, we present InaudibleKey, an inaudible acoustic signal-based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic channel reciprocity, InaudibleKey exploits the acoustic channel frequency response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generating keys. InaudibleKey employs several novel technologies to significantly improve its performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed system in different real environments. Compared to state-of-the-art works, InaudibleKey improves key generation rate by 3-145 times, extends pairing distance by 3.2-44 times, and reduces information reconciliation counts by 2.5-16 times. Security analysis demonstrates that InaudibleKey is resilient to a number of malicious attacks. We also implement InaudibleKey on modern smartphones and resource-limited IoT devices. Results show that it is energy-efficient and can run on both powerful and resource-limited IoT devices without incurring excessive resource consumption.","Xu, Weitao; Li, Zhenjiang; Xue, Wanli; Yu, Xiaotong; Wei, Bo; Wang, Jia; Luo, Chengwen; Li, Wei; Zomaya, Albert Y.",,112,1

The goal of this study is to identify patient, institutional and paramedic risk factors for non-optimal resource utilization for interfacility transfers of injured adult patients transported by air ambulance to a LTC. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of adult emergent interfacility transports via Ornge with data collected on patient demographics, clinical status, sending facilities, transport details and paramedic qualifications. A logistic regression model was used to analyze data. RESULTS: 1777 injured patients undergoing transport with Ornge were analyzed with 805 of these undergoing non-optimal transport. Patients who had an optimal resource use were found to be older and mechanically ventilated. Risk factors increasing odds of non-optimal transport included patients transported from a nursing station (OR 1.94), transport with primary or advanced care paramedics (OR 6.57 and 1.44, respectively) and transport between both 0800-1700 and 1700-0000 (OR 1.40 and 1.54, respectively). The median delay to arrival to receiving facility if a patient had a non-optimal resource use was 40 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Three main risk factors were identified in this study. We believe that nursing stations as a sending facility and type of paramedics crew transporting patients resulted in non-optimal resource utilization primarily due to triage of lower acuity patients. However the timing of day is more likely to be a resource availability issue and something that can be further studied and potentially improved moving forward.","Quirion, Andrew; Ahghari, Mahvareh; Nolan, Brodie",CJEM,112,20

As COVID-19 often causes peripheral or central neurological complications, it is anticipated that a number of the chronic pain complications of COVID-19 will be neuropathic. This review first examines the most common viral infections responsible for neurological complications including neuropathic pain. These encompass herpes zoster, HIV, poliovirus, enteroviruses, and several tropical viruses. Neurological complications of COVID-19 including in particular Guillain-Barré syndrome, myelitis, and stroke are reviewed with regards to their potential risk of chronic neuropathic pain. Prospective longitudinal cohorts of patients should be implemented to evaluate the exact risk of neuropathic pain after COVID-19. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months-17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for &#8804;3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted >3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 10%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (19%, 4/21), procalcitonin (4%,1/28), liver enzyme (22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.","Wang, D; Ju, X L; Xie, F; Lu, Y; Li, F Y; Huang, H H; Fang, X L; Li, Y J; Wang, J Y; Yi, B; Yue, J X; Wang, J; Wang, L X; Li, B; Wang, Y; Qiu, B P; Zhou, Z Y; Li, K L; Sun, J H; Liu, X G; Li, G D; Wang, Y J; Cao, A H; Chen, Y N",Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,112,26

In this retrospective study, the used chest CT image dataset covered 422 subjects, including 72 confirmed COVID-19 subjects (260 studies, 30,171 images), 252 other pneumonia subjects (252 studies, 26,534 images) that contained 158 viral pneumonia subjects and 94 pulmonary tuberculosis subjects, and 98 normal subjects (98 studies, 29,838 images). In the experiment, subjects were split into training (70%), validation (15%) and testing (15%) sets. We utilized the convolutional blocks of ResNets pretrained on the public social image collections and modified the top fully connected layer to suit our task (the COVID-19 recognition). In addition, we tested the proposed method on a finegrained classification task; that is, the images of COVID-19 were further split into 3 main manifestations (ground-glass opacity with 12,924 images, consolidation with 7418 images and fibrotic streaks with 7338 images). Similarly, the data partitioning strategy of 70%-15%-15% was adopted. The best performance obtained by the pretrained ResNet50 model is 94.87% sensitivity, 88.46% specificity, 91.21% accuracy for COVID-19 versus all other groups, and an overall accuracy of 89.01% for the three-category classification in the testing set. Consistent performance was observed from the COVID-19 manifestation classification task on images basis, where the best overall accuracy of 94.08% and AUC of 0.993 were obtained by the pretrained ResNet18 (P < 0.05). All the proposed models have achieved much satisfying performance and were thus very promising in both the practical application and statistics. Transfer learning is worth for exploring to be applied in recognition and classification of COVID-19 on CT images with limited training data. It not only achieved higher sensitivity (COVID-19 vs the rest) but also took far less time than radiologists, which is expected to give the auxiliary diagnosis and reduce the workload for the radiologists.","Chen, Hongtao; Guo, Shuanshuan; Hao, Yanbin; Fang, Yijie; Fang, Zhaoxiong; Wu, Wenhao; Liu, Zhigang; Li, Shaolin",J. digit. imaging,112,21

Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains an ongoing global pandemic. It is an urgent challenge to clarify the innate recognition mechanism to control this virus. Here we show that retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) sufficiently restrains SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells in a type I/III interferon (IFN)-independent manner. RIG-I recognizes the 3' untranslated region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome via the helicase domains, but not the C-terminal domain. This new mode of RIG-I recognition does not stimulate its ATPase, thereby aborting the activation of the conventional mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein-dependent pathways, which is in accordance with lack of cytokine induction. Nevertheless, the interaction of RIG-I with the viral genome directly abrogates viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediation of the first step of replication. Consistently, genetic ablation of RIG-I allows lung cells to produce viral particles that expressed the viral spike protein. By contrast, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was restored by all-trans retinoic acid treatment through upregulation of RIG-I protein expression in primary lung cells derived from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, our findings demonstrate the distinctive role of RIG-I as a restraining factor in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells.","Yamada, Taisho; Sato, Seiichi; Sotoyama, Yuki; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Yamauchi, Hajime; Sasaki, Michihito; Takaoka, Akinori",Nat Immunol,112,20

The COV-EAT study aimed to report changes in children's and adolescents' lifestyle habits during the first COVID-19 lockdown and explore potential associations between changes of participants' lifestyle behaviors and body weight. An online survey among 397 children/adolescents and their parents across 63 municipalities in Greece was conducted in April-May 2020. Parents self-reported changes of their children's lifestyle habits and body weight, as well as sociodemographic data of their family. The present study shows that during the lockdown, children's/adolescents' sleep duration and screen time increased, while their physical activity decreased. Their consumption of fruits and fresh fruit juices, vegetables, dairy products, pasta, sweets, total snacks, and breakfast increased, while fast-food consumption decreased. Body weight increased in 35% of children/adolescents. A multiple regression analysis showed that the body weight increase was associated with increased consumption of breakfast, salty snacks, and total snacks and with decreased physical activity. The COV-EAT study revealed changes in children's and adolescents' lifestyle behaviors during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Greece.

METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted through telephonic interviews among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Jodhpur, India from 23 March to 20 July 2020. Contact history, comorbidities and tobacco and alcohol use were elicited using standard tools. RESULTS: Among 911 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, 47.5% were symptomatic, 14.1% had severe COVID-19 and 41 (4.5%) died. Older age, working outside the home, cardiac and respiratory comorbidity and alcohol use were found to increase the risk of symptomatic disease as compared with asymptomatic infection. Current tobacco smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.26 to 0.78]) but not smokeless tobacco use (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.55 to 1.19]) appeared to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease. Age &#8805;60 y and renal comorbidity were significantly associated with severe COVID-19. Age &#8805;60 y and respiratory and cardiac comorbidity were found to predispose to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent reduced risk of symptomatic COVID-19 among tobacco smokers could be due to residual confounding owing to unknown factors, while acknowledging the limitation of recall bias. Cross-protection afforded by frequent upper respiratory tract infection among tobacco smokers could explain why a similar association was not found for smokeless tobacco use, thereby being more plausible than the 'nicotinic hypothesis'.

METHODS: The data were collected at two time points through a web-based questionnaire. The first wave aimed to collect information up to one month before the implementation of the smart working. The second wave aimed to collect information about potential changes occurred after one year of smart working. RESULTS: This study showed that high demands, low control and low social support might lead to reduced well-being and less satisfaction with work, and have an effect on work engagement and work-life balance. Particularly, improving social support can moderate the negative impact of high strain on well-being, preventing work-life imbalance and risk of isolation. DISCUSSION: Findings and future perspectives are discussed to support stakeholders in defining policies and practices concerning health and wellbeing at work while preserving productivity, for a successful implementation of smart working in the public administration.","Di Tecco, Cristina; Ronchetti, Matteo; Russo, Simone; Ghelli, Monica; Rondinone, Bruna Maria; Persechino, Benedetta; Iavicoli, Sergio",Med Lav,112,23

Millions of people worldwide are already infected by this virus, and severe infection causes hyper inflammation, thus disrupting lung function, exacerbating breath difficulties, and death. Various inflammatory mediators bio-synthesized through the arachidonic acid pathway play roles in developing cytokine storms, injuring virus-infected cells. Since pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, are key brokers for physiological processes such as inflammation, fever, allergy, and pain but, their function in COVID-19 is not well defined. This study addresses eicosanoid's crucial role through the arachidonic pathway in inflammatory cascading and recommends using bioactive lipids, NSAIDs, steroids, cell phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitors, and specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) to treat COVID-19 disease.

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, an atrous convolution-based deep learning model was established for the computer-assisted diagnosis of mild COVID-19 pneumonia. The dataset included 2087 chest CT exams collected from four hospitals between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2020. The true positive rate, true negative rate, receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC) and convolutional feature map were used to evaluate the model. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning model was trained on 1538 patients and tested on an independent testing cohort of 549 patients. The overall sensitivity was 91.5% (195/213; p < 0.001, 95% CI: 89.2-93.9%), the overall specificity was 90.5% (304/336; p < 0.001, 95% CI: 88.0-92.9%) and the general AUC value was 0.955 (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ABO and Rh blood groups are associated with risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PATIENTS: All adults and children who had ABO blood group assessed between January 2007 and December 2019 and who subsequently had SARS-CoV-2 testing between 15 January and 30 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The main study outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by viral RNA polymerase chain reaction testing. A second outcome was severe COVID-19 illness or death. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and absolute risk differences (ARDs) were adjusted for demographic characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 225 556 persons were included, with a mean age of 54 years. The aRR of SARS-CoV-2 infection for O blood group versus A, AB, and B blood groups together was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.92; ARD, -3.9 per 1000 [CI, -5.4 to -2.5]).

CD4 T cell differentiation is a key determinant of protective immunity against Mtb, but it is not fully understood how host-pathogen interactions shape individual antigen-specific T cell populations and their protective capacity. Here, we investigated the immunodominant Mtb antigen, MPT70, which is upregulated in response to gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) or nutrient/oxygen deprivation of in vitro-infected macrophages. Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analyzed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1+CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination, and against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred protection similar to vaccination with ESAT-6. Together, our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells toward terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune balance in favor of the host.IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis, caused by Mtb, constitutes a global health crisis of massive proportions and the impact of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to cause a rise in tuberculosis-related deaths. Improved vaccines are therefore needed more than ever, but a lack of knowledge on protective immunity hampers their development. The present study shows that constitutively expressed antigens with high availability drive highly differentiated CD4 T cells with diminished protective capacity, which could be a survival strategy by Mtb to evade T cell immunity against key antigens. We demonstrate that immunization with such antigens can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining antigen-specific T cells in a state of low differentiation. Future vaccine strategies should therefore explore combinations of multiple highly expressed antigens and we suggest that T cell differentiation could be used as a readily measurable parameter to identify these in both preclinical and clinical studies.","Clemmensen, Helena Strand; Dube, Jean-Yves; McIntosh, Fiona; Rosenkrands, Ida; Jungersen, Gregers; Aagaard, Claus; Andersen, Peter; Behr, Marcel A; Mortensen, Rasmus",mBio (Online),112,20

Simple and rapid immunodiagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify positive cases. Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) to detect anti-SARV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum. A recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane to capture specific IgG. Mouse anti-human IgG antibody was labeled with self-assembled LNPs that served as a fluorescent reporter. A 100-µL aliquot of serum samples (1:1000 dilution) was used for this assay and the whole detection process took 10 min. The results of the validation experiment met the requirements for clinical diagnostic reagents. A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples. We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR. Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.","Chen, Zhenhua; Zhang, Zhigao; Zhai, Xiangming; Li, Yongyin; Lin, Li; Zhao, Hui; Bian, Lun; Li, Peng; Yu, Lei; Wu, Yingsong; Lin, Guanfeng",Anal Chem,112,16

With the ever-spreading of online purchasing websites, micro-blogging sites, and social media platforms, OM in online social media platforms has picked the interest of thousands of scientific researchers. Because the reviews, tweets and blogs acquired from these social media networks, act as a significant source for enhancing the decision making process. The obtained textual data (reviews, tweets, or blogs) are classified into three different class labels which are negative, neutral and positive for analyzing and extracting relevant information from the given dataset. In this contribution, we introduce an innovative MapReduce improved weighted ID3 decision tree classification approach for OM, which consists mainly of three aspects: Firstly We have used several feature extractors to efficiently detect and capture the relevant data from the given tweets, including N-grams or character-level, Bag-Of-Words, word embedding (GloVe, Word2Vec), FastText, and TF-IDF. Secondly, we have applied a multiple feature selector to reduce the high feature&#x2019;s dimensionality, including Chi-square, Gain Ratio, Information Gain, and Gini Index. Finally, we have employed the obtained features to carry out the classification task using an improved ID3 decision tree classifier, which aims to calculate the weighted information gain instead of information gain used in traditional ID3. In other words, to measure the weighted information gain for the current conditioned feature, we follow two steps: First, we compute the weighted correlation function of the current conditioned feature. Second, we multiply the obtained weighted correlation function by the information gain of this current conditioned feature. This work is implemented in a distributed environment using the Hadoop framework, with its programming framework MapReduce and its distributed file system HDFS.

RESULTS: We estimated that public sector contributions led to at least 30% reductions in COVID-19-related healthcare resource utilization. Private sector contributions to expanded diagnostic testing and treatments led to further reductions in mortality (- 44%), intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospital beds (- 30% and - 28%, respectively), and ventilator use (- 29%). The combination of lower diagnostic test sensitivity and proportions of patients self-isolating may exacerbate case numbers, and policies that encourage self-isolating should be considered.

However, critical care medicine, which is abundant with high acuity yet infrequent procedures, has not embraced 3DP as much as others. The discrepancy between the possible training or therapeutic uses of 3DP in critical care and what is currently utilized in other fields needs to be addressed. OBJECTIVE: This narrative literature review describes the uses of 3DP in critical care that have been documented. It also discusses possible future directions based on recent technological advances. METHODS: A literature search on PubMed was performed using keywords and Mesh terms for 3DP, critical care, and critical care skills. RESULTS: Our search found that 3DP use in critical care fell under the major categories of medical education (23 papers), patient care (4 papers) and clinical equipment modification (4 papers). Medical education showed the use of 3DP in bronchoscopy, congenital heart disease, cricothyroidotomy, and medical imaging. On the other hand, patient care papers discussed 3DP use in wound care, personalized splints, and patient monitoring. Clinical equipment modification papers reported the use of 3DP to modify stethoscopes and laryngoscopes to improve their performance. Notably, we found that only 13 of the 31 papers were directly produced or studied by critical care physicians. CONCLUSION: The papers discussed provide examples of the possible utilities of 3DP in critical care.

METHODS: We searched major databases and included publications of quantitative and qualitative studies in English and German on any type of research on the functional, critical and communicative domains of HL conducted in the context of the three outbreaks in the general population. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported where and when the study was conducted, the design and method used, and how HL was measured. RESULTS: 72 studies were included. Three investigated HL or explicitly referred to the concept of HL, 14 were guided by health behaviour theory. We did not find any study designed to develop or psychometrically evaluate pandemic/epidemic HL instruments, or relate pandemic/epidemic or general HL to a pandemic/epidemic outcome, or any controlled intervention study. Type of assessment of the domains of HL varied widely. CONCLUSION: Theory-driven observational studies and interventions, examining whether pandemic-related HL can be improved are needed.

METHODS: Prospective nationwide study including a consecutive cohort of liver transplant patients with Covid-19 recruited during the Spanish outbreak from February 28th to April 7th, 2020. The primary outcome was severe Covid-19, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and/or death. Age- and gender-standardized incidence and mortality ratios (SIR and SMR) were calculated using data from the Ministry of Health and the Spanish liver transplant registry. Independent predictors of severe Covid-19 among hospitalized patients were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 111 liver transplant patients were diagnosed with Covid-19 (SIR=191.2 [95%CI 190.3-192.2]). The epidemiological curve and geographic distribution overlapped widely between liver transplant and general populations. After a median follow-up of 23 days, 96 patients (86.5%) were admitted to hospital and 22 patients (19.8%) required respiratory support. Twelve patients were admitted to the ICU (10.8%). The mortality rate was 18%, being lower compared to the matched general population (SMR=95.5 [95%CI 94.2-96.8]). Thirty-five patients (31.5%) met criteria of severe Covid-19. Baseline immunosuppression containing mycophenolate was an independent predictor of severe Covid-19 (RR=3.94; 95%CI 1.59-9.74; p=0.003), particularly at doses higher than 1,000 mg/day (p=0.003). This deleterious effect was not observed with calcineurin inhibitors or everolimus and complete immunosuppression withdrawal showed no benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Being chronically immunosuppressed, liver transplant patients have an increased risk of acquiring Covid-19 but their mortality rates are lower than matched general population. Upon hospital admission, mycophenolate dose reduction or withdrawal could help in preventing severe Covid-19. However, complete immunosuppression withdrawal should be discouraged.","Colmenero, Jordi; Rodríguez-Perálvarez, Manuel; Salcedo, Magdalena; Arias-Milla, Ana; Muñoz-Serrano, Alejandro; Graus, Javier; Nuño, Javier; Gastaca, Mikel; Bustamante-Schneider, Javier; Cachero, Alba; Lladó, Laura; Caballero, Aránzazu; Fernández-Yunquera, Ainhoa; Loinaz, Carmelo; Fernández, Inmaculada; Fondevila, Constantino; Navasa, Miquel; Iñarrairaegui, Mercedes; Castells, Lluis; Pascual, Sonia; Ramírez, Pablo; Vinaixa, Carmen; González-Dieguez, María Luisa; González-Grande, Rocío; Hierro, Loreto; Nogueras, Flor; Otero, Alejandra; Álamo, José María; Blanco-Fernández, Gerardo; Fábrega, Emilio; García-Pajares, Fernando; Montero, José Luis; Tomé, Santiago; De la Rosa, Gloria; Pons, José Antonio",J. hepatol,112,20

However, 20 out of 187 countries and territories have over 2 million confirmed cases alone, a situation which calls for a critical assessment. The social distancing and preventive measures instituted across countries have a link with spread containment whereas spread containment is associated with meteorological factors. Here, we examine the effect of meteorological factors on COVID-19 health outcomes. We develop conceptual tools with dew/frost point, temperature, disaggregate temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and surface pressure against confirmed cases, deaths and recovery cases. Using novel panel estimation techniques, our results find strong evidence of causation between meteorological factors and COVID-19 outcomes. We report that high temperature and high relative humidity reduce the viability, stability, survival and transmission of COVID-19 whereas low temperature, wind speed, dew/frost point, precipitation and surface pressure prolong the activation and infectivity of the virus.

These avians apply many intelligent techniques like surprise pounce (seven kills) while they are catching their prey according to the escaping patterns of the target. The HHO simulates these hunting patterns of the hawks to obtain the best/optimal solutions to the problems. In this study, we propose a new multiobjective HHO algorithm for the solution of the well-known binary classification problem. In this multiobjective problem, we reduce the number of selected features and try to keep the accuracy prediction as maximum as possible at the same time. We propose new discrete exploration (perching) and exploitation (besiege) operators for the hunting patterns of the hawks. We calculate the prediction accuracy of the selected features with four machine learning techniques, namely, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machines, and Decision Trees. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct comprehensive experiments on many benchmark datasets retrieved from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. Moreover, we apply it to a recent real-world dataset, i.e., a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dataset.

Here, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of mouse WAT perivascular (PDGFRß+) cells, termed fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs), activate proinflammatory signalling cascades shortly after the onset of high-fat diet feeding and regulate proinflammatory macrophage accumulation in WAT in a TLR4-dependent manner. FIPs activation in obesity is mediated by the downregulation of zinc-finger protein 423 (ZFP423), identified here as a transcriptional corepressor of NF-&#954;B. ZFP423 suppresses the DNA-binding capacity of the p65 subunit of NF-&#954;B by inducing a p300-to-NuRD coregulator switch. Doxycycline-inducible expression of Zfp423 in PDGFRß+ cells suppresses inflammatory signalling in FIPs and attenuates metabolic inflammation of visceral WAT in obesity. Inducible inactivation of Zfp423 in PDGFRß+ cells increases FIP activity, exacerbates adipose macrophage accrual and promotes WAT dysfunction. These studies implicate perivascular mesenchymal cells as important regulators of chronic adipose-tissue inflammation in obesity and identify ZFP423 as a transcriptional break on NF-&#954;B signalling.","Shan, Bo; Shao, Mengle; Zhang, Qianbin; Hepler, Chelsea; Paschoal, Vivian A; Barnes, Spencer D; Vishvanath, Lavanya; An, Yu A; Jia, Lin; Malladi, Venkat S; Strand, Douglas W; Gupta, Olga T; Elmquist, Joel K; Oh, Dayoung; Gupta, Rana K",Nat Metab,112,15

Many countries, including Bangladesh, reported suicide as extreme consequences of the psychological burden influenced by COVID-19. The present study explores human stress and its factor influenced by COVID-19 in Bangladesh, which significantly affect the quality of life. METHODS: An online-based questionnaire survey was conducted among 651 adult Bangladeshi populations by capturing socio-demographic information, possible human stress, and consequences of the pandemic. A set of statistical tools such as Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), T-test, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied to identify the relationship between different factors and influential factors increasing human stress. RESULTS: More than 83% of the participants are facing COVID-19 related mental stress, which results in short temper, sleep disorder, and family chaos. PCA and HCA outcomes indicated a significant relationship between the respondents' opinions and human stress factors, which harmonized with the country's existing scenario. PCM results enlighten the relationship between human stress factors and found financial hardship, cutting back daily spending, and food crisis are interconnected together causes stress. Also, hampering students' formal education and future career plans significantly contribute to mental stress. CONCLUSION: Based on the above findings, it's crucial to introduce a time-oriented strategy and implement precaution monitoring plans for Bangladesh. The rescue plan will help people to manage the pandemic and improve mental health to fight against psychological challenges related to COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Amit, Sajid; Barua, Lumbini; Kafy, Abdulla-Al",Diabetes Metab Syndr,112,26

Methods: The study subjects were derived from the follow-up cohort of chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis who received antiviral therapy in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from February 2004 to September 2019. LC patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. The life-table method was used to calculate the incidence of liver cancer. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk factors that may affect the development of liver cancer in patients with LC. A subgroup analysis was conducted in liver cirrhotic patients who developed liver cancer to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment compliance. The (2) test was used for rate comparison. Results: The median follow-up time of 198 LC cases treated with NAs was 6.0 years (1.0-15.3 years). By the end of the visit: (1) 16.2% (32/198) of LC patients had developed liver cancer, and the cumulative incidence of liver cancer in 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years were 0, 8.9%, 14.3%, 18.6%, and 23.4%, respectively, with an average annual incidence of 3.1%. Among the 32 cases with liver cancer, 68.7% had developed small liver cancer (22/32). (2) Univariate Cox model analysis showed that the development of liver cancer was related to four factors, i.e., the presence or absence of LC nodules, whether the baseline was first-line medication, the family history of liver cancer, and patient compliance. The results of multivariate Cox model analysis showed that poor patient compliance and baseline non-first-line medication were risk factors for liver cancer. (3) The results of log-rank test subgroup analysis showed that the 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with hardened nodules was significantly higher than that of patients without hardened nodules (21.7% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.029). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with non-first-line drugs was significantly higher than that of patients with first-line drugs (22.0% vs.8.2%, P = 0.003). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with poor compliance was significantly higher than that of patients with good compliance (21.3% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.014). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with a family history of liver cancer was significantly higher than that of patients without a family history of liver cancer (22.3% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.006). (4) Compared with patients with poor compliance, patients with good compliance had higher HBV DNA negative serconversion rate (98.7% vs. 87.8%, P = 0.005), and a lower virological breakthrough rate (12.1% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.007). Conclusion: The long-term NAs antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of liver cancer, but it cannot completely prevent the development of liver cancer, especially in patients with a family history of liver cancer and baseline hardened nodules (high risk of liver cancer). Furthermore, the complete management can improve patient compliance, ensure the efficacy of antiviral therapy, and reduce the risk of liver cancer development, so to achieve secondary prevention of liver cancer, i.e., early detection, diagnosis and treatment.","Zang, W W; Su, M H; Ling, X Z; Wang, R M; Cao, B C; Wu, Y L; Deng, D L; Wei, H L; Liang, X S; Jiang, J N",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,112,24

Results: Overall, the 1009 I/Q hotel guests had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range, 33-55 years), 756 (75%) were men, 454 (45%) were Latinx, and 501 (50%) were persons experiencing sheltered (n = 295) or unsheltered (n = 206) homelessness. Overall, 463 (46%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19; 303 of 907 (33%) had comorbid medical disorders, 225 of 907 (25%) had comorbid mental health disorders, and 236 of 907 (26%) had comorbid substance use disorders. A total of 776 of 955 guests (81%) completed their I/Q hotel stay; factors most strongly associated with premature discontinuation were unsheltered homelessness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.6; P < .001) and quarantine status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; P = .001). In total, 346 of 549 patients (63%) were transferred from the county hospital; of 113 ineligible referrals, 48 patients (42%) had behavioral health needs exceeding I/Q hotel capabilities. Thirteen of the 346 patients transferred from the county hospital (4%) were readmitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, direct transfers to I/Q hotels from emergency and outpatient departments were associated with averting many hospital admissions. There was a nonsignificant decrease in the mean hospital length of stay for inpatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from 5.5 to 2.7 days from March to May 2020 (P = .11). Conclusions and Relevance: To support persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco rapidly and safely scaled a hotel-based model of I/Q that was associated with reduced strain on inpatient capacity. Strategies to improve guest retention and address behavioral health needs not met in hotel settings are intervention priorities.","Fuchs, Jonathan D; Carter, Henry Clay; Evans, Jennifer; Graham-Squire, Dave; Imbert, Elizabeth; Bloome, Jessica; Fann, Charles; Skotnes, Tobi; Sears, Jonathan; Pfeifer-Rosenblum, Rebecca; Moughamian, Alice; Eveland, Joanna; Reed, Amber; Borne, Deborah; Lee, Michele; Rosenthal, Molly; Jain, Vivek; Bobba, Naveena; Kushel, Margot; Kanzaria, Hemal K",JAMA Netw Open,112,16

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to discuss how a college of nursing at a large public university in the southeast United States has responded to the challenges of conducting research during the novel COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Seven faculty researchers at the University of South Carolina College of Nursing share their experiences in overcoming the unique challenges of conducting research due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 are presented within the context of the research process, career implications, communication, and maintaining morale. RESULTS: Fears of COVID-19 and social distancing measures have hindered participant recruitment, enrollment, and involvement in ongoing studies. Increasing virtual technology use and enhancing safety precautions have assisted researchers to overcome barriers. Scholarly writing has increased for some faculty members whose studies have been stalled by the pandemic, yet others have seen a decline due to additional personal responsibilities. The careers of faculty members across all ranks have been uniquely affected by the pandemic. With most faculty working remotely, enhanced communication strategies at the university and college have supported the research enterprise. Morale has been adversely affected, but a variety of personal and collegial efforts have helped faculty cope and preserve a sense of normalcy during this devastating pandemic. DISCUSSION: Faculty and their ability to conduct the research needed to inform clinical and public health practice have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges of conducting research during this unprecedented crisis, faculty and institutions are taking novel steps to ensure the continuity of scientific progress for improving the health and well-being of patients and populations.","Abshire, Demetrius A; McDonnell, Karen K; Donevant, Sara B; Corbett, Cynthia F; Tavakoli, Abbas S; Felder, Tisha M; Pinto, Bernardine M",Nurs. res,112,16

They adversely affect groups that have systematically experienced greater social or economic obstacles to health. Renewed efforts are needed to reduced health disparities in the United States, highlighted by the disparate impact on racial minorities during the coronavirus pandemic. Institutional or systemic patterns of racism are promoted and legitimated through accepted societal standards, and organizational processes within the field of medicine, and contribute to health disparities. Herein, we review current evidence regarding health disparities in allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, drug allergy, and primary immune deficiency disease in racial and ethnic underserved populations. Best practices to address these disparities involve addressing social determinants of health and adopting policies to improve access to specialty care and treatment for the underserved through telemedicine and community partnerships, cross-cultural provider training to reduce implicit bias, inclusion of underserved patients in research, implementation of culturally competent patient education, and recruitment and training of health care providers from underserved communities. Addressing health disparities requires a multilevel approach involving patients, health providers, local agencies, professional societies, and national governmental agencies.","Davis, Carla M; Apter, Andrea J; Casillas, Adrian; Foggs, Michael B; Louisias, Margee; Morris, Elsie C; Nanda, Anil; Nelson, Michael R; Ogbogu, Princess U; Walker-McGill, Cheryl Lynn; Wang, Julie; Perry, Tamara T",J Allergy Clin Immunol,112,16

Methods: We extracted passenger volume data for the entire global airline network, as well as the dates of the implementation of travel restrictions and the observation of the first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in each country or territory, from publicly available sources. We calculated effective distance between every airport and the city of Wuhan, China. We modelled the risk of SARS-CoV-2 importation by estimating survival probability, expressing median time of importation as a function of effective distance. We calculated the relative change in importation risk under three different hypothetical scenarios that all resulted in different passenger volumes. Findings: We identified 28 countries with imported cases of COVID-19 as at 26 February 2020. The arrival time of the virus at these countries ranged from 39 to 80 days since identification of the first case in Wuhan. Our analysis of relative change in risk indicated that strategies of reducing global passenger volume and imposing travel restrictions at a further 10 hub airports would be equally effective in reducing the risk of importation of SARS-CoV-2; however, this reduction is very limited with a close-to-zero median relative change in risk. Conclusion: The hypothetical variations in observed travel restrictions were not sufficient to prevent the global spread of SARS-CoV-2; further research should also consider travel by land and sea. Our study highlights the importance of strengthening local capacities for disease monitoring and control.","Shi, Shoi; Tanaka, Shiori; Ueno, Ryo; Gilmour, Stuart; Tanoue, Yuta; Kawashima, Takayuki; Nomura, Shuhei; Eguchi, Akifumi; Miyata, Hiroaki; Yoneoka, Daisuke",Bull World Health Organ,112,1

First, we systematically identified 47 HOFs based on the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). We then converted the HFACS framework into a Bayesian Network (BN) after determining the causalities among these factors. Finally, we applied the hybrid HFACS-BN model to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak in China by virtue of its efficacy in probability prediction and diagnosis of key risk factors, and thus to test the feasibility of the model itself.

The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence, incidence and outcomes across a range of specific CVDs among homeless individuals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using linked UK primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and validated phenotypes, we identified homeless individuals aged &#8805;16 years between 1998 and 2019, and age- and sex-matched housed controls in a 1:5 ratio. For 12 CVDs (stable angina; unstable angina; myocardial infarction; sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; unheralded coronary death; heart failure; transient ischaemic attack; ischaemic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage; peripheral arterial disease; abdominal aortic aneurysm), we estimated prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality post-diagnosis, comparing homeless and housed groups. We identified 8492 homeless individuals (32 134 matched housed individuals). Comorbidities and risk factors were more prevalent in homeless people, e.g. smoking: 78.1% vs. 48.3% and atrial fibrillation: 9.9% vs. 8.6%, P < 0.001. CVD prevalence (11.6% vs. 6.5%), incidence (14.7 vs. 8.1 per 1000 person-years), and 1-year mortality risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.08, P < 0.001] were higher, and onset was earlier (difference 4.6, 95% CI 2.8-6.3 years, P < 0.001), in homeless, compared with housed people. Homeless individuals had higher CVD incidence in all three arterial territories than housed people. CONCLUSION: CVD in homeless individuals has high prevalence, incidence, and 1-year mortality risk post-diagnosis with earlier onset, and high burden of risk factors.

The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2'-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (&#916;G), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (&#916;G = -9.8 kcal/mol) & Raltegravir (&#916;G = -7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (&#916;G = -9.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (&#916;G = -8.4 kcal/mol) for 2'-OMTase].

Subgroups by employment, distress, and previous DMHT use status had varied preferences. Of those who did not use a DMHT to cope with COVID-19, most indicated that they did not consider looking for such a tool to cope (1179/1710, 68.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite potential need for DMHTs, this study found that use of such tools remains like pre-pandemic levels. This study also found that regardless of level of distress or even past experience using an app to cope with COVID-19, it is possible to develop a COVID-19 coping app that would appeal to a majority of essential workers and unemployed persons.","Arean, Patricia; Mata-Greve, Felicia; Johnson, Morgan; Pullmann, Michael; Griffith Fillipo, Isabell; Comtois, Katherine; Friedman, Emily",,112,18

DICE is intended to generate cluster membership that may be used to categorize a population by individual risk level for a targeted outcome. Following the representation learning and clustering steps, we embed the objective function in DICE with a constraint which requires a statistically significant association between the outcome and cluster membership of learned representations. DICE further includes a neural architecture search step to maximize both the likelihood of representation learning and outcome classification accuracy with cluster membership as the predictor. To demonstrate its utility in medicine for patient risk-stratification, the performance of DICE was evaluated using two datasets with different outcome ratios extracted from real-world electronic health records. Outcomes are defined as acute kidney injury (30.4\%) among a cohort of COVID-19 patients, and discharge disposition (36.8\%) among a cohort of heart failure patients, respectively. Extensive results demonstrate that DICE has superior performance as measured by the difference in outcome distribution across clusters, Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index for clustering, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for outcome classification compared to several baseline approaches.","Huang, Yufang; Axsom, Kelly M.; Lee, John; Subramanian, Lakshminarayanan; Zhang, Yiye",,112,29

One recent contribution has even argued that risk is beginning to replace security as the defining logic of health governance and policy. Others dispute this on the basis that risk and security have always operated together in the ""securitization"" of disease. This article constitutes a theoretical intervention into this burgeoning debate. Does a stronger appreciation of risk warrant the diminishment of security? Are we looking at the ""riskification"" of health rather than ""securitization""? Or would this miss the way these two logics might be complimentary or intertwined in ways that we are yet to theorize? I argue that the global health and securitization literatures are better served by an explicit consideration of risk and security logics in interplay, or never entirely encompassed by the other, nor in complete alignment, yet never truly separate. To do this, I propose a reconceptualization of the central problem-exceptionalism-that allows for risk to be understood as a form of exceptionalist politics. I demonstrate the validity of this approach through an otherwise ""easy case"" of securitization: the US response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.","Kirk, Jessica",Int. Stud. Q.,112,9

This study seeks to explore the nature of Ghana's COVID-19 campaign, focusing on the communication strategies and the extent to which indigenous communication tools (ICTs) have been employed. Relying on document analysis, Ghana's COVID-19 campaign rarely deployed ICTs but rather paid lip service to the country's indigenous resources in public addresses to the nation. It also found that the fight against the virus metamorphosed into political campaigns making WHO's vital information subservient to images of political figures and political iconography in general.

We document large increases in demand for storable products, such as food staples and household supplies, in the days before lockdown. Households in all socio-economic groups exhibit unusually high demand pre-lockdown, but there is a clear gradient, with the largest demand spikes for wealthier households. Although stories of people purchasing extreme amounts received a lot of attention, higher aggregate demand was mainly driven by more households than usual choosing to buy storable products, with only small increases in average quantities bought on a given trip. Temporary limits on the number of units per transaction, introduced following the demand spike, are therefore unlikely to lead to the avoidance of stock-outs.","O039,; Connell, M.; de Paula, A.; Smith, K.",Fiscal Studies,112,11

During storage, RBC undergoes various biophysical and biochemical changes (commonly known as storage lesion) for which blood transfusion with ""old RBC"" shows a lot of clinical problems especially relevant to critically ill patients. Recent research on S-nitrosylation of haemoglobin to improve oxygen delivery of banked blood revealed the important role of nitric oxide (NO) in protecting storage lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we used various ""NO donating"" chemicals with different NO release dynamics and chemistries in RBC storage cocktails to test the effects of NO on storage lesion. Changes in different storage markers were evaluated after 7 days storage of pre-treated RBC. RESULTS: All the NO donors have shown protection against hemolysis. However, S-nitroso glutathione (GSNO) ranks first in shielding RBCs from storage lesion and additionally, it helps in elevating the value of 2, 3-di phosphoglycerate (2, 3-DPG), improving the RBC membrane fluidity and decreasing the adhesion towards endothelial monolayer. DISCUSSION: Present study reveals that NO released from NO donors confers protection against storage lesions of the RBC. Further, the study confirms that pre-treatment with GSNO, a NO donor and a nitrosylating agent, ensures the best protection to RBC during low temperature storage, when compared to other NO donor treatments.","Sengupta, P; Mahalakshmi, V; Stebin, J J; Ganesh, S; Suganya, N; Chatterjee, S",Transfus. clin. biol,112,1

274599,274599,274599,No evidence for distinct types in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2,10.4116,9.606069,2020,"BACKGROUND: Age-related vision impairments and dementia both become more prevalent with increasing age. Research into the mechanisms of these conditions has proposed that some of their causes (eg, macular degeneration/glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease) could be symptoms of an underlying common cause. Research into sensory-cognitive aging has provided data that sensory decline may be linked to the progression of dementia through reduced sensory stimulation. While hearing loss rehabilitation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning, there are no data available on whether low vision rehabilitation, specifically for reading, could have a beneficial effect on cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: The research questions are: (1) Does low vision rehabilitation reduce reading effort? (2) If so, does reduced reading effort increase reading activity, and (3) If so, does increased reading activity improve cognitive functioning? The primary objective is to evaluate cognition before, as well as at 6 months and 12 months after, 3 weeks of low vision reading rehabilitation using magnification in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, with or without coexisting hearing impairments. We hypothesize that improvements postrehab will be observed at 6 months and maintained at 12 months for participants with vision loss and less so for those with dual sensory loss. The secondary objective is to correlate participant characteristics with all cognitive outcomes to identify which may play an important role in reading rehabilitation. METHODS: We employ a quasiexperimental approach (nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study). A 3x3 design (3 groups x 3 time points) allows us to examine whether cognitive performance will change before and after 6 months and 12 months of a low vision reading intervention, when comparing 75 low vision and 75 dual sensory impaired (vision & hearing) participants to 75 age-matched healthy controls. The study includes outcome measures of vision (eg, reading acuity and speed), cognition (eg, short-term and long-term memory, processing speed), participant descriptors, demographics, and clinical data (eg, speech perception in noise, mental health). RESULTS: The study has received approval, and recruitment began on April 24, 2019. As of March 4, 2021, 38 low vision and 7 control participants have been enrolled. Lockdown forced a pause in recruitment, which will recommence once the COVID-19 crisis has reached a point where face-to-face data collection with older adults becomes feasible again. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of protective effects caused by reading rehabilitation will have a considerable impact on the vision rehabilitation community and their clients as well as all professionals involved in the care of older adults with or without dementia. If we demonstrate that reading rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on cognition, the demand for rehabilitation services will increase, potentially preventing cognitive decline across groups of older adults at risk of developing macular degeneration.

This paper explores how different types of places--activity spaces at micro-level and human settlements at macro-level--impact the transmission of infections using evidences from COVID-19. We examine eleven types of activity spaces and find heterogeneous impacts across countries, yet we also find that non-essential activity spaces tend to have larger impacts than essential ones. Contrary to common beliefs, settlement size and density are not positively associated with reproduction numbers. Further, the impacts of closing activity spaces vary with settlement types and are consistently lower in larger settlements in all sample countries, suggesting more complex pattern of virus transmission in large settlements. This work takes first steps in systematically evaluating the epistemological risks of places at multiple scales, which contributes to knowledge in urban resilience, health and livability. TeaserActivity spaces and human settlement characteristics impact the spread of epidemics in multiple ways and should be considered in policy making.","Liu, Lun; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Zhu; Zhang, Weiyi; Zhuang, Shengsheng; Lv, Tingmiao; Chio, Chi-on; Wang, Yifan; Dao, Rina; Tang, Chuchang; Ao-Ieong, On-Ieng",,112,15

Since containment measures have disrupted many data collection and research efforts, studies have had to rely on existing data or design new approaches to gathering relevant information. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the literature that has been produced on children's exposure to violence during the pandemic to understand emerging patterns and critically appraise methodologies to help inform the design of future studies. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed a search of working papers, technical reports, and journal articles. METHODS: The search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and reports published between March 1 and December 31, 2020. The sources were assessed according to scope and study design. RESULTS: The review identified 48 recent working papers, technical reports, and journal articles on the impact of COVID-19 on violence against children. In terms of scope and methods, the review led to three main findings: 1) Studies have focused on physical or psychological violence at home and less attention has been paid to other forms of violence against children, 2) most studies have relied on administrative records, while other data sources, such as surveys or big data, were less commonly employed, and 3) different definitions and study designs were used to gather data directly, resulting in findings that are hardly generalizable. With respect to children's experience of violence, the review led to four main findings: 1) Studies found a decrease in police reports and referrals to child protective services, 2) mixed results were found with respect to the number of calls to police or domestic violence helplines, 3) articles showed an increase in child abuse-related injuries treated in hospitals, and 4) surveys reported an increase in family violence. CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the persistent challenges affecting the availability and quality of data on violence against children, including the absence of standards for measuring this sensitive issue as well as the limited availability of baseline data. Future research on COVID-19 and violence against children should address some of the gaps identified in this review.","Cappa, Claudia; Jijon, Isabel",Child Abuse Negl,112,1

More worrisome, some may be experiencing early signs or symptoms, yet they are not seeking evaluation, treatment or surveillance examinations. The long-term impact of this on patients, families and health care providers will be substantial. Not only will this strain sophisticated health systems in developed countries, but it will also overwhelm the health care infrastructure in developing countries. Health-care executives, cancer center directors, oncologists and policy experts should focus now on serving this potential ""third wave"" of sick patients who have delayed treatment.

One of the major remittance sources for Bangladesh is its migrant workers who are required to receive mRNA vaccines to return to their jobs. Despite reports of higher efficacy of mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, breakthrough infection cases are arising especially with the emergence of Delta variant. It is highly important to understand the post-vaccination immune response and breakthrough infections in different populations so that the necessity of booster dosage can be assessed properly. MethodsWe observed post BNT162b2 full vaccination immune response in a small older group (mean age= 59.5{+/-}5.44 years) of migrant workers (n=10) for six months at the Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The plasma samples from the participants were collected after 14 days, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, and 6 months of receiving the 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Anti S1 RBD IgG responses were measured as optical density ratios using a commercially available ELISA kit. ResultsAll 10 of the participants were male migrant workers and none of them had a history of previous COVID-19 infection. The median antibody response [IQ1:IQ3] was 9.05 [7.53; 10.0] on day 14 then it increases to 13.6 [12.0; 14.0] at the second month which gradually decreased to a median of 8.63 [8.34; 9.37] on the 6th-month post-vaccination. There were two breakthrough infection cases after receiving the second dose and the antibody responses were highly increased in the following months. Two of the breakthrough cases were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 as the symptom duration was less than 3 days with no respiratory complications and no hospital admission were required. ConclusionsThe BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine produces a strong immune response that sustains at least 6 months after getting fully vaccinated. But even after getting fully vaccinated people are susceptible to breakthrough infections that are not severe and boost the immune response greatly offering a hybrid immunity from both vaccine and natural infection. Hence, it is still important to fully vaccinate a greater number of people rather than thinking of offering booster dosage to a privileged population out of the fear of breakthrough cases. If the LMICs can quickly cover at least 80% of their population with usual priority targets (healthcare workers, migrant workers, older people, etc.) then a global risk reduction and pandemic control would be possible that will allow additional variant-specific boosters for targeted populations if evidence support.","Hoque, Ashraful; Rahman, Md Marufur; Das, Anindita",,112,16

Following a U.K. national lockdown from March 20, 2020, we studied business practices and behaviors in licensed premises to inform COVID-19 policies. To our knowledge, no previous study worldwide has examined these issues. METHOD: Before premises reopened in Scotland, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews (May-June 2020) with participants from hospitality trade associations, licensed premises, or in related roles (n = 18). Interviews focused on anticipated business practices and challenges relevant to minimizing COVID-19 transmission. Following reopening (July-August 2020), we conducted observations of relevant practices and behaviors in 29 bars purposively sampled for diversity, using a structured schedule. Interviews and observation reports were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Interviewees generally sought clarity, flexibility, and balance in government guidance on reopening, and they cited commercial and practical challenges to doing so safely. Alcohol consumption was perceived as an additional but potentially manageable challenge. Most observed premises had made physical and operational modifications; however, practices were variable. Observed incidents of concern included close physical interaction between customers and with staff, frequently featuring alcohol intoxication and rarely effectively stopped by staff. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the efforts of bar operators and guidance from government, potentially significant risks of COVID-19 transmission persisted in a substantial minority of observed bars, especially when customers were intoxicated.","Fitzgerald, Niamh; Uny, Isabelle; Brown, Ashley; Eadie, Douglas; Ford, Allison; Lewsey, Jim; Stead, Martine",J Stud Alcohol Drugs,112,30

Thromboembolic events have a higher incidence among patients with COVID-19, but there are few reports on the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline (PubMed), the Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for case-control studies that included data on vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 and were published in English, between January 1 and July 25, 2020. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the included data were confirmed, the prognoses of patients with and without concurrent thromboembolic events were compared, and the odds ratio (OR) was used as the effect size. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (2,030 patients) were included. Thromboembolic events complicated a total of 609 COVID-19 patients. The combined OR of the mortality of COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic events was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.13-3.27), that of ICU treatment rate was 2.63 (95% CI: 1.49-4.67), and that of treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.14 (95% CI: 1.97-5.02). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with COVID-19 patients with and without thromboembolism, the mortality, ICU treatment rate, and invasive mechanical ventilation treatment rate of COVID-19 patients with thromboembolism were found to be increased significantly, and the prognosis was worse.","Wang, C; Zhang, H; Zhou, M; Cheng, Y; Ye, L; Chen, J; Wang, M; Feng, Z",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,112,11

DesignUnblinded randomized clinical trial of two nasal irrigation protocols in outpatients PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, nested in a prospective case:cohort using laboratory-confirmed cases in the CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance dataset. SettingSingle-lab community testing facility associated with the emergency department (ED) in Augusta, GA. ParticipantsA consecutive sample of outpatients 55 years and older were contacted from daily COVID-19+ lab reports between September 24 and December 21 of 2020. Patients without supplemental oxygen use or cognitive barriers agreeing to same-day irrigation initiation were remotely consented. Among 826 screened, 321 were unable to be reached, 132 were ineligible, 294 refused participation, and 79 participants were enrolled. InterventionsParticipants were randomly assigned adding 2.5 mL povidone-iodine 10% or 2.5 mL sodium bicarbonate to 240ml of isotonic nasal irrigation twice daily for 14 days. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was hospitalization or death from COVID-19 within 28 days of enrollment by daily self-report confirmed with phone calls and hospital records, compared to the CDC Surveillance Dataset covering the same time. Secondary outcomes compared symptom resolution by irrigant additive. ResultsSeventy-nine participants were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 64 [8] years; 36 [46%] women; 71% Non-Hispanic White). Analyzed by intention-to-treat, by day 28, COVID-19 symptoms resulted in 1/42 hospitalizations in those irrigating with alkalinization, 0/37 in the povidone-iodine group, (1.27%) and no deaths. Of nearly three million CDC cases, 9.14% were known to be hospitalized, with an additional 1.5% mortality in those without hospitalization data. The total risk of hospitalization or death (10.6%) was 8.4 times that of enrolled patients (SE=2.74; P=.006). 62 completed daily surveys (78%), averaging 1.8 irrigations/day. Eleven had irrigation complaints, and four discontinued. There were no significant differences by additive.

Resveratrol has been widely studied for several of its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and anti-oxidative effects. The regulation of SIRT-1 is thought to be related to the effects of resveratrol. As a downstream component of SIRT-1, NF-&#954;B is one of the important signaling pathways that regulate the inflammatory response. Herein, we explored how treatment with resveratrol promoted recovery of motor function after SCI by activating the SIRT-1/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway and inhibiting inflammation in rat models. Recovery of hind limb function was observed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale at different time points after SCI. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, Nissl staining and HE staining were utilized to observe the morphological characteristics of spinal cord tissue, as well as the expression of SIRT-1, NF-&#954;B, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Resveratrol treatment promoted motor function recovery, increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and reduced loss of motor neurons and lesion size among rats after SCI. Meanwhile, inflammatory response was inhibited as the SIRT-1/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway was modulated. These results suggest that resveratrol can help achieve neuroprotective effect by inhibiting inflammation, regulated by the SIRT-1/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway.","Zhao, Haosen; Mei, Xifan; Yang, Dongfang; Tu, Guanjun",Neurosci Lett,112,16

Occasionally, a transitional psoas is encountered at L4/5 and has been postulated to be a contraindication to transpsoas LLIF. A case series of patients with transitional psoas who underwent L4/5 LLIFs is presented. METHODS: This retrospective review assessed 79 consecutive patients who underwent L4/5 LLIF during a 24-month period. Preoperative imaging was reviewed, and patients were classified into 2 groups: normal psoas or transitional psoas. Intraoperative features and outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients underwent L4/5 LLIFs, of whom 23 had transitional psoas anatomy and 56 had normal psoas anatomy. Among patients with transitional psoas, the center of the psoas was a mean (range) of 11.2 (5.2-26.6) mm in front of the center of the vertebral body compared with 2.0 (0-4) mm in the normal psoas group. The mean (range) retraction time was similar between groups (10.8 [6.7-14.9] minutes in the TP group versus 11.0 [7.8-15.0] minutes in the NP group). No permanent motor injuries occurred in either group, and no differences in length of stay or preoperative or postoperative Oswestry Disability Index scores were found between the groups. The protocol for L4/5 LLIF in patients with transitional psoas anatomy is described. CONCLUSIONS: Transitional psoas anatomy is frequently encountered in surgical candidates for L4/5 LLIF. Through careful identification of the lumbar plexus and judicious retraction, the transpsoas LLIF can safely be performed in these patients.","Ohiorhenuan, Ifije E; Martirosyan, Nikolay L; Wewel, Joshua T; Sagar, Soumya; Uribe, Juan S",World neurosurgery (Online),112,1

Here, we investigated the clinical course and management of hospitalized moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients. The medical records and follow-up data were analyzed from the SARS-CoV-2 patients outside Wuhan. A total of 73 moderate patients (38 men, 35 women) were included, with median age of 47.0 (38.5-57.5) years. Among them, only one patient (1.4%) died using active treatment to improve symptoms. The median duration of the four main symptoms cough, fever, chest tightness, and fatigue were 11.0, 8.0, 11.0, and 7.0 days, respectively; the median duration of the positive nucleic acid test (NAT) results for SARS-CoV-2 was 16.5 days; the median hospitalization time was 25.0 days in 72 moderate survivors. The duration of cough and fever was positively correlated with the duration of the positive NAT results. On admission, 50% had lymphopenia; less than 30% had abnormal blood biochemistry findings involving hyperglycemia, liver function and myocardial enzymes. At discharge, the laboratory indexes were substantially improved. Two weeks after discharge, 5.6% survivors experienced a recurrence of the positive NAT results. Moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients have a good prognosis by the active treatment. A small proportion of the recovered moderate patients still may be virus carriers and require an additional round of viral detection.","Peng, Xiaojuan; Liu, Qi; Chen, Zhaolin; Wen, Guiyan; Li, Qing; Chen, Yanfang; Xiong, Jie; Meng, Xinzhou; Ding, Yuanjin; Shi, Ying; Tang, Shaohui",PLoS One,112,3

We conducted 437 paired readings in 34 LUS evaluations of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. The LUS scans were performed on the same day with a standard high-end ultrasound scanner (Venue GO, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and a pocket-sized ultrasound scanner (Butterfly iQ, Butterfly Network Inc., Guilford, CT, USA). Fourteen scans were performed on individuals with severe cases, 11 on individuals with moderate cases and nine on individuals with mild cases.

In each case, activating the receptor lowers IOP, but CB1 receptors are found both at sites of aqueous humor inflow and outflow. As such, knockout mice for any of these receptors would be expected to have higher-than average, or at least unchanged, intraocular pressure. The current study investigates the unexpected observation that CB1 knockout mice have lower pressure than wild type counterparts by testing various regulators of cannabinoid signaling in murine models of IOP. We now report that a CB1 antagonist has differential effects on IOP: SR141716 raises IOP in standard light cycle (SLC) but lowers IOP in reverse light cycle (RLC). This is mimicked by ABD1085, a negative allosteric modulator of CB1. CB1 inhibitors lower IOP in both normotensive and hypertensive mouse eyes. The pressure-lowering effect is absent in CB1 knockout mice. IOP rebounds after the end of treatment but shows no sign of desensitization with daily treatment for a week. Unlike the positive cannabinoid effect, antagonist effects are not sex-dependent. We propose that there are two mechanisms of action for CB1, one that lowers IOP upon activation and a second with inverse sign that lowers IOP when CB1 is antagonized. The relatively lower pressure in CB1 knockout mouse eyes suggests that this second negative regulation of IOP is dominant.","Miller, Sally; Daily, Laura; Ploss, Maya; Greig, Iain; Ross, Ruth; Rayana, Naga Pradeep; Dai, Jiannong; Sugali, Chenna Kesavulu; Mao, Weiming; Straiker, Alex",Exp Eye Res,112,16

This virus has spread worldwide, with over 16 million cases and over 650,000 deaths. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in significant impact on the livelihoods of the British public and has had implications for healthcare delivery. The cancellation of elective procedures is likely to affect Oral Surgery specialty training. This paper aims to ascertain the extent of any impact of COVID-19 on Oral Surgery specialty training. Material and Methods: A survey was created for Oral Surgery specialty trainees in the UK. A variety of questions were used, including multiple choice, yes/no, Likert scales and free text answers. All questions were related to the impact of COVID-19 on training. Results: A total of 34 full responses were recorded. Results showed that COVID-19 has had an immense impact on Oral Surgery training, with most trainees recording high anxiety levels regarding the future of their training. The overall experience of most trainees involved a reduction in logbook procedures, cancelled study days, courses or conferences. Conclusion: Though oral surgery training has been deficient during this period, some trainees reported positive experiences while redeployed in other fields or specialties. In addition, we highlight the significant effect on trainees' mental health. Most trainees suggested a training period extension to remedy deficiencies. From this paper, we identify the wide-ranging effects of the pandemic, and Oral Surgery trainees now await decisions on the future of specialty training.","Aulakh, Gurnam; Wanis, Christine; Wilson, Gavin; Moore, Richard",,112,21

Here, we used diagnostic leukapheresis (DLA) to enrich CTCs from patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) and explored whether organoids provide a platform for ex vivo treatment modelling. METHODS: We prospectively screened 102 patients with mPCa and performed DLA in 40 patients with &#8805;5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood. We enriched CTCs from DLA using white blood cell (WBC) depletion alone or combined with EpCAM selection. The enriched CTC samples were cultured in 3D to obtain organoids and used for downstream analyses. RESULTS: The DLA procedure resulted in a median yield of 5312 CTCs as compared with 22 CTCs in 7.5 mL of blood. Using WBC depletion, we recovered 46% of the CTCs, which reduced to 12% with subsequent EpCAM selection. From the isolated and enriched CTC samples, organoid expansion succeeded in 35%. Successful organoid cultures contained significantly higher CTC numbers at initiation. Moreover, we performed treatment modelling in one organoid cell line and identified substantial tumour heterogeneity in CTCs using single cell DNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: DLA is an efficient method to enrich CTCs, although the modest success rate of culturing CTCs precludes large scale clinical application. Our data do suggest that DLA and subsequent processing provides a rich source of viable tumour cells. Therefore, DLA offers a promising alternative to biopsy procedures to obtain sufficient number of tumour cells to study sequential samples in patients with mPCa.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes according to age categories. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 6,314 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February and June 30 2020, and follow-up recorded until 30 September 2020, in the Paris metropolitan area, France. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS: Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (HR 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 in those with diabetes. In direct comparison between patients with and without diabetes, diabetes-associated risk was inversely proportional to age, highest in <50 and similar after 70 years. Similarly, mortality was higher in patients with diabetes (26%) than in those without diabetes (22%, p<0.001), but adjusted HR for diabetes was significant only in patients under 50 (HR 1.81 [1.14-2.87]).

Complement is also part of the innate immune system, protecting the host by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, complement is multifunctional far beyond infectious defense. It contributes to organ development, such as sculpting neuron synapses, promoting tissue regeneration and repair, and rapidly engaging and synergizing with a number of processes, including hemostasis leading to thromboinflammation. Complement is a double-edged sword. Although it usually protects the host, it may cause tissue damage when dysregulated or overactivated, such as in the systemic inflammatory reaction seen in trauma and sepsis and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage-associated molecular patterns generated during ischemia-reperfusion injuries (myocardial infarction, stroke, and transplant dysfunction) and in chronic neurologic and rheumatic disease activate complement, thereby increasing damaging inflammation. Despite the long list of diseases with potential for ameliorating complement modulation, only a few rare diseases are approved for clinical treatment targeting complement. Those currently being efficiently treated include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Rare diseases, unfortunately, preclude robust clinical trials. The increasing evidence for complement as a pathogenetic driver in many more common diseases suggests an opportunity for future complement therapy, which, however, requires robust clinical trials; one ongoing example is COVID-19 disease. The current review aims to discuss complement in disease pathogenesis and discuss future pharmacological strategies to treat these diseases with complement-targeted therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The complement system is the host's defense friend by protecting it from invading pathogens, promoting tissue repair, and maintaining homeostasis. Complement is a double-edged sword, since when dysregulated or overactivated it becomes the host's enemy, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and, in worst case, death. A number of acute and chronic diseases are candidates for pharmacological treatment to avoid complement-dependent damage, ranging from the well established treatment for rare diseases to possible future treatment of large patient groups like the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019.","Garred, Peter; Tenner, Andrea J; Mollnes, Tom E",Pharmacol Rev,112,29

METHODS: The CORONADO initiative is a French nationwide multicentre study of patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 with a 28-day follow-up. The patients were screened after hospital admission from 10 March to 10 April 2020. We mainly focused on hospital discharge and death within 28 days. RESULTS: We included 2796 participants: 63.7% men, mean age 69.7 ± 13.2 years, median BMI (25th-75th percentile) 28.4 (25.0-32.4) kg/m2. Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 44.2% and 38.6% of participants, respectively. Within 28 days, 1404 (50.2%; 95% CI 48.3%, 52.1%) were discharged from hospital with a median duration of hospital stay of 9 (5-14) days, while 577 participants died (20.6%; 95% CI 19.2%, 22.2%). In multivariable models, younger age, routine metformin therapy and longer symptom duration on admission were positively associated with discharge. History of microvascular complications, anticoagulant routine therapy, dyspnoea on admission, and higher aspartate aminotransferase, white cell count and C-reactive protein levels were associated with a reduced chance of discharge. Factors associated with death within 28 days mirrored those associated with discharge, and also included routine treatment by insulin and statin as deleterious factors.

A recent study revealed COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) is responsible for the proteolytic mutation of this virus and is essential for its life cycle. Thus inhibition of this protease will eventually lead to the destruction of this virus. In-Silico Molecular docking was performed with the Native ligand and the 15 flavonoid based phytochemicals of Calendula officinals to check their binding affinity towards the COVID-19 main protease. Finally, the top 3 compounds with the highest affinity have been chosen for molecular dynamics simulation to analyses their dynamic properties and conformational flexibility or stability. In-Silico Docking showed that major phytochemicals of Calendula officinals i.e. rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O-ß-D, calendoflaside, narcissin, calendulaglycoside B, calenduloside, calendoflavoside have better binding energy than the native ligand (inhibitor N3). MD simulation of 100 ns revealed that all the protease-ligand docked complexes are overall stable as compare to Mpro-native ligand (inhibitor N3) complex. Overall, rutin and caledoflaside showed better stability, compactness, and flexibility. Our in silico (Virtual molecular docking and Molecular dynamics simulation) studies pointed out that flavonoid based phytochemicals of calendula (rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O-ß-D, calendoflaside) may be highly effective for inhibiting Mpro which is the main protease for SARS-CoV-2 causing the deadly disease COVID-19. Rutin is already used as a drug and the other two compounds can be made available for future use.

Recent cancer research is now utilizing the medicinal chemistry toolbox to tailor novel 'smart' carrier systems that can reduce the major limitations of chemotherapy ranging from non-specificity and ubiquitous biodistribution to systemic toxicity. In this aspect, various stimuli-responsive polymers have gained considerable interest due to their intrinsic tumor targeting properties. Among these polymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) has been chemically modified to tune its thermoresponsivity or even copolymerized to endow new stimulus responsiveness for enhancing tumor targeting. Herein, we set our design rationale to impart additional active targeting entity to pH/temperature-responsive PNIPAM-based polymer for more efficient controlled payloads accumulation at the tumor through cellular internalization via synthesizing novel ""super intelligent"" lactoferrin conjugated PNIPAM-acrylic acid (LF-PNIPAM-co-AA) copolymer. The synthesized copolymer was physicochemically characterized and evaluated as a smart nanocarrier for targeting breast cancer. In this regard, Honokiol (HK) was utilized as a model anticancer drug and encapsulated in the nanoparticles to overcome its lipophilic nature and allow its parenteral administration, for achieving sustainable drug release with targeting action. Results showed that the developed HK-loaded LF-PNIPAM-co-AA nanohydrogels displayed high drug loading capacity reaching to 18.65 wt.% with excellent physical and serum stability. Moreover, the prepared HK-loaded nanohydrogels exhibited efficient in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. In vivo, HK-loaded nanohydrogels demonstrated suppression of VEGF-1 and Ki-67 expression levels, besides inducing apoptosis through upregulating the expression level of active caspase-3 in breast cancer-bearing mice. Overall, the developed nanohydrogels (NGs) with pH and temperature responsivity provide a promising nanocarrier for anticancer treatment.","Metawea, Osama R M; Abdelmoneem, Mona A; Haiba, Nesreen Saied; Khalil, Hosam H; Teleb, Mohamed; Elzoghby, Ahmed O; Khafaga, Asmaa F; Noreldin, Ahmed E; Albericio, Fernando; Khattab, Sherine N",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,112,23

To obtain such structural information, we present DeepTracer, a fully automated deep learning-based method for fast de novo multichain protein complex structure determination from high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps. We applied DeepTracer on a previously published set of 476 raw experimental cryo-EM maps and compared the results with a current state of the art method. The residue coverage increased by over 30% using DeepTracer, and the rmsd value improved from 1.29 Å to 1.18 Å. Additionally, we applied DeepTracer on a set of 62 coronavirus-related cryo-EM maps, among them 10 with no deposited structure available in EMDataResource. We observed an average residue match of 84% with the deposited structures and an average rmsd of 0.93 Å. Additional tests with related methods further exemplify DeepTracer's competitive accuracy and efficiency of structure modeling.

In recent years, it has become clear that hospitalization and critical illness bestow an increased VTE risk in pediatrics and relate to mortality and life-limiting comorbidities. For critically ill children, reported rates of VTE vary by study sampling techniques, presence of inherited or acquired thrombophilia, acute and chronic immobility, underlying illness prompting hospitalization, and clinical factors related to illness severity such as central venous catheterization, length of stay, mechanical ventilation, and patient age. Accordingly, critically ill children with new signs of venous congestion, acute inflammation, or unexplained acute organ dysfunction should be routinely evaluated for VTE. This narrative review summarizes recent and historical literature regarding risk factors, prevention, presentation, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in critically ill children. In addition, we identify knowledge gaps and priorities for future collaborative research on this vital condition. Special attention is given to the clinical trial opportunities, challenges, and ongoing efforts in thromboprophylaxis in critically ill children, including those hospitalized for disease related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and multisystem inflammatory disease in children.","Sochet, Anthony A; Kiskaddon, Amy; Betensky, Marisol; Goldenberg, Neil",Semin. thromb. hemost,112,22

METHODS: This was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms randomly assigned to treatment (n = 200) and placebo (n = 200) groups. The primary outcome was duration from treatment to clinical recovery. Secondary outcomes were disease progression and persistent COVID-19 positivity by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Among 556 screened patients, 400 were enrolled and 363 completed follow-up. The mean patient age was 40 years, and 59% were men. The median recovery time was 7 (4-10, treatment group) and 9 (5-12, placebo group) days (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.90). The number of patients with a &#8804;7-day recovery was 61% (treatment group) and 44% (placebo groups) (hazard ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.09).

One-third of participants were at risk for the development of clinically elevated peritraumatic distress. The perception of risk, fear of COVID-19, and stigma were significantly associated with elevated levels of distress. Individuals who had poor health, or who spent more than 1 h per day using the media, also expressed a higher level of distress. Moreover, the level of disruption of daily life and financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with a higher level of peritraumatic distress.

Additionally, nurses are at a high risk due to their working within close proximity to COVID-19 patients. As a result, they experience increased job stress. Objective: To explore the current situation and influencing factors of job stress among clinical first-line nurses fighting COVID-19. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to conduct a questionnaire survey with 110 nurses who were on the clinical frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic in a hospital in Wuhan. Results: The job stress scores of clinical nurses on the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic were collected (91.42 ± 26.09); the dimensions of work environment and resources as well as workload and time pressure were ranked first and second, respectively. The results of a multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that working hours per day, service years, number of night shifts per week, and level of academic qualification were the main factors affecting the job stress levels of nursing staff. Conclusions: The job stress of nurses on the clinical frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic was found to be at a medium level. Nursing leaders and hospital managers should pay attention to the impact of job stress on frontline nurses, while taking positive and effective measures aimed at eliminating the source of nursing work pressures to stabilize their nursing teams and promote their work in the fight against this epidemic.","Zhan, Yufang; Ma, Shuang; Jian, Xiangdong; Cao, Yingjuan; Zhan, Xiangqiao",Front Public Health,112,1

The PDB files of the target proteins and prepared herbal compounds (ligands) were subjected for docking to AutoDock Vina using UCSF Chimera, which provides a list of potential complexes based on the criteria of form complementarity of the natural compound with their binding affinities. The results of molecular docking revealed that Taxol, Rutin, Genkwanine, and Luteolin-glucoside have a high affinity with ACE2 and 3CLpro. Therefore, these natural compounds can have 2 effects at once, inhibiting 3CLpro and preventing recognition between the virus and ACE2.

However, consequences include a decline in mental and physical health, decompensation, and a sense of hopelessness among residents. We present and explore a case study at an assisted living facility addressing the ethical issues in balancing the management of the community versus the resident's right to autonomy and self-determination. A team of palliative care experts was brought into assisted living facilities to manage patients, care for well residents, and provide input in advance care planning and symptom management. The principles of self-determination and autonomy, stewardship, and distributive justice were explored. The use of nursing skills in triage and assessment, principles in public health, and the 8 domains of palliative care provided a comprehensive framework for structuring emergency operations. Palliative interventions and the role of palliative care nurses played an integral part in addressing ethical challenges in the containment of the virus and the deleterious effects of social isolation among the elderly.","Parekh de Campos, Amisha; Daniels, Susan",J Hosp Palliat Nurs,112,6

People have had to resort to virtual events, with a subsequent proliferation of webinars, online meetings, and digital resources. In this situation we have had to find new ways of measuring the impact of these activities. Using the activities of the Italian Lichen Society (Società Lichenologica Italiana, SLI), Google Trends and colleagues' contributions, we evaluated the performances and impacts of virtual tools on lichenological literacy. We compared the relative success of virtual and in-person events and the effort required; we evaluated followers' appreciation of various categories of posts on SLI Facebook page; and designed a questionnaire to collate information on individual experiences of in-person and virtual events linked to lichens. As expected, online events generally required less effort to put together and deploy than in-person events and engaged more people, especially when recorded and made available online for a long time. Using online searches for the word ""lichens"" we found an association with national events, and there was a notable increase in membership of SLI over the last 10 years, demonstrating an increasing interest by people in lichens. Without excluding the positive effects of in-person experiences, we believe that online events offer a powerful tool to help increase interest in, and knowledge about lichens. This interest may help to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on this sensitive component of the ecosystem and help human-lichen relationships.

Yet, clerics are powerful social assets in Iranian society who have the status to help minimize the spread and effects of pandemics upon Iranian people. As a result, their assistance and influence must be used to combat the COVID-19 crisis. This paper argues that clerics in Iran should motivate people to uphold and obey health norms in four ways: (1) health promotion and encouragement, (2) material and instrumental support, (3) spiritual support, and (4) the mobilization of people to combat the disease.

However, the poor bioavailability, low stability on gastrointestinal systems, and fast plasma elimination limit further clinical applications of Ginsenoside Rh2 for cancer treatments. In this study, a novel formulation of niosomal Ginsenoside Rh2 was prepared using the thin film hydration technique. Methods: The niosomal formulation contained Span 60 and cholesterol, and cationic lipid DOTAP was evaluated by determining particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, the polydispersity index (PDI), and surface morphology. The cytotoxic effects of free Ginsenoside Rh2 and Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomes were determined using the MTT method in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. For the investigation of the in vitro cellular uptake of Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosome, two formulations were prepared: the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula containing 5% DOTAP and the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula without DOTAP. Results: The mean size, DPI, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded nanoniosomal formulation containing DOTAP were 93.5±2.1 nm, 0.203±0.01, +4.65±0.65, and 98.32% ±2.4, respectively. The niosomal vesicles were found to be round and have a smooth surface. The release profile of Ginsenoside Rh2 from niosome was biphasic. Furthermore, a two-fold reduction in the Ginsenoside Rh2 concentration was measured when Ginsenoside Rh2 was administered in a nanoniosomal form compared to free Ginsenoside Rh2 solutions in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. After storage for 90 days, the encapsulation efficiency, vesicle size, PDI, and zeta potential of the optimized formulation did not significantly change compared to the freshly prepared samples. The cellular uptake experiments of the niosomal formulation demonstrated that by adding DOTAP to the niosomal formulation, the cellular uptake was enhanced. Discussion: The enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxic activity of the Ginsenoside Rh2 nanoniosomal formulation on the PC3 cell make it an attractive candidate for application as a nano-sized delivery vehicle to transfer Ginsenoside Rh2 to cancer cells.","Zare-Zardini, Hadi; Alemi, Ashraf; Taheri-Kafrani, Asghar; Hosseini, Seyed Ahmad; Soltaninejad, Hossein; Hamidieh, Amir Ali; Haghi Karamallah, Mojtaba; Farrokhifar, Majid; Farrokhifar, Mohammad",Drug Des Devel Ther,112,16

Low back pain and other spine disorders are prevalent among those exposed to whole-body vibration in occupational and military settings. Although standards for limiting exposure to whole-body vibration have been in place for decades, there is a lack of understanding of whole-body vibration-associated risks among safety and healthcare professionals. Consequently, disorders associated with whole-body vibration exposure remain prevalent in the workforce and military. The relationship between whole-body vibration and low back pain in humans has been established largely through cohort studies, for which vibration inputs that lead to symptoms are rarely, if ever, quantified. This gap in knowledge highlights the need for the development of relevant in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models to study such pathologies. The parameters of vibrational stimuli (eg, frequency and direction) play critical roles in such pathologies, but the specific cause-and-effect relationships between whole-body vibration and spinal pathologies remain mostly unknown.

Twenty-eight COVID-19 patients (aged 61.7 ± 10 years, males 79%). The majority was mechanically ventilated (86%) and 4 patients (14%) required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of March 31, the Intensive Care Unit mortality rate was 7%, whereas 7 patients were discharged (25%) with a length of stay of 8.2 ±5 days.

In conclusions, in COVID-19-related ARDS, increased in Tn levels was common but not associated with alterations in wall motion kinesis, thus suggesting that troponin T elevation is likely to be multifactorial, mainly linked to disease severely (as inferred by the relation between Tn and C-reactive Protein). The increase in systolic pulmonary arterial pressures observed in all patients may be related to hypoxic vasoconstriction.

To decrease the risk of complications in such patients, one proposed solution has been to have those diagnosed with COVID-19 but not sick enough to warrant admission monitor their arterial oxygenation by pulse oximetry at home and present for care when they show evidence of hypoxemia. Though the ease of use and low cost of pulse oximetry makes this an attractive option for identifying problems at an early stage, there are important considerations with pulse oximetry about which patients and providers may not be aware that can interfere with successful implementation of such monitoring programs. Only a few independent studies have examined the performance of pocket oximeters and smart phone-based systems, but the limited available data raise questions about their accuracy, particularly as saturation falls below 90%. There are also multiple sources of error in pulse oximetry that must be accounted for, including rapid fluctuations in measurements when the arterial oxygen pressure/tension falls on the steep portion of the dissociation curve, data acquisition problems when pulsatile blood flow is diminished, accuracy in the setting of severe hypoxemia, dyshemoglobinemias, and other problems. Recognition of these issues and careful counseling of patients about the proper means for measuring their oxygen saturation and when to seek assistance can help ensure successful implementation of needed monitoring programs.","Luks, Andrew M; Swenson, Erik R",Ann Am Thorac Soc,112,20

We sought to characterize these handover practices to identify areas of improvement and determine if handover standardization might be beneficial for trauma team performance. METHODS: Data were prospectively collected over a nine-week period by a trained observer at a Canadian level one trauma centre. A randomized scheduled was used to capture a representative breadth of handovers. Data collected included outcome measures such as duration of handover, structure of the handover, and information shared, process measures such as questions and interruptions from the trauma team, and perceptions of the handover from nurses, trauma team leaders and EMS according to a bidirectional Likert scale. RESULTS: 79 formal verbal handovers were observed. Information was often missing regarding airway (present 22%), breathing (54%), medications (59%), and allergies (54%). Handover structure lacked consistency beyond the order of identification and mechanism of injury. Of all questions asked, 35% were questioning previously given information. The majority of handovers (61%) involved parallel conversations between team members while EMS was speaking. There was a statistically significant disparity between the self-evaluation of EMS handovers and the perceived quality determined by nurses and trauma team leaders. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the need to standardize handover due to poor information content, a lack of structure and active listening, information repetition, and discordant expectations between team members.

The meniscus can be pinned at the top surface of the nanopillars during evaporation for perfectly wetting fluid. The curvature of the meniscus close to nanopillars varies dramatically. Nanobubbles do not originate from the solid surface, where there is an ultrathin nonevaporation film due to strong solid-fluid interaction, but originate and evolve from the corner of nanopillars, where there is a quick increase in potential energy of the fluid. Second, according to a parametric study, the smaller pitch between nanopillars (P) and larger diameter of nanopillars (D) are found to enhance evaporation but also raise the possibility of boiling, whereas the smaller height of nanopillars (H) is found to enhance evaporation and suppress boiling. Finally, it is revealed that the nanofilm thickness should be maintained beyond a threshold, which is 20 Å in this work, to avoid the suppression effect of disjoining pressure on evaporation. Moreover, it is revealed that whether the evaporative heat transfer is enhanced on the nanopillar surface compared with the smooth surface is also affected by the nanofilm thickness. The value of nanofilm thickness should be determined by the competition between the suppression effect on evaporation due to the decrease in the volume of supplied fluid and the existence of capillary pressure and the enhancement effect on evaporation due to the increase in the heating area. Our work serves as the guidelines to achieve stable and efficient nanofilm pure evaporative heat transfer on nanopillar surfaces.","Pu, Jin Huan; Wang, Si Kun; Sun, Jie; Wang, Wen; Wang, Hua Sheng",Langmuir,112,16

METHOD: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE up to August 10th, 2020. The adjusted effect estimates were extracted and pooled to evaluate the risk of the unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were also carried out. RESULTS: There were 12 studies with 10,304 patients included in our meta-analysis. A significant trend was observed when evaluating the association between cerebrovascular disease and adverse outcomes (pooled effectâ¯=â¯2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-3.16). In addition, the pooled effects showed that patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease had more likelihood to progress fatal outcomes than patients without a history of cerebrovascular disease (pooled effectâ¯=â¯1.78, 95% CI: 1.04-3.07). CONCLUSION: This study for the first time indicated that cerebrovascular disease was an independent risk factor for predicting the adverse outcomes, particularly fatal outcomes, in COVID-19 patients on the basis of adjusted effect estimates.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; Ho, Cyrus S; Ho, Roger C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),112,16

It would be valuable to be able to predict which patients are likely to benefit in terms of exacerbation prevention based on their early response in lung function and symptoms. Methods: This was a post-hoc analysis from the 52-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority FLAME trial. Early clinically important improvement (ECII) was defined as achievement of minimal clinically important difference in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; &#8805;100 mL increase) and one patient-reported outcome (PRO): either St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (&#8805;4-unit reduction; D1), or COPD assessment test (&#8805;2-point reduction; D2) at Week 4 or 12. Results: Approximately 18-20% of patients achieved ECII at Week 4 or 12 post-randomization according to any of the two definitions. The rate of subsequent exacerbations was lower in patients who achieved ECII at Week 4 (D1: ratio of rates [95% CI], 0.85 [0.74 to 0.98]; D2, 0.88 [0.77 to 1.00]) or at Week 12 (D1, 0.85 [0.74 to 0.98]; D2, 0.86 [0.75 to 1.00]) versus patients not achieving ECII. Patients who achieved ECII experienced longer time-to-first exacerbation between Week 4 or 12 to end of study. More patients achieved ECII with indacaterol/glycopyrronium versus salmeterol/fluticasone according to both definitions at Week 4 (D1, odds ratio [95% CI], 1.69 [1.40 to 2.04]; D2, 1.61 [1.34 to 1.93]), and 12 (D1, 2.01 [1.66 to 2.44]; D2, 1.80 [1.48 to 2.18]). Conclusion: ECII is a novel composite endpoint, based on clinically relevant improvement in lung function and PROs in the early phase of treatment intervention that may predict subsequent exacerbation risk and may be used in clinical trials.","Kostikas, Konstantinos; Mackay, Alexander J; Vogelmeier, Claus F; Frent, Stefan-Marian; Gupta, Pritam; Banerji, Donald; Patalano, Francesco; Pfister, Pascal J; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,112,24

Here we focus on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.","Alberti, Tommaso; Faranda, Davide",,112,16

Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the global challenges in 2020, creating obstacles to meeting the urgent needs of people. Young people aged 18-24 are one of the most vulnerable groups in terms of psychological well-being, which makes it important to study their reactions during the pandemic. Study design. The study was conducted from April 14 to June 16, 2020 in the Khabarovsk region. Data was collected remotely. To identify changes during the pandemic, the sample data was compared with the results of a study, which had been conducted in February 2019. Participants. Sample 2019: 139 subjects (45 males and 94 females, aged 18-24, M=20). Sample 2020: 130 subjects (40 males and 90 females, aged 18-24, M=19.5). Measurements. The subjective well-being of young people was measured on a scale of global life satisfaction and subjective happiness. To study the psychological distance of social contacts, a modified method of A.B. Kupreichenko was used. Results. The significant increase in life satisfaction among young people was registered. Under the pandemic conditions, increased satisfaction is associated with proximity to a wide range of social groups. Conclusions. The subjective well-being in early adulthood during the pandemic is associated with focus on social contacts, which creates conditions for the effective use of internal and external resources. © 2021 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

Cardiac (N = 48, 50% male) versus no cardiac (N = 50, 50% male) were similar in age; weight; nonrespiratory symptoms; and medical history. The cardiac group had 1 death and symptoms including coronary artery dilation, ejection fraction <50%, pericardial effusion, peripheral edema, arrhythmia, and pulmonary artery thrombus. The cardiac group had higher risk of ICU admission (77% vs 54%, p = 0.02); invasive ventilation (23% vs 4%,p = 0.007); vasoactive infusions (27% vs 4%, p = 0.002); prominent respiratory symptoms (60% vs 36%, p < 0.03); abnormal chest imaging (69% vs 34%, p = 0.001); troponin (33% vs 12%, p = 0.01); alanine aminotransferase (33% vs 12%, p = 0.02); and thrombocytopenia (46% vs 22%, p = 0.02).

Results: 126 patients were included, 33 with confirmed infection and age mean 8.4 years (95% CI 6.8-10.5) higher than not infected. Fever was the most common and with greater sensitivity. The differences found were a greater frequency of anosmia (P = .029) and headache (P = .009) among children infected with a specificity of 96.7% and 81.5% respectively. There were no differences in the duration of the symptoms. 81.8% of those infected were probably infected in the nucleus 85.2% by a parent who worked outside the home. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 70.9% and its negative predictive value 91.1%. Conclusions: The clinical picture is nonspecific and the symptoms more specific difficult to detect in younger children. Children had a reduced role in the intrafamily transmission.

Hospitals, mental health facilities, and other clinics face the challenge of providing continued care to a population that is under severe stress, while minimizing in-person visits that risk spreading the virus. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States, providing care at 1,286 sites. VHA ensured the continuity of mental health services after the COVID-19 outbreak by rapidly expanding its use of telemental health methods in the first weeks after the U.S. pandemic outbreak. VHA provided nearly 1.2 million telephone and video encounters to veterans in April 2020 and reduced in-person visits by approximately 80% when compared with the October 2019 to February 2020 period before the pandemic. By June 2020, VHA had an 11-fold increase in encounters using direct-to-home video and a fivefold increase in telephone contacts relative to before the pandemic. This article discusses research on the effectiveness of telemental health, VHA policies before COVID-19 that facilitated the use of telemental health systemwide, and VHA's actions that rapidly scaled use of telemental health during the first months of the outbreak. Key challenges and lessons learned from VHA's experience and implications for providers and health care systems regarding the use of telemental health to meet patients' mental health care needs during the pandemic are also discussed.

SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in the human body. Complementary therapies that impact on expression of IgE and IgG antibodies, including administration of bee venom (BV), have efficacy in the management of arthritis, and Parkinson's disease. A recent epidemiological study in China showed that local beekeepers have a level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 with and without previous exposure to virus. BV anti-inflammatory properties are associated with melittin and phospholipase A2 (PLA2), both of which show activity against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including H1N1 and HIV, with activity mediated through antagonist activity against interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;). Melittin is associated with the underexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and protein kinase Akt. BV therapy also involves group III secretory phospholipase A2 in the management of respiratory and neurological diseases. BV activation of the cellular and humoral immune systems should be explored for the application of complementary medicine for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections. BV ""vaccination"" is used to immunize against cytomegalovirus and can suppress metastases through the PLA2 and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4)-bisphosphate pathways.

The aim of this study is to report on the clinical characteristics and the predictors of mortality in hospitalized AA patients with COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective cohort review, we included all AA patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to an inner-city teaching community hospital in New York city. Demographics, clinical presentation, baseline co-morbidities, and laboratory data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 408 (median age, 67 years) patients included, 276 (66.65%, median age 63 years) survived while 132 (33.35%, median age 71 years) died. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, myalgia, fever/chills, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), with a prevalence of 62.50%, 43.87%, 53.68%, and 27.21%, respectively.

Emerging data suggests that employment in certain occupations (e.g., essential; frontline) may place individuals at higher-risk for contracting COVID-19. The current investigation examined how Black American fathers' COVID-19 perceived work risk was associated with their individual well-being (COVID-19 diagnosis; depressive and anxiety symptoms; sleep disturbance; sleep quality) as well as spillover into family contexts. Participants were 466 Black American fathers (M = 36.63; SD = 11.00) who completed online surveys in June-July 2020. Adjusted binomial logistic and multiple regressions were estimated to examine how fathers' work context was associated with COVID-19 health outcomes, psychological functioning, sleep health, and family stress. Descriptive analyses revealed that 32% of fathers reported a personal diagnosis of COVID-19 and 21% indicated that an immediate family member had been diagnosed. Adjusted binomial logistic regression analyses revealed that fathers working in higher-risk contexts for contracting COVID-19 had a greater odds ratio for both a personal (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.68) and an immediate family member diagnosis (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.36). Working in a higher-risk context for contracting COVID-19 was associated with poorer psychological functioning, greater sleep disturbance, and higher levels of family discord.

This study evaluates the correlation between seven weather variables and COVID-19 in Malaysia. Based on the previous literature, there is a lack of information about the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on environmental factors in Malaysia. Spearman rank correlation test was selected to correlate seven weather variables (relative humidity, global radiation, maximum temperature, mean temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and wind speed) with COVID-19 cases for the period of March 17, 2020 to April 30, 2020. On the national scale assessment, all the seven weather variables showed a non-significant correlation relationship with COVID-19. By dividing Malaysia into sixteen sub-regions, the correlation analysis shows weather had a larger impact on COVID-19 in five regions of Malaysia, mainly in the western, northern and southern parts of Peninsular Malaysia. The findings also indicate that COVID-19 was negatively correlated with relative humidity and rainfall, where a significant relationship was found in major cities such as Penang, Johor and Selangor. Maximum temperature and wind speed were non-significant correlated with COVID-19 in all the evaluated sub-regions, showing these two weather variables may be less important in the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia.

In this context, the paper aims to identify antecedents and outcomes of high-quality internal communication during the pandemic. In doing so, it draws important practical and theoretical implications for pandemic-era communication, particularly surrounding issues such as employees' needs and strategic approaches to communication during the pandemic, as well as the effects of successful internal (crisis) communication. Design/methodology/approach A representative survey was conducted on employees (n = 934) working at different types of organizations in Germany. After a dimensionality check was conducted through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the proposed hypotheses were tested by conducting a structural equation model (SEM) using the R package lavaan. Findings This study identifies several antecedents of high-quality internal communication during the Covid-19 crisis, such as the frequency of communication at the beginning and during the pandemic, the dissemination of substantial information, participative communication and a clear rejection of secrecy. Furthermore, the findings show that high-quality internal communication has a positive impact on the employee-organization relationship (EOR). Originality/value This study suggests that strategic alignment of internal communications during the Covid-19 pandemic is crucial: by considering a number of factors, organizations can positively influence employees' perceptions of the quality of their internal communication. In terms of theoretical implications, this study discusses how the concept of high-quality internal communication can be operationalized and explores the outcomes that this can generate.","Ecklebe, S.; Loffler, N.",Journal of Communication Management,112,16

We, therefore, aim to assess the influence of COVID-19 infection on IVF treatments. DESIGN: An observational study. SETTING: A tertiary, university-affiliated medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive couples undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) for IVF, before and after recovering from COVID-19 infection, and reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage. The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after recovering from COVID-19 infection were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stimulation characteristics and embryological variables. RESULTS: Nine couples (seven with the female partner infection and two with the male partner) resumed IVF treatment 8-92 d after recovering from the COVID-19 infection (negative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). No in-between cycles differences were observed in OS and embryological variables between the cycles before and after recovering from the COVID-19 infection, except for a significantly lower proportion of top-quality embryos. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection did not affect patients' performance or ovarian reserve in their immediate subsequent IVF cycle, except for a reduced proportion of top-quality embryos (TQEs). We therefore suggest, to postpone IVF treatment for a least 3 months (duration of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis) after recovering from COVID-19 infection, aiming to recruit healthy gametes that were not exposed to COVID-19 infection during their development.","Orvieto, Raoul; Segev-Zahav, Aliza; Aizer, Adva",Gynecol Endocrinol,112,20

Prior studies suggest that COVID-19 may be associated with an increased risk for various cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and venous thromboembolism. Early reports of non-COVID-19 patients have described the concurrence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) and spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). However, the interplay between COVID-19, TTC and SCAD has not been well established. We herein propose two sets of two-hit hypotheses for the development of SCAD and TTC in the context of COVID-19. The first two-hit hypothesis explains the development of SCAD, in which TTC-associated formation of vulnerable coronary substrate serves as the first hit (predisposing factor), and COVID-19-associated inflammation and vascular disruption serves as the second hit (precipitating factor). The second two-hit hypothesis is proposed to explain the development of TTC, in which SCAD-associated formation of vulnerable myocardial substrate serves as the first hit, and COVID-19-associated sympathetic overactivity serves as the second hit. Under this conceptual framework, COVID-19 poses a double threat for the development of SCAD (among patients with underlying TTC) as well as TTC (among patients with underlying SCAD), thereby forming a reciprocal causation. This hypothesis provides a rationale for the joint assessment of TTC and SCAD in COVID-19 patients with pertinent cardiovascular manifestations.","Shojaei, Fahimehalsadat; Habibi, Zahra; Goudarzi, Sogand; Firouzabadi, Fatemeh Dehghani; Montazerin, Sahar Memar; Najafi, Homa; Kahe, Farima; Momenzadeh, Kaveh; Mir, Mahshid; Khan, Faris; Jamil, Umer; Jamil, Adeel; Lee, Jane J; Chi, Gerald",Med Hypotheses,112,16

Some of these disorders are susceptible to a treatment, which is administered weekly or every other week, in a hospital. During the COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) pandemic lockdown, patients with LSDs on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) missed their scheduled access to the Day Hospital to get their treatment. Methods: Based on the feeling that our patients were experiencing profound distress, we designed a structured telephone interview with the aim to evaluate how, and to which extent, the pandemic outbreak was changing their behavior and feelings about their chronic disease, the impact on therapies, and future expectations. The same interview was administered to an age-matched control group. Results: All interviewed people experienced an increase of anxiety, worries, and uncertainty fostered by incessant media updates. Moreover, a striking similarity emerged between the groups regarding forced home reclusion and the profound feeling to be excluded by normal life, well-known to those affected by a chronic rare disease. Conclusions: Although no statistically significant difference was found compared to controls, we felt that the reactions were qualitatively different, underlining the fragility and isolation of such patients.","Fiumara, Agata; Lanzafame, Giuseppina; Arena, Alessia; Sapuppo, Annamaria; Raudino, Federica; Praticò, Andrea; Pavone, Piero; Barone, Rita",J.

A Comprehensive Assessment for Catalan,10.761231,9.517895,2021-07-16,"This paper introduces the model of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. In modern Western medicine, during non-crisis times, principlism provides the four guiding principles in biomedical ethics-autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice; autonomy typically emerges as the decisive principle. The physician-patient relationship is a deontological construct in which the physician's primary duty is to the individual patient and the individual patient is paramount. For this reason, we term the non-crisis ethical framework that guides modern medicine Deontological Principlism. During times of crisis, resources become scarce, standards of care become dynamic, and public health ethics move to the forefront. Healthcare providers are forced to work in non-ideal conditions, and interactions with individual patients must be considered in the context of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare to shift to a more utilitarian framework with a greater focus on promoting the health of communities and populations. This paper puts forth the notion of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. We discuss each of the four principles from a utilitarian perspective and use clinical vignettes, based on real cases from the COVID-19 pandemic, for illustrative purposes. We explore how Deontological Principlism and Utilitarian Principlism are two ends of a spectrum, and the implications to healthcare as we emerge from the pandemic.","Vearrier, Laura; Henderson, Carrie M",HEC Forum,112,21

Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases, irrespectively of the protonation state of the catalytic CYS-HIS dyad. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement.

Understanding the processes which underlie the psychological and behavioral responses of people with EDs during this time are key to ensure tailored support in these unprecedented circumstances. Methods: People with lifetime EDs (n = 32) were recruited through social media from May to June 2020 during a period of strict infection control measures in the United Kingdom (i.e., ""lockdown,"" ""social distancing""). They completed open-ended questions in an online anonymous questionnaire that invited them to reflect on how various aspects of their lives have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including ED symptoms and coping strategies. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Most respondents reported that their ED worsened or resurfaced. Isolation, low mood, anxiety, lack of structure, disruption to routines, and media/social media messages around weight and exercise seemed to contribute to this. There was a clear sense that individuals struggled with which aspects of psychological distress to prioritize, i.e., mood vs. ED cognitions and behaviors, particularly as attempts to cope with one often exacerbated the other. Nonetheless, some participants reported ""silver linings"" of the pandemic. Conclusions: In this self-selected sample, deterioration or recurrence of ED symptoms were the norm. This has implications for the provision of treatment and care for people with EDs both in the immediate short-term and in potential future waves of the pandemic, with a significant surge of new and re-referrals expected.","McCombie, Catherine; Austin, Amelia; Dalton, Bethan; Lawrence, Vanessa; Schmidt, Ulrike",Front Psychiatry,112,10

At the current stage, the expression and function of circRASSF2 in breast cancer (BC) have not been clarified. According to our study, it is found that circRASSF2 sequences contain miR-1205 binding sites, and Homeobox gene A1 (HOXA1) is the target gene of miR-1205. Besides, the clinical observations and histopathologic study reveal that the expression of circRASSF2 increased to a significant extent in BC tissues and serum. Additionally, it is found that circRASSF2 expression had a positive correlation with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, differentiation and tumor size, and that overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of circRASSF2 high expression BC patients were inferior to those with low circRASSF2 expression. In vitro study, an overt decrease was detected in the proliferation, clone formation ability, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in cells when circRASSF2 was knocked down. We confirmed the direct interaction between circRASSF2, miR-1205 and HOXA1 by a dual luciferase reporter system. Additionally, our study revealed that over-expression of miR-1205 decreased HOXA1 protein expression, and HOXA1 protein expression decreased when circRASSF2 were knocked down, and when miR-1205 expression was inhibited, HOXA1 expression was significantly increased. In conclusion, our study suggests that circRASSF2 regulates BC progression through the miR-1205/HOXA1 pathway.

METHODS: This scoping review searched federal and P/T websites on daily COVID-19 pandemic preparedness strategies between 30 January and 30 April 2020. The PROGRESS-Plus equity-lens framework was used to define priority populations. All definitions, policies and guidelines of PH strategies implemented by the federal and P/T governments to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were included. PH measures were classified using a modified Public Health Agency of Canada Framework for Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness. RESULTS: A total of 722 COVID-19 PH measures were issued during the study period. Of these, home quarantine (voluntary) (n=13.0%; 94/722) and retail/commerce restrictions (10.9%; n=79/722) were the most common measures introduced. Many of the PH orders, including physical distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures or retail/commerce restrictions began to be introduced after 11 March 2020. Lifting of some of the PH orders in phases to reopen the economy began in April 2020 (6.5%; n=47/722). The majority (68%, n=491/722) of COVID-19 PH announcements were deemed mandatory, while 32% (n=231/722) were recommendations. Several PH measures (28.0%, n=202/722) targeted a variety of groups at risk of socially produced health inequalities, such as age, religion, occupation and migration status. CONCLUSIONS: Most PH measures centred on limiting contact between people who were not from the same household. PH measures were evolutionary in nature, reflecting new evidence that emerged throughout the pandemic. Although ~30% of all implemented COVID-19 PH measures were tailored towards priority groups, there were still unintended consequences on these populations.","Polisena, Julie; Ospina, Maria; Sanni, Omolara; Matenchuk, Brittany; Livergant, Rachel; Amjad, Sana; Zoric, Igor; Haddad, Nisrine; Morrison, Andra; Wilson, Kumanan; Bogoch, Isaac; Welch, Vivian A",BMJ Open,112,1

In April 2020, at the Tor Vergata University in Rome, Italy, two patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation (KT) declined a deceased donor's kidney offer. Therefore, between April 20 and 25, 2020, we conducted a telephone survey among our 247 KT waitlist patients. Our aim was to explore: (a) the COVID-19 diffusion among them and (b) their current willingness to be transplanted in case of a kidney offer from a deceased donor. Two hundred and forty-three patients participated in a phone interview. One patient had died from COVID-19. Eighty-five (35%) KT candidates would decline any kidney offer, in most cases until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events.

METHODS: This is a retrospective case series study conducted on patients with DRS, mimicking non-comitant exotropia or esotropia and a face turn. Patients were included only if they lacked either globe retraction on adduction (sine retraction) or limitation of adduction or abduction on ductions (sine limitation not >0.5). Any overshoots or pattern strabismus was recorded. The ocular motility and alignment, details of surgery and their surgical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified; 13 in the sine retraction and 8 in the sine limitation group. All patients presented with a compensatory face turn. Overshoots were present in 10 (77%) and 7 patients (88%) in the sine retraction and sine limitation groups, respectively. Forced duction test showed tightness of the ipsilateral medial and the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle in esotropic (n = 3) and exotropic patients (n = 18), respectively. Orthotropia was achieved in 82% of patients following ipsilateral medial or lateral rectus muscle recession. CONCLUSIONS: There is a subset of patients who present with motility pattern similar to DRS but lack its complete diagnostic criteria.

However, there are no consistent data about who might benefit most from it. METHODS: We administered TCZ on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP who were hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) and who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. The primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 h of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous TCZ from March 8, 2020 to April 20, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analyzed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male patients. A coexisting condition was present in 68% of cases. Prognostic factors of death were older age, higher IL-6, d-dimer and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP), lower total lymphocytes, and severe disease that requires additional oxygen support. The primary endpoint (intubation or death) was significantly worst (37% vs 13%, p < 0·001) in those receiving the drug when the oxygen support was high (FiO2 >0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: TCZ is well tolerated in patients with SSP, but it has a limited effect on the evolution of cases with high oxygen support needs.","Górgolas Hernández-Mora, Miguel; Cabello Úbeda, Alfonso; Prieto-Pérez, Laura; Villar Álvarez, Felipe; Álvarez Álvarez, Beatriz; Rodríguez Nieto, María Jesús; Carrillo Acosta, Irene; Fernández Ormaechea, Itziar; Al-Hayani, Aws Waleed Mohammed; Carballosa, Pilar; Calpena Martínez, Silvia; Ezzine, Farah; Castellanos González, Marina; Naya, Alba; López De Las Heras, Marta; Rodríguez Guzmán, Marcel José; Cordero Guijarro, Ana; Broncano Lavado, Antonio; Macías Valcayo, Alicia; Martín García, Marta; Bécares Martínez, Javier; Fernández Roblas, Ricardo; Piris Pinilla, Miguel Ángel; Fortes Alen, José; Sánchez Pernaute, Olga; Romero Bueno, Fredeswinda; Heili-Frades, Sarah; Peces-Barba Romero, Germán",Int J Infect Dis,112,16

Traditional seizure detection products (e.g., wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast, and non-invasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient, during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g. posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of 20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their caregivers.","Korany, Belal; Mostofi, Yasamin",,112,24

At the same time, if we consider the University context, there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic. The present study aims to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic condition influenced the psychological well-being of the Italian nursing students. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to Italian nursing students which contains two parts: a demographic section and the assessment to the psychological well-being nursing student with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values ââthat were almost normal. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19. If the training ameliorates psychological well being, therefore, it is necessary to provide and preserve nurses expertise to encourage teaching in nursing degree courses on maxi emergencies to prepare future nurses to face them adequately.","Vitale, Elsa; Moretti, Biagio; Noternicola, Angela; Covelli, Ilaria",Acta Biomed,112,16

METHODS: A crown preparation on a manikin was performed on tooth number 30 and repeated five times for each setup to simulate a patient under care. Aerosol, environmental, and operator face shield spatter, and sound intensity was measured. Generalized linear mixed models were used, and posthoc pairwise comparisons were performed to compare least-squares means when appropriate using a Tukey adjustment. RESULTS: All tested setups showed some environmental spatter formation; however, these were able to control most (and in some cases all) spatter on the operator face shield. All methods resulted in excellent aerosol mitigation when a second line of high-volume evacuation (HVE) was added to the device setup. However, in most setups, total sound levels exceeded 85 dB, posing a concern for prolonged noise exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The Prototype device and four other tested setups with secondary HVE addition completely eliminated aerosol creation as tested. Spatter of the Face Shield was best eliminated using the Prototype device. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the dental community has at its disposal equipment that can effectively mitigate aerosol and spatter.","Comisi, John C; Ravenel, Theodore D; Kelly, Abigail; Teich, Sorin T; Renne, Walter",J. esthet. restor. dent,112,16

Shortly after, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. The emergence of this virus led many United States governors to enact executive orders in an effort to limit the person-to-person spread of the virus. One state that utilized such measures was New York, which contains New York City (NYC), the most populous city in the United States. Many reports have shown that due to the government-backed shutdowns, the air quality in major global cities improved. However, there has been only limited work on whether this same trend is seen throughout the United States, specifically within the densely populated NYC area. Thus, the focus of this study was to examine whether changes in air quality were observed in NYC resulting from New York State's COVID-19-associated shutdown measures. To do this, daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were obtained from 15 central monitoring stations throughout the five NYC boroughs for the first 17 weeks (January through May) of 2015-2020. Decreases in PM2.5 (36%) and NO2 (51%) concentrations were observed shortly after the shutdown took place; however, using a linear time lag model, when changes in these pollutant concentrations were compared to those measured during the same span of time in 2015-2019, no significant difference between the years was found. Therefore, we highlight the importance of considering temporal variability and long-term trends of pollutant concentrations when analyzing for short-term differences in air pollutant concentrations related to the COVID-19 shutdowns.","Zangari, Shelby; Hill, Dustin T; Charette, Amanda T; Mirowsky, Jaime E",Sci Total Environ,112,33

Foxp3 regulators were enriched in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF nucleosome-remodeling and SAGA chromatin-modifying complexes. Among the three SWI/SNF-related complexes, the Brd9-containing non-canonical (nc) BAF complex promoted Foxp3 expression, whereas the PBAF complex was repressive. Chemical-induced degradation of Brd9 led to reduced Foxp3 expression and reduced Treg cell function in vitro. Brd9 ablation compromised Treg cell function in inflammatory disease and tumor immunity in vivo. Furthermore, Brd9 promoted Foxp3 binding and expression of a subset of Foxp3 target genes.

Tocilizumab was applied and intended to target both COVID-19 and RA. However, disease of this patient aggravated after usage of tocilizumab. After the discussion of a multiple disciplinary team (MDT) including rheumatologists, antimicrobial treatments were applied to target the potential opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus), which were authenticated several days later via high throughput sequencing. As an important cytokine in immune responses, IL-6 can be a double-edged sword: interference in the IL-6-IL-6 receptor signaling may save patients from cytokine release storm (CRS), but can also weaken the anti-infectious immunity, particularly in rheumatic patients, who may have received a long-term treatment with immunosuppressive/modulatory agents. Thus, we suggest careful considerations before and close monitoring in the administration of tocilizumab in rheumatic patients with COVID-19. Besides tocilizumab, several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can also be applied in the treatment of COVID-19.

The authors examine what happened when the community-based Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) initiative they engaged with traditionally marginalized high school students was interrupted as a result of physical distancing necessitated by COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: Data for this inquiry were taken from a broader on-going ethnography of youth’s participation in the YPAR project and included audio and video recordings from meetings of the YPAR initiative and messages exchanged between and among authors and youth. Authors used components of culturally responsive-sustaining education and theories related to student voice as an analytic frame through which they considered how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced their work. Findings: Three findings are examined in this paper. They consider: how youth participants and the authors stayed connected after they were no longer able to meet in person; how youth chose to center the needs of the subsidized housing community where they lived while continuing their work; and how youth and authors navigated the uncertainties they encountered in looking ahead to future possibilities for their study as the pandemic continued. Originality/value: This study provides urgently needed insights for educators and researchers grappling with how they may enact culturally responsive-sustaining education and research during the COVID-19 global pandemic and beyond.,"Marciano, Joanne E.; Peralta, Lee Melvin; Lee, Ji Soo; Rosemurgy, Hannah; Holloway, Lillian; Bass, Justice",J.

It is a global health priority to identify patients at risk of fatal outcomes. 1955 patients admitted to HM-Hospitales from 1 March to 10 June 2020 due to COVID-19, were were divided into two groups, 1310 belonged to the training cohort and 645 to validation cohort. Four different models were generated to predict in-hospital mortality. Following variables were included: age, sex, oxygen saturation, level of C-reactive-protein, neutrophil-to-platelet-ratio (NPR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) and the rate of changes of both hemogram ratios (VNLR and VNPR) during the first week after admission. The accuracy of the models in predicting in-hospital mortality were evaluated using the area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUC). AUC for models including NLR and NPR performed similarly in both cohorts: NLR 0.873 (95% CI: 0.849-0.898), NPR 0.875 (95% CI: 0.851-0.899) in training cohort and NLR 0.856 (95% CI: 0.818-0.895), NPR 0.863 (95% CI: 0.826-0.901) in validation cohort. AUC was 0.885 (95% CI: 0.885-0.919) for VNLR and 0.891 (95% CI: 0.861-0.922) for VNPR in the validation cohort. According to our results, models are useful in predicting in-hospital mortality risk due to COVID-19. The RIM Score proposed is a simple, widely available tool that can help identify patients at risk of fatal outcomes.","López-Escobar, Alejandro; Madurga, Rodrigo; Castellano, José María; Velázquez, Sara; Suárez Del Villar, Rafael; Menéndez, Justo; Peixoto, Alejandro; Jimeno, Sara; Ventura, Paula Sol; Ruiz de Aguiar, Santiago",Diagnostics (Basel),112,4

We conducted a time-series analysis to evaluate the association of six common air pollutants with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children aged 0-14 years in 4 cities (Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan and Xining), China during 2013-2018. We used generalized additive models incorporating penalized smoothing splines and random-effect meta-analysis to calculate city-specific and pooled estimates, respectively. The exposure-response relationship curves were fitted using the cubic spline regression. Subgroup analyses by gender, age, season and disease subtype were also performed. A total of 183,036 respiratory diseases hospitalizations were recorded during the study period, and 94.1% of the cases were acute respiratory infections. Overall, we observed that increased levels of air pollutants except O3, were significantly associated with increased hospital admissions for respiratory disease. Each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 at lag 07, PM10 at lag 03 and per 1 mg/m3 increase in CO at lag 01 corresponded to increments of 1.19%, 3.58%, 2.23%, 0.51% and 6.10% in total hospitalizations, respectively. Generally, exposure-response relationships of PM2.5 and SO2 in Guangzhou, SO2, NO2 and CO in Wuhan, as well as SO2 and NO2 in Xining with respiratory disease hospitalizations were also found. Moreover, the adverse effects of these pollutants apart from PM2.5 in certain cities remained significant even at exposure levels below the current Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) Grade II. Children aged 4-14 years appeared to be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5, SO2 and NO2. Furthermore, with the exception of O3, the associations were stronger in cold season than in warm season. Short-term exposure to PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO were associated, in dose-responsive manners, with increased risks of hospitalizations for childhood respiratory diseases, and adverse effects of air pollutants except PM2.5 held even at exposure levels below the current CAAQS Grade II in certain cities.","Yang, Huihua; Yan, Chunxiang; Li, Meng; Zhao, Lei; Long, Zhen; Fan, Yali; Zhang, Zhonggang; Chen, Renjie; Huang, Yihui; Lu, Congbin; Zhang, Jianduan; Tang, Jie; Liu, Hua; Liu, Miao; Guo, Wenting; Yang, Liangle; Zhang, Xiaomin",Int J Hyg Environ Health,112,26

Recent efforts of generating adversaries using rule-based synonyms and BERT-MLMs have been witnessed in general domain, but the ever increasing biomedical literature poses unique challenges. We propose BBAEG (Biomedical BERT-based Adversarial Example Generation), a black-box attack algorithm for biomedical text classification, leveraging the strengths of both domain-specific synonym replacement for biomedical named entities and BERTMLM predictions, spelling variation and number replacement. Through automatic and human evaluation on two datasets, we demonstrate that BBAEG performs stronger attack with better language fluency, semantic coherence as compared to prior work.","Mondal, Ishani",,112,30

The consequences of this include renal dysfunction, hepatitis and stroke. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of patients who suffer from stroke as a complication of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of all studies published between November 1, 2019 and July 8, 2020 which reported on patients who suffered from stroke as a complication of COVID-19. RESULTS: 326 studies were screened, and 30 studies reporting findings from 55,176 patients including 899 with stroke were included. The average age of patients who suffered from stroke as a complication of COVID-19 was 65.5 (Range: 40.4-76.4 years). The average incidence of stroke as a complication of COVID-19 was 1.74% (95% CI: 1.09% to 2.51%). The average mortality of stroke in COVID-19 patients was 31.76% (95% CI: 17.77% to 47.31%). These patients also had deranged clinical parameters including deranged coagulation profiles, liver function tests, and full blood counts. CONCLUSION: Although stroke is an uncommon complication of COVID-19, when present, it often results in significant morbidity and mortality. In COVID-19 patients, stroke was associated with older age, comorbidities, and severe illness.","Siow, Isabel; Lee, Keng Siang; Zhang, John J Y; Saffari, Seyed Ehsan; Ng, Adeline; Young, Barnaby",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,112,16

The aim of this study was to examine the nature and dissemination of COVID-19 information related to dentistry on Twitter platform Arabic database during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: One hundred and fifty independent searches with a combination of keywords for both COVID-19 and dentistry from a preselected Arabic keyword were carried out for the period from the 2nd of March (first confirmed cases of COVID-19) to the 6th of July 2020. Tweets were filtered to remove duplicate and unrelated tweets. The suitable tweets were 1,150. After calibration, two examiners coded the tweets following two main themes: COVID-19 and oral health-related information. Tweets were then compared with COVID-19 daily events in the Arab countries as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). Descriptive analysis was performed to present the overview of the findings using Microsoft Excel. Results: The most retweeted information was the help with urgent consultation or emergency dental treatment during COVID-19 tweeted by a dentist. There were 673 retweets and 1,116 likes of this tweet. The most common tweets related to oral health were needs of dental treatment (n=462, 39.5%) of which, toothaches or wisdom tooth problems constituted 48% of the related tweets. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it is obvious that social media users reacted to the COVID-19 threat to dental practices.

METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on face-to-face and telemedicine interactions was conducted at a multisite health care system from January to August 2020 in vascular surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end point is direct patient satisfaction comparison between face-to-face and telemedicine encounters/interactions prior and during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 6262 patient encounters from January 1, 2020, to August 6, 2020. Of the total encounters, 790 (12.6%) were via telemedicine, which were initiated on March 11, 2020, after the World Health Organization's declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. These telemedicine encounters were readily adopted and embraced by both the providers and patients and remain popular as an option to patients for all types of visits. Of these patients, 78.7% rated their overall health care experience during face-to-face encounters as very good and 80.6% of patients rated their health care experience during telemedicine encounters as very good (P = .78). CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented consequences to the practice of medicine and specifically of vascular surgery, our multisite health care system has been able to swiftly adapt and adopt telemedicine technologies for the care of our complex patients. Most important, the high quality of patient-reported satisfaction and health care experience has remained unchanged.","Erben, Young; Franco-Mesa, Camila; Hamid, Osman; Lin, Michelle; Stone, William; Meltzer, Andrew J; Hattery, Wendy; Palaj, Arta; Wilshusen, Laura L; Vista, Tafi L; Kalra, Manju; Farres, Houssam; Bower, Thomas C; De Martino, Randall R; Huang, Josephine F; Meschia, James F; TerKonda, Sarvam P",J. vasc. surg,112,1

The new confirmed cases of infected individuals of COVID-19 are increasing day by day. Therefore, the prediction of infected individuals has become of utmost important for health care arrangements and to control the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model with intervention strategies such as lockdown, quarantine, and hospitalization. We compute the basic reproduction number (R0), which plays a vital role in mathematical epidemiology. Based on R0, it is revealed that the system has two equilibrium, namely disease-free and endemic. We also demonstrate the non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions, local and global stability of equilibria, transcritical bifurcation to analyze its epidemiological relevance. Furthermore, to validate our system, we fit the cumulative and new daily cases in India. We estimate the model parameters and predict the near future scenario of the disease. The global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to observe the impact of different parameters on R0. We also investigate the dynamics of disease in respect of different situations of lockdown, e.g., complete lockdown, partial lockdown, and no lockdown. Our analysis concludes that if there is partial or no lockdown case, then endemic level would be high. Along with this, the high transmission rate ensures higher level of endemicity. From the short time prediction, we predict that India may face a crucial phase (approx 6000000 infected individuals within 140 days) in near future due to COVID-19. Finally, numerical results show that COVID-19 may be controllable by reducing the contacts and increasing the efficacy of lockdown.","Bugalia, Sarita; Bajiya, Vijay Pal; Tripathi, Jai Prakash; Li, Ming-Tao; Sun, Gui-Quan",Math Biosci Eng,112,16

The virus affected more people and spread to various countries than what was predicted when COVID-19 initially began spreading. There have been numerous pandemics and epidemics in the 21st century yet COVID-19 has affected more people and spread widely. The primary objective of the study was to explore history, spread and associated parameters of existing viruses especially COVID-19. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed for a systematic search to identify eligible published articles. Clinical data, regarding COVID-19 patients, was obtained from previously published articles. The main cause of COVID-19 spreading rapidly was noted to be due to a high percentage of asymptomatic patients, transmission being air-borne, and the lack of knowledge and preventative measures being implemented when the virus began spreading. The common co-morbidity that found in patients was Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Coronary Heart Disease. The common symptoms, found through the Meta-analysis, that the patients faced included cough (55.4%), fever (68.4%), fatigue (20.3%), and shortness of breath (18.1%). The proportion of asymptotic positive cases was measured 58.3% (95%CI: 24.7% - 87.9%) while mortality proportion was found to be 6.7% (fixed-effect model) and 13.4% (random-effect model). The Meta-analysis indicated that a higher percentage of males were affected by COVID-19 than females and more patients are found to be asymptomatic. Moreover, the mortality rate of patients that have had COVID-19 was found to be low.","Awasthi, S.; Sharma, S.; Attri, S.; Attri, S.

In 2020, the number of patients taken for DDH screening was 159 and 776 in the same period, respectively. Thirteen patients were diagnosed with DDH older than 3 months age in June-July 2020. There were only two patients in same period in 2019. In 2020, 6 of 13 patients who applied to the hospital late for the routine US and had pathologic hips were not taken to orthopaedics or follow-up by their families. CONCLUSION: In the era of COVID-19, the number of late diagnosis and lost follow-up for DDH are increased. To prevent future morbidities and reduce surgical interventions, special measures should be taken.","Mert Dogan, Güleç; Aslantürk, Okan",Int J Clin Pract,112,10

LID - e8932,10.5943985,9.515738,2020,"Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work. While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called ‘Verifiable Credentials’, (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform ‘Solid’, and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Result s: Our mobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is ‘just another app’ which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect ‘waiting in the wings’ for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.","Eisenstadt, Marc Ramachandran Manoharan Chowdhury Niaz Third Allan Domingue John",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,112,24

For this achievement, much credit is due to the New Zealand government, especially to Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. However, post-lockdown the New Zealand government has encountered a number of Covid policy implementation problems (many of which could have been anticipated). Nevertheless, Covid-19 might still turn out to have been a seismic shock to existing policy processes and policy frames (such as austerity). If so, there are grounds for hope that in the future, governments and voters might be less short-term in their outlook.

Robust reversible watermarking (RRW) algorithms provide copyright protection and the original images can be recovered at the receiver’s end. However, the existing algorithms have limitations in their ability to balance the tradeoff among robustness, imperceptibility, and embedded capacity. Some of them are even not completely reversible. Besides, most medical image watermarking algorithms are not designed for color images. To improve their performance in protecting medical color image information, we propose a novel RRW scheme based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). First, the DWT provides a robust solution. Second, the modification of the wavelet domain coefficient guarantees the changes of integer values in the spatial domain and ensures the reversibility of the watermarking scheme. Third, the embedding scheme makes full use of the characteristics of the original image and watermarking. This reduces the modification of the original image and ensures better imperceptibility. Lastly, the selection of the Zernike moments order for geometric correction is optimized to predict attack parameters more accurately by using less information. This enhances the robustness of the proposed scheme against geometric attacks such as rotation and scaling. The proposed scheme is robust against common and geometric attacks and has a high embedding capacity without obvious distortion of the image. The paper contributes towards improving the security of medical images in remote healthcare.","Zhou, Xiaoyi Ma Yue Zhang Qingquan Mazin Abed Mohammed Damaševičius Robertas",Electronics,112,23

Pulmonary hypertension patients need persistent medical care; however, limited reports focused on them when there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in China. This national survey was aimed to evaluate the overall condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during this period. A questionnaire regarding the living condition of pulmonary hypertension patients during coronavirus disease 2019 was designed by pulmonary hypertension diagnostic experts in Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital. Pulmonary hypertension patients and their family members were invited to participate in this survey online. One-hundred twenty pulmonary hypertension patients and 23 family members participated in the survey; 64.8% (n = 87) participants came from Hubei, and others were from 15 other provinces; 98.6% (n = 141) participants were in home quarantine; 65.8% (n = 79) were pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease; and 76.7% (n = 92) patients proclaimed their heart function was well maintained at class I or II. One (0.8%) patient was confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Two (1.7%) patients were hospitalized due to heart function worsening. Nearly 70% (n = 100) participants implied shortage in medications during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. A total of 24.2% (n = 29) patients indicated that medications were discontinued due to the insufficient supply. Most of the participants stayed optimistic on either coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak or their pulmonary hypertension disease, and 61.7% (n = 74) patients would go to the hospital for follow-up immediately after outbreak. These preliminary data show pulmonary hypertension patients are able to avoid severe disease when they are in home quarantine. Medication supplement is important for pulmonary hypertension patients when their heart function is well maintained. In addition, there might be increasing requirements of medical care for pulmonary hypertension patients after the outbreak.","Zhou, Hongmei; Zhang, Gangcheng; Deng, Xiaoxian; Jin, Bowen; Qiu, Qiu; Yan, Menghuan; Wang, Xi; Zheng, Xuan",Pulm.

Otorhinolaryngologists (ORLs) are suspected to be at high risk of infection, due to the high viral load in the mucosa of the upper airways. The current review evaluates the impact of the pandemic on ORLs' activities and assesses the risk infection. METHODS: A selective literature research was conducted using relevant English and German terms for ORL, SARS-CoV­2, risk, and infection at PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, as well as in the Deutsches Ärzteblatt and on the websites of the Robert Koch Institute and the Johns Hopkins University. RESULTS: Protection recommendations for ORL include general hygiene measures and wearing KN95 masks for routine professional activities. When in contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, it is recommended to extend the personal protective equipment by eye protection, gloves, cap, and gown. International otorhinolaryngology societies have released guidelines for procedures (e.g., tracheostomy, sinus surgery), propagating personal protection for the surgical team and reduction of aerosols. Testing for SARS-CoV­2 in patients and medical staff can contribute to reducing the risk of infection. Vaccination would provide some additional protection for ORLs and other health care professionals with increased exposure to aerosols. There is increasing evidence that ORLs are at a high risk of contracting SARS-CoV­2. CONCLUSION: Consequent personal protection, frequent testing of patients and health care professionals, and the promised SARS-CoV­2 vaccinations may provide adequate protection for highly exposed persons.","Herzog, M; Beule, A G; Lüers, J-C; Guntinas-Lichius, O; Grafmans, D; Deitmer, T",HNO,112,1

We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app (https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis.","Gros, Claudius; Valenti, Roser; Schneider, Lukas; Gutsche, Benedikt; Markovic, Dimitrije",PLoS One,112,32

However, it's unclear if these measures change following treatment. In this study, 31 OCD patients and 28 healthy controls performed a stop signal task during 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging before treatment, while 24 OCD patients and 17 healthy controls were rescanned one week and three months after concentrated exposure and response prevention over four consecutive days using Bergen 4-Day Format. To study changes over time we performed a longitudinal analysis on stop signal reaction time and task-related activation and amygdala connectivity during successful and failed inhibition. Results showed that there was no group difference in task performance. Before treatment, OCD patients compared to controls showed less inhibition-related activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and increased functional connectivity between the right amygdala and the right inferior frontal gyrus and pre-supplementary motor area. During error-processing, OCD patients versus controls showed less activation in the pre-SMA before treatment. These group differences did not change after treatment. Pre-treatment task performance, brain activation, and connectivity were unrelated to the degree of symptom improvement after treatment. In conclusion, inferior frontal gyrus hypoactivation and increased fronto-limbic connectivity are likely trait markers of OCD that remain after effective exposure therapy.","Lillevik Thorsen, Anders; de Wit, Stella J; Hagland, Pernille; Ousdal, Olga Therese; Hansen, Bjarne; Hagen, Kristen; Kvale, Gerd; van den Heuvel, Odile A",Neuroimage Clin,112,14

The disease has imposed a huge burden on health resources. Evaluation of clinical and epidemiological profiles of such patients can help in understanding and managing the outbreak more efficiently. This study was a prospective observational analysis of 200 diagnosed COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 20th march to 8th May 2020. All these patients were positive for COVID-19 by an oro-nasopharyngeal swab-rtPCR based testing. Analyses of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and the outcomes were performed. The mean age of the population was 40 years with a slight male predominance (116 patients out of 200, 58%). A majority of the patients (147, 73.5 %) were symptomatic, with fever being the most common symptom (109, 54.5%), followed by cough (91, 45.5%). An older age, presence of symptoms and their duration, leukocytosis, a high quick SOFA score, a high modified SOFA score, need for ventilator support, an AST level more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater were at a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Presence of diabetes mellitus, AST > three times ULN, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or higher, and a qSOFA score of 1 or higher were all associated with significantly greater odds of critical care requirement. Triage and severity assessment helps in deciding the requirement for a hospital stay and ICU admission for COVID-19 which can easily be done using clinical and laboratory parameters.

The growth of online purchasing of prescription medicines is significant and has been amplified by social isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many patients unable to obtain medicines as they normally would. By contrast, there are licensed, certified, legitimate retail pharmacies that provide significant and vital services to patients. OBJECTIVE: To review the major public health threat from illegal entities that sell any type of prescription medicines to individuals without proper physician oversight. DISCUSSION: Rogue and inappropriate online vendors are providing counterfeit and substandard medications fraudulently with untold impacts on morbidity and mortality globally. This article presents the differ-entiation between the types of legal and illegal Internet pharmacies, as well as the actions that are current-ly in play to affect the illegal online purchase of prescription medicines. Much must be done in a collaborative, global effort to address the public health threat of obtaining prescription drugs via the Internet.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the virtual conferences in the field of urology during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide suggestions for better organization of such conferences. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 30 to June 15, 2020, in China. Our team designed a 23-item questionnaire to investigate the conferences attended by urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation) was applied to analyze the data collected. RESULTS: A total of 330 Chinese urologists participated in our survey, and the response rate was 89.7% (330/368). Among the participants, 40.9% (135/330) were associate chief physicians. The proportion of participants who took part in conventional face-to-face academic conferences decreased from 92.7% (306/330) before the COVID-19 pandemic to 22.1% (73/330) during the pandemic (P<.001). In contrast, the proportion of urologists who took part in virtual conferences increased from 69.4% (229/330) to 90% (297/330) (P<.001). Most urologists (70.7%, 210/297) chose to participate in the virtual conferences at home and thought that a meeting length of 1-2 hours was most appropriate. Among the urologists, 73.7% (219/297) reported that their participation in the virtual conferences went smoothly, while the remaining respondents reported that they had experienced lags in video and audio streaming during the virtual conferences. When comparing conventional face-to-face conferences with virtual conferences, 70.7% (210/297) of the respondents thought that both conference formats were acceptable, while 17.9% (53/297) preferred virtual conferences and 11.5% (34/297) preferred conventional face-to-face meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual conferences are increasing in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, many aspects of these conferences could be improved for better organization.","Wang, Menghua; Liao, Banghua; Jian, Zhongyu; Jin, Xi; Xiang, Liyuan; Yuan, Chi; Li, Hong; Wang, Kunjie",J Med Internet Res,112,20

Inequality of educational potential has a strong regional dimension, exerting a considerable delayed impact on regional socioeconomic development. Differences in universities’ resources affected their ability to adapt their instructional, research, and administrative processes during the pandemic, thus broadening the education and research quality gap in higher education. Some regions may face an increased outflow of youth talent to universities based in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that will certainly weaken the socioeconomic growth prospects of Russia’s regions. The pandemic accelerated the debate over this problem and demonstrated readiness of universities for joint efforts. This leads to an expansion of policy to create a cooperative network of universities and their stakeholders so as to reduce institutional differentiation and promote exchange of experience and competence among universities. This paper investigates into the main characteristics of vertical differentiation in Russian higher education that had been in place when the pandemic broke out and determined whether universities succeeded or failed in switching to distance learning. Furthermore, lockdown measures and their economic impact on different types of universities are analyzed. Finally, we discuss possible avenues and specific considerations for expanding cross-institutional collaboration and engaging stakeholders in university development. © 2021, Mir Rossii.

Immediately after the inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, alveolar type II epithelial cells harbor and initiate local innate immunity. These particles can infect circulating macrophages, which then present the coronavirus antigens to T cells. Subsequently, the activation and differentiation of various types of T cells, as well as uncontrollable cytokine release (also known as cytokine storms), result in tissue destruction and amplification of the immune response. Vitamin D enhances the innate immunity required for combating COVID-19 by activating toll-like receptor 2. It also enhances antimicrobial peptide synthesis, such as through the promotion of the expression and secretion of cathelicidin and ß-defensin; promotes autophagy through autophagosome formation; and increases the synthesis of lysosomal degradation enzymes within macrophages. Regarding adaptive immunity, vitamin D enhances CD4+ T cells, suppresses T helper 17 cells, and promotes the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating T cell-dependent B cells. Moreover, vitamin D attenuates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4+ T cells through nuclear factor &#954;B signaling, thereby inhibiting the development of a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells after its spike proteins are bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Vitamin D increases the bioavailability and expression of ACE2, which may be responsible for trapping and inactivating the virus. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is responsible for tissue destruction, inflammation, and organ failure related to SARS-CoV-2. Vitamin D inhibits renin expression and serves as a negative RAS regulator. In conclusion, vitamin D defends the body against SARS-CoV-2 through a novel complex mechanism that operates through interactions between the activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, ACE2 expression, and inhibition of the RAS system. Multiple observation studies have shown that serum concentrations of 25 hydroxyvitamin D are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. The evidence gathered thus far, generally meets Hill's causality criteria in a biological system, although experimental verification is not sufficient. We speculated that adequate vitamin D supplementation may be essential for mitigating the progression and severity of COVID-19. Future studies are warranted to determine the dosage and effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation among different populations of individuals with COVID-19.","Peng, Ming-Yieh; Liu, Wen-Chih; Zheng, Jing-Quan; Lu, Chien-Lin; Hou, Yi-Chou; Zheng, Cai-Mei; Song, Jenn-Yeu; Lu, Kuo-Cheng; Chao, You-Chen",Int. j. mol. sci.

The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of the adoption of data-driven innovation. We reflect on how to ensure an appropriate level of protection of individual data and how to maximize public health benefits that can be derived from the collected data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze available COVID-19 contact tracing apps and verify to what extent public health interests and data privacy standards can be fulfilled simultaneously in the process of the adoption of digital health technologies. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE databases, as well as grey literature, was performed to identify available contact tracing apps. Two checklists were developed to evaluate (1) the apps' compliance with data privacy standards and (2) their fulfillment of public health interests. Based on both checklists, a scorecard with a selected set of minimum requirements was created with the goal of estimating whether the balance between the objective of data privacy and public health interests can be achieved in order to ensure the broad adoption of digital technologies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 contact tracing apps were reviewed. In total, 11 criteria were defined to assess the usefulness of each digital technology for public health interests. The most frequently installed features related to contact alerting and governmental accountability. The least frequently installed feature was the availability of a system of medical or organizational support. Only 1 app out of 21 (5%) provided a threshold for the population coverage needed for the digital solution to be effective. In total, 12 criteria were used to assess the compliance of contact tracing apps with data privacy regulations. Explicit user consent, voluntary use, and anonymization techniques were among the most frequently fulfilled criteria. The least often implemented criteria were provisions of information about personal data breaches and data gathered from children. The balance between standards of data protection and public health benefits was achieved best by the COVIDSafe app and worst by the Alipay Health Code app. CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing apps with high levels of compliance with standards of data privacy tend to fulfill public health interests to a limited extent. Simultaneously, digital technologies with a lower level of data privacy protection allow for the collection of more data. Overall, this review shows that a consistent number of apps appear to comply with standards of data privacy, while their usefulness from a public health perspective can still be maximized.","Kolasa, Katarzyna; Mazzi, Francesca; Leszczuk-Czubkowska, Ewa; Zrubka, Zsombor; Péntek, Márta",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,112,20

The underlying mechanisms and risk factors are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine if the bladder wall structure affects the risk of bladder perforation during TUR. METHODS: Fifteen patients who underwent TUR complicated by a bladder perforation (group 1) and fifteen matched controls who underwent uncomplicated TUR (group 2) were retrospectively enrolled in this morphological analysis. Surgical specimens were collected from all participating patients to describe the quality and architecture of urothelium and bladder submucosa. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with primary mouse anti-human E-cadherin, beta-catenin, type IV collagen, cytokeratin 20 and epithelial membrane antigen antibodies. The intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction was assessed using an immunoreactive score (IRS). Ultrastructural examinations were performed by transmission electron microscopy. The microscopic assessment was focused on the intensity of fibrosis in the bladder submucosa and the presence of degenerative changes in the urothelium. RESULTS: Patients' age, sex distribution, tumour diameters, surgeon experience or cancer stage did not differ between study groups. The immunohistochemical analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences between group 1 and group 2. From a clinical point of view, ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy showed a higher rate of severe fibrosis in group 1 (63.6% vs. 38.5%), with no differences in the rate and degree of urothelial changes. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Bladder perforation during TUR is not a result of a deficient structure of the bladder wall. Based on available evidence, the surgical technique seems to play the most important role in its prevention.","Poletajew, Slawomir; Ilczuk, Tomasz; Krajewski, Wojciech; Niemczyk, Grzegorz; Cyran, Agata; Bialek, Lukasz; Radziszewski, Piotr; Górnicka, Barbara; Kryst, Piotr",World J Surg Oncol,112,16

Therefore, fluid administration in patients with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) should be properly guided. Choice of an index to guide fluid management during a pandemic with mass patient admissions carries an additional challenge due to the relatively limited resources. An ideal test for assessment of fluid responsiveness during this pandemic should be accurate in ARDS patients, economic, easy to interpret by junior staff, valid in patients in the prone position and performed with minimal contact with the patient to avoid spread of infection. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS are divided into two phenotypes (L phenotype and H phenotype) according to their lung compliance. Selection of the proper index for fluid responsiveness varies according to the patient phenotype. Heart-lung interaction methods can be used only in patients with L phenotype ARDS. Real-time measures, such a pulse pressure variation, are more appropriate for use during this pandemic compared to ultrasound-derived measures, because contamination of the ultrasound machine can spread infection. Preload challenge tests are suitable for use in all COVID-19 patients. Passive leg raising test is relatively better than mini-fluid challenge test, because it can be repeated without overloading the patient with fluids. Trendelenburg maneuver is a suitable alternative to the passive leg raising test in patients with prone position. If a cardiac output monitor was not available, the response to the passive leg raising test could be traced by measurement of the pulse pressure or the perfusion index. Preload modifying maneuvers, such as tidal volume challenge, can also be used in COVID-19 patients, especially if the patient was in the gray zone of other dynamic tests. However, the preload modifying maneuvers were not extensively evaluated outside the operating room. Selection of the proper test would vary according to the level of healthcare in the country and the load of admissions which might be overwhelming. Evaluation of the volume status should be comprehensive; therefore, the presence of signs of volume overload such as lower limb edema, lung edema, and severe hypoxemia should be considered beside the usual indices for fluid responsiveness.","Hasanin, Ahmed; Mostafa, Maha",J. anesth,112,16

The precise pathophysiological mechanism causing this symptom is unknown. This report describes a case of sudden hearing loss in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, was examined. She experienced sudden hearing loss in her right ear and disabling tinnitus. She underwent combined corticosteroid therapy (oral and intratympanic), resulting in an isolated improvement of 250 kHz in the right ear (from 60 dB, the threshold became 15 dB) and of 4, 6, and 8 kHz in the left ear (from 35 dB, 20 dB, and 35 dB, the thresholds became 15 dB, 5 dB and 20 dB, respectively).

Covid-19 required the urgency of a new psychological intervention model to better address the crisis and ensure a direct support response to the people involved in the pandemic. The present study aimed to detect the symptoms and reactions of the population with respect to the event. The survey was carried out by describing the clinical symptoms that emerged from the triage card used by SIPEM SoS Emilia Romagna (Italy), connoting the criteria of emergency psychology. METHODS: A retrospective quantitative study was conducted on 288 psychological triage cards. RESULTS: only 11% of users who ask for support say they are positive while 85% report not having contracted the virus. Of the total, 40.9% call for psychological support in the management of anxiety symptoms, a need also reported by 55% of the subsample who declared previous psychological problems. In reaction to the pandemic event, 51.1% of the total refers to coping resources and availability for help. DISCUSSIONS: the need for support of the population to manage symptoms highlights the need for early interventions, also to facilitate that slice of the population that does not have effective individual coping strategies and resources available to help. CONCLUSIONS: it can be deduced that interventions during these types of emergencies must be timely and aimed not only at those affected but also at the general population.","Cervellione, Brenda; Rossi, Sandra; Carbone, Roberta; Ferracane, Giuseppina; Lombardo, Ester M C; Pedrelli, Enrica; Sozzi, Anna; Artioli, Giovanna; Sarli, Leopoldo; Iacolino, Calogero",Acta Biomed,112,26

Paralinguistic cues, such as repeated punctuation, are used to compensate for the lack of non-verbal cues in text-based formats. However, it is unclear whether these cues indeed bridge the potential gap between the writer's intentions and the reader's interpretations. A pilot study and two experiments investigated the effect of using repeated punctuation on behavioral intention to assist an email writer in a work-related situation. Findings demonstrate that while the intentions behind using repeated punctuation relate to signaling situational importance or affective state, behavioral intentions are driven by dispositional rather than situational attributions. Specifically, the use of repeated punctuation reduces perceived competence of the message writer and consequently decreases positive behavioral intentions. Overall, the study challenges the simplified view of paralinguistic cues as communication facilitators, highlighting their potential harmful effects on impression formation and behavioral intentions in the digital age.","Sidi, Y.; Glikson, E.; Cheshin, A.",Front Psychol,112,1

Although there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, early recognition and supportive treatment may reduce the mortality. The aim of this study is to develop a functional nomogram that can be used by clinicians to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized and treated for COVID-19 disease, and to compare the accuracy of model predictions with previous nomograms. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 709 patients who were over 18 years old and received inpatient treatment for COVID-19 disease. Multivariable Logistic Regression analysis was performed to assess the possible predictors of a fatal outcome. A nomogram was developed with the possible predictors and total point were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 709 patients treated for COVID-19, 75 (11%) died and 634 survived. The elder age, certain comorbidities (cancer, heart failure, chronic renal failure), dyspnea, lower levels of oxygen saturation and hematocrit, higher levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase and ferritin were independent risk factors for mortality. The prediction ability of total points was excellent (Area Under Curve = 0.922). CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram developed in this study can be used by clinicians as a practical and effective tool in mortality risk estimation. So that with early diagnosis and intervention mortality in COVID-19 patients may be reduced.","Acar, Hazal Cansu; Can, Günay; Karaali, Ridvan; Börekçi, Sermin; Balkan, Ilker Inanç; Gemicioglu, Bilun; Konukoglu, Dildar; Erginöz, Ethem; Erdogan, Mehmet Sarper; Tabak, Fehmi",BMC Infect Dis,112,10

This review outlines the current evidence of the epidemiology of infection in children, the clinical manifestations of disease, the role of children in transmission of the virus and the recently described hyperinflammatory syndrome observed later during the first phase of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: International seroprevalence studies have found younger children to have lower prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating they have not been infected as much as adults. This may be due to shielding by school closures, or by a reduced susceptibility to infection, as indicated by a significantly lower attack rate in children than adults in household contact tracing studies. The most well recognized symptoms in adults of cough, fever, anosmia and ageusia are less frequent in children, who may often present with mild and nonspecific symptoms, or with gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Risk factors for severe disease in children include chronic lung, cardiac or neurological disease, and malignancy. However, the absolute risk still appears very low for these cohorts. A new hyperinflammatory syndrome has emerged with an apparent immune cause. SUMMARY: Important questions remain unanswered regarding why children have mild disease compared with adults; how children of different ages contribute to asymptomatic community transmission of the virus; and the pathophysiology of and most appropriate investigation and treatment strategies for the novel hyperinflammatory syndrome.","Munro, Alasdair P S; Faust, Saul N",Curr Opin Infect Dis,112,20

Pregnant women represent a risk category for increased abortion rates and vertical transmission with adverse events on the newborns has been recently confirmed. The scientific world is struggling for finding an effective cure for counteracting symptomatology. Today, there are many therapeutic proposes but none of them can effectively counteract the infection. Moreover, many of these compounds show important side effects not justifying their use. Scientific literature reports an immune system over-reaction through interleukins- 6 activation. In this regard, the possibility to control the immune system represents a possible strategy for counteracting the onset of COVID-19 symptomatology. Vitamin D deficiency shows increased susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections. Moreover, Vitamin D seems involved in host protection from different virus species by modulating activation and release of cytokines. Myo-inositol down-regulates the expression of IL-6 by phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase pathway. Furthermore, myo-inositol is the precursor of phospholipids in the surfactant and it is applied for inducing surfactant synthesis in infants for treating respiratory distress syndrome. This review aims to summarize the evidence about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and to encourage the scientific community to investigate the use of Vitamin D and Myo-inositol which could represent a possible preventive treatment for pregnant women or women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies. © 2021 Trylyst.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 patients, and require special attention. Limited information is available about its effect in HCWs. Secondary transmission from HCWs is a possibility among patients, family members, and the community. Therefore, it is important to investigate the infection risk of HCWs and the clinical characteristics of affected cases and possible source of infection with exposure details. Methods: The aim of this study is to analyze the medical records of HCWs with COVID-19 retrospectively and carry out the analysis of the data of HCWs with COVID-19 at TNMC and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH, COVID-19 Hospital) in Mumbai. Results: Interim analysis was carried out for the data collected from 6th April to 20th August 2020. Total 3711 HCWs (frontline, 74.32%, non-frontline, 25.68%) are working at NH Mumbai. We observed 11% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, 4% co-infection and 1% mortality. Majority (85%) of the HCWs with COVID-19 were symptomatic and 15% were asymptomatic. Comorbidities were reported in 19% of HCWs with COVID-19. Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus were the most common co-morbidities reported. More than 4% percent of HCWs with COVID-19 were also positive for plasmodium vivax Malaria. Conclusion: The results of the study will be useful for determining the impact of COVID-19 and adverse outcomes in HCWs, identifying probable mode of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. This is required for planning the strategies to handle the epidemic of COVID-19 among HCWs in Mumbai region, and at Maharashtra state level.","Mahajan, Niraj N; Mathe, Apeksha; Patokar, Gauri A; Bahirat, Shubhada; Lokhande, Pradip D; Rakh, Vishal; Gajbhiye, Rahul; Rathi, Surbhi; Tilve, Arundhati; Mahajan, Kshitija; Mohite, Shailesh C",J Assoc Physicians India,112,1

They maintain that the World Health Organization has recently sent the wrong message about the ""pillars"" of PHC in their relationship to UHC. An understanding of political economy is required in order to come to terms with the bases of PHC and the fundamentals of UHC that dealing with inequities is not only an economic issue but fundamentally a political issue. Neoliberal decision-making can enhance inequities in society. Two chronic health conditions, diabetes and multiple sclerosis, are examples of conditions that lead to costly and debilitating consequences for patients but also lead to substantial economic costs in terms of lost workforce participation and lost productivity. These cases demonstrate the socio-political issues involved in the management of care for a number of illnesses. The upsurge of COVID-19 has placed an enormous strain on health and broader social and economic resources and challenged the pretext of UHC as health for all: substantial differences in equity and political commitment have emerged. Sturmberg and Martin argue that the joining of UHC and PHC needs leadership, which involves local communities and resourcing. PHC is a changing system based on power relationships involving funders and the health community. In Australia as in several countries, out-of-pocket costs have grown rapidly and have affected access for some groups to PHC and have challenged the pretext of equity in UHC. In the context of PHC and UHC, we support the position that health for all goes beyond health care for all, to embrace healthy lives promoting wellbeing.","Walker, Christine; Peterson, Chris L",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice (Online),112,0

The control-value theory of achievement emotions has emerged as a useful framework for examining the antecedents and consequences of different emotions that students experience in online learning. The purpose of the present study was to validate the assumptions of the control-value theory in an asynchronous online graduate program, and to examine the role of emotional intelligence in this social-cognitive process. Data were collected from 102 graduate students enrolled at a public university in the United States. Results showed that online self-efficacy was a significant predictor of achievement emotions (enjoyment and anxiety). However, student value appraisals of the online program only predicted anxiety. Hierarchical regression analyses also revealed that only anxiety was a significant predictor of self-regulated learning. Further moderation analyses were conducted and showed that emotional intelligence moderated the relationships between achievement emotions and self-regulated learning. The implications for research, theory, and practice are discussed.

With the emergence of this new quantum industry, a new workforce trained in QIST skills and knowledge is needed. To help support education and training of this workforce, universities and colleges require knowledge of the type of jobs available for their students and what skills and degrees are most relevant for those new jobs. Additionally, students need to know how to tailor their degrees to best align with the current needs of the quantum industry. We report on the results from a survey of 57 companies in the quantum industry, with the goal of elucidating the jobs, skills, and degrees that are relevant for this new workforce. We find a range of job opportunities from highly specific jobs, such as quantum algorithm developer and error correction scientist, to broader jobs categories within the business, software, and hardware sectors. These broader jobs require a range of skills, most of which are not quantum related. Further, except for the highly specific jobs, companies that responded to the survey are looking for a range of degree levels to fill these new positions, from bachelors to masters to PhDs. With this knowledge, students, instructors, and university administrators can make informed decisions about how to address the challenge of increasing the future quantum workforce.","Hughes, Ciaran; Finke, Doug; German, Dan-Adrian; Merzbacher, Celia; Vora, Patrick M.; Lewandowski, H.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study between October 2010 and December 2017. Transvaginal mesh surgery was performed in patients with symptomatic anterior and/or apical prolapse (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification &#8805; stage 2). The primary outcome was rate of severe surgical complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (defined as grade &#8805;3), and the secondary outcome was the anatomical success at the last postoperative follow-up visit. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-six patients were included, 289 of these patients underwent anterior sacrospinous fixation with uterine preservation, 50 had a previous hysterectomy and 57 underwent a concomitant hysterectomy. The median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range, 7 months). The rate of severe complications was 2.1%, 6.0%, and 5.3% in the uterine preservation group, previous hysterectomy group, and concomitant hysterectomy group, respectively (P = 0.2). The operative time was significantly higher in the concomitant hysterectomy group, and the mesh exposure rate was significantly higher in the previous hysterectomy group. The overall recurrence rate was 7.6%, with no differences between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant and previous hysterectomy did not appear to increase the severe complication rate or anatomical failure after transvaginal mesh surgery. However, a history of hysterectomy appears to be a risk factor for vaginal mesh exposure. This must be considered in the choice between prosthetic and autologous management options for the treatment of posthysterectomy vault prolapse.","Breton, Florence; Abdirahman, Syad; Fatton, Brigitte; Calletwaert, Geertje; de Tayrac, Renaud; Allegre, Lucie",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

BACKGROUND: Regulatory resources help employees manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours on a daily basis. On days when these resources are low, employees may engage in maladaptive self-regulation: more self-undermining (i.e. creating additional obstacles) and less job crafting (i.e. optimizing job demands and resources), which debilitates their work performance. We expected that self-regulation is impaired especially when individuals exhibit low motivation and low ability to regulate their behaviour, that is, when they experience elevated burnout. DESIGN: This research used a daily diary design. Nurses responded to a general survey and then completed daily diary surveys in three different moments: before, during and after work for 10 consecutive workdays (total reports N = 732). METHOD: A sample of 81 nurses from Polish hospitals and primary healthcare centres completed self-reported questionnaires between January and March 2018. Hypotheses were tested using multilevel modelling in Mplus. RESULTS: Momentary self-regulatory capacity before work was negatively related to self-undermining and positively related to job crafting, and it indirectly predicted daily job performance. As hypothesized, these indirect relationships were moderated by general, chronic burnout. We found that only for employees with low levels of burnout, daily self-regulation was linked with better functioning via increased job crafting and decreased self-undermining. CONCLUSION: Chronic burnout disturbs day-to-day behaviour regulation. Individuals with elevated burnout symptoms have difficulty to translate momentary boosts in regulatory resources into adaptive strategies that are linked with higher performance. IMPACT: Our findings call for better recovery programmes, strategic Human Resource Management practices aimed at reducing factors that deplete daily self-regulatory resources, and finally top-down interventions preventing burnout among employees in the healthcare system.","Roczniewska, Marta; Bakker, Arnold B",J. adv. nurs,112,0

OBJECTIVE: To understand the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes associated with COVID-19 infection, this study will longitudinally track changes in chemosensory acuity among people with suspected COVID-19 infection using standardized test stimuli that are self-administered over 28 days. METHODS: In a prospective, case-controlled observational study, volunteers will be recruited when they present for COVID-19 screening by respiratory tract polymerase chain reaction test (""swab test""). The volunteers will initially complete a series of questionnaires to record their recent changes in smell and taste ability, followed by a brief standardized smell and taste test. Participants will receive a home-use smell and taste test kit to prospectively complete daily self-assessments of their smell and taste acuity at their place of residence for up to 4 weeks, with all data submitted for collection through web-based software. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore, and is funded by the Biomedical Research Council Singapore COVID-19 Research Fund. Recruitment began on July 23, 2020, and will continue through to March 31, 2021. As of October 2, 2020, 69 participants had been recruited. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to collect longitudinal data on changes to smell and taste sensitivity related to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR swab test, in a population-based cohort. The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaire-based methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.

Methods: A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. Results: 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 0.87%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 0.56 to 0.60%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). Conclusion: Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population.","Michelena, Xabier; Borrell, Helena; López-Corbeto, Mireia; López-Lasanta, María; Moreno, Estefanía; Pascual-Pastor, María; Erra, Alba; Serrat, Mayte; Espartal, Esther; Antón, Susana; Añez, Gustavo Adolfo; Caparrós-Ruiz, Raquel; Pluma, Andrea; Trallero-Araguás, Ernesto; Barceló-Bru, Mireia; Almirall, Miriam; De Agustín, Juan José; Lladós, Jordi; Julià, Antonio; Marsal, Sara",Semin Arthritis Rheum,112,22

Inappropriate marketing of breastmilk substitutes (BMS), feeding bottles, and teats threatens the enabling environment of breastfeeding, and exacerbates child mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition, especially in the context of COVID-19. These tactics also violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. This study identified marketing tactics of BMS companies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by reviewing promotional materials and activities from 9 companies in 14 countries, and the official Code reporting data from the Philippines. Eight qualitative themes emerged that indicate companies are capitalizing on fear related to COVID-19 by using health claims and misinformation about breastfeeding. Other promotional tactics such as donations and services were used to harness the public sentiment of hope and solidarity. Past studies show that these tactics are not new, but the pandemic has provided a new entry point, helped along by the unprecedented boom in digital marketing. There was a sharp increase of reported violations in the Philippines since the pandemic: 291 during the first months of the outbreak compared with 70 in all of 2019, corroborating the thematic findings. A lack of public awareness about the harm of donations and inadequate Code implementation and enforcement have exacerbated these problems. Proposed immediate action includes using monitoring findings to inform World Health Assembly (WHA) actions, targeted enforcement, and addressing misinformation about breastfeeding in the context of COVID-19. Longer-term action includes holding social media platforms accountable, raising public awareness on the Code, and mobilizing community monitoring.","Ching, Constance; Zambrano, Paul; Nguyen, Tuan T; Tharaney, Manisha; Zafimanjaka, Maurice Gerald; Mathisen, Roger",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),112,26

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is the key in containing the pandemic and breaking the chain of transmission. In low- and middle-income countries availability of testing kits has become the major bottleneck in testing. Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to evaluate a novel protocol of pooling of RNA samples/elutes in performance of PCR for SARS CoV-2 virus. STUDY DESIGN: Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. RESULTS: The present study demonstrated that pool testing with RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. CONCLUSION: Pooling of RNA samples can reduce the time and expense, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gupta, Ekta; Padhi, Abhishek; Khodare, Arvind; Agarwal, Reshu; Ramachandran, Krithiga; Mehta, Vibha; Kilikdar, Mousumi; Dubey, Shantanu; Kumar, Guresh; Sarin, Shiv Kumar",PLoS One,112,24

Influenza often has rapid onset and relatively short duration, both in the individual and in the population. The case fatality rate varies for different strains of the virus, as do the effects on total mortality. Outbreaks related to coronavirus infections have recently become a global concern but much less is known about the dynamics of these outbreaks and their effects on mortality. In this work, disease outbreaks in Sweden, in the time period of 1860-2020, are characterized and compared to the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The focus is on outbreaks with a sharp increase in all-cause mortality. Outbreak onset is defined as the time point when death counts start to increase consistently for a period of at least 10 days. The duration of the outbreak is defined as the time period in which mortality rates are elevated. Excess mortality is estimated by standard methods. In total there were 15 outbreaks detected in the time period, the first 14 were likely caused by influenza virus infections, the last by SARS-CoV-2. The mortality dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is shown to be similar to outbreaks due to influenza virus, and in terms of the number of excess deaths, it is the worst outbreak in Sweden since the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919.","Ledberg, Anders",Front Public Health,112,22

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication. METHODS: An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms ""Covid-19 skin,"" ""Covid-19 rash,"" ""Covid-19 exanthem,"" and ""Covid-19 chilblains."" Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease. As a potential correlate to disease severity, prognosis, or infectibility, it is critical that all healthcare professionals be well versed in these increasingly common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.","Daneshgaran, Giulia; Dubin, Danielle P; Gould, Daniel J",Am J Clin Dermatol,112,24

We assessed the COVID-19 pandemics impact on time to treatment initiation (TTI) and treatment selection for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic solid cancer. MethodsWe used an electronic health record-derived longitudinal database curated via technology-enabled abstraction to identify 14,136 US patients newly diagnosed with de novo or recurrent metastatic solid cancer between January 1 and July 31 in 2019 or 2020. Patients received care at [~]280 predominantly community-based oncology practices. Controlled interrupted time series analyses assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period (April-July 2020) on TTI, defined as the number of days from metastatic diagnosis to receipt of first-line systemic therapy, and use of myelosuppressive therapy. ResultsThe adjusted probability of treatment within 30 days of diagnosis [95% confidence interval] was similar across periods: January-March 2019 41.7% [32.2%, 51.1%]; April-July 2019 42.6% [32.4%, 52.7%]; January-March 2020 44.5% [30.4%, 58.6%]; April-July 2020 46.8% [34.6%, 59.0%]; adjusted percentage-point difference-in-differences 1.4% [-2.7%, 5.5%]. Among 5,962 patients who received first-line systemic therapy, there was no association between the pandemic period and use of myelosuppressive therapy (adjusted percentage-point difference-in-differences 1.6% [-2.6%, 5.8%]). There was no meaningful effect modification by cancer type, race, or age.

Symptoms of long-COVID include fatigue, dyspnea, gastrointestinal and cardiac problems, cognitive impairments, myalgia, and others. While the possible causes of long-COVID include long-term tissue damage, viral persistence, and chronic inflammation, the review proposes, perhaps for the first time, that persistent brainstem dysfunction may also be involved. This hypothesis can be split into two parts. The first is the brainstem tropism and damage in COVID-19. As the brainstem has a relatively high expression of ACE2 receptor compared with other brain regions, SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit tropism therein. Evidence also exists that neuropilin-1, a co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2, may be expressed in the brainstem. Indeed, autopsy studies have found SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in the brainstem. The brainstem is also highly prone to damage from pathological immune or vascular activation, which has also been observed in autopsy of COVID-19 cases. The second part concerns functions of the brainstem that overlap with symptoms of long-COVID. The brainstem contains numerous distinct nuclei and subparts that regulate the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and neurological processes, which can be linked to long-COVID. As neurons do not readily regenerate, brainstem dysfunction may be long-lasting and, thus, is long-COVID. Indeed, brainstem dysfunction has been implicated in other similar disorders, such as chronic pain and migraine and myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome.","Yong, Shin Jie",ACS Chem Neurosci,112,16

Limited information exists regarding the interrelationship between CD47 expression and tumour-associated macrophage-related immuno-microenvironment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These factors may predict novel immunotherapy efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD47 and PD-L1 expression was retrospectively assessed in 191 resected NSCLC specimens via immunohistochemistry. Forty-six patients with pulmonary infectious diseases were enrolled as the control group. The infiltration of macrophages (M2 and M1) and CD8+ T-lymphocytes was evaluated via dual-immunofluorescence staining. Targeted DNA sequencing was performed on NSCLC specimens. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model. RESULTS: Using 2+/3+ as a CD47 positive (CD47pos) expression cut-off, the prevalence of CD47pos expression in NSCLC was 33.0% (63/191), significantly higher than in pulmonary infectious diseases. CD47pos expression was significantly higher in female, non-smoking and adenocarcinoma patients (p=0.020, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, CD47pos expression was significantly correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (p<0.001). The expression of CD47 (H-score) in NSCLC was negatively correlated with tumour PD-L1 expression (p=0.0346) and tumour mutation burden (p=0.0107). CD47pos expression was independently correlated with poor disease-free survival in patients with resected NSCLC in multivariate Cox regression analysis (p=0.035). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the demographic, molecular and immuno-microenvironment characteristics of CD47 expression in NSCLC. We identified tumour CD47pos expression as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence in resected NSCLC. Our findings illustrate the potential of anti-CD47 treatment in NSCLC.","Xu, Yan; Li, Ji; Tong, Bing; Chen, Minjiang; Liu, Xiaoyan; Zhong, Wei; Zhao, Jing; Wang, Mengzhao",,112,1

No clear data are available concerning this question based on T-category. METHODS: Two groups of patients with esophagectomy and high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy for eAC were analyzed: hybrid (laparoscopy + right thoracotomy) (n = 835) and open (laparotomy + right thoracotomy) (n = 188). Outcome criteria were 30- and 90-day mortality, R0-resection rate (R0), number of resected lymph nodes (rLNs), and 5-year survival rate (5y-SR). For each type of surgery, three patient groups were analyzed: pT1-carcinoma (group-1), cT3Nx and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (group-2), and pT3N0-3 without neoadjuvant therapy (group-3). The comparison was based on a propensity score matching in relation of 1:2 for open versus hybrid. RESULTS: In group-1 (38 open vs 76 hybrid) R0-resection (100%), 30-day mortality (0%), 90-day mortality (2.6% vs 0%), and rLNs (median 29.5 vs 28.5) were not significantly different. The pN0-rate was 76% in the open and 92% in the hybrid group (p = 0.036). Accordingly, the 5y-SR was 69% and 87% (p = 0.016), but the prognosis of the subgroups pT1pN0 or pT1pN+ was not significantly different between open or hybrid. In group-2 (68 open vs 135 hybrid) R0-resection (97%), 30-day (0% vs 0.7%) and 90-day (4%) mortality, rLNs (28.5 vs 26), and 5y-SR (36% vs 41%) were not significantly different. In group-3 (37 open vs 75 hybrid) R0, postoperative mortality, rLNs, and 5y-SR were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: In a propensity score-matched comparison of patients with an open or hybrid esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma the quality of oncologic resection, postoperative mortality and prognosis are not different.","Hölscher, Arnulf H; DeMeester, Tom R; Schmidt, Henner; Berlth, Felix; Bollschweiler, Elfriede",Langenbeck&#039;s arch. surg,112,16

METHODS: The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database. Genes related to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were queried on the GeneCards database. The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). RESULTS: CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19.

These deny communities of the plausible supply of resources from FS. This paper assesses the perception underpinning the occurrence of nonfaecal matter in FS in Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 400 respondents in four communities in Brong Ahafo and Greater Accra Regions of Ghana, using a structured questionnaire. Data were analysed by using STATA software version 15. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were conducted on all independent variables and statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The study identified the following as the most perceived frequently disposed nonfaecal matter into FS: sanitary pads and diapers (38.5%), fabrics/rags (23.2%), toilet rolls (20.8%), razor/shaving sticks (10.3%), and others (7.2%). Gender, state of toilet facility (roof or unroofed), presence of container for collecting other types of waste in the toilet room, and state of container in toilet room either covered or uncovered were the factors found to be significantly associated with the disposal of solid waste (SW) into FS at 95% confidence level. The fear of exposing used sanitary materials for rituals, the use of fabric as an alternative to toilet rolls, and the desire to conceal aborted pregnancies from the public were some of the reasons alluded to the disposal acts. Education and awareness campaigns on proper SW disposal practices, appropriate use of toilet facilities, and the resource potentials of FS were found to be the best way forward to discourage indiscriminate disposal of SW into FS.","Quarshie, Ama Mbeaba; Gyasi, Samuel Fosu; Kuranchie, Francis Atta; Awuah, Esi; Darteh, Eugene",J Environ Public Health,112,1

Upon exposure to physiological or environmental fluids, it is likely that protein nanoparticles, like synthetic nanoparticles, will adsorb proteins and this protein corona will be dependent on the surface properties of the protein nanoparticles. As there is little understanding of this phenomenon for engineered protein nanoparticles, the purpose of this work was to create protein nanoparticles with variable surface hydrophobicity and surface charge and establish the effect of these properties on the mass and composition of the adsorbed corona, using the fetal bovine serum as a model physiological solution. Albumin, cationic albumin, and ovalbumin cross-linked nanoparticles were developed for this investigation and their adsorbed protein coronas were isolated and characterized by gel electrophoresis and nanoliquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Distinct trends in corona mass and composition were identified for protein nanoparticles based on surface charge and surface hydrophobicity. Proteomic analyses revealed unique protein corona patterns and identified distinct proteins that are known to affect nanoparticle clearance in vivo. Further, the protein corona influenced nanoparticle internalization in vitro in a macrophage cell line. Altogether, these results demonstrate the strong effect protein identity and properties have on the corona formed on nanoparticles made from that protein. This work builds the foundation for future study of protein coronas on the wide array of protein nanoparticles used in nanomedicine and environmental applications.","Pustulka, Samantha M; Ling, Kevin; Pish, Stephanie L; Champion, Julie A",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,112,20

Little is known about public knowledge, beliefs and behaviors in-relation to the pandemic in Nepal. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 among the general public and to identify associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May-June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID-19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure strength and direction of relationships. Results: Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively, but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r = 0.19, p < 0.01) and attitude-practice (r = 0.08, p < 0.05). The relationship between knowledge and education was fairly strong (r = 0.34, p < 0.01).

High mortality (50-97%) was proposed by some groups, leading to considerable uncertainties with regard to outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and MV. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective observational cohort study at 15 hospitals in Hamburg, Germany, was performed. Critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who completed their ICU stay between February and June 2020 were included. Patient demographics, severity of illness, and ICU course were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 223 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. The majority, 73% (n = 163), were men; the median age was 69 (interquartile range = 58-77.5) years, with 68% (n = 151) patients having at least one chronic medical condition. Their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was a median of 5 (3-9) points on admission. Overall, 167 (75%) patients needed MV. Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula were used in 31 (14%) and 26 (12%) patients, respectively. Subsequent MV, due to noninvasive ventilation/high-flow nasal cannula therapy failure, was necessary in 46 (81%) patients. Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 33% (n = 72) of patients, and owing to severe respiratory failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary in 9% (n = 20) of patients. Experimental antiviral therapy was used in 9% (n = 21) of patients.

High mortality (50-97%) was proposed by some groups, leading to considerable uncertainties with regard to outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and MV. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective observational cohort study at 15 hospitals in Hamburg, Germany, was performed. Critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who completed their ICU stay between February and June 2020 were included. Patient demographics, severity of illness, and ICU course were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 223 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. The majority, 73% (n = 163), were men; the median age was 69 (interquartile range = 58-77.5) years, with 68% (n = 151) patients having at least one chronic medical condition. Their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was a median of 5 (3-9) points on admission. Overall, 167 (75%) patients needed MV. Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula were used in 31 (14%) and 26 (12%) patients, respectively. Subsequent MV, due to noninvasive ventilation/high-flow nasal cannula therapy failure, was necessary in 46 (81%) patients. Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 33% (n = 72) of patients, and owing to severe respiratory failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary in 9% (n = 20) of patients. Experimental antiviral therapy was used in 9% (n = 21) of patients. Complications during the ICU stay were as follows: septic shock (40%, n = 90), heart failure (8%, n = 17), and pulmonary embolism (6%, n = 14). The length of ICU stay was a median of 13 days (5-24), and the duration of MV was 15 days (8-25). The ICU mortality was 35% (n = 78) and 44% (n = 74) among mechanically ventilated patients.

This case-control study aimed to (a) document the prevalence of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) in eating disorders, (b) examine the specific impact of disordered eating behaviors on the risk of DGBI, and (c) explore the impact of current eating disorder psychopathology on DGBI. METHOD: We included 765 cases with eating disorders and 1,240 controls. DGBI were assessed via the ROME III questionnaire. Prevalences of DGBI were calculated across eating disorder diagnoses (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and multiple eating disorders) and in controls. The association between disordered eating behaviors and DGBI was examined using logistic regression models. Lastly, we compared the total number of DGBI in individuals with high versus low current eating disorder symptoms. RESULTS: A large majority (88.2-95.5%) of individuals with eating disorders reported at least one DGBI and 34.8-48.7% reported three or more DGBI. Of the DGBI categories, functional bowel disorders were the most commonly endorsed category, and of the individual DGBI, irritable bowel syndrome was the most frequently reported (43.9-58.8%). All investigated disordered eating behaviors showed a positive association with most DGBI categories. Finally, individuals reporting high current eating disorder symptoms reported higher mean number of DGBI (3.03-3.34) than those with low current symptoms (1.60-1.84). DISCUSSION: The directionality and mechanisms underlying the nature of the relationship between gastrointestinal and eating disorder symptoms is worthy of further study and clinicians should adopt an integrated approach by attending to both gastrointestinal and eating disorder symptoms in their patients.","Wiklund, Camilla A; Rania, Marianna; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf; Thornton, Laura M; Bulik, Cynthia M",Int. j. eat. disord,112,2

Materials: This was a retrospective study conducted from March 9 until 11 May 2020, in the breast unit at the department of radiology of a central university hospital in a Middle-Eastern developing country. Data were collected from 205 patients visiting the breast unit during the lockdown period and compared with the activity in the same period in the previous year. Results: Reduction of the breast unit activity was estimated at 73%. In addition, 153 mammograms, 205 ultrasounds, and 16 breast MRIs were done. Indications for mammogram were screening (41.5%), follow-up (22%), clinical symptoms (20%) and breast cancer surveillance (16.5%). MRI was performed mostly for preoperative surgical management. The rate of positive biopsies was 41%. All staff members and patients have accommodated to new adjustments. Conclusion: Activity in the breast unit dropped during the lockdown period. Staff should continue to seek their own and their patient's safety without diminishing the quality of healthcare.","Salem, Christine; Hajj, Marie-Ange; Kourié, Hampig; Haddad, Antoine; Khaddage, Abir; Ayoub, Eliane Nasser; Jabbour, Khalil; Moubarak, Malak; Atallah, David",Future Oncol,112,16

The identification of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) challenged the preexisting paradigm of how inflammation ends. Rather than a passive process, the resolution of inflammation relies on the active production of SPMs, such as Lipoxins (Lx), Maresins, protectins, and Resolvins. LXA4 is an SPM that exerts its action through ALX/FPR2 receptor. Stable ALX/FPR2 agonists are required because SPMs can be quickly metabolized within tissues near the site of formation. BML-111 is a commercially available synthetic ALX/FPR2 receptor agonist with analgesic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on that, we aimed to determine the effect of BML-111 in a model of UVB-induced skin inflammation in hairless mice. We demonstrated that BML-111 ameliorates the signs of UVB-induced skin inflammation by reducing neutrophil recruitment and mast cell activation. Reduction of these cells by BML-111 led to lower number of sunburn cells formation, decrease in epidermal thickness, collagen degradation, cytokine production (TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, TGF, and IL-10), and oxidative stress (observed by an increase in total antioxidant capacity and Nrf2 signaling pathway), indicating that BML-111 might be a promising drug to treat skin disorders.","Martinez, Renata M; Fattori, Victor; Saito, Priscila; Pinto, Ingrid C; Rodrigues, Camilla C A; Melo, Cristina P B; Bussmann, Allan J C; Staurengo-Ferrari, Larissa; Bezerra, Julia Rojo; Vignoli, Josiane A; Baracat, Marcela M; Georgetti, Sandra R; Verri, Waldiceu A; Casagrande, Rubia",Molecules (Basel),112,26

Past work has revealed that perceived stress relates to poorer outcomes, however, little work to date has examined factors that may exacerbate these outcomes, and no work to date has examined this relation in terms of COVID-19. Anxiety sensitivity is a promising individual difference factor that has shown to be related to mental health and functional impairment. Anxiety Sensitivity is also a vulnerability factor related to heightened stress perception. Method: Therefore, the current study sought to examine the potential moderating role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between COVID-19 specific perceived stress and global anxiety symptom severity, anxious arousal symptom severity, and functional impairment among 563 adults (58.1% male; M age = 38.3 years; SD = 12.15). Results: Results indicated a statistically significant interaction between COVID-19 perceived stress and anxiety sensitivity with global anxiety symptom severity, anxious arousal symptom severity, and functional impairment. Post-hoc analysis indicated that COVID-19 perceived stress was associated with an increased likelihood of clinically significant global anxiety symptom severity and anxious arousal symptom severity at higher levels of anxiety sensitivity. Conclusions: The current study provides support for the role of anxiety sensitivity in identifying individuals at risk for clinically significant global anxiety symptom severity and anxious arousal symptom severity.","Manning, Kara; Eades, Natasha D; Kauffman, Brooke Y; Long, Laura J; Richardson, Angela L; Garey, Lorra; Zvolensky, Michael J; Gallagher, Matthew W",Cognit Ther Res,112,16

Respiratory tract manifestations are the most common symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) like nausea or sickness, diarrhea, and anorexia, and psychological effects may be reported in affected individuals. However, similar symptoms may be observed in healthy people as a consequence of an anxiety state. METHODS: We analyzed GISs and anxiety state during the COVID-19 lockdown period; from 9 March 2020 to 4 May 2020. A web-based survey consisting of 131 items was administered to 354 students affiliated with the School of Medicine of the University ""Magna Graecia"" of Catanzaro; Italy. A set of statistical analyses was performed to analyze the relationships among the answers to assess a correlation between the topics of interest. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that 54.0% of interviewed reported at least one GISs, 36.16% of which reported a positive history for familial GISs (FGISs). The 354 subjects included in our cohort may be stratified as follows: 25.99% GISs and FGISs, 27.97% GISs and no-FGISs, 10.17% no-GISs and FGISs, 35.87% no-GISs and no-FGISs. Results indicated an anxiety state for 48.9% of respondents, of which 64.74% also presented GISs. In addition, considered dietary habits, we detect the increased consumption of hypercaloric food, sweetened drinks, and alcoholic beverages.

These guidelines were based on early experience of what worked in nursing homes across the country. This article summarises the main learning points. The initial priority of the Dean was to formulate and implement a prevention and control plan specific to their home. The material procurement team was responsible for the purchase of medical supplies, food and daily necessities. The psychological intervention team was responsible for ongoing psychological support and crisis intervention to staff and residents. The isolation team was responsible for the management of residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The disinfection team was responsible for the disinfection of rooms, public places and elevators. Deans are the people who are ordinarily appointed to manage nursing homes, and during the epidemic, they have overall responsibility for the prevention and control of the epidemic. All visitors to the homes were made aware these regulations and the reasons for which entry was permitted and prohibited. The nursing homes were divided into a 'red' and 'green' zones and staff allocated to just one of these areas to avoid cross-infection. During the epidemic, nursing homes discontinued group meals and supported individual meals to avoid crowding. Rapid contact tracing enabled us to identify other residents in the home who were at risk of COVID-19 and test them for SARS-CoV-2. At present, the measures nursing homes have taken have achieved some results. There have, though, been some difficulties and challenges. For example, the problem of shortage of personal protective equipment gradually emerged. Also, the normal operation and of the nursing homes was made difficult by the excessive focus on managing and preventing spread of COVID. The balance between pandemic management and day-to-day continuity of service provision will need to be accommodated more fully in future revisions of the guidance.","Wang, LiNing Qi Na Zhou YuQiu Zhang Hui",Age and Ageing,112,26

In this regard, the flammability of trees is a topic of great interest for ecology, management, and the development of sustainable restoration and rehabilitation plans. Tree species differ in regard to flammability, and many plant functional traits contribute to flammability at species, community and vegetation level. The relationship between plant traits and flammability at species level is important for a broader understanding of the vegetation-fire dynamic at the local and landscape scales. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of individual plant traits of tree species on flammability components. By keywords-based searching of academic databases, 85 research papers were collected and analyzed. The literature synthesis shows: i) main issues addressed in studies on plant trait-based tree flammability, ii) general research output and biogeographic regions studied, iii) inventory of tree taxa investigated, iv) relationships between plant traits and flammability components, v) the most relevant plant traits that determine the flammability-related differences between species.","Popovic, Zorica; Bojovic, Srdjan; Markovic, Milena; Cerdà, Artemi",Sci Total Environ,112,26

The severe lung disease caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, is one of the many causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused more than three million deaths worldwide and has challenged all therapeutic options for mechanical ventilation. Thus, new therapies are necessary to prevent deaths and long-term complications of severe lung diseases and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The authors of the present report have developed a novel device that allows selective lobe ventilation and selective lobe recruitment and provides a new platform for pulmonary drug delivery. A major advantage of separating lobes that are mechanically heterogeneous is to allow for customization of ventilator parameters to match the needs of segments with similar compliance, a better overall ventilation perfusion relationship, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury of more compliant lobes. This device accounts for lung heterogeneity and is a potential new therapy for acute lung injury by allowing selective lobe mechanical ventilation using two novel modes of mechanical ventilation (differential positive end-expiratory pressure and asynchronous ventilation), and two new modalities of alveolar recruitment (selective lobe recruitment and continuous positive airway pressure of lower lobes with continuous ventilation of upper lobes). Herein the authors report their initial experience with this novel device, including a brief overview of device development; the initial in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo testing; layout of future research; potential benefits and new therapies; and expected challenges before its uniform implementation into clinical practice.","Maracaja, Luiz; Khanna, Ashish K; Royster, Roger; Maracaja, Danielle; Lane, Magan; Jordan, James Eric",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,112,1

A previously validated, anonymous and online questionnaire was applied to a non-probabilistic sample of Portuguese teachers. In addition to the socio-demographic and professional variables, the questionnaire measured subjective and professional well-being, satisfaction with the education system and future perspectives regarding the professional circumstances. The psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire were analysed, the t-test and ANOVA were used to analyse the differences between the main variables and the socio-demographic and professional characteristics, along with the generalized linear model in order to more precisely determine the predicting factors of teachers' professional well-being. The results showed that the majority of respondents have a moderately positive perception of well-being. Teachers were satisfied with the education system before the pandemic. The pandemic has reduced the perception of well-being in the face of the profession, creating some concern among teachers about their professional future. Sex, length of service, well-being, perceptions of teaching difficulties and future perspectives proved to be predictors of professional well-being in times of pandemic. This study provided scientific bases for the development of interventions that improve the professional well-being of teachers, which focus on emotional management and the development of digital skills in teachers with long careers. This piece of research concluded with thorough evidence that there is a need for further and stronger investment in public policies for the reform and, consequently, for the renewal of the teaching class.","Alves, R.; Lopes, T.; Precioso, J.",Ijeri-International Journal of Educational Research and Innovation,112,24

During wet years, high precipitation disproportionately contributes to P losses. We combine simulations of a gridded crop model and outputs from a number of hydrological and climate models to assess global impacts of changes in precipitation regimes on P losses during the 21st century. Under the baseline climate during 1991-2010, median P losses are 2.7 ± 0.5 kg P ha-1 year-1 over global croplands of four major crops, while during wet years, P losses are 3.6 ± 0.7 kg P ha-1 year-1. By the end of this century, P losses in wet years would reach 4.2 ± 1.0 (RCP2.6) and 4.7 ± 1.3 (RCP8.5) kg P ha-1 year-1 due to increases in high annual precipitation alone. The increases in P losses are the highest (up to 200%) in the arid regions of Middle East, Central Asia, and northern Africa. Consequently, in three quarters of the world's river basins, representing about 40% of total global runoff and home up to 7 billion people, P dilution capacity of freshwater could be exceeded due to P losses from croplands by the end of this century.","Liu, Wenfeng; Ciais, Philippe; Liu, Xingcai; Yang, Hong; Hoekstra, Arjen Y; Tang, Qiuhong; Wang, Xuhui; Li, Xiaodong; Cheng, Lei",Environ Sci Technol,112,23

Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a>2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (~90min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50keV to 5MeV electrons with deltaE/E<40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a ~72cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5Hz Nyquist (nominally) with<0.3nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1Hz. The spinning satellites (T_spin~3s) are equipped with magnetorquers that permit spin-up/down and reorientation maneuvers. The spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane, allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250keV-5MeV ions, addressing secondary science.

Also termed mitochondrial nutrients (MNs), these cofactors have demonstrated specific protective actions in a number of chronic disorders, as assessed in a well-established body of literature. METHODS: Using PubMed, the authors searched for articles containing information on the utilization of MNs in inflammatory disorders as assessed from in vitro and animal studies, and in clinical trials, in terms of exerting anti-inflammatory actions. RESULTS: The retrieved literature provided evidence relating acute pathologic conditions, such as sepsis and pneumonia, with a number of redox endpoints of biological and clinical relevance. Among these findings, both ALA and CARN were effective in counteracting inflammation-associated redox biomarkers, while CoQ10 showed decreased levels in proinflammatory conditions. MN-associated antioxidant actions were applied in a number of acute disorders, mostly using one MN. The body of literature assessing the safety and the complementary roles of MNs taken together suggests an adjuvant role of MN combinations in counteracting oxidative stress in sepsis and other acute disorders, including COVID-19-associated pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present state of art in the use of individual MNs in acute disorders suggests planning adjuvant therapy trials utilizing MN combinations aimed at counteracting proinflammatory conditions, as in the case of pneumonia and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pagano, Giovanni; Manfredi, Carla; Pallardó, Federico V; Lyakhovich, Alex; Tiano, Luca; Trifuoggi, Marco",Inflamm Res,112,1

However, the reasons for the changes in mutation patterns are still unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of over 300 million peptides derived from 13,432 SARS-CoV-2 strains harboring 4,420 amino acid mutations to analyze the potential selective pressure of the host immune system and reveal the driver of mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The results showed that the nonstructural protein ORF1ab and the structural protein Spike were most susceptible to mutations. Furthermore, mutations in cross-reactive T-cell epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronavirus may help SARS-CoV-2 to escape cellular immunity under long-term and large-scale community transmission. Additionally, through homology modeling and protein docking, mutations in Spike protein may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells and escape antibody-mediated B-cell immunity. Our research provided insights into the potential mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 under natural selection, improved our understanding of the evolution of the virus, and established important guidance for potential vaccine design.","Zhang, C.; Jin, X.; Chen, X.; Qiu, L.; Leng, Q.; Qiu, T.",Frontiers in Microbiology,112,32

Given that the highest viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found in the airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk of infection. As a result, multiple recommendations have emerged regarding protective measures for surgical teams, including suspending non-urgent procedures and surgeries. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology residency training programs nationwide. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was completed in April 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey, sent by email to all Chilean otolaryngology residents. Demographics, clinical activities, on-call shifts, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to COVID-19 patients, deployment to other specialties, diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and surgeries performed were analyzed. Self-reported surgical data logs from previous years were used to compare results. Results: Forty-seven residents completed the survey (84% response rate); 64% of residents refer seeing patients ten days or less during April 2020. Commonly performed procedures such as flexible nasolaryngoscopy, rigid nasal endoscopy, and peritonsillar abscess drainage were not performed by over 40% of the residents in that month. Only 38% participated in surgeries, with an average of 0.6 surgeries as a first surgeon, a dramatic decrease in surgical exposure when comparing the data logs from previous years. Most residents refer the following measures taken by their residency program to improve residency training: bibliographic videoconferences (87%), online clinical case seminars (60%), weekly journal clubs (38%), among others. Conclusions: Clinical and surgical opportunities decreased dramatically during April 2020. Adjustments to the regular academic curricula should be considered to decrease the negative impact of this pandemic on residency training.","Álvarez, Matías L; Waissbluth, Sofia; González, Claudia; Napolitano, Carla; Torrente, Mariela; Délano, Paul H; Alarcón, Ricardo; Fernández, Francisca; Bitrán, Roger",Medwave,112,1

Specifically, first we explain how to obtain the best investment portfolio with a given target risk. This is important in order to produce portfolios with different risk profiles, as typically offered by financial institutions. Second, we show how to implement individual investment bands, i.e., minimum and maximum possible investments for each asset. This is also important in order to impose diversification and avoid corner solutions. Quite remarkably, we show how to build the constrained cost function as a quadratic binary optimization (QUBO) problem, this being the natural input of quantum annealers. The validity of our implementation is proven by finding the optimal portfolios, using D-Wave Hybrid and its Advantage quantum processor, on portfolios built with all the assets from S&P100 and S&P500. Our results show how practical daily constraints found in quantitative finance can be implemented in a simple way in current NISQ quantum processors, with real data, and under realistic market conditions. In combination with clustering algorithms, our methods would allow to replicate the behaviour of more complex indexes, such as Nasdaq Composite or others, in turn being particularly useful to build and replicate Exchange Traded Funds (ETF).","Palmer, Samuel; Sahin, Serkan; Hernandez, Rodrigo; Mugel, Samuel; Orus, Roman",,112,24

Pathological features of the disease include caseation necrosis and epithelioid granuloma. Consensus treatment for LMDF is currently unavailable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 47-year-old Chinese female patient who presented with facial pruritic, erythematous papules 8 months before this study. She was diagnosed with skin tuberculosis at another hospital and given antituberculosis medication. However, the treatment was not efficacious. DIAGNOSES: In this study, the diagnosis of Demodex-induced LMDF was made by a dermatologist according to physical examination, skin biopsy pathology, and microscopic examination. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was given ornidazole tablets (500âmg twice a day) and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor gel (0.2âg/cm twice a day) for an 8-week period. OUTCOMES: Eight weeks after the treatment, the facial erythematous papules were improved, and no new skin lesions were observed. The patient showed no signs of recurrence during the 6-month follow-up. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: This case showed that ornidazole combined with recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor gel might be useful in treatment of Demodex-induced LMDF. In addition, the results suggested that pathological caseation necrosis was caused by a series of inflammatory and immune responses to Demodex infection.","Luo, Yang; Wu, Lan-Xi; Zhang, Jian-Hong; Zhou, Nan; Luan, Xiu-Li",Medicine (Baltimore),112,16

We focus on the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-like changes and overactivation of Th17 cells (these produce cytokines) in patients with COVID-19. We aim to explore the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab (an injectable drug for the treatment of autoimmune diseases) to prevent organ injury caused by the immune response to COVID-19. Ixekizumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. TRIAL DESIGN: The experiment is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the open trial, 3 patients with COVID-19 are treated with ixekizumab, and the safety and efficacy are observed for 7 days. In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. This is a two-center, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial with 2-arm parallel group design (1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 aged 18-75 with increased Interleukin (IL)-6 levels will be enrolled, but patients with severe infections requiring intensive care will be excluded. The trial will be undertaken in two centers. The first stage is carried out in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, and the second stage is carried out simultaneously in the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: In the first stage, three subjects are given ixekizumab (""Taltz"") (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) and antiviral therapy (&#945;-interferon (administer 5 million U by aerosol inhalation twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (administer 100mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), chloroquine (administer 500mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), ribavirin (administer 500mg by intravenous injection two to three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), or arbidol (administer 200mg by mouth three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), but not more than 3 types). The treatment course of the first stage is 7 days. In the second stage, 40 randomized patients will receive the following treatments--Group 1: ixekizumab (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) with antiviral therapy (the same scheme as in the first stage); Group 2: antiviral therapy alone (the same scheme as in the first stage). The length of the second treatment course is 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is a change in pulmonary CT severity score (an imaging tool for assessing COVID-19, which scores on the basis of all abnormal areas involved). Pulmonary CT severity score is assessed on the 7th day, 14th day, or at discharge. RANDOMISATION: In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. The eLite random system of Nanjing Medical University is used for randomization. BLINDING (MASKING): The main efficacy indicator, the CT results, will be evaluated by the third-party blinded and independent research team.

A virtual ward model delivers clinical care remotely to patients in isolation. We report on an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the safety and efficacy of a virtual ward model of care for an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective clinical assessment was performed for 223 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward in Brisbane, Australia, from March 25 to May 15, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed for variables associated with the length of stay and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 223 patients, 205 (92%) recovered without the need for escalation to hospital care. The median length of stay in the virtual ward was 8 days (range 1-44 days). In total, 18 (8%) patients were referred to hospital, of which 6 (33.3%) were discharged after assessment at the emergency department. Furthermore, 12 (5.4%) patients were admitted to hospital, of which 4 (33.3%) required supplemental oxygen and 2 (16.7%) required mechanical ventilation. No deaths were recorded. Factors associated with escalation to hospital care were the following: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% CI 1.28-9.87; P=.01), sputum production (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.74-15.49; P=.001), and arthralgia (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.21-11.71; P=.02) at illness onset and a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold of &#8804;20 on a diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.25-19.63; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a virtual ward model of care to treat patients with COVID-19 is safe and efficacious, and only a small number of patients would potentially require escalation to hospital care.

DESIGN: This was a prospective clinical study. All women undergoing transvaginal oocyte retrieval were required to have a negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test 3-5 days prior to the procedure. Male partners were not tested. All cases used intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The first tube of follicular fluid aspirated during oocyte retrieval, drops of media following removal of the embryos on day 5, and vitrification solution after blastocyst cryopreservation were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: In total, medium from 61 patients, vitrification solution from 200 patients and follicular fluid from 300 patients was analysed. All samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: With stringent safety protocols in place, including testing of women and symptom-based screening of men, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in follicular fluid, medium or vitrification solution.

Initially, the greatest challenge is having enough doses of vaccine and administering them to all who want it. Yet even while many wait expectantly for their turn to be vaccinated, a significant minority of Americans are hesitant. Lack of information or misinformation about the vaccine, a long-standing and well-entrenched antivaccination movement, distrust of public health officials, and political polarization have left many people ambivalent or opposed to vaccination. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation taken in late November and early December 2020, 27% of respondents surveyed stated that they would ""probably"" or ""definitely"" not be willing to be vaccinated.1 Reflecting the sharp partisan divide that has characterized views about the pandemic, Democrats (86%) were far more likely than Republicans (56%) to be vaccinated.

This has impacted the UK education sector with many universities halting campus-based teaching and examinations. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 on final year medical students' examinations and placements in the United Kingdom (UK) and how it might impact their confidence and preparedness going into their first year of foundation training. METHODS: A 10-item online survey was distributed to final year medical students across 33 UK medical schools. The survey was designed by combining dichotomous, multiple choice and likert response scale questions. Participants were asked about the effect that the COVID-19 global pandemic had on final year medical written exams, electives, assistantships and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The survey also explored the student's confidence and preparedness going into their first year of training under these new unprecedented circumstances. RESULTS: Four hundred forty students from 32 UK medical schools responded. 38.4% (n = 169) of respondents had their final OSCEs cancelled while 43.0% (n = 189) had already completed their final OSCEs before restrictions. 43.0% (n = 189) of assistantship placements were postponed while 77.3% (n = 340) had electives cancelled. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations and student assistantships significantly affected students' preparedness (respectively p = 0.025, 0.008, 0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p = 0.0005). The majority of students feel that measures taken during this pandemic to amend their curricula was necessary. Respondents also agree that assisting in hospitals during the outbreak would be a valuable learning opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: The impact on medical student education has been significant, particularly affecting the transition from student to doctor. This study showed the disruptions to student assistantships had the biggest effect on students' confidence and preparedness. For those willing to assist in hospitals to join the front-line workforce, it is crucial to maintain their wellbeing with safeguards such as proper inductions, support and supervision.","Choi, Byung; Jegatheeswaran, Lavandan; Minocha, Amal; Alhilani, Michel; Nakhoul, Maria; Mutengesa, Ernest",BMC Med Educ,112,20

On December 21, 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the European Union, with efficacy of 95% protection against COVID-19 infection. Several other vaccines are at different stages of assessment by the European Medicines Agency. In addition to the elderly, oncology patients are a vulnerable population in which COVID-19 infection may be more severe. However, owing to the design of the initial studies, evidence on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in these patients is scarce and recommendations are based on the opinion of associations, stakeholders, and experts via extrapolation of information and experience for other vaccines, especially influenza vaccines. Despite the limited evidence, the consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe and vaccination of oncology patients and their close relatives is recommended, although efficacy may be lower in patients with an impaired immune response and the need for additional booster doses is not yet clear. Recommendations include avoiding the use of vaccines based on viral vectors for patients with an impaired immune response, deferring vaccination for immunosuppressed patients or administering the vaccine before immunosuppression, and avoiding chemotherapy receipt between the two doses of a vaccine or on the same day that the vaccine is administered. These recommendations can be extrapolated to urology patients and although evidence is lacking, there should not be greater interference with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines from androgen deprivation therapy or intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin. However, large studies to provide strong evidence for uro-oncology patients are needed. Patient summary: We looked at the effects of COVID-19 vaccination for patients with urological cancers. The consensus is that the vaccines are safe, and vaccination of cancer patients and their close relatives is recommended.","Socarrás, Moises Rodriguez; Gómez Rivas, Juan; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Puente, Javier; Moschini, Marco; Moreno-Sierra, Jesús",,112,20

Using anonymized card transactions and mobile device-based location tracking data, we analyze the factors that contribute to these behavior changes, focusing on stimulus check issuance and state-wide reopening. Our finding suggests that stimulus payment has a significant immediate effect of boosting spending, but it typically does not reverse a downward trend. State-wide reopening had a small effect on spending. Foot traffic increased gradually after stimulus check issuance, but only increased slightly after reopening, which also coincided or preceded several policy changes and confounding events (e.g., protests) in the US. We also find differences in the reaction to these policies in different regions in the US.

OBJECTIVE: Using a patient-centered approach, we explored the experiences and needs of people living with dementia and their care partners during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of an ongoing evaluation of dementia support services in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: A survey instrument was developed around the priorities identified in the context of the COVID-19 and Dementia Task Force convened by the Alzheimer Society of Canada. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were analyzed. Overall, respondents were able to access information that was helpful for maintaining their own health and managing a period of social distancing. Care partners reported a number of serious concerns, including the inability to visit the person that they care for in long-term or palliative care. Participants also reported that the pandemic increased their levels of stress overall and that they felt lonelier and more isolated than they did before the pandemic. The use of technology was reported as a way to connect socially with their loved ones, with the majority of participants connecting with others at least twice per week. CONCLUSION: Looking at the complex effects of a global pandemic through the experiences of people living with dementia and their care partners is vital to inform healthcare priorities to restore their quality of life and health and better prepare for the future.","Tam, Mallorie T; Dosso, Jill A; Robillard, Julie M",J Alzheimers Dis,112,20

We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus to estimate the magnitude reduction in transmission due to weather-related disruptions. Changes in contact rates and care-seeking were informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital visits. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16 to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3 to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in an early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak. For SARS-CoV-2, this suggests that, even when SARS-CoV-2 spread is out of control, implementing short-term disruptions can prevent COVID-19 deaths.","Jackson, Michael L; Hart, Gregory R; McCulloch, Denise J; Adler, Amanda; Brandstetter, Elisabeth; Fay, Kairsten; Han, Peter; Lacombe, Kirsten; Lee, Jover; Sibley, Thomas R; Nickerson, Deborah A; Rieder, Mark J; Starita, Lea; Englund, Janet A; Bedford, Trevor; Chu, Helen; Famulare, Michael",BMC Infect Dis,112,16

Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV-I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions.

Here we present a first look at RNA sequence conservation and structural propensities in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Using sequence alignments spanning a range of betacoronaviruses, we rank genomic regions by RNA sequence conservation, identifying 79 regions of length at least 15 nt as exactly conserved over SARS-related complete genome sequences available near the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We then confirm the conservation of the majority of these genome regions across 739 SARS-CoV-2 sequences subsequently reported from the COVID-19 outbreak, and we present a curated list of 30 ""SARS-related-conserved"" regions. We find that known RNA structured elements curated as Rfam families and in prior literature are enriched in these conserved genome regions, and we predict additional conserved, stable secondary structures across the viral genome. We provide 106 ""SARS-CoV-2-conserved-structured"" regions as potential targets for antivirals that bind to structured RNA. We further provide detailed secondary structure models for the extended 5' UTR, frameshifting stimulation element, and 3' UTR. Lastly, we predict regions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome that have low propensity for RNA secondary structure and are conserved within SARS-CoV-2 strains.

By introducing the concept of the probability of binding efficiency (PBE) and combining the secondary structures of RNA molecules, we designed 11 siRNAs that target the consensus regions of three key viral genes: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) genes of SARS-CoV-2. The silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs were determined in human lung and endothelial cells overexpressing these viral genes. The results suggested that most of the siRNAs could significantly reduce the expression of the viral genes with inhibition rates above 50% in 24 hours. This work not only provides a strategy for designing potentially effective siRNAs against target genes but also validates several potent siRNAs that can be used in the clinical development of preventative medication for COVID-19 in the future.","Wu, Renfei; Luo, Kathy Qian",Int J Biol Sci,112,26

We found marked differences between groups; the WKY rats, were less active, vocalized less, and used significantly fewer types of 50-kHz calls in comparison to their WI counterparts. The animals were re-tested in adulthood and the same differences existed in overall activity, types of vocalizations and the behavioural vocal profiles used by the two groups of animals.

It is in fact a repetition of a historical pattern where exclusion or restriction of Asian immigration and racist scapegoating of Asian Americans converge and surge during periods of public health crises in the United States. Yellow Peril narratives, Orientalist tropes of ‘filthy, backward and morally depraved’ Asians, and racialized discourses about disease, migration, and belonging, which have historically played a crucial role in the cultural production of Asians as a racial contagion, have reemerged in the context of COVID-19, although the specific discursive conditions and impact are not always identical. Nonetheless, reduced to their bodies, which in turn are ethno-stigmatized (by their presumed connection with China), Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are being invested with the epidemiological properties associated with COVID-19 – infectious, contaminating the air around them, and contagious. While Asian Americans are being viewed as an embodied form of the contagion that needs to be expelled, Asian immigrants are being projected as a potential risk and as a future threat that needs to be contained. The anti-Asian racism during COVID-19 illuminates the through lines of white supremacism and virulent nativism that are integral to the foundation of the United States and its past and present imaginaries of ‘American’ national identity, culture, and security. Asian Americans are being reminded, yet again, of the precarity of their belonging within the white American nation, and their vexed condition redirects our attention to the need for a more contextualized analysis of the complicated entanglement of ideologies of liberal multiculturalism and racial capitalism with those of settler colonialism and white supremacy in the current socio-political moment.","Mallapragada, Madhavi",Cultural Studies,112,24

By using a modified Delphi process, we sought to develop a structured framework to provide guidance regarding procedure indications and procedure time intervals. Methods: A national panel of 14 expert gastroenterologists from throughout the US used a modified Delphi process, to achieve consensus regarding: i) common indications for general endoscopy, ii) critical patient-important outcomes for endoscopy, iii) defining time-sensitive intervals, iv) assigning time-sensitive intervals to procedure indications. Two anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. Results: Expert panel reached consensus that procedures should be allocated to one of three timing categories: (1) time-sensitive emergentâ¯=â¯scheduled within 1 week, (2) time-sensitive urgentâ¯=â¯scheduled within 1 to 8 weeks, (3) non-time sensitiveâ¯=â¯defer to > 8 weeks and reassess timing then. The panel identified 62 common general endoscopy indications (33 for EGD, 21 for colonoscopy, 5 for sigmoidoscopy). Consensus was reached on patient-important outcomes for each procedure indication, and consensus regarding timing of the procedure indication was achieved for 74% of indications. Panelists also identified adequate personal-protective-equipment, rapid point-of-care testing, and staff training as critical pre-conditions before endoscopy services could be resumed.

The principal risk factor for the development of serious forms of COVID-19 was found to be the precarious metabolic health. There are several mechanisms that are implicated in the seriousness of COVID-19 ranging from attenuation of immune system function to chronic inflammation. It is important to keep in mind that obesity is a complex disease when discussing the relation between obesity and the severity of COVID-19. An increasing body of proof links obesity to COVID-19. Obesity has an obvious role in the high incidence, symptoms severity and mortality rates of viral infections seen in obese patients. Adipose tissue shows a high expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, so obese population exhibit higher vulnerability to COVID-19. The primary immune response is offered mainly by type-I interferon (IFN-I) that is suppressed in COVID-19. The pro-inflammatory state associated with obesity produces imbalance of the inflammatory response to COVID-19, as the cytokine storm found in subjects with serious disease form. Obesity is considered as chronic inflammation of low degree, so it shows a capacity for pathogenic immune amplification. In this review, the effect of obesity on the immune system is described. The authors described the dysfunctional immune responses caused by obesity that lead to organ injury in COVID-19 infection and impair the ability of patient to combat the virus. Further research is required to assess the impact of obesity control, immunonutrition and physical exercise in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Alrahimi, J.

The risk factors and mechanisms associated with PA are poorly understood. Although neurovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have been documented, its association with PA has not yet been determined. METHODS: From a prospectively collected database of patients treated at a tertiary care center for pituitary adenoma, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of PA cases during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to December 2020. We also conducted a literature review to identify other reported cases. RESULTS: We identified 3 consecutive cases of PA and concomitant COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at presentation were headache and vision changes. The included patients were successfully treated with surgical decompression and medical management of the associated endocrinopathy, ultimately experiencing improvement in their visual symptoms at the latest follow-up examination. COVID-19 infection in the perioperative period was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction test results in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the addition of our series to the literature, 10 cases of PA in the setting of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed. The present series was limited in its ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between these 2 entities. However, COVID-19 infection might represent a risk factor for the development of PA.

An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.","Roques, Lionel; Bonnefon, Olivier; Baudrot, Virgile; Soubeyrand, Samuel; Berestycki, Henri",,112,28

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 4131 COVID-19 positive adult patients who were admitted to 3 tertiary care hospitals of an academic medical center at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City from March 1, 2020, to May 10, 2020, to identify patients who had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. We evaluated the MRIs in detail, and identified a subset of patients with leukoencephalopathy and/or cerebral microbleeds. We compared clinical, laboratory, and functional outcomes for these patients to patients who had a brain MRI that did not show these findings. RESULTS: Of 115 patients who had an MRI of the brain performed, 35 (30.4%) patients had leukoencephalopathy and/or cerebral microbleeds. Patients with leukoencephalopathy and/or cerebral microbleeds had neuroimaging performed later during the hospitalization course (27 versus 10.6 days; P<0.001), were clinically sicker at the time of brain MRI (median GCS 6 versus 14; P<0.001), and had higher peak D-dimer levels (8018±6677 versus 3183±3482; P<0.001), lower nadir platelet count (116.9±62.2 versus 158.3±76.2; P=0.03), higher peak international normalized ratio (2.2 versus 1.57; P<0.001) values when compared with patients who had a brain MRI that did not show these findings.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Literature Review. DATA SOURCES: Pubmed and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar were queried using combined key words such as ""telemedicine,"" ""covid"" and ""otolaryngology."" The searches were completed in March-August 2020. Additional queries were made with particular subspecialty phrases such as ""rhinology"" or ""otology"" to maximize yield of relevant titles. Relevant articles were selected for abstract review. Applicable abstracts were then selected for review of the full text. RESULTS: Initial search identified 279 results. These were screened for relevance and 100 abstracts were selected for review. Abstracts were excluded if they were not in English, not related to otolaryngology, or if the full text was unavailable for access. Of these, 37 articles were selected for complete review of the full text. CONCLUSION: The sudden healthcare closures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp increase in the use of telemedicine, particularly in subspecialty fields. Otolaryngologists are at a unique risk of infection resulting from the examination of the head and neck and aerosol-generating procedures due to the predilection of viral particles for the nasal cavities and pharynx. The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a catalyst to implement telemedicine into clinical practice, however identifying ways to integrate telemedicine long term is key for a sustainable and viable practice in the post-COVID-19 era. Although many states are now finding themselves on the down-sloping side of their infection rate curve, many others remain at the apex. Additionally, the risk of future waves of this pandemic, or the onset of another pandemic, should not be overlooked. Practice modification guidelines that mitigate infection risk by utilizing telemedicine would be useful in these instances. Telemedicine can help to reduce infection spread by limiting unnecessary in-person interactions and help conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) by facilitating remote care with the added benefits of expanding care to broad geographic areas, limiting cost, time, and travel burden on patients and families, and enabling consistent follow up.","Samarrai, Ruwaa; Riccardi, Aaliyah C; Tessema, Belachew; Setzen, Michael; Brown, Seth M",Am J Otolaryngol,112,1

However, little is known about how residential SUD treatment programs are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research team conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 directors of 20 residential SUD treatment programs across California during the state's shelter-in-place order. The researchers then analyzed qualitative interview data thematically and coded them using ATLAS.ti software. FINDINGS: Thematic analyses identified six major themes: program-level impacts, staff impacts, client impacts, use of telehealth, program needs, and positive effects. ""Program-level impacts"" were decreased revenue from diminished client censuses and insufficient resources to implement infection control measures. ""Staff impacts"" included layoffs, furloughs, and increased physical and emotional fatigue. ""Client impacts"" were delayed treatment initiation; receipt of fewer services while in treatment; lower retention; and economic and psychosocial barriers to community re-entry. ""Use of telehealth"" included technical and interpersonal challenges associated with telehealth visits. ""Program needs"" were personal protective equipment (PPE), stimulus funding, hazard pay, and consistent public health guidance. ""Positive effects"" of the pandemic response included increased attention to hygiene and health, telehealth expansion, operational improvements, and official recognition of SUD treatment as an essential health care service. CONCLUSION: Study findings highlight COVID-related threats to the survival of residential SUD treatment programs; retention of the SUD treatment workforce; and clients' SUD treatment outcomes. These findings also identify opportunities to improve SUD service delivery and suggest avenues of support for residential SUD treatment facilities during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pagano, Anna; Hosakote, Sindhu; Kapiteni, Kwinoja; Straus, Elana R; Wong, Jessie; Guydish, Joseph R",J Subst Abuse Treat,112,15

We aimed to investigate whether echocardiographic measures of ventricular function were independently associated with adverse clinical course and cardiac sequaele in MIS-C. METHODS: In a longitudinal observational study of 54 MIS-C patients (mean age 6.8 ± 4.4 years, 46% male, 56% African American), measures of ventricular function and morphometry at initial presentation, pre-discharge, and median of 3 and 10 week follow-up were retrospectively analyzed, and were compared to 108 84 age and gender matched normal controls. The magnitude of strain is expressed as an absolute value. Risk stratification for adverse clinical course and outcomes were analyzed between the tertiles of clinical and echo data using ANOVA, univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Median LV apical 4-chamber longitudinal (LVA4LS) and global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) at the initial presentation were significantly decreased in MIS-C compared to normal cohort (16.2% and 15.1% vs. 22.3% and 22.0% respectively, p<0.01). Patients in the lowest LVA4LS tertile (<13%) had significantly higher CRP and hs-Troponin, need for intensive care (ICU), mechanical life support, and longer hospital length of stay (LOS) compared to those in the highest tertile (>18.5%) (p<0.01). Initial LVA4LS and LVGLS were normal in 13 of 54 and 10 of 39 patients respectively. There was no mortality. In multivariate regression, only LVA4LS was associated with both the need for ICU and LOS. At median 10 week follow-up to date, 7 of 36 patients (19%) and 6 of 25 patients (24%) had abnormal LVA4LS and LVGLS respectively. Initial LVA4LS<16.2% indicated abnormal LVA4LS at follow-up with 100% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Impaired LVGLS and LVA4LS at initial presentation independently indicate a higher risk of adverse acute clinical course and persistent subclinical LV dysfunction at 10 weeks follow-up, suggesting they could be applied to identify higher risk children with MIS-C.","Sanil, Yamuna; Misra, Amrit; Safa, Raya; Blake, Jennifer M; Eddine, Ahmad Charaf; Balakrishnan, Preetha; Garcia, Richard U; Taylor, Rachel; Dentel, John N; Ang, Jocelyn; Cashen, Katherine; Heidemann, Sabrina M; Bauerfield, Christian; Sethuraman, Usha; Farooqi, Ahmad; Aggarwal, Sanjeev; Singh, Gautam",J.

Historically, racism, stigma, and discrimination resulted in grossly inequitable application of disease containment measures. But history also provides examples in which broad measures enjoyed remarkable public support. When it comes to COVID-19, blame and division continue to shape containment responses. But the COVID-19 pandemic also resonates with moments in which there was broad social support for containment precisely because lockdowns or stay at home orders are, on the surface, remarkably equitable. Yet even in a context in which a majority of Americans support social distancing, small but coordinated conservative groups are challenging social distancing as a matter of individual rights. In sharp contrast, vulnerable populations, who bear the heaviest burden of disease, have claimed a right to social distancing as a matter of protection.","Fairchild, Amy; Gostin, Lawrence; Bayer, Ronald",Am J Bioeth,112,24

Traditional LUR models mostly use predefined buffers, which have the disadvantage of not matching high-resolution data well. In order to get a better-fitting model, a few researches have proposed new buffer selection methods. To solve this problem, we propose a new optimal buffer selection method based on the dichotomy to improve the correlation between predicted variables and pollutant concentration. For some socioeconomic data with high spatial resolution that cannot be obtained, for example, building data is used instead of population density data. Compared with the model with the predefined buffers, the model with our buffer selection strategy explained additional 5% variability in measured concentrations, in terms of the R2 of the final model. Our model explained 98% of the samples, and the deviation (1.78%) and root mean square error (5.17 µg/m) were small. It means that the LUR model with our buffer selection strategy can be used as a fit method to better describe spatial variability in atmospheric pollutant levels, which will be conducive to epidemiological research and urban environmental planning.","Liu, Zeyu; Guan, Qingyu; Lin, Jinkuo; Yang, Liqin; Luo, Haiping; Wang, Ning",,112,20

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including subjects consecutively admitted to two psychiatric emergency rooms of DMHA in Monza, Lombardy, Italy. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, referred symptoms, diagnosis and information on patients' illness course following the emergency consultations were collected. No subjects were excluded for the purposes of the study. RESULTS: Between February 21st and May 3rd 2020, there was a marked reduction in the number of psychiatric emergency consultations, if compared to the same period of 2019. Subjects who were living in psychiatric residential treatment facilities, had cannabis addiction and a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder were significantly more likely to present to emergency psychiatric consultations during lockdown.

The original trial protocol was published in Trials (accessible at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-1917-4 ). This included recruitment in two cohorts, enabling the learning from the smaller first cohort to be incorporated in the second cohort. Here we describe final amendments to the study protocol and discuss their underlying rationale. METHODS: Four major changes were introduced into the study protocol: (1) there were changes in eligibility criteria, including a clearer operational definition to assess the degree of SEL implementation in schools, and also new criteria to avoid experimental contamination; (2) the number of schools and pupils that had to be recruited was increased based on what we learned in the first cohort; (3) some changes were made to the secondary outcome measures to improve their validity and ability to measure constructs of interest and to reduce the burden on school staff; and (4) the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic both influences and makes it difficult to interpret the 2-year follow-up primary endpoint results, so we changed our primary endpoint to 1-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: These changes to the study protocol were approved by the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee and Data and Ethics Monitoring Committees and improved the enrolment of participants and quality of measures. Furthermore, the change in the primary endpoint will give a more reliable answer to our primary question because it was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in both cohort 1 and cohort 2. Nevertheless, the longer 2-year follow-up data will still be acquired, although this time-point will be now framed as a second major investigation to answer some new important questions presented by the combination of the pandemic and our study design.

The value of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nursing homes (NHs) residents is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (i) atypical symptoms may predict rRT-PCR results and (ii) rRT-PCR results may predict immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 in NH residents. DESIGN: A retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING: Eight NHs with at least 10 rRT-PCR-positive residents. SUBJECTS: A total of 456 residents. METHODS: Typical and atypical symptoms recorded in residents' files during the 14 days before and after rRT-PCR testing were analysed. Residents underwent blood testing for IgG-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 6 to 8 weeks after testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses compared symptoms and immunisation rates in rRT-PCR-positive and negative residents. RESULTS: A total of 161 residents had a positive rRT-PCR (35.3%), 17.4% of whom were asymptomatic before testing. Temperature >37.8°C, oxygen saturation <90%, unexplained anorexia, behavioural change, exhaustion, malaise and falls before testing were independent predictors of a further positive rRT-PCR. Among the rRT-PCR-positive residents, 95.2% developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vs 7.6% in the rRT-PCR-negative residents. Among the residents with a negative rRT-PCR, those who developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies more often had typical or atypical symptoms (P = 0.02 and <0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study supports a strategy based on (i) testing residents with typical or unexplained atypical symptoms for an early identification of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases, (ii) rT-PCR testing for identifying COVID-19 residents, (iii) repeated wide-facility testing (including asymptomatic cases) as soon as a resident is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and (iv) implementing SARS-CoV-2 infection control measures in rRT-PCR-negative residents when they have unexplained typical or atypical symptoms.","Blain, Hubert; Gamon, Lucie; Tuaillon, Edouard; Pisoni, Amandine; Giacosa, Nadia; Albrand, Mylène; Miot, Stéphanie; Rolland, Yves; Picot, Marie-Christine; Bousquet, Jean",Age Ageing,112,22

An evidence-based public health framework must guide the COVID-19 response in immigration detention centers.We draw on the hierarchy of controls framework to demonstrate how immigration detention centers are failing to implement even the least effective control strategies. Drawing on this framework and recent legal and medical advocacy efforts, we argue that safely releasing detainees from immigration detention centers into their communities is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in immigration detention settings.

Although venous thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients have been well described, data on arterial thrombosis (AT) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of AT in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and June 9, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify potentially eligible studies. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies (5 cohort, 5 case series, and 17 case reports) describing arterial thrombotic events in 90 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of AT in severe/critically ill intensive care unit-admitted COVID-19 patients across the 5 cohort studies was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 2.8-6.4). Most of the patients were male, elderly, and had comorbidities. AT was symptomatic in >95% of these patients and involved multiple arteries in approximately 18% of patients. The anatomical distribution of arterial thrombotic events was wide, occurring in limb arteries (39%), cerebral arteries (24%), great vessels (aorta, common iliac, common carotid, and brachiocephalic trunk; 19%), coronary arteries (9%), and superior mesenteric artery (8%). The mortality rate in these patients is approximately 20%. CONCLUSIONS: AT occurs in approximately 4% of critically ill COVID-19 patients. It often presents symptomatically and can affect multiple arteries. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism of AT in COVID-19 would be needed to clarify possible therapeutic targets.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Kipkorir, Vincent; Ngure, Brian; Misiani, Musa; Munguti, Jeremiah; Ogeng039,; o, Julius",Ann. vasc. surg,112,24

We aimed to understand recent trends in use of CPOE by health system-affiliated ambulatory clinics. METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data (2014-2016) for 19,109 ambulatory clinics that participated in all 3 years of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Analytics survey to assess use of CPOE and identify characteristics of clinics associated with CPOE use. We calculated descriptive statistics to examine overall trends in use, location of order entry (bedside vs. clinical station), and system-level use CPOE across all clinics. We used linear probability models to explore the association between clinic characteristics (practice size, practice type, and health system type) and two outcomes of interest: CPOE use at any point between 2014 and 2016, and CPOE use beginning in 2015 or 2016. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2016, use of CPOE increased more than 9 percentage points from 58 to 67%. Larger clinics and those affiliated with multi-hospital health systems were more likely to have reported use of CPOE. We found no difference in CPOE use by primary care versus specialty care clinics. When used, most clinics reported using CPOE for most or all of their orders. Health systems that used CPOE usually did so for all system-affiliated clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Small practice size or not being part of a multi-hospital system are associated with lower use of CPOE between 2014 and 2016. Less than optimal use in these environments may be harming patient outcomes.","Fischer, Shira H; Rudin, Robert S; Shi, Yunfeng; Shekelle, Paul; Amill-Rosario, Alejandro; Scanlon, Dennis; Damberg, Cheryl L",BMC Health Serv Res,112,10

With this idea in mind, double-faced peptide-based boosters were computationally designed to allow recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by Hepatitis B antibodies. One booster face is made of ACE2-mimic peptides that can bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The other booster face is composed of a Hepatitis B core-antigen, targeting the Hepatitis B antibody fragment. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the designed boosters have a highly specific and stable binding to both the RBD and the antibody fragment (AF).

Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with vascular calcification among this category of patients. Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3; the native inactivated 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], has been proposed to have a good impact on vascular calcification and vitamin D deficiency. However, clinical data is still limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effect of oral cholecalciferol on vascular calcification and 25(OH)D levels in hemodialysis patients. A total of sixty eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (Oral 200.000IU Cholecalciferol per month) or a placebo group, for 3 months. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium, phosphorus, their product (CaXP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, were all assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03602430. Cholecalciferol significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D and fetuin-A in the treatment group (p-value < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. Cholecalciferol administration showed no effect on either FGF-23 or OPG. None of the treatment group patients experienced any adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Cholecalciferol was shown to be an effective, tolerable, inexpensive pharmacotherapeutic option to overcome vitamin D deficiency, with a possible modulating effect on fetuin-A, among hemodialysis patients.

Unlike other nidoviruses, which include the Coronaviridae, mesoniviruses are restricted to mosquito hosts and do not infect vertebrate cells. To date there is little information on the morphological and antigenic characteristics of this new group of viruses and a dearth of mesonivirus-specific research tools. In this study we determined the genetic relationships of recent Australian isolates of Alphamesonivirus 4 (Casuarina virus-CASV) and Alphamesonivirus 1 (Nam Dinh virus-NDiV), obtained from multiple mosquito species. Australian isolates of NDiV showed high-level similarity to the prototype NDiV isolate from Vietnam (99% nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identity). Isolates of CASV from Central Queensland were genetically very similar to the prototype virus from Darwin (95-96% nt and 91-92% aa identity). Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that virion diameter (&#8776;80 nm) and spike length (&#8776;10 nm) were similar for both viruses. Monoclonal antibodies specific to CASV and NDiV revealed a close antigenic relationship between the two viruses with 13/34 mAbs recognising both viruses.

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) is, to this day, the preferred methodology for viral RNA detection, even if not without problems. To overcome some of the limitations still existing for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in various applications, the use of one-step reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) has been established. The purpose of this study was, then, to evaluate the efficacy of ddPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, optimizing the detection of low-viral load-burdened samples. Methods: The RT-ddPCR workflow was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision using samples from 90 COVID-19-infected patients referred to the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Udine (Italy). Results: The present study shows that RT-ddPCR allows the detection of as low as 10.3 copies of a SARS-COV-2 E-gene per sample with a higher level of accuracy and precision, especially at low concentration. Conclusion: During the postpeak phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is essential to rely on a highly robust molecular biology method to identify infected subjects, whether they have symptoms or not, in order to prepare appropriate containment measures.","Mio, Catia; Cifù, Adriana; Marzinotto, Stefania; Marcon, Barbara; Pipan, Corrado; Damante, Giuseppe; Curcio, Francesco",Dis Markers,112,16

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study (Fall Semester Cohort 2020), a non-probability sample of students across multiple colleges who completed an online survey between September - December 2020. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the associations between COVID-19 dimensions (concern, racial/ethnic discrimination, financial distress, infection, illness of loved one, death of loved one, caregiving) and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety), adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status. RESULTS: Nearly a fifth of the sample reported moderately severe or severe depression, and nearly a third reported moderately severe or severe anxiety over the past two weeks. When accounting for all COVID-19 dimensions in the same model, COVID-19 concern, racial/ethnic discrimination, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with moderately severe or severe depression; COVID-19 concern, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with moderately severe or severe anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic may have shaped mental health through a range of potential social and environmental dimensions. Interventions are required that consider multiple dimensions of COVID-19 to improve mental health during and after the pandemic.","Oh, Hans; Marinovich, Caitlin; Rajkumar, Ravi; Besecker, Megan; Zhou, Sasha; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Smith, Lee",J Affect Disord,112,0

In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of TNBC critically requires CDK4/6 for proliferation, and yet, these TNBC are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition due to sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into tumor cell lysosomes. This sequestration is caused by enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and increased lysosomal numbers in TNBC cells. We developed new CDK4/6 inhibitor compounds that evade the lysosomal sequestration and are efficacious against resistant TNBC. We also show that coadministration of lysosomotropic or lysosome-destabilizing compounds (an antibiotic azithromycin, an antidepressant siramesine, an antimalaria compound chloroquine) renders resistant tumor cells sensitive to currently used CDK4/6 inhibitors. Lastly, coinhibition of CDK2 arrested proliferation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells. These observations may extend the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors to TNBCs that are refractory to current anti-CDK4/6 therapies.","Fassl, Anne; Brain, Christopher; Abu-Remaileh, Monther; Stukan, Iga; Butter, Deborah; Stepien, Piotr; Feit, Avery S; Bergholz, Johann; Michowski, Wojciech; Otto, Tobias; Sheng, Qing; Loo, Alice; Michael, Walter; Tiedt, Ralph; DeAngelis, Carmine; Schiff, Rachel; Jiang, Baishan; Jovanovic, Bojana; Nowak, Karolina; Ericsson, Maria; Cameron, Michael; Gray, Nathanael; Dillon, Deborah; Zhao, Jean J; Sabatini, David M; Jeselsohn, Rinath; Brown, Myles; Polyak, Kornelia; Sicinski, Piotr",Sci.

Therefore, the present study aims to explore the possibilities offered by naturally available and abundant flavonoid compounds, as a prospective antiviral drug to combat the virus. A library of 44 citrus flavonoids was screened against the highly conserved Main Protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking. The compounds which showed better CDocker energy than the co-crystal inhibitor of Mpro were further revalidated by flexible docking within the active site; followed by assessment of drug likeness and toxicity parameters. The non-toxic compounds were further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation and predicted activity (IC50) using 3D-QSAR analysis. Subsequently, hydrogen bonds and dehydration analysis of the best compound were performed to assess the binding affinity to Mpro. It was observed that out of the 44 citrus flavonoids, five compounds showed lower binding energy with Mpro than the co-crystal ligand. Moreover, these compounds also formed H-bonds with two important catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 of the active sites of Mpro. Three compounds which passed the drug likeness filter showed stable conformation during MD simulations. Among these, the lowest predicted IC50 value was observed for Taxifolin. Therefore, this study suggests that Taxifolin, could be a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and can be further analysed by in vitro and in vivo experiments for management of the ongoing pandemic.","Gogoi, Neelutpal; Chowdhury, Purvita; Goswami, Ashis Kumar; Das, Aparoop; Chetia, Dipak; Gogoi, Bhaskarjyoti",Mol. divers,112,1

This increases the risk of developing ocular surface disease (OSD) leading to increased post critical care morbidity. The risks are further increased in patients who are nursed prone as access to eyes is limited. Our aim was to determine whether eye care met the standard of the Ophthalmic Services Guidance and to improve the quality of care provided if found to be deficient. Methodology and Results A prospective audit of the eye care provided to ventilated patients in critical care was done in April, 2020. An ophthalmological examination including fluoresce in staining was done to ascertain the prevalence of ocular morbidity present. Twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria and 88% patients were ventilated secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. 35% of them were nursed prone at time of assessment;81% had lagophthalmos (incomplete eye closure) while 53% of patients had a variant of OSD, including 23% with swollen conjunctival prolapse, 18% with conjunctivitis and 12% with corneal abrasions. None of the patients with lagophthalmos had received eye lubricants. Of the proned patients 50% had their eyes taped closed but only 33% had eye lubrication applied. We introduced local best practice guidance adapted from the Ophthalmic Services guidance. Education of critical care staff was undertaken and simplified guidance was exhibited in clinical areas. Post-intervention audit was carried out against the standard after a one-month interval and 24 patients were included (80% COVID-19 pneumonia);67% had eye lubrication and 50% had eyes taped as per guidance in supine position. 100% of proned patients had eye lubricants with micropore taping. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, staffs were recruited from diverse backgrounds including theatre scrub nurses, recovery practitioners and operation department practitioners, to work alongside critical care nurses caring for ventilated patients. Education on the best ophthalmic practice guidance enabled holistic care to be provided to many ventilated patients by staff with limited prior experience in eye care in critical care.","Dhanapala, M.; Sabaretnam, S.",Sri Lankan Journal of Anaesthesiology,112,1

However, a technical standard for oxygen therapy nursing, as well as how this would improve clinical outcomes and symptoms, is yet to be explored. METHODS: From February 9, 2020, to March 31, 2020, 58 patients of confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the 20th ward of the Eastern Branch, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Fifteen patients who did not receive oxygen therapy and 13 patients who were transferred from other hospitals were excluded. The rest of the 30 patients that received standardized oxygen therapy in our unit were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, and finger pulse oxygen saturation were collected during hospitalization. RESULTS: Clinical outcomes of the 30 patients were as follows: 27 patients (90.00%) were cured and discharged; 3 patients (10.00%) who continued to stay in hospital were stabilized with symptoms relieved. The fingertip oxygen saturation was 94.80%±3.49% at ICU admission and 97.8%±1.27% when transferred out of ICU after standardized oxygen therapy (P<0.005). The symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle aches of the patients were improved when transferred out of ICU, compared with their condition when admitted to ICU (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The standardized oxygen therapy nursing strategy for patients with COVID-19 emphasizes the nursing measurement, which focuses on the patient's oxygenation. It is led by nurses and starts oxygen therapy at an earlier stage. It not only improves the clinical outcomes of critical patients but also effectively reduces the infection risk of medical staff while emphasizing nursing quality management.","Pan, Wenyan; Li, Jingjing; Ou, Yufeng; Wu, Yitao; Cai, Shining; Zhang, Yuxia; Wang, Chunling",Ann Palliat Med,112,30

AIM: To evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual functioning of individuals who declared no medical history of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A total of 1,356 participants filled out an Internet-based survey between June 1 and June 20, 2020. The data from these participants were analyzed to determine sexual functioning in terms of sexual intercourse frequency and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroups analyses were also performed, wherein the subgroups were developed according to the population density of the cities in which the participants lived to examine whether population density has any effect on the sexual functions of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual functioning. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 33.16 ± 8.31 years. There was a statistically significant difference between the participants according to the decrease in the number of weekly sexual intercourses when they were compared in terms of smoking status, alcohol consumption, marital and parental status, being a health-care worker, having a regular sexual partner, and the working status during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each). In the subgroup analyses, it was observed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups for change in the number of sexual intercourses, the number of masturbations, and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic (P < .05, for each). CONCLUSION: A decline in sexual functioning was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Living in a metropolitan area was associated with a decline in both sexual intercourse frequency and sexual desire during the COVID-19 pandemic. Karsiyakali N, Sahin Y, Ates HA, et al.

The most common approach to combine adaptive step sizes and symplectic integrators involves the Poincar\'e transformation of the original Hamiltonian. In this article, we provide a framework for the construction of variational integrators using the Poincar\'e transformation. Since the transformed Hamiltonian is typically degenerate, the use of Hamiltonian variational integrators based on Type II or Type III generating functions is required instead of the more traditional Lagrangian variational integrators based on Type I generating functions. Error analysis is provided and numerical tests based on the Taylor variational integrator approach of Schmitt, Shingel, Leok (2018) to time-adaptive variational integration of Kepler's 2-Body problem are presented. Finally, we use our adaptive framework together with the variational approach to accelerated optimization presented in Wibisono, Wilson, Jordan (2016) to design efficient variational and non-variational explicit integrators for symplectic accelerated optimization.","Duruisseaux, Valentin; Schmitt, Jeremy; Leok, Melvin",,112,1

In the present study, we investigated the exercise frequency and intensity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also current exercise dependency and mood state among non-contact individual, contact individual, and team sports athletes. A total of 1353 athletes from non-contact individual sports athletes (NCISA), contact individual sports athletes (CISA) and team sport athletes (TSA) participated;45.4% of them were females that completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, former and current exercise patterns, exercise dependency and mood states. NCISA had less exercise frequency than CISA, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and NCISA had less exercise frequency than TSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding exercise intensity, CISA had higher scores than NCISA and TSA before the COVID-19 pandemic, and CISA had more exercise intensity than TSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequency and intensity were reduced from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in the three groups, except for TSA intensity. In addition, positive and negative mood states were correlated with exercise dependency. CISA were more discouraged and vigorous than NCISA and TSA, respectively. For NCISA, CISA, and TSA, ordinal regressions separately showed that adherence to quarantine and exercise dependency were better predictors of exercise indexes. Finally, exercise dependency subscales were different among sports, but it was not in exercise dependency itself. Although the decrease in exercise indexes was noticeable, there was no consistent pattern of change in exercise behavior in all sports. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, negative moods were predominant among all athletes. The results discussed are based on exercise nonparticipating, sport type, and affect regulation hypothesis.","Aghababa, Alireza Badicu Georgian Fathirezaie Zahra Rohani Hadi Nabilpour Maghsoud Zamani Sani Seyed Hojjat Khodadadeh Elham",Children,112,20

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin for the treatment of hospitalized mild to moderate COVID-19 infected patients. This was a randomized open-label controlled study that included 164 patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomized into two groups where Group 1 (Ivermectin group) included patients who received ivermectin 12 mg once daily for 3 days with standard care and Group 2 (control group) included patients who received standard protocol of treatment alone for 14 days. The main outcomes were mortality, the length of hospital stay, and the need for mechanical ventilation. All patients were followed up for 1 month.

Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures, because they represent a demographic that is most affected by disasters and because pregnancy itself entails significant life changes that require major psychosocial and emotional adjustments. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, and developmental outcomes in their offspring. OBJECTIVE: The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals and developmental outcomes in their offspring. Findings of the study are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and their offspring and point toward prevention and intervention targets. METHODS: The PdP study comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants were eligible if they were: pregnant, &#8805;17 years, &#8804;35 weeks gestation at study enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French. At enrollment, participants completed an initial survey that assessed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, previous pregnancies and births, pre-pregnancy health, health conditions during pregnancy, medications, psychological distress, social support, and hardships experienced because of COVID-19 (e.g., lost employment, loved one dying). For the first three months following the initial survey, participants received a monthly email link to complete a follow-up survey that asked about experiences since the previous survey. After three months, follow-up surveys were sent every other month to reduce participant burden. For each of these surveys, participants were first asked if they were still pregnant and then routed either to the next prenatal survey or to the delivery survey. In the postpartum, surveys were sent at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of infant age to assess maternal stress, psychological distress and infant development. RESULTS: Participant recruitment via social media (Facebook, Instagram) began on April 5, 2020 and is ongoing. As of October 2019, more than 8200 individuals completed the initial survey. Follow-up data collection is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal investigation seeks to elucidate the associations between hardships, maternal psychological distress, child development during COVID-19, and risk and resilience factors that amplify or ameliorate these associations. Findings are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and point toward prevention and intervention targets.

This article describes surveillance for COVID-19 in HCWs at a tertiary healthcare facility and documents the outcomes. A descriptive cross-sectional study of all HCWs identified from surveillance for COVID-19 from March 31 to August 31, 2020 was conducted. Healthcare workers were categorized as high risk and low risk using an adapted the WHO Risk Assessment tool. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens obtained from high-risk subjects were tested by a reverse transcriptase PCR method. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0, Armonk, NY), and results were presented as frequencies and percentages. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05. During 5 months of surveillance, 1,466 HCWs with a mean age of 38.1 ± 9.7 years were identified as contacts. On risk assessment, 328 (22.4%) were adjudged high risk. High risk was associated with increasing age (P < 0.001), male gender (P = 0.001), and nonclinical staff (P = 0.002). Following testing, 78 (5.3%) in the high-risk category were confirmed to have COVID-19. There was no record of COVID-19 in HCWs adjudged low risk. Forty-four (56.4%) cases were epidemiologically linked to the community, 20 (25.7%) to patients, and 14 (17.9%) to another HCW. Surveillance and risk assessment are crucial to COVID-19 response in healthcare facilities and revealed HCW infections with predominantly nonoccupational epidemiological links in this study.","Ogboghodo, Esohe O; Osaigbovo, Iriagbonse I; Obarisiagbon, Otaniyenuwa O; Okwara, Benson U; Obaseki, Darlington E; Omo-Ikirodah, Orezimena T; Ehinze, Ewere S; Adio, Funmilola; Nwaogwugwu, Joy C; Eseigbe, Efeomon F",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,112,30

The impact of smoking on COVID‐19 severity has been previously reported in several meta‐analyses limited by small sample sizes and poor methodology. We aimed to rigorously and definitively quantify the effects of smoking on COVID‐19 severity. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched between 1 December 2019 and 2 June 2020. Studies reporting smoking status of hospitalized patients with different severities of disease and/or at least one clinical endpoint of interest (disease progression, intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality) were included. Data were pooled using a random‐effects model. This study was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42020180920. We analyzed 47 eligible studies reporting on 32 849 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients, with 8417 (25.6%) reporting a smoking history, comprising 1501 current smokers, 5676 former smokers, and 1240 unspecified smokers. Current smokers had an increased risk of severe COVID‐19 (risk ratios [RR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14‐2.85; P = .012), and severe or critical COVID‐19 (RR: 1.98; CI: 1.16‐3.38; P = .012). Patients with a smoking history had a significantly increased risk of severe COVID‐19 (RR: 1.31; CI: 1.12‐1.54; P = .001), severe or critical COVID‐19 (RR: 1.35; CI: 1.19‐1.53; P < .0001), in‐hospital mortality (RR: 1.26; CI: 1.20‐1.32; P < .0001), disease progression (RR: 2.18; CI: 1.06‐4.49; P = .035), and need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.20; CI: 1.01‐1.42; P = .043). Patients with any smoking history are vulnerable to severe COVID‐19 and worse in‐hospital outcomes.

Moreover, situations of this kind are historically cyclical. The symptoms and treatment of infected patients are, for better or worse even for new viruses, always the same: more or less severe flu symptoms, isolation and full hygiene. By now man has learned how to manage epidemic situations, but deaths and negative effects continue to occur. What about technology? What effect has the actual technological progress we have achieved? In this review, we wonder about the role of robotics in the fight against COVID. It presents the analysis of scientific articles, industrial initiatives and project calls for applications from March to now highlighting how much robotics was ready to face this situation, what is expected from robots and what remains to do.

To assess the economic impact of not meeting the target until 2045, we estimated full-income losses in 120 countries, including those due to excess deaths resulting from COVID-19-related disruptions to tuberculosis services, for the period 2020–50. METHODS: Annual mortality risk changes at each age in each year from 2020 to 2050 were estimated for 120 countries. This risk change was then converted to full-income risk by calculating a population-level mortality risk change and multiplying it by the value of a statistical life-year in each country and year. As a comparator, we assumed that current rates of tuberculosis continue to decline through the period of analysis. We calculated the full-income losses, and mean life expectancy losses per person, at birth and at age 35 years, under scenarios in which the SDG targets are met in 2030 and in 2045. We defined the cost of inaction as the difference in full-income losses and tuberculosis mortality between these two scenarios. FINDINGS: From 2020 to 2050, based on the current annual decrease in tuberculosis deaths of 2%, 31·8 million tuberculosis deaths (95% uncertainty interval 25·2 million–39·5 million) are estimated to occur, corresponding to an economic loss of US$17·5 trillion (14·9 trillion–20·4 trillion). If the SDG tuberculosis mortality target is met in 2030, 23·8 million tuberculosis deaths (18·9 million–29·5 million) and $13·1 trillion (11·2 trillion–15·3 trillion) in economic losses can be avoided. If the target is met in 2045, 18·1 million tuberculosis deaths (14·3 million–22·4 million) and $10·2 trillion (8·7 trillion–11·8 trillion) can be avoided. The cost of inaction of not meeting the SDG tuberculosis mortality target until 2045 (vs 2030) is, therefore, 5·7 million tuberculosis deaths (5·1 million–8·1 million) and $3·0 trillion (2·5 trillion–3·5 trillion) in economic losses. COVID-19-related disruptions add $290·3 billion (260·2 billion–570·1 billion) to this cost. INTERPRETATION: Failure to achieve the SDG tuberculosis mortality target by 2030 will lead to profound economic and health losses. The effects of delay will be greatest in sub-Saharan Africa. Affected countries, donor nations, and the private sector should redouble efforts to finance tuberculosis programmes and research because the economic dividend of such strategies is likely to be substantial.

The aim of the study was to analyze the association between food preferences and food choice determinants in adolescents aged 15–20 years within the Polish Adolescents’ COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study. The PLACE-19 Study included a random quota sampling conducted in the whole of Poland and covered a population-based sample of 2448 secondary school students. The food preferences were assessed using a validated Food Preference Questionnaire (FPQ), and the food choices were assessed using a validated Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ). The statistical analysis comprised k-means clustering and linear regression adjusted for sex and age. Four homogenous clusters of respondents were defined based on the food choice motives—“healthy eaters” (health as the most important determinant of food choices), “hedonists” (convenience, sensory appeal, and price as the most important determinants), “indifferent consumers” (low significance for all determinants), and “demanding consumers” (high significance for all determinants). The preferences for all food categories differed when comparing between clusters presenting various food choice determinants (p < 0.001). The “healthy eaters” were characterized by the highest preference for vegetables; the “hedonists” preferred meat/fish, dairy, and snacks; the “demanding consumers” had a high preference for all food categories, while “indifferent consumers” had a low preference for all food categories. All preference scores were positively associated with mood, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, and price (p < 0.05). The results confirmed the association between food preferences and food choice determinants in adolescents, as well as allowed adolescents to be clustered into segments to define various needs and motives among the identified segments. For public health purposes, it may be crucial to educate “hedonists,” with a high preference for meat/fish, dairy and snacks, accompanied by convenience, sensory appeal, and price as the most important determinants of their food choices.","Głąbska, Dominika; Skolmowska, Dominika; Guzek, Dominika",Nutrients,112,16

While countries such as China have successfully curbed the domestic outbreak of the virus with various restrictive and preventive measures, the challenge of avoiding imported cases remains. More importantly, it is still unclear to what extent these implemented aviation emergency responses have effectively mitigated the transmission risk of the virus. This paper provides an empirical assessment of aviation responses to the control of imported COVID-19 cases, with a focus on the following three strategies: the “circuit breaker” policy, the “negative Nucleic Acid testing (NAT)”, and the “double negative tests” requirement. Non-recursive structural equation models (SEM) with latent variables were applied to detailed international flight data and individual epidemic survey data of Guangzhou, China, between May 1 and November 30, 2020. The results show that the “double negative tests” measure has a positive effect on eliminating the number of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, while the effects of single “circuit breaker” and its co-intervention with “negative NAT” are conterproductive. This study provides important implications to civil aviation agencies in regard to medium and long-term risk control of imported cases. Specifically, although the circuit breaker mechanism was designed to target on the risk control of imported COVID-19 cases, it may be more effective to carefully maintain a timely and reliable pre-boarding screening and testing to curb the number of imported cases.","Yu, Meng; Chen, Zhenhua",J Air Transp Manag,112,20

A pair of primers (P1/P2) was used to detect both CDV wild-type strains and vaccines. Another pair (P3/P4) was used to detect only CDV wild-type strains. A 335 bp fragment was amplified from the genomic RNA of the vaccine and wild-type strains. A 555 bp fragment was amplified specifically from the genomic RNA of the wild-type strains. No amplification was achieved for the uninfected cells, cells infected with canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, or canine adenovirus. The combined RT-PCR method detected effectively and differentiated the CDV wild-type and vaccine strains by two separate RT-PCRs. The method can be used for clinical detection and epidemiological surveillance. The phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene of the local wild-type CDV strains revealed that the seven local isolates all belonged to the Asia-1 lineage, and were clustered closely with one another at the same location.

Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to explore the feasibility of these hybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds for PICU patients. Design: Mixed quantitative and qualitative deductive thematic content analysis of narrative responses. Setting: PICU, single tertiary-care academic center. Participants: Multidisciplinary PICU HCWs. Interventions: Integration of Zoom meeting into clinical daily PICU rounds. Measurements: For the quantitative part, we gathered the details of daily PICU hybrid rounds in terms of times, number of HCWs, and type of files shared through Zoom. For the qualitative part, open-ended questions were used. Main Results: The physical round took statistically significantly less time (34.68 ± 14.842 min) as compared with the Zoom round (72.45 ± 22.59 min), p < 0.001. The most shared component in the virtual round was chest X-rays (93.5%). Thirty-one HCWs participated in focus group discussions and were included in the analysis. Some of the HCWs' perceived advantages of the hybrid rounds were enabling multidisciplinary discussions, fewer round interruptions, and practicality of virtual discussions. The perceived challenges were the difficulty of the bedside nurse attending the virtual round, decreased teaching opportunities for the trainees, and decreased interactions among the team members, especially if video streaming was not utilized. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary hybrid virtual and physical clinical rounds in the PICU were perceived as feasible by HCWs. The virtual rounds decreased the physical contact between the HCWs, which could decrease the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spread among the treating team. Still, several components of the hybrid round should be optimized to facilitate the virtual team-members' interactions and enhance the teaching experience.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Alhboob, Ali; Abouammoh, Noura; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Aljamaan, Fadi; Alsohime, Fahad; Alabdulhafid, Majed; Ashry, Ahmad; Bukhari, Ahmad; ElTahir, Omer; Jamal, Amr; Halwani, Rabih; Alhasan, Khalid; Alherbish, Adi; Temsah, Reem; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Barry, Mazin",Front Pediatr,112,26

This ‘innocent bystander’ tissue injury arises in dysregulated hyperinflammatory states from neutrophil functions and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) intended to kill pathogens, but injure cells instead, causing MOF. Insufficiency of prior therapeutic approaches suggest need to identify dysregulated neutrophil-subset(s) and induce subset-specific apoptosis critical for neutrophil function-shutdown and clearance. We hypothesized that neutrophils expressing the pro-survival dual endothelin-1/signal peptide receptor, DEspR, are apoptosis-resistant just like DEspR+ cancer cells, hence comprise a consequential pathogenic neutrophil-subset in ARDS and COVID19-ARDS. Here, we report correlation of circulating DEspR+CD11b+ activated neutrophils (DESpR+actNs) and NETosing-neutrophils with severity in ARDS and in COVID19-ARDS, increased DEspR+ neutrophils and monocytes in post-mortem ARDS-patient lung sections, and neutrophil DEspR/ET1 receptor/ligand autocrine loops in severe COVID19. Unlike DEspR[−] neutrophils, ARDS patient DEspR+actNs exhibit apoptosis-resistance, which decreased upon ex vivo treatment with humanized anti-DEspR-IgG4(S228P) antibody, hu6g8. Ex vivo live-cell imaging of non-human primate DEspR+actNs showed hu6g8 target-engagement, internalization, and induction of apoptosis. Altogether, data differentiate DEspR+actNs as a targetable neutrophil-subset associated with ARDS and COVID19-ARDS severity, and suggest DEspR-inhibition as a potential therapeutic paradigm.","Herrera, Victoria L.

Pulse-chase experiments showed that pp60 was synthesized initially as a protein of approximately 57,000 in molecular weight (p57). Immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-JHMV antiserum indicated that p57 was virus specific. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies specific for pp60 showed that p57 was antigenically related to pp60 and was not phosphorylated, while the intracellular protein that comigrated with the virion nucleocapsid protein, pp60, was phosphorylated. The p57 was found exclusively in the cytosol while the majority of pp60 was associated with the membrane fraction but pp60 was not an integral membrane protein.","Stohlman, Stephen A.; Fleming, John O.; Patton, Chris D.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,112,29

In view of this scenario, this research aims to explore the effectiveness of population mobility restriction in alleviating epidemic transmission during different stages of the outbreak. Taking Shenzhen, a city with a large immigrant population in China, as a case study, the real-time reproduction number of COVID-19 is estimated by statistical methods to represent the dynamic spatiotemporal transmission pattern of COVID-19. Furthermore, migration data between Shenzhen and other provinces are collected to investigate the impact of nationwide population flow on near-real-time dynamic reproductive numbers. The results show that traffic flow control between populated cities has an inhibitory effect on urban transmission, but this effect is not significant in the late stage of the epidemic spread in China. This finding implies that the government should limit international and domestic population movement starting from the very early stage of the outbreak. This work confirms the effectiveness of travel restriction measures in the face of COVID-19 in China and provides new insight for densely populated cities in imposing intervention measures at various stages of the transmission cycle.","Ji, Honglu; Tong, Huan; Wang, Jingge; Yan, Dan; Liao, Zangyi; Kong, Ying",Environ Geochem Health,112,24

Oral health care workers have an increased risk of infection due to dental practice characteristics. New effective vaccines against COVID-19 recently began to be inoculated. We aimed to evaluate the intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a population of dentists, identifying factors associated with their intentions. Methods An anonymous online survey was conducted among 761 dentists enrolled at the Board of Physicians and Dentists of the District of Monza Brianza. It collected data on demographic characteristics, flu vaccine uptake, COVID-19 history, vaccine attitudes, and specific reasons for intending to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or not. Results Overall, 421 dentists completed the survey. More than 82% of the participants declared their intent to be vaccinated against coronavirus. The multivariate logistic regression model reported a positive association with flu vaccine uptake in the current season (OR 5.15, 2.14–12.39) and a negative association with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.32, 0.15–0.66). The participants’ main reason for supporting vaccination was to protect their family and friends (87%), whereas their main reason for opposing vaccination was the lack of information (39%). Conclusions It is fundamental to consider vaccine hesitancy in health care workers and face it properly since they must provide recommendations to patients and promote adherence to vaccination programs.","Belingheri, Michael; Roncalli, Massimo; Riva, Michele Augusto; Paladino, Maria Emilia; Teruzzi, Carlo Maria",J Am Dent Assoc,112,7

High income countries such as the US, the UK, Italy and Belgium have reported high COVID-19 related deaths but low-and-middle-income countries have recorded fewer deaths despite having poor healthcare system. This study aimed to investigate the association between malaria prevalence and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: An ecological study was conducted with data from 195 countries. Spearman’s correlation was used to test the association between the population variables and COVID-19 mortality. Generalized linear model with Poisson distribution was used to determine the significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between median age, life expectancy, 65+ mortality and COVID-19 mortality while malaria prevalence, sex ratio and cardiovascular mortality were negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Malaria prevalence, life expectancy and mortality rate were significant on multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the hypotheses that there are reduced COVID-19 deaths in malaria endemic countries, although the results need to be proved further by clinical trials.","Anyanwu, Michael U.",BMC Infect Dis,112,21

METHODS: This prospective study included a total of 40 patients with FN and malignancies followed at Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology. The control group (n=76) consisted of age-matched patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) who were admitted to the emergency service due to fever. RESULTS: Viral agents were detected in 16 of 53 FN attacks (30.1%). The most commonly isolated viruses were coronavirus (23.7%, n=9), influenza B (18.4%, n=7), and adenovirus (18.4%, n=7). Of 76 children diagnosed with URTI with fever (52.6%) had viral agents, and only 28 of them had a single agent. The most commonly isolated virus was adenovirus (28.6%, n=14). Viral factors were found in 32 of 42 patients (76.1%) patients diagnosed with LRTI, while respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus in 27 patients (21.7%, n=5). CONCLUSION: Our study results show that viral agents play an important role in the etiology of FN. This is the first study to show that viral agents play an important role in the etiology of this disease and viral factors in non-neutropenic febrile children at the same time period by detecting respiratory viruses in 30% of FN cases. More similar studies provide antiviral therapy in selected patients, as well as these studies lead to reduce the use of antimicrobial agents or allow more selective use of antibiotics and/or the earlier discontinuation of these antibiotics in febrile neutropenic children who have been shown to have viral cause of respiratory tract infection based on clinical and microbiological/molecular diagnostic criteria.","Turhan, Ayse Bozkurt; Us, Tercan; Dinleyici, Ener Cagri; Yildirim, Gonca Kilic; Kasifoglu, Nilgun; Ozdemir, Zeynep Canan; Bor, Ozcan",North Clin Istanb,112,11

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient flows, patient pathways and use of hospital resources during the pandemic were simulated using a discrete event simulation model and patient-level data from a large French comprehensive cancer centre's discharge database, considering two scenarios of delays: massive return of patients from November 2020 (early-return) or March 2021 (late-return). Expected additional cancer deaths at 5 years and mortality rate were estimated using individual hazard ratios based on literature. RESULTS: The number of patients requiring hospital care during the simulation period was 13,000. In both scenarios, 6–8% of patients were estimated to present a delay of >2 months. The overall additional cancer deaths at 5 years were estimated at 88 in early-return and 145 in late-return scenario, with increased additional deaths estimated for sarcomas, gynaecological, liver, head and neck, breast cancer and acute leukaemia. This represents a relative additional cancer mortality rate at 5 years of 4.4 and 6.8% for patients expected in year 2020, 0.5 and 1.3% in 2021 and 0.5 and 0.5% in 2022 for each scenario, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with cancer are expected to impact patient survival. In the perspective of recurrent pandemics or alternative events requiring an intensive use of limited hospital resources, patients should be informed not to postpone care, and medical resources for patients with cancer should be sanctuarised.","Bardet, Aurelie; Fraslin, Alderic M.; Marghadi, Jamila; Borget, Isabelle; Faron, Matthieu; Honoré, Charles; Delaloge, Suzette; Albiges, Laurence; Planchard, David; Ducreux, Michel; Hadoux, Julien; Colomba, Emeline; Robert, Caroline; Bouhir, Samia; Massard, Christophe; Micol, Jean-Baptiste; Ter-Minassian, Lucile; Michiels, Stefan; Auperin, Anne; Barlesi, Fabrice; Bonastre, Julia",Eur J Cancer,112,18

The empirical evidence of the power of non-verbal communication to engage therapists and clients in therapeutic work, develop a positive and collaborative relationship between them, and display empathy is quite large. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, drawing from the therapists’ participation in an online survey. A sample of 137 psychotherapists with different therapy orientations and years of clinical practice participated in the study. Therapists conducted face-to-face therapy wearing face masks with existing and/or new clients. We performed an exploratory analysis, using descriptive statistics, to explore the psychotherapists’ evaluations regarding perceived impact of face masks on different therapy quality dimensions. In a complementary rationale, we analyzed the therapists’ perspectives on their experience wearing face masks using the thematic analysis methodology. Results show that among 137 psychotherapists, 114 were attending both existing and new clients, whereas only 13 were seeing exclusively existing clients and 10 were working exclusively with new clients. Despite no major differences were found between conditions regarding the perceived impact of face masks on different therapy quality dimensions and strategies adopted, the qualitative analysis allowed us to expand the quantitative results and deepen understanding of psychotherapists’ experience. Based on general and typical patterns, we propose two distinct models to describe the therapist’s experiences narrative when working with existing or new clients wearing face masks. Based on the results, we propose some recommendations to clinical practice in similar conditions.","Ribeiro, Eugénia; Ferreira, Ângela; Cardoso, Cátia; Queiroz, Raquel; Silva, Vânia",Front Psychol,112,1

METHODS: Through the China’s Infectious Disease Information System, we collected information about COVID-19 associated deaths from December 15, 2019 to February 24, 2020 in Wuhan. We analyzed the patient’s demographic characteristics, drew epidemiological curve and made geographic distribution maps of the death toll in each district over time, etc. ArcGIS was used to plot the numbers of daily deaths on maps. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and @Risk software. RESULTS: As of February 24, 2020, a total of 1833 deaths were included. Among the deaths with COVID-19, mild type accounted for the most (37.2%), followed by severe type (30.1%). The median age was 70.0 (inter quartile range: 63.0–79.0) years. Most of the deaths were distributed in 50–89 age group, whereas no deaths occurred in 0–9 age group. Additionally, the male to female ratio was 1.95:1. A total of 65.7% of the deaths in Wuhan combined with underlying diseases, and was more pronounced among males. Most of the underlying diseases included hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The peak of daily deaths appeared on February 14 and then declined. The median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 10.0 (6.0–14.0) days; the interval from onset to diagnosis gradually shortened. The median intervals from diagnosis to death and symptom onset to deaths were 6.0 (2.0–11.0), 17.0 (12.0–22.0) days, respectively. Most of the disease was centralized in central urban area with highest death rate in Jianghan District. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 poses a greater threat to the elderly people and men with more devastating effects, particularly in the presence of underlying diseases. The geographical distributions show that the epidemic in the central area of Wuhan is more serious than that in the surrounding areas. Analysis of deaths as of February 24 indicates that a tremendous improvement of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan has achieved by effective control measures taken by Wuhan Government.

We explore the implications of the memory property for tax evasion, consumption, and asset allocation. Assuming that tax audits and jumps in the risky asset both follow self-exciting Hawkes processes, we provide a semi-analytical solution to this problem for an agent with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility. We find that the memory feature does not change the agent's effective holding in the risky asset, and its effects on tax evasion and consumption are determined by the agent's risk aversion. It is suggested that government should treat agents differentially by their risk preferences and set audit-related parameters carefully to avoid unnecessary public expenditure.","Ma, Yong; Jiang, Hao; Xiao, Weilin",,112,29

In the present work a detailed interaction study between the phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants and the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2 has been performed. The top four phytochemicals obtained through molecular docking were, swertiapuniside, cordifolide A, sitoindoside IX, and amarogentin belonging to Swertia chirayita, Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera. These ligands bound to the RdRP were further studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The principal component analysis of these systems showed significant conformational changes in the finger and thumb subdomain of the RdRP. Hydrogen bonding, salt-bridge and water mediated interactions supported by MM-GBSA free energy of binding revealed strong binding of cordifolide A and sitoindoside IX to RdRP. The ligand-interacting residues belonged to either of the seven conserved motifs of the RdRP. These residues were polar and charged amino acids, namely, ARG 553, ARG 555, ASP 618, ASP 760, ASP 761, GLU 811, and SER 814. The glycosidic moieties of the phytochemicals were observed to form favourable interactions with these residues. Hence, these phytochemicals may hold the potential to act as RdRP inhibitors owing to their stability in binding to the druggable site.","Koulgi, Shruti; Jani, Vinod; Uppuladinne V.

The post-antibiotic era has raised the need to find alternative approaches to antibiotic administration, as major pathogens becoming resistant to antibiotics. An in-depth understanding of ADPr reactions provides the rationale for designing novel antimicrobial strategies for treatment of infectious diseases.

In the present manuscript, we explored whether HLA class I genotypes can be associated with the critical course of Coronavirus Disease-19 by searching possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A(*)01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A(*)02:01 and HLA-A(*)03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A(*)01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A(*)02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age. Application of the constructed RS model to an independent Spanish patients cohort (n = 45) revealed that the score was also associated with the severity of the disease. The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19.","Shkurnikov, Maxim; Nersisyan, Stepan; Jankevic, Tatjana; Galatenko, Alexei; Gordeev, Ivan; Vechorko, Valery; Tonevitsky, Alexander",Front Immunol,112,30

While much of the focus is on respiratory infections, there is substantial evidence that certain pathogens, such as those which colonise the skin, can be released into, and transported through the air through routine activities. In these situations the bacteria is released over a volume of space, with different intensities and locations varying in time rather than being released at a single point. This paper considers the application of CFD modelling to the evaluation of risk from this type of bioaerosol generation. An experimental validation study provides a direct comparison between CFD simulations and bioaerosol distribution, showing that passive scalar and particle tracking approaches are both appropriate for small particle bioaerosols. The study introduces a zonal source, which aims to represent the time averaged release of bacteria from an activity within a zone around the entire location the release takes place. This approach is shown to perform well when validated numerically though comparison with the time averaged dispersion patterns from a transient source. However, the ability of a point source to represent such dispersion is dependent on airflow regime. The applicability of the model is demonstrated using a simulation of an isolation room representing the release of bacteria from bedmaking.","Hathway, E.A.; Noakes, C.J.; Sleigh, P.A.; Fletcher, L.A.",Build Environ,112,26

Though no specific drug has been developed so far, emerging agents have been confirmed effective or potentially beneficial to restrain it. Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) is a commonly used Chinese medical preparation to treat viral influenza, including in the fight against SARS in 2002–2003 in China. Recent data also showed that LHQW played a vigorous role in COVID-19 treatment. PURPOSE: This review will elucidate the pre-clinical and clinical evidence of LHQW in lung protection and antiviral activities, and provide timely data delivery for the exploration of effective treatment strategies in the therapy of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: The research data were obtained from the academic databases (up to August 8, 2020) including Pubmed, CNKI and Web of Science, on ethnobotany and ethno medicines. The search keywords for screening the literature information were “virus”, “COVID-19”, or “SARS-CoV-2”, and “Lianhua Qingwen”. The documents were filtered and summarized for final evaluation. RESULTS: The collected evidence demonstrated that LHQW exhibited benefits against COVID-19. Impressively, LHQW in conjunction with conventional treatment could significantly improve COVID-19 patients as a synergetic strategy. The mechanisms were mainly involved the antiviral activity, and regulation of inflammation response as well as immune function. CONCLUSION: Although the data were far from adequate, the latest advances had shown the benefits of LHQW in COVID-19, especially in combination with other antiviral drugs. This review provides comprehensive evidence of LHQW as a complementary strategy for treating COVID-19. Nevertheless, imperious researches should be conducted to clarify the unconfirmed effects, regulatory mechanisms and adverse reactions of LHQW in treating COVID-19 by means of well designed randomized controlled trials.","Li, Liu-Cheng; Zhang, Zhi-Hui; Zhou, Wen-Cheng; Chen, Jie; Jin, Hua-Qian; Fang, Hong-Mei; Chen, Qin; Jin, Ye-Cheng; Qu, Jiao; Kan, Lian-Di",Biomed Pharmacother,112,20

These institutions have turned to distance learning to provide educational continuity. Schools now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. However, there is little empirical evidence to guide decision-makers on how this can be achieved. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyses of >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network revealed that population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results show that e-learning interventions can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimizing disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during early or late stages of a disease outbreak.","Yeo, Sing Chen; Lai, Clin K.Y.; Tan, Jacinda; Gooley, Joshua J.",bioRxiv,112,16

During the first weeks after birth, an impressive growth and maturation phase is occurring in the gland during which the distinct hormonal cell populations expand. During pubertal growth and development, growth hormone (GH) levels need to peak which requires an adaptive enterprise in the GH-producing somatotrope population. At aging, pituitary function wanes which is associated with organismal decay including the somatopause in which GH levels drop. In addition to these key time points of life, the pituitary’s endocrine cell landscape plastically adapts during specific (patho-)physiological conditions such as lactation (need for PRL) and stress (engagement of ACTH). Particular resilience is witnessed after physical injury in the (murine) gland, culminating in regeneration of destroyed cell populations. In many other tissues, adaptive and regenerative processes involve the local stem cells. Over the last 15 years, evidence has accumulated that the pituitary gland houses a resident stem cell compartment. Recent studies propose their involvement in at least some of the cell remodeling processes that occur in the postnatal pituitary but support is still fragmentary and not unequivocal. Many questions remain unsolved such as whether the stem cells are key players in the vivid neonatal growth phase and whether the decline in pituitary function at old age is associated with decreased stem cell fitness. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanisms of pituitary plasticity, in particular the stem cell-linked ones, are still largely unknown. Pituitary research heavily relies on transgenic in vivo mouse models. While having proven their value, answers to pituitary stem cell-focused questions may more diligently come from a novel powerful in vitro research model, termed organoids, which grow from pituitary stem cells and recapitulate stem cell phenotype and activation status. In this review, we describe pituitary plasticity conditions and summarize what is known on the involvement and phenotype of pituitary stem cells during these pituitary remodeling events.","Laporte, Emma; Vennekens, Annelies; Vankelecom, Hugo",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),112,22

Methods: Descriptive study of a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak registered in March-April 2020 at medical ward of onco-hematological patients in an Spanish hospital. Confirmed cases were hospitalized patients, healthcare and non-healthcare workers who tested positive by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: Twenty-two COVID-19 cases (12 workers and 10 inpatients) were laboratory-confirmed. Initial cases were a healthcare provider and a visitor who tested positive. The median patients age was 73 years (range 62-88). The main reason of admission was haematological in 8 patients and oncologic in 2. All patients followed an immunosuppressive treatment, 5/10 with high-flow oxygen nebulizations. Five patients presented a moderate/serious evolution, and 5 patients died. The mean workers age was 42.1±10.9. One healthworker required Intensive Care Unit admission, and all of them recovered completely. Conclusions: In the hospital setting, close patients surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is essential, especially in immunosuppressed patients.

Since the recent emergence of new variants, associated with increased transmissibility and/or antibody escape (variants of concern), there is an urgent need for methods that enable specific and timely detection and quantification of the occurrence of these variants in the community. In this study we demonstrate the use of RT-ddPCR on wastewater samples for specific detection of mutation N501Y. This assay enabled simultaneous enumeration of the concentration of variants with the 501Y mutation and Wild Type (WT, containing 501N) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detection of N501Y was possible in samples with mixtures of WT with low proportions of lineage B.1.351 (0.5%). The method could accurately determine the proportion of N501Y and WT in mixtures of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The application to raw sewage samples from the cities of Amsterdam and Utrecht demonstrated that this method can be applied to determine the concentrations and the proportions of WT and N501Y containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples. The emergence of N501Y in Amsterdam and Utrecht wastewater aligned with the emergence of B.1.1.7 as causative agent of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, indicating that RT-ddPCR of wastewater samples can be used to monitor the emergence of the N501Y mutation in the community. It also indicates that RT-ddPCR could be used for sensitive and accurate monitoring of current (like K417N, E484K) or future mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Monitoring emergence of these mutations in the community via wastewater is rapid, efficient and valuable in supporting public health decision-making.","Heijnen, L.; Elsinga, G.; de Graaf, M.; Molenkamp, R.; Koopmans, M.

These factors include aerosol generation, particle sizes and concentrations, organism viability, infectivity and virulence, airflow and climate, and environmental sampling and analysis. The major focus on attention to engineering controls comes from recent increases in tuberculosis, particularly the multidrug-resistant varieties in the general hospital population, the severely immunocompromised, and those in at-risk and confined environments such as prisons, long-term care facilities, and shelters for the homeless. Many workers are in close contact with persons who have active, undiagnosed, or insufficiently treated tuberculosis. Additionally, patients and health care workers may be exposed to a variety of pathogenic human viruses, opportunistic fungi, and bacteria. This report therefore focuses on the nature of infectious aerosol transmission in an attempt to determine which factors can be systematically addressed to result in proven, applied engineering approaches to the control of infectious aerosols in hospital and health care facility environments. The infectious aerosols of consideration are those that are generated as particles of respirable size by both human and environmental sources and that have the capability of remaining viable and airborne for extended periods in the indoor environment. This definition precludes skin and mucous membrane exposures occurring from splashes (rather than true aerosols) of blood or body fluids containing infectious disease agents.

At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, optimization of quarantine regimes becomes paramount for public health, societal well-being, and global economy. However, biological factors that determine the duration of the virus incubation period remain poorly understood. RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the length of the incubation period and disease severity for a wide range of human pathogenic viruses. Using a machine learning approach, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates, solely from several virus genome features, in particular, the number of protein-coding genes and the GC content, the incubation time ranges for diverse human pathogenic RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The predictive approach described here can directly help in establishing the appropriate quarantine durations and thus facilitate controlling future outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The length of the incubation period in viral diseases strongly correlates with disease severity, emphasizing the biological and epidemiological importance of the incubation period. Perhaps, surprisingly, incubation times of pathogenic RNA viruses can be accurately predicted solely from generic features of virus genomes. Elucidation of the biological underpinnings of the connections between these features and disease progression can be expected to reveal key aspects of virus pathogenesis.","Gussow, Ayal B.; Auslander, Noam; Wolf, Yuri I.; Koonin, Eugene V.",BMC Biol,112,1

Here, we report 4 cases that meet the definition of clinical reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as a literature review on this subject; all occurred in healthcare workers in Acapulco Guerrero, Mexico who provide their services in a hospital that cares for patients with COVID-19. The time between the manifestation of the first and second infection for each case was 134, 129, 107 and 82 days, all patients presented symptomatology in both events. The time between remission of the first infection and onset of second infection was 108, 109, 78 and 67 days for each case, while the time to confirmation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between infections was 134, 124, 106 and 77 days. In two of the four cases the reinfection resulted in a more severe case, while in the remaining two cases the manifestation of symptoms and complications was similar to that presented in the first infection. Given this scenario, greater care is needed in the management of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 to protect healthcare workers and the general public from risks and complications caused by a possible reinfection by SARS-CoV-2.","Garduño-Orbe, Brenda; Sánchez-Rebolledo, Juan Manuel; Cortés-Rafael, Mustafá; García-Jiménez, Yuliana; Perez-Ortiz, Marcelina; Mendiola-Pastrana, Indira Rocío; López-Ortiz, Eduardo; López-Ortiz, Geovani",Medicina (Kaunas),112,22

We recruited 38 (aged 22–74 years; 27 males) patients hospitalized for complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonintensive COVID units. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing about 5 months after hospital discharge. Of all patients, 42.1% had processing speed deficits, while 26.3% showed delayed verbal recall deficits. Twenty-one percent presented with deficits in both processing speed and verbal memory. Bivariate analysis revealed a positive correlation between the lowest arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2)) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) (P/F) ratio during hospitalization and verbal memory consolidation performance (SRT-LTS score, r = 0.404, p = 0.027), as well as a positive correlation between SpO(2) levels upon hospital arrival and delayed verbal recall performance (SRT-D score, r(s) = 0.373, p = 0.042). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during hospitalization was associated with worse verbal memory performance (ARDS vs. no ARDS: SRT-LTS mean score = 30.63 ± 13.33 vs. 44.50 ± 13.16, p = 0.007; SRT-D mean score = 5.95 ± 2.56 vs. 8.10 ± 2.62, p = 0.029). Cognitive abnormalities can frequently be found in COVID-19 patients 5 months after hospital discharge. Increased fatigability, deficits of concentration and memory, and overall decreased cognitive speed months after hospital discharge can interfere with work and daily activities.","Ferrucci, Roberta; Dini, Michelangelo; Groppo, Elisabetta; Rosci, Chiara; Reitano, Maria Rita; Bai, Francesca; Poletti, Barbara; Brugnera, Agostino; Silani, Vincenzo; D’Arminio Monforte, Antonella; Priori, Alberto",Brain Sci,112,16

Like all flaviviruses, ZIKV relies on the cellular machinery to complete its viral cycle, with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) being the critical site of viral replication factories. The sudden high protein load in the ER induces an ER stress to which the cell responds with an appropriate unfolded protein response (UPR) in an attempt to restore its disturbed homeostasis. When the restoration fails, the cell signalling leads to a programmed cell death by apoptosis with the upregulation of the UPR-induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) which acts as the main trigger for this fatal outcome. Our previous studies have shown the ability of ZIKV to manipulate various cellular responses in order to optimize virus production. ZIKV is able to delay apoptosis to its benefit and although ER stress is induced, the UPR is not complete. Here we discovered that ZIKV impairs the expression of CHOP/DDIT3, the main factor responsible of ER-stress driven apoptosis. Surprisingly, the mechanism does not take place at the transcriptional level but at the translational level.","Turpin, Jonathan; El-Safadi, Daed; Lebeau, Grégorie; Frumence, Etienne; Desprès, Philippe; Viranaïcken, Wildriss; Krejbich-Trotot, Pascale",Int J Mol Sci,112,3

Systematic studies on the opinions of people most affected by health inequities are limited. Therefore, we included evaluations of teleconsultation-based services offered to socioeconomically disadvantaged and clinically vulnerable populations globally, with a focus on surveillance, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This review includes analytical and descriptive observational studies primarily from MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases, published after the World Health Organization received the first warnings about COVID-19 from Chinese authorities in December, 2019, until December 2020. The search strategy combined aspects of COVID-19, telemedicine, patient satisfaction, and key concepts of vulnerable populations. Results: We selected 33 studies for full-text reading and 10 for critical appraisal. Two categories emerged from the qualitative analysis: telehealth evaluation and services during COVID-19, and opinions of vulnerable populations. Television and social networks play a crucial role in providing information. Although teleconsultations are practical and cost effective for patients, the majority preferred receiving in-person treatment in primary care clinics. Conclusions: Listening to the opinions of vulnerable groups and their caregivers is critical both before and during adoption of COVID-19 control measures. Health managers need to monitor the health of and delivery of services to socioeconomically and clinically vulnerable people closely, to improve services, and provide care from a human rights perspective.","Silva, Angélica Baptista; Sindico, Sergio Ricardo Ferreira; Carneiro, Ana Carolina; Henrique, Sávio Mourão; Fernandes, Arthur Gustavo; Gomes, Joyker Peçanha; Marinho, Thaysa Pereira; Fernandes, Valcler Rangel",Telemed J E Health,112,1

In the medical field, although many patients prefer remote medical care, this prevents the physician from examining the patient directly; thus, it is important for patients to accurately convey their condition to the physician. Accordingly, remote medical care should be implemented and adaptable home medical devices are required. However, only a few highly accurate home medical devices are available for automatic wheeze detection as an exacerbation sign. OBJECTIVE: We developed a new handy home medical device with an automatic wheeze recognition algorithm, which is available for clinical use in noisy environments such as a pediatric consultation room or at home. Moreover, the examination time is only 30 seconds, since young children cannot endure a long examination time without crying or moving. The aim of this study was to validate the developed automatic wheeze recognition algorithm as a clinical medical device in children at different institutions. METHODS: A total of 374 children aged 4-107 months in pediatric consultation rooms of 10 institutions were enrolled in this study. All participants aged ≥6 years were diagnosed with bronchial asthma and patients ≤5 years had reported at least three episodes of wheezes. Wheezes were detected by auscultation with a stethoscope and recorded for 30 seconds using the wheeze recognition algorithm device (HWZ-1000T) developed based on wheeze characteristics following the Computerized Respiratory Sound Analysis guideline, where the dominant frequency and duration of a wheeze were >100 Hz and >100 ms, respectively. Files containing recorded lung sounds were assessed by each specialist physician and divided into two groups: 177 designated as “wheeze” files and 197 as “no-wheeze” files. Wheeze recognitions were compared between specialist physicians who recorded lung sounds and those recorded using the wheeze recognition algorithm. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for all recorded sound files, and evaluated the influence of age and sex on the wheeze detection sensitivity. RESULTS: Detection of wheezes was not influenced by age and sex. In all files, wheezes were differentiated from noise using the wheeze recognition algorithm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the wheeze recognition algorithm were 96.6%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 97.0%, respectively. Wheezes were automatically detected, and heartbeat sounds, voices, and crying were automatically identified as no-wheeze sounds by the wheeze recognition algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The wheeze recognition algorithm was verified to identify wheezing with high accuracy; therefore, it might be useful in the practical implementation of asthma management at home. Only a few home medical devices are available for automatic wheeze detection. The wheeze recognition algorithm was verified to identify wheezing with high accuracy and will be useful for wheezing management at home and in remote medical care.","Habukawa, Chizu; Ohgami, Naoto; Arai, Takahiko; Makata, Haruyuki; Tomikawa, Morimitsu; Fujino, Tokihiko; Manabe, Tetsuharu; Ogihara, Yoshihito; Ohtani, Kiyotaka; Shirao, Kenichiro; Sugai, Kazuko; Asai, Kei; Sato, Tetsuya; Murakami, Katsumi",JMIR Pediatr Parent,112,1

It usually presents as a rapidly growing cervical mass that generates compressive symptoms. Its association with thyrotoxicosis is rare. A 76-year-old woman, with no contributory history, presented with a 3-month course of fast-growing cervical tumor, associated with tenderness, cough, and weight loss. Physical examination revealed goiter, localized erythema, and a painful and stone tumor dependent on the right thyroid lobe. Due to the malignant findings of the thyroid ultrasound, the patient underwent a thyroid core needle biopsy, which indicated ATC. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone, elevated free thyroxine (fT4), and increased thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies. At the beginning, we considered that the etiology of thyrotoxicosis was secondary to subacute thyroiditis (SAT) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to the immunochromatography result and chest tomography findings. The result of markedly elevated TPO antibodies left this etiology more remote. Therefore, we suspected Graves’ disease as an etiology; however, thyroid histopathology and ultrasound did not show compatible findings. Therefore, we suspect that the main etiology of thyrotoxicosis in the patient was the destruction of the thyroid follicles caused by a rapid invasion of malignant cells, which is responsible for the consequent release of preformed thyroid hormone. ATC is a rare endocrine neoplasm with high mortality; it may be associated with thyrotoxicosis, whose etiology can be varied; therefore, differential diagnosis is important for proper management. LEARNING POINTS: Anaplastic thyroid cancer is the thyroid cancer with the worst prognosis and the highest mortality. The association of anaplastic thyroid cancer with thyrotoxicosis is rare, and a differential diagnosis is necessary to provide adequate treatment. Due to the current pandemic, in patients with thyrotoxicosis, it is important to rule out SARS-CoV-2 as an etiology. Anaplastic thyroid cancer, due to its aggressive behavior and rapid growth, can destroy thyroid follicular cells, generating preformed thyroid hormone release, being responsible for thyrotoxicosis.","Concepción Zavaleta, Marcio José; Ildefonso Najarro, Sofia Pilar; Plasencia Dueñas, Esteban Alberto; Quispe Flores, María Alejandra; Moreno Marreros, Diego Martín; Concepción Urteaga, Luis Alberto; Luna Victorio, Laura Esther; Fernández Dávila, Freddy Valdivia",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,112,26

Limited information is available to identify those greatest risk for cardiac complications. The objective of this study is to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were CE and mortality. Cardiovascular events included heart failure, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE. Multiple logistics regression analyses were used to determine predictors of CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Inpatients with COVID-19 had greater odds of having a CE (n=126) if they were older, male, black, and had pulmonary and cardiovascular comorbidities (p < 0.001). Inpatients who had higher levels of potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, activated partial prothrombin time, domain-dimer, interleukin-6, white blood cell count, and oxygen requirements had an increased odds of having a CE (p < 0.05). Cardiovascular events were associated with higher mortality (45.24%). Blacks had greater odds of CEs in the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (p=0.008, p=0.014, respectively), however, blacks had better survival, despite having greater risk. Conclusions Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular events and death were identified in this sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and mortality was increased significantly in those inpatients who had CEs.","Roser, Lynn P.; McGuffin, Trevor C.; XU, QIAN; Salunkhe, Vidyulata; Samanapally, Harideep; Nathala, Pavani; Kong, Maiying; Huang, Jiapeng",American Journal of Infection Control,112,9

This impact can be reduced by applying a range of evidence-based coping strategies. Based on previous research, we created a pamphlet-based communication campaign designed to assist adults to provide support for young people confronted with emotional distress associated with the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] and the related disease [coronavirus disease (COVID-19)] in 2020. We developed a pamphlet describing the common emotions children and adolescents report feeling in the face of disasters and the coping strategies that have proven effective in mitigating them. The target population was adults who interact with children and adolescents in both formal and informal settings. The pamphlet included basic information on this specific emergency, emotions that might be commonly experienced, and coping strategies for dealing with negative emotions. The aim of this paper is to describe the planning, development, and implementation of the campaign. First, we monitored how the media gave visibility to the campaign during the 40 days following the release of the pamphlet: it potentially reached a large audience at a national and international level through at least 216 media channels included the HEMOT(®) (Helmet for EMOTions) website. Second, Google Analytics™ data from the HEMOT(®) website enabled us to examine the characteristics of the visitors to the website and the behavior of those who viewed the pamphlet. More than 6,000 visitors, most from Europe followed by the Americas, visited the website in the first 40 days after the pamphlet publication. The webpage including the pamphlet obtained over 6,200 views, most directly or via other websites. A cluster analysis suggested that the access to the webpage did not mirror the trend concerning the new cases of COVID-19 in Italy (which increased during the central phase of the campaign) or worldwide (which continued to increase across the 40 days). Third, data gathered with a convenience sample of adults who had consulted the pamphlet provided a perspective on the comprehensibility of the messages conveyed by the pamphlet and on the utility for children and adolescents. The process we have demonstrated in this example could be replicated in different communities and settings to respond to the spread of the COVID-19 or to respond to other widespread or more localized disasters.","Raccanello, Daniela; Vicentini, Giada; Rocca, Emmanuela; Barnaba, Veronica; Hall, Rob; Burro, Roberto",Front Psychol,112,24

AIMS: This study surveyed first round PPP loan disbursement to otolaryngology practices in the United States in response to COVID‐19. METHODS: A cross‐sectional study was conducted using publicly available data published on PPP by the SBA. Otolaryngology clinics receiving loans greater than $0.15M were filtered using the following terms: “otolaryngology”, “otolaryngologist”,“sinus”, “head and neck”, “throat”, “ENT”, and “facial plastic”. 481 ENT clinics that received loans greater than $0.15 M from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) were identified. Loan amount, business type, geographicregion, owner race, owner gender, and the number of jobs per business were recorded for each clinic. Chi‐square analysis was performed to determine significance (P < 0.05) of each characteristic. RESULTS: Loan distribution was significantly different based on jobs reported (P < .001) and business type (P < .001). 100% of loans ranging from $0.15 M to $0.35 M went to micro and small practices whereas 33% of medium‐sized practices received loans greater than $1 M. Higher proportions of Subchapter corporations (60.00%) received smaller loans of $0.15 to $0.35 M than Limited Liability Companies (39.13%) and Corporations (51.69%) which generally employ more people. DISCUSSION: Loan distribution was significantly different between businesses based on jobs reported (P < 0.001), with micro/small practices recieving smaller loans than their medium counterparts. All large businesses recived loans in in excess of $2 M. This suggests proportional distribution of loans in accordance with jobs reported. CONCLUSION: This study suggests PPP funding was objectively distributed to ENT clinics based on staff size.

Vaccination is one of the most effective tools available to Public Health. Its potential usefulness is threatened by the rise of vaccine hesitancy among the general population, which has grown as much as to prompt the World Health Organization to express its concerns on the matter. The risk posed by vaccine hesitancy is even more concerning in the light of the efforts to curb the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which focus mainly on mass vaccination campaigns. This holds especially true when applied to healthcare professionals, among whom vaccine hesitancy can be particularly detrimental. For these reasons, our study focuses on potential determinants of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare professionals. Study design. The study is a cross-sectional study. Methods. Data were collected from January 1st to February 16th, by means of a self-administered online questionnaire in a cohort of Italian healthcare professionals. Results. Overall, 10,898 questionnaires were collected. Among the respondents, 1.1% expressed vaccine hesitancy. Hesitancy was less frequent in professionals involved in Primary Care and in the Clinical Sciences/ Public Health group. Among clinicians, paediatricians, oncologists, and geriatrists showed especially accepting attitudes towards vaccination. Lower hesitancy rates were also registered among the respondents who already had received influenza vaccination and who never had any adverse effects following vaccination.

Rapid intervention necessitates the capacity to generate, grow, and genetically manipulate infectious CoVs in order to rapidly evaluate pathogenic mechanisms, host and tissue permissibility, and candidate antiviral therapeutic efficacy. CoVs encode the largest viral RNA genomes at about 28–32,000 nucleotides in length, and thereby complicate efficient engineering of the genome. Deconstructing the genome into manageable fragments affords the plasticity necessary to rapidly introduce targeted genetic changes in parallel and assort mutated fragments while maximizing genome stability over time. In this protocol we describe a well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy for CoVs that is comprised of partitioning the viral genome into 5–7 independent DNA fragments (depending on the CoV genome), each subcloned into a plasmid for increased stability and ease of genetic manipulation and amplification. Coronavirus genomes are conveniently partitioned by introducing type IIS or IIG restriction enzyme recognition sites that confer directional cloning. Since each restriction site leaves a unique overhang between adjoining fragments, reconstruction of the full-length genome can be achieved through a standard DNA ligation comprised of equal molar ratios of each fragment. Using this method, recombinant CoVs can be rapidly generated and used to investigate host range, gene function, pathogenesis, and candidate therapeutics for emerging and preemergent CoVs both in vitro and in vivo.","Cockrell, Adam S.; Beall, Anne; Yount, Boyd; Baric, Ralph",Reverse Genetics of RNA Viruses,112,1

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain imaging and visual evoked potential studies provide evidence for excessive neuronal activity in the medial temporal lobe, specifically the lingual gyrus, and suggest the VS syndrome is a hyperexcitability syndrome. These data provide the basis for consideration of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a potential treatment for the VS syndrome. Objective: To publish the study protocol for a pilot study underway at the University of Colorado School of Medicine to investigate the use of rTMS intervention to improve symptoms and visual dysfunction associated with VS. The study aims to determine the adverse events and drop-out rate, evaluate performance of outcome measures, including a novel VS symptom scale, and describe changes in outcomes associated with treatment. Methods and Design: Up to 10 participants meeting criteria for VS syndrome, age 19–65 years, will undergo an open-label intervention consisting of 10 rTMS sessions, occurring 5 days a week over a 2-week period. Participants will complete pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments that include: the Colorado Visual Snow Scale (CVSS), the National Eye Institute Visual Functional Questionnaire—25 (VFQ-25), the General Anxiety Disorder—7 scale (GAD-7), and three psychophysical visual processing tasks. Discussion: Knowledge gained from this pilot study will inform future study planning and provide valuable lessons for future investigation of rTMS for the VS syndrome.

Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of three types of flavonoids against CHIKV in vitro replication. Three compounds: silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activities against CHIKV using a CHIKV replicon cell line and clinical isolate of CHIKV of Central/East African genotype. A cytopathic effect inhibition assay was used to determine their activities on CHIKV viral replication and quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to calculate virus yield. Antiviral activity of effective compound was further investigated by evaluation of CHIKV protein expression using western blotting for CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and E2E1 proteins. Briefly, silymarin exhibited significant antiviral activity against CHIKV, reducing both CHIKV replication efficiency and down-regulating production of viral proteins involved in replication.

Among them, a high mannose (HM)-binding anti-HIV lectin, ESA-2 from the red alga Eucheuma serra, showed the highest inhibition against infection with an EC(50) of 12.4 nM. Moreover, ESA-2 exhibited a wide range of antiviral spectrum against various influenza strains with EC(50)s of pico molar to low nanomolar levels. Besides ESA-2, HM-binding plant lectin ConA, fucose-binding lectins such as fungal AOL from Aspergillus oryzae and AAL from Aleuria aurantia were active against H1N1-2009, but the potency of inhibition was of less magnitude compared with ESA-2. Direct interaction between ESA-2 and a viral envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), was demonstrated by ELISA assay. This interaction was effectively suppressed by glycoproteins bearing HM-glycans, indicating that ESA-2 binds to the HA of influenza virus through HM-glycans. Upon treatment with ESA-2, no viral antigens were detected in the host cells, indicating that ESA-2 inhibited the initial steps of virus entry into the cells.

However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines, and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.","Brady, Shannon C.; Zdraljevic, Stefan; Bisaga, Karol W.; Tanny, Robyn E.; Cook, Daniel E.; Lee, Daehan; Wang, Ye; Andersen, Erik C.",Genetics,112,9

Short-term physiologic responses to the vaccine have not been studied using wearable devices. OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize physiologic changes in response to COVID-19 vaccination in a small cohort of participants using a wearable device (WHOOP Strap 3.0). This is a proof of concept for using consumer-grade wearable devices to monitor response to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, physiologic data from 19 internal medicine residents at a single institution that received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was collected using the WHOOP Strap 3.0. The primary outcomes were percent change from baseline in heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate (RHR), and respiratory rate (RR). Secondary outcomes were percent change from baseline in total, rapid eye movement, and deep sleep. Exploratory outcomes included local and systemic reactogenicity following each dose and prophylactic analgesic use. RESULTS: In 19 individuals (mean age 28.8, SD 2.2 years; n=10, 53% female), HRV was decreased on day 1 following administration of the first vaccine dose (mean –13.44%, SD 13.62%) and second vaccine dose (mean –9.25%, SD 22.6%). RHR and RR showed no change from baseline after either vaccine dose. Sleep duration was increased up to 4 days post vaccination, after an initial decrease on day 1. Increased sleep duration prior to vaccination was associated with a greater change in HRV. Local and systemic reactogenicity was more severe after dose two. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first observational study of the physiologic response to any of the novel COVID-19 vaccines as measured using wearable devices. Using this relatively small healthy cohort, we provide evidence that HRV decreases in response to both vaccine doses, with no significant changes in RHR or RR. Sleep duration initially decreased following each dose with a subsequent increase thereafter. Future studies with a larger sample size and comparison to other inflammatory and immune biomarkers such as antibody response will be needed to determine the true utility of this type of continuous wearable monitoring in regards to vaccine responses. Our data raises the possibility that increased sleep prior to vaccination may impact physiologic responses and may be a modifiable way to increase vaccine response. These results may inform future studies using wearables for monitoring vaccine responses.

SARS-CoV-2 infection begins by attaching to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) via the spike glycoprotein, followed by cleavage by TMPRSS2, revealing the viral fusion domain. Other presumptive receptors for SARS-CoV-2 attachment include CD147, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and Myeloid C-lectin like receptor (CLR), each of which might play a role in the systemic viral spread. The pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, often displaying a cytokine storm syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Despite progress made, the detailed mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the host immune system remain unclear and are an area of very active research. The process’s key players include viral non-structural proteins and open reading frame products, which have been implicated in immune antagonism.

Several suggestive therapeutic options through drug repurposing are recommended, but a complete consensus is not reached. A combination of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZM) has been widely tried and discussed but its administration has also led to potential adversities in patients. Studies are suggesting that most prominent adverse event with HCQ and AZM combination is QT interval prolongation. We studied interaction of HCQ with AZM and subsequent effect of this drug combination on QT interval prolongation. We performed system biological investigation of HCQ and AZM targets and screened important targets and pathways possibly involved in QT interval prolongation. The best core hub protein drug targets involved in QT interval prolongation were identified as HSP90AA1 exclusively associated with HCQ, while AKT1 exclusively associated with AZM. It was found that PI3K/Akt, VEGF, ERBB2 pathways must be given consideration for understanding the role of HCQ and AZM in QT interval prolongation. Conclusion: Computational methods have certain limitations based on source database coverage and prediction algorithms and therefore this data needs experimental correlation to draw final conclusion, but current findings screen targets for QT interval prolongation associated with HCQ and AZM.

Patients with mild or moderate COVID‐19 were randomly divided into the BRH group or the control group at a 2:1 ratio. Routine treatment according to China’s Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan was performed in both groups, whereas patients in the BRH group were additionally given oral BRH (32 mg t.i.d.) for 14 consecutive days. The efficacy and safety of BRH were evaluated. A total of 18 patients with moderate COVID‐19 were randomized into the BRH group (n = 12) or the control group (n = 6). There were suggestions of BRH advantage over placebo in improved chest computed tomography, need for oxygen therapy, and discharge rate within 20 days. However, none of these findings were statistically significant. BRH tablets may potentially have a beneficial effect in patients with COVID‐19, especially for those with lung or hepatic injury.

However, the studies conducted so far are mainly based on web surveys which may involve selection bias. The PACOVID survey relies on a population-based design and addresses the attitudes, psychological and social experiences of the oldest old regarding the pandemic and lockdown and their impact. Material and Methods: Cross-sectional phone survey involving 677 persons. Baseline report on attitudes, psychological, and social experiences of the oldest old, regarding the pandemic and lockdown measures. Results: The mean age was 87.53 (SD 5.19). About 46% were living alone during the lockdown. Concerning difficulties, “none” was the most frequent answer (35.6%). For questions addressing how often they had felt sad, depressed, or lonely (CESD-scale), the most frequent answers were “never/very rarely” (58.7, 76.6, 60.8%) and 27.1% had anxious symptomatology (STAI scale). Most (92.9%) felt socially supported. Engaging in leisure activities was the most frequent coping strategy, and for numerous participants the lockdown did not represent much of a change in terms of daily routine. A very good knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 and the safety measures was observed. Comparisons with measures collected before the pandemic showed low changes in subjective health and the CES-D questions. Discussion: With a methodological design limiting selection bias, our results claim for a weakened psychosocial impact even though the participants are concerned and aware of the pandemic issues. These results highlight the resources and resilience abilities of older persons including in advancing age.","Hernández-Ruiz, Virgilio; Meillon, Céline; Avila-Funes, José-Alberto; Bergua, Valérie; Dartigues, Jean-François; Koleck, Michèle; Letenneur, Luc; Ouvrard, Camille; Pérès, Karine; Rascle, Nicole; Tabue-Teguo, Maturin; Amieva, Hélène",Front Psychiatry,112,16

This requires readjustment of the functional balance of the sialic acid receptor-binding hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) to the sialoglycan-receptor repertoire of the new host. Novel techniques have revealed mechanistic details of this HA–NA–receptor balance, emphasizing a previously underappreciated crucial role for NA in driving the motility of receptor-associated IAV particles. Motility enables virion penetration of the sialylated mucus layer as well as attachment to, and uptake into, underlying epithelial cells. As IAVs are essentially irreversibly bound in the absence of NA activity, the fine-tuning of the HA–NA–receptor balance rather than the binding avidity of IAV particles per se is an important factor in determining host species tropism.","de Vries, Erik; Du, Wenjuan; Guo, Hongbo; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.",Trends Microbiol,112,20

However, we suggest that this deference is warranted because these questions have been appropriately probed many times by many different kinds of people. While non-experts should defer to epidemiologists with regard to matters within the sphere of epidemiology specifically, responding to the pandemic requires expertise from many fields.

It particularly affects children under five years of age. The most common causative agents are coxsackieviruses A6 and A16, and enterovirus A71 (EV71). The clinical presentation is usually mild and self-limited, but, in some cases, severe and fatal complications develop. To date, no specific therapy or worldwide vaccine is available. In general, viral infection invokes both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Passive immunity transfer can ameliorate the severe symptoms of diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, MERS, and SARS. Hyperimmune plasma (HIP) from healthy donors with high anti-EV71 neutralizing titer were used to transfuse confirmed EV71-infected children with neurological involvement (n = 6). It resulted in recovery within three days, with no neurological sequelae apparent upon examination 14 days later. Following HIP treatment, plasma chemokines were decreased, whereas anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines gradually increased. Interestingly, IL-6 and G-CSF levels in cerebrospinal fluid declined sharply within three days. These findings indicate that HIP has therapeutic potential for HFMD with neurological complications. However, given the small number of patients who have been treated, a larger cohort study should be undertaken. Successful outcomes would stimulate the development of anti-EV71 monoclonal antibody therapy.","Techasaensiri, Chonnamet; Wongsa, Artit; Puthanakit, Thanyawee; Chokephaibulkit, Kulkanya; Chotpitayasunondh, Tawee; Charoonruangrit, Ubonwon; Sombatnimitsakul, Somjai; Puthavathana, Pilaipan; Lerdsamran, Hatairat; Auewarakul, Prasert; Tassaneetrithep, Boonrat",Pathogens,112,9

This study aimed to uncover opportunities and barriers for genetic service delivery in the Kenyan healthcare system from the perspectives of those who provide genetic testing and/or genetic counselling. Participants included Kenyan health personnel who deliver genetic services. This was a qualitative study that collected data via semi-structured one-on-one interviews and analyzed it using inductive thematic analysis. Participant demographics and characteristics of clinical genetic service provision were collected using a survey and results summarized using descriptive statistics. Themes revealed during analysis were compared to the clinical characteristics of genetic service provision to inform the opportunities and barriers. Fifteen interviews were conducted in total. Thematic analysis indicated that participants believed that the barriers facing genetic service delivery were linked to three themes: (1) education and training, (2) costs, and (3) counselling challenges. The opportunities for genetic service delivery were linked to four themes: (1) demand, (2) education and training, (3) encouraging a multidisciplinary approach to care, and (4) enhancing laboratory infrastructure. These findings are crucial for the development of a national evidence-informed and culturally appropriate model for genetic service delivery.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of two cohorts of consecutive patients with ELVO admitted to a quaternary hospital from March 1 to April 17, 2020. We abstracted data from electronic health records on baseline, biomarker profiles, key time points, quality measures and radiographic data. RESULTS: Of 179 patients admitted with ischemic stroke, 36 had ELVO. Patients with COVID-19 and ELVO had a higher risk of mortality during the pandemic versus patients without COVID-19 (OR 16.63, p = 0.004). An age-based sub-analysis showed in-hospital mortality in 60% of COVID-19 positive patients between 61-70 years-old, 66.7% in between 51-60 years-old, 50% in between 41-50 years-old and 33.3% in between 31-40 years old. Patients that presented with pulmonary symptoms at time of stroke presentation had 71.4% mortality rate. 27.3% of COVID-19 patients presenting with ELVO had a good outcome at discharge (mRS 0-2). Patients with a history of cigarette smoking (p = 0.003), elevated d-dimer (p = 0.007), failure to recanalize (p = 0.007), and elevated ferritin levels (p = 0.006) had an increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 and ELVO had a significantly higher risk for mortality compared to COVID-19 negative patients with ELVO. A small percentage of COVID-19 ELVO patients had good outcomes. Age greater than 60 and pulmonary symptoms at presentation have higher risk for mortality. Other risk factors for mortality were a history of cigarette smoking, elevated, failure to recanalize, elevated d-dimer and ferritin levels.","Altschul, David J; Esenwa, Charles; Haranhalli, Neil; Unda, Santiago R; de La Garza Ramos, Rafael; Dardick, Joseph; Fernandez-Torres, Jenelys; Toma, Aureliana; Labovitz, Daniel; Cheng, Natalie; Lee, Seon-Kyu; Brook, Allan; Zampolin, Richard",Interv Neuroradiol,112,1

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, and generally lacked quantitative measurements. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± SD), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","Parma, Valentina; Ohla, Kathrin; Veldhuizen, Maria G; Niv, Masha Y; Kelly, Christine E; Bakke, Alyssa J; Cooper, Keiland W; Bouysset, Cédric; Pirastu, Nicola; Dibattista, Michele; Kaur, Rishemjit; Liuzza, Marco Tullio; Pepino, Marta Y; Schöpf, Veronika; Pereda-Loth, Veronica; Olsson, Shannon B; Gerkin, Richard C; Rohlfs Domínguez, Paloma; Albayay, Javier; Farruggia, Michael C; Bhutani, Surabhi; Fjaeldstad, Alexander W; Kumar, Ritesh; Menini, Anna; Bensafi, Moustafa; Sandell, Mari; Konstantinidis, Iordanis; Di Pizio, Antonella; Genovese, Federica; Öztürk, Lina; Thomas-Danguin, Thierry; Frasnelli, Johannes; Boesveldt, Sanne; Saatci, Özlem; Saraiva, Luis R; Lin, Cailu; Golebiowski, Jérôme; Dar Hwang, Liang-; Ozdener, Mehmet Hakan; Guàrdia, Maria Dolors; Laudamiel, Christophe; Ritchie, Marina; Havlícek, Jan; Pierron, Denis; Roura, Eugeni; Navarro, Marta; Nolden, Alissa A; Lim, Juyun; Whitcroft, K L; Colquitt, Lauren R; Ferdenzi, Camille; Brindha, Evelyn V; Altundag, Aytug; Macchi, Alberto; Nunez-Parra, Alexia; Patel, Zara M; Fiorucci, Sébastien; Philpott, Carl M; Smith, Barry C; Lundström, Johan N; Mucignat, Carla; Parker, Jane K; van den Brink, Mirjam; Schmuker, Michael; Fischmeister, Florian Ph S; Heinbockel, Thomas; Shields, Vonnie D C; Faraji, Farhoud; Santamaría, Enrique; Fredborg, William E A; Morini, Gabriella; Olofsson, Jonas K; Jalessi, Maryam; Karni, Noam; D’Errico, Anna; Alizadeh, Rafieh; Pellegrino, Robert; Meyer, Pablo; Huart, Caroline; Chen, Ben; Soler, Graciela M; Alwashahi, Mohammed K; Welge-Lüssen, Antje; Freiherr, Jessica; de Groot, Jasper H B; Klein, Hadar; Okamoto, Masako; Singh, Preet Bano; Hsieh, Julien W; Reed, Danielle R; Hummel, Thomas; Munger, Steven D; Hayes, John E",Chem Senses,112,28

In international law terms, feminist calls for a response to the pandemic have privileged the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), conditioned—I argue—by two decades of the pursuit of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda through the UNSC. The deficiencies of the UNSC response, as characterised by the Resolution 2532 adopted to address the pandemic, manifest yet again the identified deficiencies of the WPS agenda at the UNSC, namely fragmentation, securitisation, efficacy and legitimacy. What Resolution 2532 does bring, however, is new clarity about the underlying reasons for the repeated and enduring nature of these deficiencies at the UNSC. Specifically, the COVID-19 ‘crisis’ is powerful in exposing the deficiencies of the crisis framework in which the UNSC operates. My reflections draw on insights from Hilary Charlesworth’s seminal contribution ‘International Law: A Discipline of Crisis’ to argue that, instead of conceding the ‘crisis’ framework to the pandemic by prioritising the UNSC, a ‘feminist recovery’ must instead follow Charlesworth’s exhortation to refocus on an international law of the everyday.","O’Rourke, Catherine",Fem Leg Stud,112,16

Expanding COVID-19 testing to include environmental surfaces would ideally be performed with inexpensive swabs that could be transported safely without concern of being a source of new infections. However, CDC-approved clinical-grade sampling supplies and techniques using a synthetic swab are expensive, potentially expose laboratory workers to viable virus and prohibit analysis of the microbiome due to the presence of antibiotics in viral transport media (VTM). To this end, we performed a series of experiments comparing the diagnostic yield using five consumer-grade swabs (including plastic and wood shafts and various head materials including cotton, synthetic, and foam) and one clinical-grade swab for inhibition to RNA. For three of these swabs, we evaluated performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 in twenty intensive care unit (ICU) hospital rooms of patients including COVID-19+ patients. All swabs were placed in 95% ethanol and further evaluated in terms of RNase activity. SARS-CoV-2 was measured both directly from the swab and from the swab eluent. RESULTS: Compared to samples collected in VTM, 95% ethanol demonstrated significant inhibition properties against RNases. When extracting directly from the swab head as opposed to the eluent, RNA recovery was approximately 2–4× higher from all six swab types tested as compared to the clinical standard of testing the eluent from a CDC-approved synthetic (SYN) swab. The limit of detection (LoD) of SARS-CoV-2 from floor samples collected using the consumer-grade plastic (CGp) or research-grade plastic The Microsetta Initiative (TMI) swabs was similar or better than the SYN swab, further suggesting that swab type does not impact RNA recovery as measured by the abundance of SARS-CoV-2. The LoD for TMI was between 0 and 362.5 viral particles, while SYN and CGp were both between 725 and 1450 particles. Lastly microbiome analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing) of paired samples (nasal and floor from same patient room) collected using different swab types in triplicate indicated that microbial communities were not impacted by swab type, but instead driven by the patient and sample type. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to using a clinical-grade synthetic swab, detection of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples collected from ICU rooms of patients with COVID was similar using consumer-grade swabs, stored in 95% ethanol. The yield was best from the swab head rather than the eluent and the low level of RNase activity and lack of antibiotics in these samples makes it possible to perform concomitant microbiome analyses.

Antibody levels, measured by competitive ELISA and represented as percentage of inhibition (PI), were assessed in the cow's serum (on the day of vaccination: D0 and on days 21, 42 and at calving), in the colostrum and in the serum of calves in the first week of life. Differences in means of PI between groups and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The non-inferiority threshold was set at −10%. The relationships between antibody levels in the colostrum and the vaccination-calving interval (VCI) or the inter-booster vaccination interval (IBVI) were also analysed. All the lower margins of the 95% CI of the difference in means of PI, in all samples and for the 3 pathogens assessed, were above −10%. This result shows that BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response against BoRV, BoCV and E. coli K99 and the passive transfer of immunity to calves when this vaccine is administered to their dams previously vaccinated with RC. Furthermore, no correlation was found between PI values in the colostrum and the VCI or IBVI. The ratio of animals with a PI ≥ 95% in the colostrum, among cows with similar intervals, was not significantly different between groups, for all antigens tested. Therefore, this study shows that a single injection of the heterologous vaccine BS can be used as a booster in cattle previously vaccinated with RC.","Durel, Luc; Rose, Clancy; Bainbridge, Tracy; Roubert, Julien; Dressel, Klaus-Ulrich; Bennemann, Johanna; Rückner, Antje; Vahlenkamp, Thomas; Maillard, Renaud",Livest Sci,112,1

The origins and mechanisms of this persistent sepsis-induced myopathy are likely complex and multifactorial. Nevertheless, the pathobiology is thought to be triggered by the interaction between circulating pathogens and impaired muscle metabolic status. In addition, while in the hospital, septic patients often experience prolonged periods of physical inactivity due to bed rest, which may exacerbate the myopathy. Physical rehabilitation emerges as a potential tool to prevent the decline in physical function in septic patients. Currently, there is no consensus regarding effective rehabilitation strategies for sepsis-induced myopathy. The optimal timing to initiate the rehabilitation intervention currently lacks consensus as well. In this review, we summarize the evidence on the fundamental pathobiological mechanisms of sepsis-induced myopathy and discuss the recent evidence on in-hospital and post-discharge rehabilitation as well as other potential interventions that may prevent physical disability and death of sepsis survivors.","Mankowski, Robert T.; Laitano, Orlando; Clanton, Thomas L.; Brakenridge, Scott C.",J Clin Med,112,16

During an epidemic event, hospital leaders frequently face new challenges requiring them to perform unaccustomed tasks, which might be well beyond the scope of their previous practice and experience. While no absolute set of characteristics is necessary in all leadership situations, certain traits, skills and competencies tend to be more critical than others in crisis management times. We will discuss some of the most important ones in this manuscript. To strengthen those managerial competencies needed to face outbreaks, healthcare leaders should be better supported by competency-based training courses as it is more and more clear that traditional training courses are not as effective as they were supposed to be. It seems we should look at the COVID-19 pandemic as a learning opportunity to re-frame what we expect from hospital leaders and to re-think the way we train, assess and evaluate them.","Abdi, Zhaleh; Lega, Federico; Ebeid, Nadine; Ravaghi, Hamid",Health services management research,112,16

Despite this, by now evidences do exist about the possibly huge reservoir of asymptomatic patients and its underestimated ability to spread the infection. Thus, we do believe that when an infectious disease has a big ratio of asymptomatic cases, as for COVID‐19, it is simply not safe to rely on epidemiological criteria and we briefly discuss this issue throughout the few new evidences there are about.

This study used objective measures to assess the impact of pandemic-related restrictions on children’s behavior. A total of 19 healthy 8–12-year-old boys were observed before and during social restriction periods. Of these, 11 boys were reassessed after restrictions were lifted. For each session, Actiwatches were dispensed for measures of time outdoors, activity, and sleep. Changes overall and by school status were assessed using signed-rank test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. During restrictions, children spent significantly less time outdoors (p = 0.001), were less active (p = 0.001), and spent less time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (p = 0.004). Sleep duration was not significantly different between sessions (p > 0.99), but bedtime and wake time shifted to a later time during restrictions (p < 0.05 for both). Time outdoors and activity returned close to pre-pandemic levels after restrictions were lifted (p > 0.05 for both). Children’s behaviors significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction in outdoor light exposure is of importance due to the role of light in the etiology of myopia and vitamin D production. The reduction in physical activity may have negative health effects in terms of obesity and depression, although further research is required to ascertain the long-term effects.","Shneor, Einat; Doron, Ravid; Levine, Jonathan; Zimmerman, Deena Rachel; Benoit, Julia S.; Ostrin, Lisa A.; Gordon-Shaag, Ariela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,112,30

Amyloidoses are classified into two as systemic and localized. Out of the systemic forms, AL (light chain) amyloidosis is the most prevalent type; however, amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is more frequently encountered in the rheumatology practice. AA amyloidosis stands out as a major complication of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Splenic and renal involvement is more likely in FMF-associated systemic amyloidosis. The involvement of thyroid and adrenal glands has also been described, although infrequently. Amyloidoses have a heterogeneous plethora of clinical manifestations, with certain phenotypes associated with specific amyloid forms. Gynecological amyloidosis is a rare condition. Uterine involvement may occur in a localized fashion or may also arise as a part of systemic involvement, albeit at a lesser ratio. Several cases of uterine AL amyloidosis have been documented so far as an organ involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis. On the other hand, uterine amyloidosis associated with AA amyloidosis has been described merely in one case with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we presented a 40-year-old female patient with FMF known for 38 years who underwent splenectomy and hysterectomy due to massive splenomegaly, deep anemia, and persistent menometrorrhagia. Histological examinations of materials revealed uterine and splenic AA amyloidosis. This case report is first-of-its-kind to describe FMF-associated uterine AA amyloidosis and also provides a discussion of possible mechanisms of amyloidosis-induced uterine bleeding.","Cansu, Döndü Üsküdar; Teke, Hava Üsküdar; Arik, Deniz; Korkmaz, Cengiz",Rheumatol Int,112,1

The University of Arizona (UArizona) utilized WBE paired with clinical testing as a surveillance tool to monitor the UArizona community for SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time, as students re-entered campus in the fall. Positive detection of virus RNA in wastewater lead to selected clinical testing, identification, and isolation of three infected individuals (one symptomatic and two asymptomatic) that averted potential disease transmission. This case study demonstrated the value of WBE as a tool to efficiently utilize resources for COVID-19 prevention and response. Thus, WBE coupled with targeted clinical testing was further conducted on 13 dorms during the course of the Fall semester (Table 3). In total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm. Overall, WBE proved to be an accurate diagnostic for new cases of COVID-19 with an 82.0% positive predictive value and an 88.9% negative predictive value. Increases in positive wastewater samples and clinical tests were noted following holiday-related activities. However, shelter-in-place policies proved to be effective in reducing the number of daily reported positive wastewater and clinical tests.

Having to live with the employers by law, FDHs’ working environment might affect their well-being during COVID-19 (e.g., household crowdedness/size, insufficiency of protective equipment against COVID-19, increased workload). Research has suggested that coping resources (e.g., social support, COVID-19-related information literacy) and COVID-19-specific worries are associated with people’s well-being during COVID-19. This study examined the psychosocial correlates of probable anxiety among FDHs in Hong Kong amid the COVID-19 pandemic. By purposive sampling, FDHs (n = 295) were recruited and invited to complete a cross-sectional survey. Participants’ working environment (crowdedness, household size), COVID-19 job arrangements (workload, provision of protective equipment), coping resources (social support, COVID-19 information literacy), COVID-19-specific worries (contracting COVID-19, getting fired if contracting COVID-19), and anxiety symptoms were measured. Multivariate regression results showed that the insufficiency of protective equipment (OR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.18, 2.11), increased workload (OR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.02, 2.25), and worries about being fired if getting COVID-19 (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.04, 1.68) were significantly associated with probable anxiety.

Second, faculty could connect their new knowledge of student development theories to their pedagogies and specifically how it can promote inclusive classroom environments. Finally, participants shared vulnerabilities by interpreting their past, present, and future teaching through a lens of student development theories.

Study design A retrospective review to evaluate the use of a negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce cross-infection through aerosol. The apparatus consists of a plastic drape suspended over the surgical field in the head and neck region with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber with an ultra-low penetrating air (ULPA) efficiency rating and a fluid suction high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter compartment. Spread of patient secretions and droplet formation was evaluated using 1% fluorescein dye in 10 ml of normal saline and ultraviolet light. The dye was applied topically in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx preoperatively and intraoperatively prior to the use of instruments such as micro-debrider, electrocautery and high-speed drilling. Following completion of the surgical procedure, an ultraviolet Wood's lamp was used to evaluate the presence of droplets on the surgical drapes and surgical gowns of the operating team. Results The study sample consisted of four patients who underwent endonasal endoscopic surgical procedures; two of these patients required concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. A micro-debrider was used in three cases; electrocautery in three cases, while a high-speed drilling was employed in two cases. Presence of fluorescein was identified around the patients' nares; on the chest wipe and instrument tray in all four patients. Dye contamination was noted on the gauze placed over the smoke evacuator (two cases of skull base surgery); no fluid droplets were identified beyond the nares or the smoke evacuator (two cases of sinus surgery). However, fluid contamination was identified underneath barrier several centimetres away from the nares (one case of trans-sphenoidal surgery). Droplets were also identified on the surgeon's gown in the abdominal region in all cases and on the arm region in one case. In one case, droplets were also identified on the abdominal region of the nurse, but this was attributed to cross contamination from surgical gauze and instruments. Conclusions This retrospective study provides preliminary data on aerosol and droplet contamination during endonasal and transoral surgery performed under a negative pressure isolation drape system. Although the authors did not screen patients for SARS-CoV-2, they propose smoke evacuator ULPA filter attachment is appropriate to capture particles down to 0.1 microns including SARS-CoV-2 which is 0.125 microns. It would be helpful to see direct evidence to support this claim in future studies. The authors have not provided details regarding set-up time and training requirements for effective application of the isolation drape apparatus or the associated costs etc. It would have also been helpful if the authors could comment on any potential difficulties in undertaking the surgical procedure with the isolation system in place. The sample size is limited to four patients and variations in the magnitude and extent of aerosol contamination needs to be investigated further before drawing any conclusions. Although unlikely, this study design did not capture the presence of aerosol/droplets in the air within the operating room which may follow removal of the isolation drape system or from exposed surgical instruments. Notwithstanding the limitations of the design, negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier is likely to minimise the contamination from aerosol and droplet during endonasal and transoral surgery.","Ali, Kamran; Raja, Mahwish",Evid Based Dent,112,1

Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. Aim: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. Methods: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. Results: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe.

However, nervous system involvement and its effect on disease outcome are poorly characterized. The objective of this study was to determine whether neurologic syndromes are associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality. METHODS: A total of 581 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, neurologic involvement, and brain imaging were compared to hospitalized non-neurologic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Four patterns of neurologic manifestations were identified: acute stroke, new or recrudescent seizures, altered mentation with normal imaging, and neuro-COVID-19 complex. Factors present on admission were analyzed as potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, including sociodemographic variables, preexisting comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory values, and pattern of neurologic manifestations. Significant predictors were incorporated into a disease severity score. Patients with neurologic manifestations were matched with patients of the same age and disease severity to assess the risk of death. RESULTS: A total of 4,711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to one medical system in New York City during a 6-week period. Of these, 581 (12%) had neurologic issues of sufficient concern to warrant neuroimaging. These patients were compared to 1,743 non-neurologic patients with COVID-19 matched for age and disease severity admitted during the same period. Patients with altered mentation (n = 258, p = 0.04, odds ratio [OR] 1.39, confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.86) or radiologically confirmed stroke (n = 55, p = 0.001, OR 3.1, CI 1.65–5.92) had a higher risk of mortality than age- and severity-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of altered mentation or stroke on admission predicts a modest but significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality independent of disease severity. While other biomarker factors also predict mortality, measures to identify and treat such patients may be important in reducing overall mortality of COVID-19.","Eskandar, Emad Nader; Altschul, David J.; de la Garza Ramos, Rafael; Cezayirli, Phillip; Unda, Santiago R.; Benton, Joshua; Dardick, Joseph; Toma, Aureliana; Patel, Nikunj; Malaviya, Avinash; Flomenbaum, David; Fernandez-Torres, Jenelys; Lu, Jenny; Holland, Ryan; Burchi, Elisabetta; Zampolin, Richard; Hsu, Kevin; McClelland, Andrew; Burns, Judah; Erdfarb, Amichai; Malhotra, Rishi; Gong, Michelle; Semczuk, Peter; Gursky, Jonathan; Ferastraoaru, Victor; Rosengard, Jillian; Antoniello, Daniel; Labovitz, Daniel; Esenwa, Charles; Milstein, Mark; Boro, Alexis; Mehler, Mark F.",Neurology,112,24

DESIGN: Exploratory analysis from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. SETTING: Hospitals in North America and Europe. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia receiving standard care. INTERVENTION: Randomly assigned 2:1 to IV tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Candidate biomarkers were measured in 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 142 patients in the placebo arm. Efficacy outcomes assessed were clinical status on a seven-category ordinal scale (1, discharge; 7, death), mortality, time to hospital discharge, and mechanical ventilation (if not receiving it at randomization) through day 28. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers were evaluated continuously with proportional odds, binomial or Fine-Gray models, and additional sensitivity analyses. Modeling in the placebo arm showed all candidate biomarkers except lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer were strongly prognostic for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical status, and time to hospital discharge. Modeling in the tocilizumab arm showed a predictive value of ferritin for day 28 clinical outcomes of mortality (predictive interaction, p = 0.03), mechanical ventilation (predictive interaction, p = 0.01), and clinical status (predictive interaction, p = 0.02) compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple biomarkers prognostic for clinical outcomes were confirmed in COVACTA.

Inhibiting IL-1β and mitoROS reduced RyR2 oxidation and the ventricular arrhythmia in DM. Inhibiting SR Ca2(+) leak by stabilizing the oxidized RyR2 channel reversed the diabetic arrhythmic risk. In conclusion, cardiac IL-1β mediated the DM-associated arrhythmia through mitoROS generation that enhances SR Ca(2+) leak. The mechanistic link between inflammation and arrhythmias provides new therapeutic options.","Liu, Hong; Zhao, Yang; Xie, An; Kim, Tae-Yun; Terentyeva, Radmila; Liu, Man; Shi, Guangbin; Feng, Feng; Choi, Bum-Rak; Terentyev, Dmitry; Hamilton, Shanna; Dudley, Samuel C.",JACC Basic Transl Sci,112,22

AIMS: We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental illness and the associated factors for its development among COVID-2019 survivors. METHOD: From 1 January to 4 June 2020, data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service COVID-19 database in South Korea. Patients with COVID-19 were defined as those whose test results indicated that they had contracted the infection, regardless of disease severity. COVID-19 survivors were defined as those who recovered from the infection. The primary end-point was the development of mental illness, which was evaluated between 1 January and 1 December 2020. RESULTS: A total 260 883 individuals were included in this study, and 2.36% (6148) were COVID-19 survivors. The COVID-19 survivors showed higher prevalence of mental illness than the control group (12.0% in the COVID-19 survivors v. 7.7% in the control group; odds ratio (OR) = 2.40, 95% CI 2.21–2.61, P < 0.001). Additionally, compared with the control group, the no specific treatment for COVID-19 group (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 2.03–2.45, P < 0.001) and specific treatment for COVID-19 group (OR = 3.27, 95% CI 2.77–3.87, P < 0.001) showed higher prevalence of mental illness among survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In South Korea, COVID-19 survivors had a higher risk of developing mental illness compared with the rest of the populations. Moreover, this trend was more evident in COVID-19 survivors who experienced specific treatment in the hospital.","Park, Hye Yoon; Song, In-Ae; Lee, So Hee; Sim, Min young; Oh, Hong Sang; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Yu, Eun-Seung; Park, Hye Youn; Oh, Tak Kyu",BJPsych Open,112,30

The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of injuries owing to interpersonal violence after implementation of a statewide stay-at-home order in Pennsylvania in March 2020. METHODS: Using the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study registry, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with gunshot wounds, stab wounds, and blunt assault-related injuries attributable to interpersonal violence treated at Pennsylvania trauma centers from March 16 to July 31 of 2018, 2019, and 2020. RESULTS: There were fewer total trauma admissions in 2020 (17,489) vs 2018 (19,290) and 2019 (19,561). Gunshot wounds increased in 2020 to 737 vs 647 for 2019 and 565 for 2018 (P = .028), whereas blunt assault injuries decreased (P = .03). In all time periods, interpersonal violence primarily impacted urban counties. African American men were predominantly affected by gunshot wounds and stab wounds, whereas Caucasian men were predominantly affected by blunt assault injuries. There were more patients with substance abuse disorders and positive drug screens during coronavirus disease than in comparison periods: (stab wound population 52.3% vs 33.9% vs 45.9%, coronavirus disease era vs 2018 vs 2019, respectively P = .0001), (blunt assault injury population 41.4% vs 33.1% vs 33.5%, coronavirus disease era vs 2018 vs 2019, respectively P < .0001). There was no correlation between the incidence of interpersonal violence and coronavirus disease 2019 rates at the county level. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a stay-at-home order was accompanied by rising incidence of gunshot and stab wound injuries in Pennsylvania. Preparedness for future resurgences of coronavirus disease 2019 and other pandemics calls for plans to address injury prevention, recidivism, and access to mental health and substance abuse prevention services.","Ratnasekera, Asanthi M; Seng, Sirivan S; Jacovides, Christina L; Kolb, Ryann; Hanlon, Alexandra; Stawicki, Stanislaw P; Martin, Niels D; Kaufman, Elinore J",Surgery (St. Louis),112,1

However, hypertriglyceridemia is associated with atherogenesis and risk for acute cardiovascular events that persist despite optimal statin treatment. Although most trials of triglyceride-lowering treatments have been negative, in trials of niacin and fibrates, subgroup analyses in patients with higher baseline triglycerides and lower HDL-C levels suggest reduced incidence of cardiovascular endpoints. The REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated that addition of purified prescription eicosapentaenoic acid (icosapent ethyl) 4 g/day in high-risk patients with triglyceride levels 135–499 mg/dL and optimized statin treatment significantly reduced cardiovascular events versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.75; 95% confidence interval 0.68–0.83; P<0.001). Benefit was seen regardless of baseline and on-treatment triglyceride levels, suggesting that other effects of eicosapentaenoic acid besides triglyceride reduction may have played a role.","Toth, Peter P.; Shah, Prediman K.; Lepor, Norman E.",Am J Prev Cardiol,112,20

Particularly on the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, biological sequence data play an important role in detecting diseases, analyzing the mechanism and discovering specific drugs. In recent years, pretraining models that have emerged in natural language processing have attracted widespread attention in many research fields not only to decrease training cost but also to improve performance on downstream tasks. Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models. Next, we provide a novel pretraining scheme for protein sequences and a multitask benchmark for protein pretraining models.

Objective To investigate the outcome of personalized immunotherapy in critical COVID-19. Methods In this open-label prospective trial, 102 patients with SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score [≥]2 or ARDS by SARS-CoV-2 were screened for MAS (ferritin more than 4420 ng/ml) and CID (ferritin [≤]4420 ng/ml and low expression of HLA-DR on CD14-monocytes). Patients with MAS and CID with increased aminotransferases were assigned to intravenous anakinra; those with CID and normal aminotransferases to tocilizumab. The primary outcome was at least 25% decrease of SOFA score and/or 50% increase of respiratory ratio by day 8; 28-day mortality, change of SOFA score by day 28; serum biomarkers and cytokine production by mononuclear cells were secondary endpoints. Measurements and Main Results The primary study endpoint was met in 58.3% of anakinra-treated patients and in 33.3% of tocilizumab-treated patients (odds ratio 3.11; 95% CIs 1.29-7.73; P: 0.011). No differences were found in mortality and in SOFA score changes. By day 4, ferritin was decreased among anakinra-treated patients; interleukin (IL)-6, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and the expression of HLA-DR were increased among tocilizumab-treated patients. Anakinra increased capacity of mononuclear cells to produce IL-6. Survivors by day 28 who received anakinra were distributed to scales of the WHO clinical progression of lower severity. Greater incidence of secondary infections was found with tocilizumab treatment. Conclusions Biomarkers may guide favourable anakinra responses in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

The current COVID-19 disease outbreak is due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has spike protein on the envelope. The spike protein of the virus binds with the ACE-2 receptor of the human lungs surface for entering into the host. Therefore, the blocking of viral entry into the host by targeting the spike protein has been suggested to be a valid strategy to treat COVID-19. The patients of COVID-19 were found to be asymptomatic, cold, mild to severe respiratory illness, and leading to death. The severe illness has been noted mainly in old age people, cardiovascular disease patients, and respiratory disease patients. However, the long-term health effects due to COVID-19 are not yet known. Recently, the vaccines were authorized to protect from COVID-19. However, the researchers have put an effort to discover suitable targets and newer medications in the form of small molecules or peptides, based on in-silico methods and synthetic approaches. This manuscript describes the current perspectives of the causative agent, diagnostic procedure, therapeutic targets, treatment, clinical trials, and development of potential clinical candidates of COVID-19.

We integrate these data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data. As of August 1, 2020, we estimate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1,000 infections (90% CI: [95 - 112 per 1,000]). We show that the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15, 2020, while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs, was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control, highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that the impact of NPIs on individuals' mobility correlates with the Human Development Index of comunas in the city. Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic. The heterogeneity of COVID-19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights the challenges that communities affected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting their behaviors during an epidemic.","Gozzi, N.; Tizzoni, M.; Chinazzi, M.; Ferres, L.; Vespignani, A.; Perra, N.",,112,21

An IL-12 expression vector (IL-12DNA) encoding single-chain IL-12 proteins comprised of p40 and p35 subunits were constructed. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse and guinea pig models compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB in the lung) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. All monkeys in the control group (saline) died within 8 months, while 50% of monkeys in the HSP65+hIL-12/HVJ group survived more than 14 months post-infection (the termination period of the experiment). Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100% survival). In contrast, 33% of monkeys from BCG Tokyo alone group were alive (33% survival). Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys.

Their tradition is highly ritualized, and it plays an important role in the lives of many participants. Following the implementation of lockdown protocols to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, groups of Sacred Harp singers quickly and independently devised a variety of means by which to sing together online using Zoom (“zinging”), Jamulus (“jamzinging”), and Facebook Live (“stringing”). The rapidity and creativity with which Sacred Harp singers developed ways to sustain their activities attests to the strength and significance of this community of practice, and in this article I describe each modality and provide an account of how it came to be developed and widely used. As a participant-observer, I completed extensive fieldwork across these digital sites and conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 other singers. I found that online singing practices have reshaped the Sacred Harp community. Many singers who did not previously have the opportunity to participate now have access, while others have lost access due to technological barriers or lack of interest in online activities. At the same time, geographical barriers have disintegrated, and singing organizers must make an effort to maintain local identity. A stable community of singers has emerged in the digital realm, but it is by no means identical to the community that predated the pandemic. I also identify the ways in which online singing has proven meaningful to participants by providing continuity in their personal and communal practice. Specifically, online singing allows participants to access and celebrate their collective memories of the Sacred Harp community, carry out significant rituals, and continue to grow as singers. While no single modality replicates the complete Sacred Harp singing experience, together they function “like pieces in a puzzle” (as one singer put it), allowing individual participants to access many of the elements of Sacred Harp singing that are most meaningful to them.","Morgan-Ellis, Esther M.",Front Psychol,112,20

However, in the context of an ongoing pandemic there is an interplay between infection and vaccination. While infection can grow exponentially, potentially overwhelming healthcare resources, vaccination rates are generally limited by both supply and logistics. With the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines receiving medical approval requiring two doses, there has been scrutiny on the spacing between doses; an elongated period between doses would allow more of the population to receive a first vaccine dose in the short-term generating wide-spread partial immunity. Methods: Focusing on data from England, we investigated prioritisation of a one dose or two dose vaccination schedule given a fixed number of vaccine doses and with respect to a measure of maximising averted deaths. We optimised outcomes for two different estimates of population size and relative risk of mortality for at-risk groups within the Phase 1 vaccine priority order in England, for different amounts of available vaccine and for different vaccine efficacies. Findings: We find that vaccines offering relatively high protection from the first dose (compared to the efficacy derived from two doses) favour strategies that prioritise giving more people one dose rather than a smaller number two. The optimal mix of one and two doses between the defined priority groups of Phase 1 shows a pattern of returning to give second doses to the highest risk groups as the number of available doses increases. Discussion: While this work highlights that an optimal timing of first and second doses between the Phase 1 priority groups can substantially reduce the overall mortality risk to the population, there also needs to be careful consideration of the precise timing between first and second doses as well as the logistics of vaccine delivery.","Hill, E.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental help-seeking and associated factors among PHW using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (BMHSU). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,475 PHW in five provinces across China between February 18 and March 1, 2020. The subsample data of those who reported probable mental health problems were analyzed for this report (n = 3,417). Logistic and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of predisposing, enabling, need, and COVID-19 contextual factors with mental health help-seeking. Results: Only 12.7% of PHW reported professional mental help-seeking during the COVID-19 outbreak. PHW who were older, had more days of overnight work, received psychological training, perceived a higher level of support from the society, had depression and anxiety were more likely to report mental help-seeking (OR(m) range: 1.02–1.73, all p < 0.05) while those worked in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were less likely to seek help (OR(m) = 0.57, p < 0.01). The belief that mental health issues were not the priority (64.4%), lack of time (56.4%), and shortage of psychologists (32.7%) were the most frequently endorsed reasons for not seeking help. Conclusions: The application of BMHSU confirmed associations between some factors and PHW's mental health help-seeking. Effective interventions are warranted to promote mental health help-seeking of PHW to ameliorate the negative impact of mental illness and facilitate personal recovery and routine work.","She, Rui; Wang, Xiaohui; Zhang, Zhoubin; Li, Jinghua; Xu, Jingdong; You, Hua; Li, Yan; Liang, Yuan; Li, Shan; Ma, Lina; Wang, Xinran; Chen, Xiuyuan; Zhou, Peien; Lau, Joseph; Hao, Yuantao; Zhou, Huan; Gu, Jing",Front Public Health,112,22

This transition posed a challenge to postgraduate students and faculty moderators, especially for participant-centric group discussion, wherein face-to-face interaction contributes significantly to active learner engagement. To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback. Such pedagogical innovations may also help to address the challenges posed in traditional teaching across the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medical education and beyond during such unforeseeable circumstances.","Kaur, Simran; Bir, Megha; Chandran, Dinu S.; Deepak, Kishore Kumar",Adv Physiol Educ,112,10

We examine the bilateral trade values of medical products traded among 35 reporting countries and 250 partner countries between January and August in both 2019 and 2020. We shed light on four kinds of bilateral linkages, including political ties (captured by voting similarity in the United Nations), economic ties (existence of trade agreements), demographic ties (migrants) and geographical ties (distance). Our findings can be summarised as follows. An increase in COVID‐19 burden leads to decreases in exports of medical products. However, such a decrease is smaller when exporting to countries with closer political, economic or geographical ties. In contrast, demographic ties play a key role in the import of personal protective products.

The first group relates to public health ethics, which analyzes the morality of public health interventions, and the second group relates to medical ethics, particularly to “the duty to care”. The Canadian Medical Association Code of Ethics is vague in the description of duties of physicians who may respond to high-risk contagious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Government, public health authorities, and anesthesia departments need to be prepared to respond to an outbreak of Ebola.

We, therefore, examined reports on interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and histamine receptor antagonists. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed by 19 September 2020, and updated on 28 October 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar using (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (histamine antagonist OR famotidine OR cimetidine). ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and (famotidine or histamine). RESULTS: Famotidine may be a useful addition in COVID-19 treatment, but the results from prospective randomized trials are as yet awaited. Bioinformatics/drug repurposing studies indicated that, among several medicines, H(1) and H(2) receptor antagonists may interact with key viral enzymes. However, in vitro studies have to date failed to show a direct inhibition of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2 replication. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical research into the potential benefits of H(2) receptor antagonists in managing COVID-19 inflammation began from a simple observation and now is being tested in multi-centre clinical trials. The positive effects of famotidine may be due to H(2) receptor-mediated immunomodulatory actions on mast cell histamine–cytokine cross-talk, rather than a direct action on SARS-CoV-2.","Ennis, Madeleine; Tiligada, Katerina",Inflamm Res,112,20

In support of this long-term objective, our team developed TaqMan Array Cards (TACs) for testing postmortem specimens (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, lung tissue, respiratory tract swabs, and rectal swabs) for >100 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targets in total (30–45 per card depending on configuration). Multipathogen panels were configured by syndrome and customized to include pathogens of significance in young children within the regions where CHAMPS is conducted, including bacteria (57 targets covering 30 genera), viruses (48 targets covering 40 viruses), parasites (8 targets covering 8 organisms), and fungi (3 targets covering 3 organisms). The development and application of multiplex real-time PCR reactions to the TAC microfluidic platform increased the number of targets in each panel while maintaining assay efficiency and replicates for heightened sensitivity.

We previously reported that IRF-3-dependent host innate immune responses partially interfere in infection of prions. Here, we found that stable infection of prion suppressed IRF-3 gene-expression. The decreased promoter activity of IRF-3 was significantly restored along with treatment of anti-prion drugs in the prion-infected cells, suggesting that infection of prion directly influence the regulation of IRF-3 transcription. We further investigated promoter activity of 5′- flanking region of murine IRF-3 using a luciferase reporter system and found that the nucleotides -119 to -1 were indispensable for the promoter activity. Within this region, mutations in the Oct-1 binding site significantly reduced the promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that Oct-1 indeed binds to the region. In addition, overexpression of Oct-1 increased the promoter activity of IRF-3. Intriguingly, Oct-1 protein was significantly reduced in prion-infected cells and mice brains compared with uninfected groups. Taken together, we concluded that prion infection could interfere in the function of Oct-1, resulting in the down-regulation of IRF-3.","Homma, Takujiro; Ishibashi, Daisuke; Nakagaki, Takehiro; Fuse, Takayuki; Sano, Kazunori; Satoh, Katsuya; Atarashi, Ryuichiro; Nishida, Noriyuki",Sci Rep,112,1

Thus, we used BPC 157 therapy against the irremovable occlusion of the end of the superior mesenteric vein. Methods. Assessments, for 30 min (gross recording, venography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress) include the portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension, systemic arterial and venous thrombosis, ECG disturbances, MDA-tissue increase, and heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, and brain (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus) lesions. Rats received BPC 157 medication (10 µg/kg, 10 ng/kg) intraperitoneally at 1 or 15 min ligation time. Results. BPC 157 rapidly activated the superior mesenteric vein–inferior anterior pancreati-coduodenal vein–superior anterior pancreaticoduodenal vein–pyloric vein–portal vein pathway, reestablished superior mesenteric vein and portal vein connection and reestablished blood flow. Simultaneously, toward inferior caval vein, an additional pathway appears via the inferior mesenteric vein united with the middle colic vein, throughout its left colic branch to ascertain alternative bypassing blood flow. Consequently, BPC 157 acts peripherally and centrally, and counteracted the intracranial (superior sagittal sinus), portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, ECG disturbances attenuated, abolished progressing venous and arterial thrombosis. Additionally, BPC 157 counteracted multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, heart, lung, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, and brain lesions, and oxidative stress in tissues. Conclusion.

Our analysis is highly pertinent given that the World Health Organisation acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by respiratory droplets, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recognises that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. In our theoretical treatment, the virion is assimilated to a core-shell nanoparticle, and contributions of various interaction energies to the virion-PM association (electrostatic, hydrophobic, London-van der Waals, etc.) are generically included. We review the limited available literature on the physicochemical features of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and identify knowledge gaps. Despite the lack of quantitative data, our conceptual framework qualitatively predicts that virion-PM entities are largely able to maintain equilibrium on the timescale of their diffusion towards the host cell surface. Comparison of the relevant mass transport coefficients reveals that virion biointernalization demand by alveolar host cells may be greater than the diffusive supply. Under such conditions both the free and PM-sorbed virions may contribute to the transmitted dose. This result points to the potential for PM to serve as a shuttle for delivery of virions to host cell targets. Thus, our critical review reveals that the chemodynamics of virion-PM interactions may play a crucial role in the transmission of COVID-19, and provides a sound basis for explaining reported correlations between episodes of air pollution and outbreaks of COVID-19.","Duval, Jérôme F.L.; van Leeuwen, Herman P.; Norde, Willem; Town, Raewyn M.",Adv Colloid Interface Sci,112,20

However, little is known about their influence on the changes of psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) among adolescents, nor about the possible association between changes in PLEs and changes in anxiety/depression symptoms. We investigated these two questions through a longitudinal comparative study. METHODS: In total, 1825 adolescents were surveyed before COVID-19 and after the lockdown in China (T0, October 20th, 2019 and T1, May 18th, 2020). PLEs, anxiety, and depression were measured with paranoia, anxiety and depression subscales of the Mental Health Inventory of Middle school students (MMHI-60). Within-subjects Wilcoxon test, Spearman correlation test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were adopted. RESULTS: Significant increase in adolescent PLEs scores was observed after the lockdown (Wilcoxon's w = 9.302, p < 0.001). We also found positive correlation between changes of PLEs and changes of anxiety/depression (Spearman's rho = 0.59/0.53, both p < 0.001). Furthermore, four PLEs trajectories were identified based on the report of PLEs at two timepoints: 60.4% with no PLEs, 9.3% remitted PLEs, 16.7% new PLEs, and 13.6% persistent PLEs. Significant difference was found in changes of anxiety/depression among four groups (p < 0.001); notably, the group with new-onset PLEs had the greatest exacerbation in anxiety/depression symptoms (both p Bonferroni <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first to identify increases in adolescent PLEs across the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested a close longitudinal association between PLEs and anxiety/depression. Our findings have implications for adolescent mental health crisis interventions during the pandemic.","Wu, Zhipeng; Liu, Zhening; Zou, Zhulin; Wang, Feiwen; Zhu, Mengran; Zhang, Wen; Tao, Haojuan; Ross, Brendan; Long, Yicheng",Schizophr Res,112,1

SETTING: Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Epistemonikos COVID-19 in L·OVE Platform, McMaster COVID-19 Evidence Alerts and websites were searched to 15 June 2020. Eligible studies were conducted in high-income countries and used multivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: After piloting, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by a single experienced reviewer. Of 3740 unique records identified, 34 were included that reported on median 596 (range 44–418 794) participants, aged 42–84 years. 19/34 (56%) were good quality. OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, severe disease, mortality. RESULTS: Authors synthesised findings narratively and appraised the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor–outcome association. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large (≥2-fold) magnitude of association between hospitalisation in people with COVID-19, and: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age >45 years, male gender, black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white), homelessness and low income. Age >60 and >70 years may be associated with large increases in mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large magnitude of association may exist with liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs British white), age >45 years, age >80 years (vs 65–69 years) and male gender among 20–64 years (but not older). Associations with hospitalisation and mortality may be very large (≥5-fold) for those aged ≥60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age (especially >60 years) may be the most important risk factor for severe outcomes. High-quality primary research accounting for multiple confounders is needed to better understand the magnitude of associations for severity of COVID-19 with several other factors.

Little qualitative research has investigated how the PCMH model affects patient experience with care. OBJECTIVE: To understand Medicaid and Medicare patient and caregiver experiences with PCMHs participating in the Multi-Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice (MAPCP) Demonstration. DESIGN: Qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare, Medicaid, and dually eligible patients who were patients in primary care practices participating in the MAPCP Demonstration and caregivers of such patients (N = 490). APPROACH: From July through November 2014, a trained facilitator conducted 81 focus groups in the eight states participating in the MAPCP Demonstration. Separate groups were held for Medicare high-risk, Medicare low-risk, Medicaid, and dually eligible beneficiaries, their caregivers, and caregivers of Medicaid children (or, in Vermont, with patients participating in the Support and Services at Home program), in two different geographical areas in each state. Focus group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo qualitative data analysis software. RESULTS: Participants’ experiences with care were generally consistent with the expectations of a PCMH, although some exceptions were noted. Medicaid only and dually eligible beneficiaries generally had less-positive experiences than Medicare beneficiaries. Most participants said their practices had not solicited feedback from them about their experiences with care. Few participants knew what the term “medical home” meant or were aware that their practices were working to become PCMHs, but many had noticed changes in recent years, primarily related to the conversion to electronic health records. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants had positive experiences with their care. Opportunities exist, however, to improve care for Medicaid and dually eligible beneficiaries, and enhance patient awareness of and involvement in PCMH practice transformation.","Wilson, Ellen K.; Siegfried, Noëlle Richa; Sorensen, Asta V.",J Gen Intern Med,112,20

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of suspect cases of COVID-19 in migrants in transit and asylum seekers in Mexico, and to compare their characteristics with those of non-migrants. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of information from the surveillance system of Mexico from January 1 to May 3 2020, identifying persons from the main sending countries of mixed migrant flows in Mexico (Central America, the Caribbean, Venezuela and African countries), in northern and southern Mexican border states. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics, risk conditions, and epidemic curves for migrants and non-migrants. Also, we estimated the cumulative incidence for non-migrants, and for migrants in two scenarios defined by different estimations of their population size. RESULTS: Migrants were on average younger, had less accompanying risk conditions, and a lower percentage of suspect cases tested positive for COVID-19. The odds of hospitalization were lower among migrants, but the difference disappeared after adjusting by age, gender and underlying risk conditions. The cumulative incidence ratios comparing migrants with non-migrants were 6.12 (CI95% 4.75,7.77) for the first scenario, and 1.49 (CI95% 1.15,1.89) for the second scenario. CONCLUSION: Migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico are at increased risk for infectious respiratory diseases, and could be disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

Bangladesh, a densely populated country with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may help policy makers produce informed decisions. This study assessed KAP in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1,837 responses across Bangladesh. Ultimately, 1,589 completed responses were included in a statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores and their interrelations with sociodemographic variables. The overall KAP was poor, with only 33% of the participants demonstrating good knowledge, whereas 52.4% and 44.8% of the subjects showed good attitudes and practices, respectively. Sociodemographic factors had strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP scores were evident in females over males, among aged 45 years and older over younger participants, and among retired workers and homemakers over students and public service employees. This study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to foster public confidence and ensure more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures.

Therefore, we have adapted a targeted enrichment protocol in combination with long-read sequencing to efficiently annotate complex KIR gene regions. Using Cas9 endonuclease activity, segments of the KIR gene cluster were enriched and sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. This provided sufficient coverage to accurately resolve and phase highly complex KIR haplotypes.

Dairy cows in a negative energy balance have an increased risk of developing clinical or subclinical ketosis. The ketosis in dairy cows has a negative impact on milk production, dry matter intake, health, immunity, and reproductive performance. Propylene glycol can be used as an important gluconeogenesis in ruminants and can effectively inhibit the formation of ketones. Supplementary propylene glycol to dairy cows during perinatal is an effective method to alleviate the negative energy balance. This review summarizes the reasons and consequences of negative energy balance as well as the mechanism and effects of propylene glycol in inhibiting a negative energy balance in dairy cows. In addition, the feeding levels and methods of using propylene glycol to alleviate negative energy balance are also discussed. ABSTRACT: With the improvement in the intense genetic selection of dairy cows, advanced management strategies, and improved feed quality and disease control, milk production level has been greatly improved. However, the negative energy balance (NEB) is increasingly serious at the postpartum stage because the intake of nutrients cannot meet the demand of quickly improved milk production. The NEB leads to a large amount of body fat mobilization and consequently the elevated production of ketones, which causes metabolic diseases such as ketosis and fatty liver. The high milk production of dairy cows in early lactation aggravates NEB. The metabolic diseases lead to metabolic disorders, a decrease in reproductive performance, and lactation performance decline, seriously affecting the health and production of cows. Propylene glycol (PG) can alleviate NEB through gluconeogenesis and inhibit the synthesis of ketone bodies. In addition, PG improves milk yield, reproduction, and immune performance by improving plasma glucose and liver function in ketosis cows, and reduces milk fat percentage. However, a large dose of PG (above 500 g/d) has toxic and side effects in cows. The feeding method used was an oral drench. The combination of PG with some other additives can improve the effects in preventing ketosis. Overall, the present review summarizes the recent research progress in the impacts of NEB in dairy cows and the properties of PG in alleviating NEB and reducing the risk of ketosis.","Zhang, Fan; Nan, Xuemei; Wang, Hui; Zhao, Yiguang; Guo, Yuming; Xiong, Benhai",Animals (Basel),112,15

Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29 nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold. The effect was independent of the type I interferon response. The 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain. The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.

The results of previous quantitative trial that investigated the effect of this combined treatment on daily PA were inconclusive. It is conjectured that a more targeted tailoring of the counselling and PR intervention could improve its effectiveness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen individuals with COPD (median age 69, 8 females) who had participated in the PneumoReha program were interviewed twice (following PR and at three-month follow-up). These interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically. Based on the codes thus identified, three categories ‘perception of PA intensity’, ‘quality of motivation to perform PA’, and ‘strategies to cope with barriers’ were used to differentiate ‘types’ of participants. RESULTS: Four different types of COPD individuals were distinguished. Study findings indicate that those individuals who participated in the PR program combined with embedded counselling tended to be more active and intrinsically motivated. CONCLUSION: A typology of four types of people with COPD was developed, characterized by their perception of activity, individual motivation and strategies for managing barriers. The patients’ physical activity level might be influenced by their concept of physical activity and the quality of motivation. Recognizing patients’ different activity behaviors is important for improving the quality of outpatient PR programs and developing tailored (according to each type) counselling interventions embedded in outpatient PR programs.

Smoking frequency is very high among males compared to females, and a large number of smokers are building or road construction laborers and people involved in offering different services such as transportation, vending from vans, etc. The practice of smoking in this area is destructive for mental and physical health especially for students compared to other professionals because the city is known as the City of Education. METHODS: The study analyzes smokers’ characteristics, general health, and their (smokers) perception of smoking in public places. Cross-sectional data were collected randomly from 160 smokers through face-to-face questionnaire survey. The determinants of complexities with regard to social environment and human health were studied using frequency distribution, chi-square test, and binary and multinomial logistic regression analysis using IBM SPSS version 24. RESULTS: Frequency distributions reveal that 93.8% of smokers believe that smoking creates public health hazards, 51.3% of smokers think it causes breathing complexities for non-smokers, 48.8% of smokers feel smoking causes air pollution, 68.8% of smokers think smoking causes gastric problems, 24.4% of smokers had headache problems due to smoking and cigarette fumes, 86.3% of smokers learnt smoking from friends, 48.8% of smokers smoke due to their addiction and 25.6% for depression, and 80.6% usually smoke after having a meal. The chi-square test reveals that class of smokers was significantly associated with frequency of heartbeat rate, starting smoking at specific age level was significantly associated with suffering from diseases, category of smoking articles was significantly associated with suffering from disease, class of smokers was significantly associated with causes for smoking, and starting smoking at specific age level was significantly associated with profession of the smokers at 1% level of significance respectively. A significant odds ratio was found (OR = 6.363, 95% CI 1.918–21.104, p < 0.01) for the profession group of students/labour at 1% level; their outcomes for suffering from diseases such as gastric problem and fever/headache/others were 6.363 times those for the profession group of service/other smokers. CONCLUSION: Smoking in public places should be restricted because non-smokers cannot breathe freely and it is not healthy for them to inhale smoke indirectly, which has many adverse effects on public health. The study also reveals that the majority of the smokers have gastric problems, abnormal heartbeat rates, frequent headaches, depression and addiction problems, etc., and that they believe that smoking causes significant health hazard on human health and social environment. Therefore, necessary interventions should be taken immediately by policy-makers to prevent smoking in public places.

In order to address this gap of knowledge, real world studies are mandatory. Aim of this study was to assess both humoral and cellular response after a mRNA vaccination schedule. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive cancer patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were enrolled from the beginning of the vaccination campaign for frail patients. Blood samples for humoral and cell-mediated immune response evaluation were obtained before vaccination (T0), before the second administration (T1) and 21 days after the second dose (T2). The primary end-point was the evaluation of the percentage of participants showing a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, measured by an ELISPOT assay, after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint is computed together with its exact binomial 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: In SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects, Spike-specific T-cell response was almost undetectable at T0 (median 0.0 IFNγ SFU/million PBMC IQR 0-7.5) and significantly increased at T1 and T2 (median 15.0 IFNγ SFU/million PBMC 25th-75th 0-40 vs 90 IFNγ SFU/million PBMC 25th-75th 32.5-224; respectively) (p<0.001). Focusing on naïve and experienced SARS-CoV-2 subjects no differences were reported both in terms of CD4 and CD8-specific T-cell response, suggesting that BNT162b2 is able to elicit both adaptive responses after complete vaccination schedule, regardless previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The level of SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs was low at T1 in SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects [median 1:5 (IQR 1:5-1:20)] but reached a significantly higher median 1:80 (25th-75th 1:20-1:160) at T2 (p<0.0001). Moreover no COVID-19 cases were documented throughout the period of study. CONCLUSIONS: Our data have demonstrated that the administration of a full course of BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a sustained immune response against SARS-CoV-2 regardless to the type of cancer and/or the type of ICIs.","Lasagna, A.; Agustoni, F.; Percivalle, E.; Borgetto, S.; Paulet, A.; Comolli, G.; Sarasini, A.; Bergami, F.; Sammartino, J.C.; Ferrari, A.; Zavaglio, F.; Arena, F.; Lilleri, D.; Secondino, S.; Falzoni, M.; Schiavo, R.; Klersy, C.; Cavanna, L.; Baldanti, F.; Pedrazzoli, P.; Cassaniti, I.",ESMO Open,112,5

This discovery resulted in a search for NADPH oxidase-activating substances as a potential new approach to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have recently shown that compounds inducing NCF1-dependent oxidative burst, e.g. phytol, have a strong ameliorating effect on arthritis in rats. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to use gene-expression profiling to understand the protective effect against arthritis of activation of NADPH oxidase in the immune system. RESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of phytol leads to an accumulation of the compound in the inguinal lymph nodes, with peak levels being reached approximately 10 days after administration. Hence, global gene-expression profiling on inguinal lymph nodes was performed 10 days after the induction of pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) and phytol administration. The differentially expressed genes could be divided into two pathways, consisting of genes regulated by different interferons. IFN-γ regulated the pathway associated with arthritis development, whereas IFN-β regulated the pathway associated with disease protection through phytol. Importantly, these two molecular pathways were also confirmed to differentiate between the arthritis-susceptible dark agouti (DA) rat, (with an Ncf-1(DA )allele that allows only low oxidative burst), and the arthritis-protected DA.Ncf-1(E3 )rat (with an Ncf1(E3 )allele that allows a stronger oxidative burst). CONCLUSION: Naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms in the Ncf-1 gene modulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase complex, which strongly regulates the severity of arthritis. We now show that the Ncf-1 allele that enhances oxidative burst and protects against arthritis is operating through an IFN-β-associated pathway, whereas the arthritis-driving allele operates through an IFN-γ-associated pathway. Treatment of arthritis-susceptible rats with an NADPH oxidase-activating substance, phytol, protects against arthritis. Interestingly, the treatment led to a restoration of the oxidative-burst effect and induction of a strikingly similar IFN-β-dependent pathway, as seen with the disease-protective Ncf1 polymorphism.","Olofsson, Peter; Nerstedt, Annika; Hultqvist, Malin; Nilsson, Elisabeth C; Andersson, Sofia; Bergelin, Anna; Holmdahl, Rikard",BMC Biol,112,32

Here, we determine the ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","Noval, Maria G.; Kaczmarek, Maria E.; Koide, Akiko; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Bruno A.; Louie, Ping; Tada, Takuya; Hattori, Takamitsu; Panchenko, Tatyana; Romero, Larizbeth A.; Teng, Kai Wen; Bazley, Andrew; Vries, Maren de; Samanovic, Marie I.; Weiser, Jeffrey N.; Aifantis, Ioannis; Cangiarella, Joan; Mulligan, Mark J.; Desvignes, Ludovic; Dittmann, Meike; Landau, Nathaniel R.; Aguero-Rosenfeld, Maria; Koide, Shohei; Stapleford, Kenneth A.",bioRxiv,112,1

METHODS: Between March 22nd and April 12th, 2021, the same survey administered in 2020 was sent to all 68 Italian pediatric diabetes centers belonging to the Italian Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (ISPED) to collect data on the demographic variables of respondents; information about the center; the use, codification, and reimbursement of telemedicine; and used tools. Descriptive data were evaluated to establish how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed telemedicine practice. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent of responder centers reported an increase in the use of telemedicine, with televisits by video calling implemented in over half of centers.

Development of host-targeting antivirals could be an alternative strategy for the control of emerging CoVs infections, as they could be quickly repositioned from one pandemic event to another. To contribute to these pandemic preparedness efforts, here we report on the broad-spectrum CoVs antiviral activity of MEDS433, a new inhibitor of the human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH), a key cellular enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. MEDS433 inhibited the in vitro replication of hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E, as well as of SARS-CoV-2, at low nanomolar range. Notably, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MEDS433 against SARS-CoV-2 was also observed in kidney organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells. Then, the antiviral activity of MEDS433 was reversed by the addition of exogenous uridine or the product of hDHODH, the orotate, thus confirming hDHODH as the specific target of MEDS433 in hCoVs-infected cells. Taken together, these findings suggest MEDS433 as a potential candidate to develop novel drugs for COVID-19, as well as broad-spectrum antiviral agents exploitable for future CoVs threats.","Calistri, Arianna; Luganini, Anna; Mognetti, Barbara; Elder, Elizabeth; Sibille, Giulia; Conciatori, Valeria; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Sainas, Stefano; Boschi, Donatella; Montserrat, Nuria; Mirazimi, Ali; Lolli, Marco Lucio; Gribaudo, Giorgio; Parolin, Cristina",Microorganisms,112,16

The objectives of this research were to detect and describe the changes in work environment of community pharmacists in Vojvodina during the state of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic effects on job related stress were assessed. METHODS: Community pharmacists from Vojvodina completed an online questionnaire on work environment changes related to COVID-19 (cross-sectional study). RESULTS: Out of the 1574 licenced pharmacists in Vojvodina, 392 completed the survey. Workload increase, reported by 90.8% of pharmacists, was caused mostly by higher demand for safety equipment, antiseptics and disinfectants, dietary products and medicines. Most pharmacists (93.1%) considered pharmacy workflow to be more complex than before the pandemic. Clients’ behavior was described as less pleasant since the start of the pandemic by 67.6% of the community pharmacists. Many were concerned for their health and the health of their families (68.9%). Community pharmacists rated their stress levels higher if they i) were working in larger chains, ii) experienced clients’ behavior as less pleasant or/and iii) were concerned for their/their family health. CONCLUSIONS: Current research pointed out the need for a more robust healthcare system which would allow rapid introduction of new activities and roles for community pharmacists that could possibly decrease job-related stress.

Drawing on the work–home resources model, this study proposes that family support provided before the onset of COVID-19 has a positive indirect effect on job performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) after the onset, by decreasing emotional exhaustion. To test this proposition, we collected two-wave data from 211 South Korean employees over a 17-month period. As predicted, after controlling for employees’ pre-COVID-19 emotional exhaustion, job performance, and OCB, pre-COVID-19 family support was found to exert a significant indirect effect on mid-COVID-19 job performance (b = 0.024, 95% CI = [0.003, 0.071], ab(cs) = 0.027) and OCB (b = 0.031, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.084], ab(cs) = 0.033), through mid-COVID-19 emotional exhaustion.

METHODS: Patients with and without COVID-19 were included from 4 Hong Kong hospitals. Database was randomly split 2:1 for model development database (n = 895) and validation database (n = 435). Multivariable logistic regression was utilised for model creation and validated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and calibration plot. Nomograms and probabilities set at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 were calculated to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: 1330 patients (mean age 58.2 ± 24.5 years; 50.7% males; 296 COVID-19 positive) were recruited. First prediction model developed had age, total white blood cell count, chest x-ray appearances and contact history as significant predictors (AUC = 0.911 [CI = 0.880-0.941]). Second model developed has same variables except contact history (AUC = 0.880 [CI = 0.844-0.916]). Both were externally validated on H-L test (p = 0.781 and 0.155 respectively) and calibration plot. Models were converted to nomograms. Lower probabilities give higher sensitivity and NPV; higher probabilities give higher specificity and PPV. CONCLUSION: Two simple-to-use validated nomograms were developed with excellent AUCs based on readily available parameters and can be considered for clinical utilisation.","Ng, Ming-Yen; Wan, Eric Yuk Fai; Wong, Ho Yuen Frank; Leung, Siu Ting; Lee, Jonan Chun Yin; Chin, Thomas Wing-Yan; Lo, Christine Shing Yen; Lui, Macy Mei-Sze; Chan, Edward Hung Tat; Fong, Ambrose Ho-Tung; Yung, Fung Sau; Ching, On Hang; Chiu, Keith Wan-Hang; Chung, Tom Wai Hin; Vardhanbhuti, Varut; Lam, Hiu Yin Sonia; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Chiu, Jeffrey Long Fung; Lam, Tina Poy Wing; Khong, Pek Lan; Liu, Raymond Wai To; Man Chan, Johnny Wai; Ka Lun Alan, Wu; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lau, Chak Sing; Kuo, Michael D.; Ip, Mary Sau-Man",Int J Infect Dis,112,1

In response, many organizations implemented work from home policies, while others stopped operations entirely in an effort to limit the spread throughout their workforce and supporting communities. This containment strategy was not universally viable; long‐term shutdowns impacted the economic viability of companies, and some industries were designated as an “essential service” and thus continued operations. These employers faced the proposition of balancing the needs of the business and the community with a continued responsibility to provide a safe workplace for employees. This paper demonstrates how the application of common risk management methodologies, such as bowtie analysis combined with an appropriate assurance and verification process (e.g., the lines of defense model), can help the risks associated with a resumption or continuation of in‐person operations in a pandemic to be better understood and ensure the measures in place to manage said risk are appropriate and effective.","Sneddon, James",Process Safety Progress,112,33

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) presents an ideal target of antivirals, whereas nucleoside analogs inhibitor is hindered by the proofreading activity of coronavirus. Herein, we report that corilagin (RAI-S-37) as a non-nucleoside inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, binds directly to RdRp, effectively inhibits the polymerase activity in both cell-free and cell-based assays, fully resists the proofreading activity and potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection with a low 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) value of 0.13 μmol/L. Computation modeling predicts that RAI-S-37 lands at the palm domain of RdRp and prevents conformational changes required for nucleotide incorporation by RdRp. In addition, combination of RAI-S-37 with remdesivir exhibits additive activity against anti-SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Together with the current data available on the safety and pharmacokinetics of corilagin as a medicinal herbal agent, these results demonstrate the potential of being developed into one of the much-needed SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Li, Quanjie; Yi, Dongrong; Lei, Xiaobo; Zhao, Jianyuan; Zhang, Yongxin; Cui, Xiangling; Xiao, Xia; Jiao, Tao; Dong, Xiaojing; Zhao, Xuesen; Zeng, Hui; Liang, Chen; Ren, Lili; Guo, Fei; Li, Xiaoyu; Wang, Jianwei; Cen, Shan",Acta Pharm Sin B,112,16

METHODS: The present study performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalization data of patients undergoing radiotherapy at the Radiation Department (from January 5 to March 19, 2020 according to the Chinese lunar calendar), who were defined as the epidemic group. Hospitalization data for patients undergoing radiotherapy during the same period in 2019 were used as the control group for comparison with the epidemic group in terms of sex, age, distribution of various cancer types, hospitalization costs, average length of stay, completion rate of radiotherapy, treatment mode, and purpose of radiotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 79 and 115 patients received radiotherapy in the epidemic group and control group, respectively. The number of patients who received radiotherapy declined 31.3% during the epidemic period. The number of head and neck cancer patients who received radiotherapy was 36 (45.57%) in the epidemic group and 32 (27.83%) in the control group, which was a significant difference (χ(2)=6.476, P=0.011). The proportions of patients with other types of cancer decreased, with no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were found in terms of other hospitalization data (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The total number of patients who received radiotherapy decreased during the epidemic period, but the proportion of head and neck cancer increased. The epidemic had no significant effect on other hospitalization data. While strengthening prevention and control measures, we should actively perform radiotherapy to ensure that cancer patients receive timely and safe treatment.","He, Jian; Yang, Liping; Tao, Zhenchao; Yang, Jing; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Ru; Zhang, Yangyang; Huang, Yifan; Zhou, Lingran; Sun, Bin; Gao, Jin",Cancer Manag Res,112,16

Sera from participants immunized on a prime-boost schedule with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine were tested for neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs), compared to neutralization of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus (designated as D614G). Results showed minimal, statistically non-significant effects on neutralization titers against the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant (1.2-fold reduction compared with D614G); other VOCs such as B.1.351 (Beta, including B.1.351-v1, B.1.351-v2, and B.1.351-v3), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta), showed significantly decreased neutralization titers ranging from 2.1-fold to 8.4-fold reductions compared with D614G, although all remained susceptible to mRNA-1273-elicited serum neutralization. IMPORTANCE In light of multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have been documented globally during the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains important to continually assess the ability of currently available vaccines to confer protection against newly emerging variants. Data presented herein indicate that immunization with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine produces neutralizing antibodies against key emerging variants tested, including variants of concern and variants of interest. While the serum neutralization elicited by mRNA-1273 against most variants tested was reduced compared with the wild-type virus, they are still expected to be protective.

Limited research on socio-economic differences in mobility hampers our ability to understand whether inequalities in social distancing are occurring during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess how mobility patterns have varied across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify associations with socio-economic factors of populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used anonymized mobility data from tens of millions of devices to measure the speed and depth of social distancing at the county level between February and May 2020. Using linear mixed models, we assessed the associations between social distancing and socio-economic variables, including the proportion of people below the poverty level, the proportion of Black people, the proportion of essential workers, and the population density. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: We find that the speed, depth, and duration of social distancing in the United States is heterogeneous. We particularly show that social distancing is slower and less intense in counties with higher proportions of people below the poverty level and essential workers; and in contrast, that social distancing is intense in counties with higher population densities and larger Black populations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Socio-economic inequalities appear to be associated with the levels of adoption of social distancing, potentially resulting in wide-ranging differences in the impact of COVID-19 in communities across the United States. This is likely to amplify existing health disparities, and needs to be addressed to ensure the success of ongoing pandemic mitigation efforts.","Garnier, Romain; Benetka, Jan R.; Kraemer, John; Bansal, Shweta",medRxiv,112,21

It has been suggested that men are more severely affected by the viral disease (COVID-19) than women. Objective the aim of the present Systematic Literature Review (SRL) and meta-analysis was to analyse the influence of gender on COVID-19 mortality, severity and disease outcomes. A SRL was performed in PubMed and Embase searching terms corresponding to the “PEO” format (Population = adult patients affected with COVID-19, Exposure = gender; Outcome = any available clinical outcomes by gender, including mortality and disease severity), search dates 01/01/2020-31/04/2020. Exclusion criteria were: case reports/series, reviews, commentaries, language other than English. We included full-text original articles. Data about study type, country, patients characteristics were extracted. Study quality was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). From a total of 950 hits generated by databases search, 85 articles fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected. Results A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to compare mortality, recovery rates and disease severity in men versus women. Male to female ratio was 1: 0.8.

Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. METHODS: Two onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities and age profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-y (2020) interruption or a 2-y (2020–2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. RESULTS: Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19’s impact on MDA. Programmes that had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high-transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-y interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) and adults (ONCHOSIM). CONCLUSIONS: Programmes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination.","Hamley, Jonathan I D; Blok, David J; Walker, Martin; Milton, Philip; Hopkins, Adrian D; Hamill, Louise C; Downs, Philip; de Vlas, Sake J; Stolk, Wilma A; Basáñez, Maria-Gloria",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,112,16

As early stage studies on COVID-19 pandemic in China were defined as those conducted prior to April 1(st), 2020, while late stage studies were those conducted after April 1(st), 2020. RESULTS: A total of 98 studies with 193,889 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of insomnia symptoms among all populations was 39.1%; the pooled prevalence of insomnia symptoms during the early and late stages of COVID-19 in China were 37.0% (95% CI 34.1-39.9%) and 41.8% (95% CI 33.6-50.0%), respectively. Importantly, there was no significant difference regarding the prevalence of insomnia symptoms between the early and late stages of COVID-19. Meta-regression showed that healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients, patients with chronic medical conditions and patients with mental disorders had a higher prevalence of insomnia symptoms compared to the general population. This association remained significant in healthcare workers and patients with chronic medical conditions after adjusting for age, gender, areas of high or low prevalence of COVID-19 cases, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of our sample presented insomnia symptoms during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Interestingly, prevalence of insomnia symptoms sustained high during the late stage of the pandemic despite the control of the disease and the amelioration of its adverse effects. Our findings suggest that insomnia symptoms related to COVID-19 appear to persist of over time.","Li, Yun; Chen, Baixin; Hong, Zhuoting; Sun, Qimeng; Dai, Yanyuan; Basta, Maria; Tang, Xiangdong; Qin, Qingsong",Sleep Med,112,24

This research reveals that the majority of students had a higher level of knowledge and a positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 guidelines. Contrarily, only 0.22 percent of students showed a strong compliance towards COVID-19 guidelines while the majority of students (60.54 percent) had rather poor adherence which is an alarming finding. Hence, reopening the educational institutions in Bangladesh amid this second wave of the pandemic is not advisable yet.

An infection control surveillance-working group (ICS-WG) and infection control coordinators (ICCs) team were created to monitor the IPC practices of the healthcare workers (HCWs) in a regional hospital in Korea. This study analyzed the surveillance results and aimed to identify what IPC practices needed improvement. METHODS: During phase 1 (March to April 2020), the ICS-WG performed random audits, recorded incidences of improper IPC practices, and provided advice to the violators. During phase 2 (April to July), the ICCs inspected the hospital units and proposed practical ideas about IPC. The surveillance and proposals targeted the following practices: patient screening, usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand and respiratory hygiene, equipment reprocessing, environmental cleaning, management of medical waste, and social distancing. RESULTS: In phase 1, of the 127 violations observed, most (32.3%) corresponded to hand and respiratory hygiene. In phase 2, the highest proportion of violation per category was observed in the management of medical waste (37.8%); among these, a higher proportion of violation (71.4%) was observed in the collection of medical waste. Of the 106 proposals made by the ICCs, the most addressed practice was patient screening (28.3%). No case of nosocomial infection was reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: Adherence to proper hand and respiratory hygiene was inadequate at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that more attention and further training are needed for the management of medical waste, particularly medical waste collection, and that continuous upgrading of the strategies for patient screening is essential. These results will be useful in helping other healthcare facilities to establish their IPC strategies.","Choi, Ui Yoon; Kwon, Young Mi; Kang, Hye Jeong; Song, Jae Hoon; Lee, Hae Yeoun; Kim, Mi Sook; Kahm, Se Hoon; Kwon, Ji Young; Kim, Sang Hoon; Lee, Sang-Hwa; Choi, Jung Hyun; Lee, Jehoon",J Infect Public Health,112,16

The study aims to compare several parameters of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV infectious diseases in terms of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates. The publicly available dataset Worldometer (extracted on April 5, 2020) confirmed by WHO report was available for meta-analysis purposes using the Meta-MUMS tool. And, the reported outcomes of the analysis used a random-effects model to evaluate the event rate, and risk ratios thorough subgroup analysis forest plots. Seventeen countries for COVID-19 and eight countries of SARS infections, including COVID-19 group n = 1124243, and SARS-CoV group n = 8346, were analyzed. In this meta-analysis, a random effect model of relations of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates of COVID-19 and SARS world infections were determined. The meta-analysis and forest plots of two viral world infections showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 infection is more than SARS infections, while recovery and mortality event rates of SARS-CoV are more than COVID-19 infection. And subgroup analysis showed that the mortality and recovery rates were higher in both SARS-CoV wand COVID-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively. In conclusion, the meta-analysis approach on the abovementioned dataset revealed the epidemiological and statistical analyses for comparing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV outbreaks.","Sokouti, Massoud; Sadeghi, Ramin; Pashazadeh, Saeid; Eslami, Saeid; Sokouti, Mohsen; Ghojazadeh, Morteza; Sokouti, Babak",Arch Med Res,112,9

These properties are tunable through the engineering of microstructure shapes, dimensions, tapering, and aspect ratios. However, the current fabrication methods are often too complex, expensive, or low-throughput. Here, we present a cost-effective approach to fabricating tapered 3D MSAs using dual-exposure lithography (DEL) and soft lithography. DEL used a strip-patterned film mask to expose the SU-8 photoresist twice. The mask was re-oriented between exposures (90° or 45°), forming an array of dual-exposed areas. The intensity distribution from both exposures overlapped and created an array of 3D overcut micro-pockets in the unexposed regions. These micro-pockets were replicated to DEL-MSAs in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The shape and dimension of DEL-MSAs were tuned by varying the DEL parameters (e.g., exposure energy, inter-exposure wait time, and the photomask re-orientation angle). Further, we characterized various properties of our DEL-MSAs and studied the impact of their shape and dimension. All DEL-MSAs showed optical diffraction capability and increased hydrophobicity compared to plain PDMS surface. The hydrophobicity and diffraction angles were tunable based on the MSA shape and aspect ratio. Among the five MSAs fabricated, the two tallest DEL-MSAs demonstrated superhydrophobicity (contact angles >150°). Further, these tallest structures also demonstrated patterning proteins (with ~6–7 μm resolution), and mammalian cells, through microcontact printing and direct culturing, respectively. Our DEL method is simple, scalable, and cost-effective to fabricate structure-tunable microstructures for anti-wetting, optical-, and bio-applications.","Rengarajan, Venkatakrishnan; Geng, Junnan; Huang, Yu",Micromachines (Basel),112,25

Studies examining the disease progression of patients with non-severe disease on admission are scarce but of profound importance in the early identification of patients at a high risk of deterioration. Objectives: To elucidate the differences in clinical characteristics between patients with progressive and non-progressive COVID-19 and to determine the risk factors for disease progression. Study design: Clinical data of 365 patients with non-severe COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 18 March 2020 were retrospectively collected. Patients were stratified into progressive and non-progressive disease groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk factors for disease progression. Results: Compared with patients with non-progressive disease, those who progressed to severe COVID-19 were older and had significantly decreased lymphocyte and eosinophil counts; increased neutrophil and platelet counts; lower albumin levels; higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, creatinine kinase, and urea nitrogen; and longer prothrombin times. Hypertension, fever, fatigue, anorexia, bacterial coinfection, bilateral patchy shadowing, antibiotic and corticosteroid administration, and oxygen support had a significantly higher incidence among patients with progressive disease. A significantly longer duration of hospital stay was also observed in patients with progressive disease. Bilateral patchy shadowing (OR = 4.82, 95% CI: 1.33–17.50; P = 0.017) and elevated levels of creatinine (OR =6.24, 95% CI: 1.42–27.40; P = 0.015), and CRP (OR = 7.28, 95% CI: 2.56–20.74; P < 0.001) were independent predictors for disease progression. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of patients with progressive and non-progressive COVID-19 were significantly different. Bilateral patchy shadowing and increased levels of creatinine, and CRP were independent predictors of disease progression.","Zhang, Yanpei; Xiao, Lu-shan; Li, Pu; Zhu, Hongbo; Hu, Chenyi; Zhang, Wen-Feng; Sun, Qing-can; Shen, Meng-ying; Liu, Shan-shan; Zhang, Wan-li; Zeng, Han-yi; Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; He, Yu-Lin; Zhu, Hong",Front Med (Lausanne),112,1

OBJECTIVES: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support may be considered in experienced centers for patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV2 infection (COVID) refractory to conventional treatment. In ECMO patients, echocardiography has emerged as a clinical tool for implantation and clinical management, but to date, little data are available on COVID-related ARDS patients requiring ECMO. We assessed the incidence of RV dilatation and dysfunction (RvDys) in patients with COVID-related ARDS patients requiring ECMO. DESIGN: single-center investigation. SETTING: intensive care unit (ICU). PARTICIPANTS: 35 patients with COVID-related ARDS patients requiring ECMO, consectively admitted to our ICU (1 st March 2020 to 28(th) February 2021). INTERVENTIONS: serial echocardiographic examinations. RV Dys was defined as RVEDA/LVEDA > 0.6 and TAPSE < 15 mm. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of RvDys was 15/35 (42%). RVdys patients underwent ECMO support after a longer period of mechanical ventilation (p=0.006) and exhibited a higher mortality rate (p=0.024) than those without RVDys. In non survivors, RV Dys was observed in all patients (n.9), who died for unfavourable progression of COVID-related ARDS. In survivors, weaned from ECMO, a significant reduction in systolic pulmonary arterial pressures was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, in COVID-related ARDS requiring ECMO support, RVDys is common, associated with increased ICU mortality. Overall our data underscore the clinical role of echocardiography in COVID-related ARDS supported by VV ECMO, since serial echocardiographic assessments (especially focused on RV changes) are able to reflect pulmonary COVID disease severity.","Lazzeri, Chiara; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Batacchi, Stefano; Cianchi, Giovanni; Franci, Andrea; Socci, Filippo; Peris, Adriano",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,112,24

In response to social distancing requirements, social workers, but not interns, were granted access to work remotely. Virtual programming became necessary to meet the interns’ remaining educational requirements and provided an opportunity for proper termination from the program. This article will delineate the program redesign for oncology social work interns using remote/virtual modalities. This melded approach involved creating simulated clinical interactions, based on selected points along the illness trajectory targeting specific clinical competencies, which were presented to interns by phone and/or videoconference. Examples will be provided related to developing clinical skills and critical thinking and preparing for professional responsibilities within a broad range of healthcare settings. Guidelines for working with individuals, couples/families, and groups will be included. Issues of individual and group supervision will be explored, with sensitivity to the parallel experience of existential uncertainty and mortality awareness among the interns in the context of the pandemic. Although in-person training is preferable, there are advantages to virtual learning for both supervisors and interns. This creative adaptation of field education provides an innovative programming model that can be used to enhance the experience for social work interns moving forward in various healthcare settings during ordinary or extraordinary circumstances.","Mitchell, Barbara; Sarfati, David; Stewart, Melissa",Clin Soc Work J,112,18

METHODS: In two experimental designs using simulated dental procedures on a mannequin, fluorescein dye was introduced: (1) into the irrigation system of an air-turbine handpiece; (2) into the mannequin's mouth. Filter papers were placed in an open plan clinic to collect fluorescein. An 8-metre diameter rig was used to investigate aerosol settling time. Analysis was by fluorescence photography and spectrofluorometry. RESULTS: Contamination distribution varied across the clinic depending on conditions. Unmitigated procedures have the potential to deposit contamination at large distances. Medium volume dental suction (159 L/min air) reduced contamination in the procedural bay by 53%, and in other areas by 81-83%. Low volume suction (40 L/min air) was similar. Cross-ventilation reduced contamination in adjacent and distant areas by 80-89%. In the most realistic model (fluorescein in mouth, medium volume suction), samples in distant bays (≥5 m head-to-head chair distance) gave very low or zero readings (< 0.0016% of the fluorescein used during the procedure). Almost all (99.99%) of the splatter detected was retained within the procedural bay/walkway. After 10 min, very little additional aerosol settled. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-infection risk from dental procedures in an open plan clinic appears small when bays are ≥ 5 m apart. Dilution effects from instrument water spray were observed, and dental suction is of benefit. Most settled aerosol is detected within 10 min indicating environmental cleaning may be appropriate after this. Clinical Significance: Aerosols produced by dental procedures have the potential to contaminate distant sites and the majority of settled aerosol is detectable after 10 min. Dental suction and ventilation have a substantial beneficial effect. Contamination is likely to be minimal in open plan clinics at distances of 5 m or more.","Holliday, Richard; Allison, James R.; Currie, Charlotte C.; Edwards, David C.; Bowes, Charlotte; Pickering, Kimberley; Reay, Sarah; Durham, Justin; Lumb, Joanna; Rostami, Nadia; Coulter, Jamie; Nile, Christopher; Jakubovics, Nicholas",J Dent,112,16

The study aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic at St. Paul's Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional study was conducted to collect socio-demographic information and symptoms of mental disorders using validated measurement tools. Accordingly, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and IES-R were used to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Chi-square test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect risk factors for common mental disorders. RESULTS: A total of 420 healthcare workers participated in the survey. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and psychological distress was 20.2%, 21.9%, 12.4%, and 15.5% respectively. Frontline HCWs had higher scores of mental health symptoms than non-frontline healthcare workers. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that being married was associated with a high level of depression. Furthermore, working in a frontline position was an independent risk factor associated with a high-level of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. LIMITATIONS: It is a single-center cross-sectional study and the findings may not be nationally representative or reveal causality. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of healthcare workers are suffering from symptoms of mental disorders. Frontline HCWs were at a greater risk of severe symptoms. Therefore, psychological interventions should be implemented to support health professionals, especially frontline workers.","Mulatu, Hailu Abera; Tesfaye, Muluken; Woldeyes, Esubalew; Bayisa, Tola; Fisseha, Henok; Kassu, Rodas Asrat",J Affect Disord Rep,112,16

This classification is the main determinant of a suitable inventory control policy of inventory classes. Therefore, a great deal of research is done on solving this problem. Usually, the problem of inventory classification is considered in a multi-criteria and uncertain environment. The proposed method in this paper inspired by the notion of heterogeneous decision-making problems in which decision-makers deal with different types of data. To this aim, a mathematical modeling-based approach is proposed considering different types of uncertainty in classification information. Demand information is considered to be stochastic due to its time-varying nature and cost information is considered to be fuzzy due to its cognitive ambiguity. A hybrid algorithm based on chance-constrained and possibilistic programming is proposed to solve the problems. Considering the stochastic nature of demand information, solving the proposed model using the hybrid algorithm, the classification of items to three classes of extremely important, class A, moderately important, class B, and relatively unimportant, class C, items are determined along with a minimum inventory level required to deal with the stochasticity of demands information. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of classifying 51 inventory items. The obtained results assigned 22%, 39%, and 39% of the items to A, B, and C classes, respectively.","Razavi Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein; Daneshvar, Maryam; Antucheviciene, Jurgita",Soft comput,112,2

In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA, this sequence element has a potential to form either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot structure. Based on many mutational studies, the stem-loop structure has been proposed for the downstream enhancer region of the HIV-1 mRNA. This stimulatory stem-loop structure is separated from the shift site by a spacer of seven nucleotides. In contrast, a recent report has proposed an alternative model in which the bases in the spacer sequence form a pseudoknot structure as the downstream enhancer sequence [Du et al., Biochemistry 35 (1996) 4187–4198.]. Using UV melting and enzymatic mapping analyses, we have investigated the conformation of the sequence region involved in ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1. Our S1, V1, and T1 endonuclease mappings, together with UV melting analysis, clearly indicate that this sequence element of the HIV-1 mRNA frameshift site forms a stem-loop structure, not a pseudoknot structure. This finding further supports the stem-loop structure proposed by many mutational studies for the downstream enhancer sequence of the HIV-1 mRNA.","Kang, Hunseung",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression,112,16

To address the basis of Kex1p targeting to the Golgi apparatus, we examined the cellular location of a series of carboxy- terminal truncations of the protein. The results indicate that a cytoplasmically exposed carboxy-terminal domain is required for retention of this membrane protein within the Golgi apparatus. Deletions of the retention region or overproduction of wild-type Kex1p led to mislocalization of Kex1p to the vacuolar membrane.

Similar information technology tools are crucial, as health care populations are going to have to endure social distancing measures in the forthcoming months and years. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide adequate and personalized support to complex health care populations by developing a specific web-based mobile app. The app is designed around the patient and adapted to specific groups, for example, people with complex or rare diseases, autism, or disabilities (especially among children) as well as Alzheimer or senile dementia. The app’s core features include the collection, labeling, analysis, and sorting of clinical data. Furthermore, it authorizes a network of people around the patient to securely access the data contained in his or her electronic health record. METHODS: The application was designed according to the paradigms of patient-centered care and user-centered design (UCD). It considers the patient as the main empowered and motivating factor in the management of his or her well-being. Implementation was informed through a family needs and technology perception assessment. We used 3 interdisciplinary focus groups and 2 assessment surveys to study the contexts of app use, subpopulation management, and preferred functions. Finally, we developed an observational study involving 116 enrolled patients and 253 system users, followed by 2 feedback surveys to evaluate the performance and impact of the app. RESULTS: In the validated general GUI, we developed 10 user profiles with different privacy settings. We tested 81 functions and studied a modular structure based on disease or medical area. This allowed us to identify replicable methods to be applied to module design. The observational study not only showed good family and community engagement but also revealed some limitations that need to be addressed. In total, 42 of 51 (82%) patients described themselves as satisfied or very satisfied. Health care providers reported facilitated communication with colleagues and the need to support data quality. CONCLUSIONS: The experimented solution addressed some of the health system challenges mentioned by the World Health Organization: usability appears to be significantly improved when the GUI is designed according to patients’ UCD mental models and when new media and medical literacy are promoted. This makes it possible to maximize the impact of eHealth products, thereby overcoming some crucial gaps reported in the literature. Two main features seemed to have potential benefit compared with other eHealth products: the modeling, within the app, of both the formal and informal health care support networks and the modular structure allowing for comorbidity management, both of which require further implementation.","Ferrucci, Francesca; Jorio, Manuele; Marci, Stefano; Bezenchek, Antonia; Diella, Giulia; Nulli, Cinzia; Miranda, Ferdinando; Castelli-Gattinara, Guido",JMIR Hum Factors,112,1

A cohort of 69 patients with olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs) were enrolled and prospectively monitored. Serological and molecular assays for the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 RNA, respectively, were performed at the time of enrolment and after 7 and 14 days. Patients were stratified according to the symptoms’ onset. A total of 52 patients (75.4%) were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive being SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. The remaining 17 (24.6%) were negative for COVID-19 and excluded from the analysis. We reported that only 34 out of 52 patients (65.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Moreover, the median time from onset of symptoms and enrolment was significantly higher in those patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs, suggesting that symptoms might last longer than SARS-CoV-2 replication. The great majority of patients (80%) developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG at three weeks after symptoms’ onset while the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dramatically decreased over time, suggesting the crucial role of combination of molecular and serological assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in those patients reporting mild symptoms.","Benazzo, Marco; Cassaniti, Irene; Maiorano, Eugenia; Calastri, Anna; Novazzi, Federica; Bonetti, Alice; Sarasini, Antonella; Bruno, Raffaele; Baldanti, Fausto",Microorganisms,112,20

To reduce the spread of the COVID-19, different non-pharmacological control measures have been conducted in different countries, which include social distancing, distance working, and stay-at-home mandates. These control measures had affected global transportation and mobility significantly. This study investigated the short-term changes in urban mobility, tropospheric air pollution, and fuel consumption in two major cities of Saudi Arabia, namely, Riyadh and Jeddah. METHODS: In this study, the dynamics of the number of trips and trip purposes in different provinces of the country were analyzed, focusing on the pandemic period and the lockdown program. These changes impacted fuel consumption and, consequently, air pollutants. The quantity of fuel consumption and its trend was projected considering a few possible fuel consumption and emission scenarios. It is also expected that fuel price plays a role in fuel consumption. The spatial and temporal distributions of the remote sensed tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels in different provinces were presented to depict the short 19 and long-term impact on the air quality due to the changes in mobility. RESULTS: The significant reduction in urban mobility has been observed since the beginning of the first partial curfew in March 2020 compared to that in 2019. The air pollutant levels (such as NO2) in 2020 after the pandemic were generally less than those of 2019. The fuel consumption has been following a decreasing trend in 2020 starting from January due to dynamic fuel price and the additional influence of pandemic. Based on the current online shopping pattern, it is argued that there will be some permanent behavioral changes in urban mobility, which will decrease some shopping trips at least immediately after the recovery from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that the availability of global urban mobility data, remote sensed based tropospheric air pollution data, and global fuel consumption database are important sources of information to investigate the impact of COVID pandemic, especially for the developing countries which suffer from scarcity of pertinent urban mobility information. It seems that, at least in the study area, the spread of COVID-19 is a complex phenomenon in which several exogenous factors, in addition to the curfew protocols, affect the spread of the virus.","Rahman, Syed Masiur; Ratrout, Nedal; Assi, Khaled; Al-Sghan, Ibrahim; Gazder, Uneb; Reza, Imran; Reshi, Omer",J Transp Health,112,29

The Mano River Union (MRU) countries of West Africa–Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia–have made incremental sustained investments into TB control programmes over the past two decades. The devastating Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014–2015 in West Africa impacted significantly on all sectors of the healthcare systems in the MRU countries, including the TB prevention and control programmes. The EVD outbreak also had an adverse impact on the healthcare workforce and healthcare service delivery. At the height of the EVD outbreak, numerous staff members in all MRU countries contracted EBV at the Ebola treatment units and died. Many healthcare workers were also infected in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units but were national hospitals and peripheral health units that were unprepared for receiving patients with EVD. In all three MRU countries, the disruption to TB services due to the EVD epidemic will no doubt have increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, TB morbidity and mortality, and decreased patient adherence to TB treatment, and the likely impact will not be known for several years to come. In this viewpoint, the impact that the EVD outbreak had on TB diagnostic, management, and prevention services is described. Vaccination against TB with BCG in children under 5 years of age was affected adversely by the EVD epidemic. The EVD outbreak was a result of global failure and represents yet another ‘wake-up call’ to the international community, and particularly to African governments, to reach a consensus on new ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels for building healthcare systems that can sustain their function during outbreaks. This is necessary so that other disease control programmes (like those for TB, malaria, and HIV) are not compromised during the emergency measures of a severe epidemic.","Ansumana, Rashid; Keitell, Samuel; Roberts, Gregory M.T.; Ntoumi, Francine; Petersen, Eskild; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int J Infect Dis,112,26

However, when human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are transferred into NOG (NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2rg (null)) mice, severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) hinders long term detailed analysis. Administration of human PBMCs into newly developed murine MHC class I- and class II-deficient NOG (NOG-dKO; NOG- Iab, B2m-double-knockout) mice showed sufficient engraftment of human immune cells with little sign of GVHD. Immunization with influenza vaccine resulted in an increase in influenza-specific human IgG Ab, indicating induction of antigen-specific B cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Immunization with human dendritic cells pulsed with HLA-A2 restricted cytomegalovirus peptide induced specific cytotoxic T cells, indicating the induction of antigen-specific T cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) using melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1)-specific TCR-transduced activated T cells showed strong tumor growth inhibition in NOG-dKO mice without any sign of GVHD accompanied by preferential expansion of the transferred MART-1-specific T cells. ACTs using cultured human melanoma infiltrating T cells also showed anti-tumor effects against autologous melanoma cells in NOG-dKO mice, in which changes in human cancer phenotypes by immune intervention, such as increased CD271 expression, could be evaluated. Therefore, NOG-dKO mice are useful tools for more detailed analysis of both the induction and effector phases of T-cell and B-cell responses for a longer period than regular NOG mice.","Yaguchi, Tomonori; Kobayashi, Asuka; Inozume, Takashi; Morii, Kenji; Nagumo, Haruna; Nishio, Hiroshi; Iwata, Takashi; Ka, Yuyo; Katano, Ikumi; Ito, Ryoji; Ito, Mamoru; Kawakami, Yutaka",Cellular & Molecular Immunology,112,1

Influenza typically contributes substantially to the burden of ARI, but only limited data are available on influenza activity and seasonality in Jordan. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions were used to identify individuals with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) admitted to four sentinel hospitals in Jordan. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, with influenza A further subtyped. RESULTS: From January 2008–February 2014, 2891 SARI cases were tested for influenza, and 257 (9%) were positive. While 73% of all SARI cases were under 5 years of age, only 57% of influenza‐positive cases were under 5 years of age. Eight (3%) influenza‐positive cases died. An annual seasonal pattern of influenza activity was observed. The proportion of influenza‐positive cases peaked during November–January (14–42%) in the non‐pandemic years.

However, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and much remains unknown about this disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. It is cleaved by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS)2 and disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)17 to assist viral entry into host cells. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in acute lung injury and lung fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood. METHODS: The networks of ACE2 and its interacting molecules were identified using bioinformatic methods. Their gene and protein expressions were measured in human epithelial cells after 24 h SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in existing datasets of lung fibrosis patients. RESULTS: We confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by bioinformatic analysis. TMPRSS2, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3, angiotensinogen (AGT), transformation growth factor beta (TGFB1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and fibronectin (FN) were interacted with ACE2, and the mRNA and protein of these molecules were expressed in lung epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2, TGFB1, CTGF and FN1 mRNA that were drivers of lung fibrosis. These changes were also found in lung tissues from lung fibrosis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 and activates fibrosis-related genes and processes to induce lung fibrosis.","Xu, Jincheng; Xu, Xiaoyue; Jiang, Lina; Dua, Kamal; Hansbro, Philip M.; Liu, Gang",Respir Res,112,1

What had been studied initially as a “unique” endoribonuclease is currently known as ribonuclease L (RNase L where “L” stands for latent). Some of the key developments include discovery of the RNase L signaling pathway, its structural characterization, and its molecular cloning. RNase L has been implicated in antiviral and antibacterial defense, as well as in hereditary prostate cancer. RNase L is activated by 2′-5′ linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), which are synthesized by the oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), a family of IFN-regulated pathogen recognition receptors that sense double-stranded RNAs. Activated RNase L cleaves single stranded RNAs, including viral RNAs and cellular RNAs. The catalytic activity of RNase L has been found to lead into the activation of several cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, apoptosis, IFN-β production, NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to IL-1β secretion, inhibition of cell migration, and cell adhesion. In this review, we will highlight the newest advances in our understanding of the catalytic role of RNase L in the context of different cellular pathways and extend the scope of these findings to discussion of potential therapeutic targets for antimicrobial drug development.","Gusho, Elona; Baskar, Danika; Banerjee, Shuvojit",Cytokine,112,20

Results High resolution sequencing has been used to investigate the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the host response in cell culture models and from clinical samples. LeTRS, a bioinformatics tool, was developed to identify leader-TRS-junctions and be used as a proxy to quantify sgmRNAs for understanding virus biology. This was tested on published datasets and clinical samples from patients and longitudinal samples from animal models with COVID-19. Discussion LeTRS identified known leader-TRS-junctions and identified novel species that were common across different species.

As the virus continues, we face a new challenge;to discern between post COVID syndromes or COVID reinfection. We present a case with this medical dilemma. CASE PRESENTATION: 64 y/o F with Diabetes, Hypertension & history of asymptomatic COVID infection eight weeks prior to presentation with follow-up negative testing, presented with fever & SOB. She initially developed progressive dyspnea on exertion for which bronchodilators were initiated as an outpatient. She then presented to our hospital with fevers & progressive SOB. Her initial workup revealed normal blood work & inflammatory markers, however her COVID RNA test was positive with seronegative COVID antibodies. Imaging revealed increased bilateral ground-glass opacities & inter-septal thickening when compared to imaging one month prior. Her positive COVID tests were attributed to viral shedding & COVID therapy was not initiated. On hospital day 6 she began to decompensate requiring rapid escalation of oxygen supplementation to high flow nasal cannula. At this time high dose steroids were initiated as post COVID syndrome was thought to be the disease pathology. On hospital day 12 retesting revealed seroconversion of COVID antibodies. Her hospital course was complicated by severe hypoxia requiring prolonged steroid taper & oxygen supplementation. She was ultimately discharged on home oxygen with outpatient management. DISCUSSION: Complications of COVID-19 disease include reinfection & post-COVID syndrome. Reinfection was considered in this patient due to repeated negative tests & an asymptomatic period. This remains a rare phenomenon. There are only 5 reported known cases thus far. It was ruled out according to WHO guidelines, since there were <90 days between her 1st & 2nd positive tests. There was no genomic sequencing of both samples to confirm different genetic lineages. Her course was attributed to prolonged shedding of virus which can occur >3 months after infection & despite neutralizing antibodies. We believe she developed severe ARDS due to COVID pneumonitis with possible progression to ILD. Typical disease course is still unclear. There is increasing evidence of fibrotic-like changes in the lung in high rate of patients for up to 6 months. Reversibility of these findings is unknown. Post-mortem evaluation of lung tissue reveals diffuse alveolar damage from chronic inflammation. Obesity, ARDS, prolonged hospitalization & NIMV are reported risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows the importance of considering COVID reinfection in patients with atypical presentation. It is imperative that we differentiate between viral shedding & reinfection in patients with post-acute COVID symptoms. Both presentations may be similar, therefore it is pivotal that we continue to investigate these two-potentially fatal COVID related processes.

Subsequently, the granules containing ASP are converted to spherules and then to Ethyl cellulose (EC) Coated spherules (CS) by a novel bed coating during the rolling (BCDR) process. Among spherules, one with 0.35 mm than 0.71 mm shows required properties. The CS has a low 120(0) angle by Optical Microscopy (OM), smooth surface without cracks by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and better flow properties (Angle of repose 29.69 ± 0.78(0), Carr's index 6.73 ± 2.24%, Hausner's Ratio 1.07 ± 0.03) than granules and spherules. Once certain structure-dependent control over release is attained (EC coated spherules shows 10% reduction in burst release (BR) than uncoated spherules showing a release of 80–91%) the predictability is achieved and Design of space (DOS) by DOE (CE-70.14%and CPC-200% and DR-61.54%) is established.

Although the infection may be responsible for some mortality, its impact is mainly associated with the impairment of intestinal functions and lower performance of animals. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cryptosporidiosis on the intestinal functions in neonatal experimentally infected Holstein calves. Absorption tests with d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate, and the lactulose/mannitol test of intestinal permeability were simultaneously performed in 1-week intervals from challenge to full recovery. In infected animals, reduced intestinal absorptive capacity for both d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate was observed on day 7 post-infection (p.i.). At the same time, a more than 100% elevation of intestinal permeability was observed in the infected calves. All intestinal functions, except absorption of retinyl-palmitate, were significantly affected and changes were detected up to day 14 p.i. In contrast, results of all tests obtained on day 21 p.i. suggest full recovery of the infected intestine. Significantly, growth of the calves which had recovered from cryptosporidiosis was still affected between days 14 and 21 p.i.","Klein, Pavel; Kleinová, Tereza; Volek, Zdeněk; Šimůnek, Jiří",Vet Parasitol,112,29

Nevertheless, the use of molecular diagnosis of EV should be investigated in respiratory tract infections (RTI). OBJECTIVES: To perform enterovirus molecular diagnostic tools, PCR and genotyping, in nasal samples for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes. METHODS: During 2008, 3612 nasal specimen (NS) were studied by IFD and MRC5 culture. Next, we realised successively viral isolation on HuH7 culture (for NS negative by IFD assay) and a duplex PCR enterovirus-rhinovirus for the 816 HuH7 positive supernatants. Furthermore, 327 NS collected from neonates were systematically tested by a real-time RT-PCR. This assay was used in routine for EV diagnosis setting in cerebrospinal fluid. Enterovirus genotyping was then performed for the 68 positive supernatants. RESULTS: Thirty-five NS (0.97%) were positive for EV by culture (MRC5). A combination of both PCR assays, PEVRV and PEV, allowed an additional identification of 41 EV, eight EV-RV and 12 RV, increasing the number of positive to 96 NS (2.6%). Among the neonates, 32 NS (11.3%) were positive for EV by PEV. Of the 98 NS tested by the two PCR assays (PEV and PEVRV), 27 were positive and we detected 10 EV, five EV-RV and 12 RV. From January to December 2008, the circulation of EV showed the usual peak in June–July when a small outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred and an additional autumnal peak corresponding to respiratory tract infections. Five main serotypes were isolated: 19 EV68 (29.7%), 12 CB3 (18.7%), nine E3 (14,1%), six CA9 (9.4%) and six CB1 (9.4%); the 19 EV68 were isolated in October–November and 17/19 (89.5%) of positive patients were hospitalised for severe respiratory diseases. CONCLUSION: The use of molecular screening techniques (PCR assays and genotyping) on nasal samples collected from patients with respiratory infections allowed a prospective, effective and precise identification of circulating strains.","Petitjean-Lecherbonnier, J.; Dina, J.; Nguyen, E.; Gouarin, S.; Lebigot, E.; Vabret, A.",Pathol Biol (Paris),112,22

This was conducted to capture their evolution from February to December 2020, as well as to explore the use of technology for physical activity purposes by adolescents as a strategy to increase their physical activity during the pandemic. Physical activity, recreational screen time, sleep duration, and sleep quality were self-reported by 2661 adolescents using an online questionnaire. Participants also indicated, in comparison with the previous winter (regular in-class learning), how their different movement behaviors changed during the following 2020 periods: (1) spring (school closures), (2) summer (school break), and (3) autumn (hybrid learning). Finally, information about the use of technology during physical activity was collected. Results show that the 24 h movement behaviors of the participants varied across the different periods, and these variations were consistent with the restrictive measures imposed by the government. It was also observed that the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep duration and quality peaked in autumn. Finally, participants’ physical activity levels were associated with the use of physical activity-related tools and applications. In conclusion, the restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation of the 24 h movement behaviors in adolescents, which has become critical.","Dubuc, Marie-Maude; Berrigan, Félix; Goudreault, Marylène; Beaudoin, Sylvie; Turcotte, Sylvain",Int J Environ Res Public Health,112,24

The open source community mobilised solutions to combat this using 3D printing technology. One such solution was the face shield, which protects facial areas from droplet contamination when used by orthopaedic and other front line health care workers (HCWs). OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of an in-house developed face shield based on feedback by HCWs and its usage in triaging zones and operation theatre in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A protective face shield was developed and distributed among the orthopaedic surgeons and front line HCWs involved in the ICU in our hospital and neighbouring facilities. Feedback was obtained using a questionnaire utilising a Likert scale. RESULTS: 227 face shields were distributed to the HCWs in our hospital (157) and neighbouring facilities (70). Design modifications were done as per the needs of the HCWs. 37 HCWs provided feedback giving the face shields an overall mean score of 7.92 out of 10. The poly vinyl chloride (PVC) film visors were better for airway management procedures as it can be tucked into PPE suit and visors with overhead projector (OHP) sheets were suitable for ICU and operative procedures. CONCLUSION: A locally developed face shield design by an inter disciplinary team in synchrony with HCWs is found to increase its acceptability and efficacy. Face shields can be made more effective in different triaging and treatment situations by varying the device setup.","Chaturvedi, Satyam; Gupta, Amartya; Krishnan S, Vimal; Bhat, Anil K.",J Orthop,112,20

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women, is associated with obesity, hyperandrogenism, and cardiometabolic dysregulations. We analyzed cardiac, renal, circulatory, and urinary SARS-CoV-2 viral entry proteins (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17) and androgen receptor (AR) expression, in a peripubertal androgen exposure model of PCOS. Peripubertal female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and low (LFD) or high (HFD) fat diet for 90 days. HFD exacerbated DHT-induced increase in body weight, fat mass, and cardiac and renal hypertrophy. In the heart, DHT upregulated AR protein in both LFD and HFD, ACE2 in HFD, and ADAM17 in LFD. In the kidney, AR protein expression was upregulated by both DHT and HFD. Moreover, ACE2 and ADAM17 were upregulated by DHT in both diets. Renal TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsin L were upregulated by DHT and differentially modulated by the diet. DHT upregulated urinary ACE2 in both diets, while neither treatment modified serum ACE2. Renal AR mRNA expression positively correlated with Ace2, Tmprss2, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17. Our findings suggest that women with PCOS could be a population with a high risk of COVID-19-associated cardiac and renal complications. Furthermore, our study suggests that weight loss by lifestyle modifications (i.e., diet) could potentially mitigate COVID-19-associated deleterious cardiorenal outcomes in women with PCOS.","Rezq, Samar; Huffman, Alexandra M.; Basnet, Jelina; Yanes Cardozo, Licy L.; Romero, Damian G.",Int J Mol Sci,112,21

OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HE, and hand hygiene practices in HCWs working in COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 units. METHODS: A total of 244 HCWs working in COVID‐19 (n = 118) and non‐COVID‐19 patient care units (n = 126) were examined by dermatologists with regard to demographic parameters and hand hygiene practices. The COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 groups were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to age, atopy, and generalized dry skin. RESULTS: HE was more frequent in the COVID‐19 group (48.3% vs 12.7%, P < .001), whereas working years (P < .05) and additional housework at home (P < .001) were longer in the non‐COVID‐19 group. After the development of HE, moisturizing creams were reported to be more frequently used in the COVID group (P < .001). Topical corticosteroids were used in a minority (40% in the COVID group and 26.7% in the non‐COVID group). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in COVID‐19 units developed HE more frequently. A majority increased the frequency of moisturizer use, instead of using topical corticosteroids, after the development of HE for the purpose of treating eczema. New approaches are needed for the prevention and management of HE in HCWs, especially by facilitating access to dermatologists.","Erdem, Yasemin; Inal, Sena; Sivaz, Onur; Copur, Sevkiye; Boluk, Kubra N.; Ugurer, Ece; Kaya, Hazel E.; Gulsunay, Ilayda E.; Sekerlisoy, Gul; Vural, Osman; Altunay, Ilknur K.; Aksu Çerman, Aslı; Özkaya, Esen",Contact Dermatitis,112,20

A CNE alignment led to the detection of a set of highly conserved nucleotide clusters that occupy strictly conserved positions in the CNE sequence. The significant length of the CNE and conservation of both its length and cluster architecture were identified as a combination of characteristics that make this CNE different from known viral non-coding functional sequences. The essential role of the CNE in the Alphabaculovirus life cycle was demonstrated through the use of a CNE-knockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) bacmid. It was shown that the essential function of the CNE was not mediated by the presumed expression activities of the protein- and non-protein-coding genes that overlap the AcMNPV CNE. On the basis of the presented data, the AcMNPV CNE was categorized as a complex-structured, polyfunctional genomic element involved in an essential DNA transaction that is associated with an undefined function of the baculovirus genome.","Kikhno, Irina",PLoS One,112,24

Currently dolutegravir based regimen is first-line agent for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus. But evidence is scarce regarding treatment satisfaction. Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess treatment satisfaction and associated factors of dolutegravir based regimen among adult human immunodeficiency virus patients attending at Debre Markos referral 2020. METHODS: Institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A systematic random sampling technique was used to collect data from June 25 to August 25, 2020 at Debre Markos referral hospital. It was entered into Epi Info and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors. Variables with p<0.05 were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: From a total of 359, 349 participants (97.2%) responded to the study. In this study, 70.5% of participants reported higher treatment satisfaction.

CONCLUSION: Overall, dolutegravir based regimen showed high treatment satisfaction. Monthly income, positive beliefs about medications, discussing about treatment options, sex and concurrent medications were associated with treatment satisfaction. Thus, it is crucial to improve treatment satisfaction by promoting positive belief towards medication and also by engaging patients in treatment decisions.","Mehari, Eden Abetu; Muche, Esileman Abdela; Gonete, Kedir Abdela; Shiferaw, Kirubel Biruk",Patient Prefer Adherence,112,14

Accordingly, we conducted this study to provide an updated account of physician deaths in South Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze and compare the different characteristics associated with physician mortality amongst the countries of the region. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study by using published news reports on the websites of news agencies from 9 selected countries in South Asia. Our study included only those physicians and doctors who died after contracting COVID-19 from their respective workplaces. All available data about the country of origin, type of, sex, age, medical or surgical specialty, and date of death were included. RESULTS: The total number of physician deaths reported due to COVID-19 in our study was 170, with half (87/170, 51%) of the deaths reported from Iran. Male physician deaths were reported to be 145 (145/170 = 85%). Internal Medicine (58.43%) was the most severely affected sub-specialty.

We aimed to develop and test an online tool for patient education on pregnancy‐related issues and communication with epilepsy nurses during pregnancy for women with epilepsy. METHODS: An existing national platform for online communication (1177.se) was used, and an online tool was developed by two epilepsy nurses, two neurologists, and an IT technician. The tool was launched as a complement to standard care, and patients deciding to use it were invited to participate in a survey of user experiences and knowledge questions. RESULTS: The online tool consists of two modules: one for patient education and one for TDM during pregnancy. The latter module allows scheduling of automatic reminders of blood tests that are sent to patients at set intervals. The epilepsy nurse can communicate results and suggested dose changes in the tool. A total of 48 women answered the survey: 28 had been invited to use the information module and 20 to use the TDM module. Patient experiences were generally good, and most users of the TDM module would prefer an online means of communication in future pregnancies. For epilepsy nurses, the tool provided good overview of patients currently pregnant and administrative advantages compared with traditional means of communication.

Motivated by this evolution, in this paper the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia is investigated with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID‐19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate κ by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the κ‐value by ≈15% as compared to the much bearable state of social and economic life wherein wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed.

We examined the mechanism of apoptosis induction by CIV. High CIV doses (CIV(XS); 400 μg/ml), UV-irradiated virus (CIV(UV); 10 μg/ml) and CVPE (CIV protein extract; 10 μg/ml) induced apoptosis in 60% of treated Choristoneura fumiferana (IPRI-CF-124T) cells. Normal doses of infectious CIV (10 μg/ml) induced apoptosis in only 10% of C. fumiferana (CF) cells. Apoptosis was inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK, an apical caspase inhibitor, indicating that CIV-induced apoptosis requires caspase activity. The putative caspase in CF cells was designated Cf-caspase-i. CIV(UV) or CVPE enhanced Cf-caspase-i activity by 80% at 24 h relative to mock-treated cells. Since the MAP kinase pathway induces or inhibits apoptosis depending on the context, we used JNK inhibitor SP600125 and demonstrated drastic suppression of CVPE-induced apoptosis. Thus, the JNK signaling pathway is significant for apoptosis in this system. Virus interaction with the cell surface was not sufficient for apoptosis since CIV(UV) particles bound to polysterene beads failed to induce apoptosis. Endocytosis inhibitors (bafilomycin or ammonium chloride) negated apoptosis induction by CIV(UV), CIV(XS) or CVPE indicating that entry through this mode is required. Given the weak apoptotic response to infectious CIV, we postulated that viral gene expression inhibited apoptosis. CIV infection of cells pretreated with cycloheximide induced apoptosis in 69% of the cells compared to 10% in normal infections. Furthermore, blocking viral DNA replication with aphidicolin or phosphonoacetic acid suppressed apoptosis and Cf-caspase-i activity, indicating that early viral expression is necessary for inhibition of apoptosis, and de novo synthesis of viral proteins is not required for induction. We show for the first time that, in a member of the family Iridoviridae, apoptosis: (i) requires entry and endocytosis of virions or virion proteins, (ii) is inhibited under conditions permitting early viral expression, and (iii) requires the JNK signaling pathway. This is the first report of JNK signal requirement during apoptosis induction by an insect virus.","Chitnis, Nilesh S.; D'Costa, Susan M.; Paul, Eric R.; Bilimoria, Shän L.",Virology,112,24

The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS industry partners and the surgeon-industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the 2nd half of 2020. METHODS: AAHKS industry partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS member surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. RESULTS: AAHKS industry partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for regional, “other national,” and AAHKS annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on site of service/outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the orthopedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS industry partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with and increasing shift to a web-based platform. Increased resource allocation for outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures were significant. Articulating optimal mechanisms to aid industry in supporting surgeons with different practice models to meet demand during the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be critical.","Warth, Lucian C.; Noiseux, Nicolas O.; Duncan, Stephen T.; Daines, S.

In this cross-sectional study we examined if perceived social support, exercise in minutes per week and change in exercise are protective factors regarding symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleeping disorders. Method: In April 2020, n = 4271 German adults completed an online survey including mental health questionnaires regarding depression (PHQ-D), anxiety (PHQ-D) and sleep (PSQI), as well as questionnaires related to protective factors such as exercise (BSA-F), physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) and social support (F-SozU). Results: Complete case analysis (n = 3700; mean age 33.13 {+/-} 11.73 years, 78.6 % females) resulted in elevated prevalence of depressive disorder (31.4%), panic disorder (5.7%) and other anxiety disorders (7.4%). 58.3% reported symptoms of insomnia. Three separate models of multiple regression were conducted. Perceived social support was associated with lower values of anxiety (beta = -0.10; t(19) = -6.46; p >0.001), lower values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.22; t(19) = -15.71; p < .001) and lower values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.15; t(19) = -9.55; p < .001). Change towards less exercise compared to the time before Covid-19 was associated with and higher values of anxiety (beta = -0.05; t(19) = -2.85; p= .004), higher values of depressive symptoms (beta = -0.08; t(19) = -5.69; p < .001), and higher values of sleeping disorder symptoms (beta = -0.07; t(19) = -4.54; p < .000). Post-hoc analysis (ANOVAs) revealed that a change towards less exercise was significantly associated with more depressive, anxiety and sleeping disorder symptoms whereas a positive change was not. No significant association was found for exercise in minutes per week for all outcomes. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a negative impact on mental health in the German population. Social Support and a stable amount of exercise might attenuate these negative mental health consequences. Ongoing monitoring of the impact of the pandemic on mental health and possible protective factors is needed in order to create a basis for the development of appropriate prevention and intervention measures.","Bauer, L.

To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating pathogens. AIM: We provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination (infectivity loss over time during room temperature storage in a breathable bag) and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination. METHODS: Masks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID(50) assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude. This multi-disciplinal approach provides important information on how often a given PPE item may be safely reused.","Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F.; Wielick, Constance; Jolois, Olivier; Dams, Lorène; Razafimahefa, Ravo M.; Nauwynck, Hans; Demeuldre, Pierre-Francois; Napp, Aurore; Laperre, Jan; Thiry, Etienne; Haubruge, Eric",PLoS One,112,29

Public health measures are crucial in preventing COVID-19. The Government of India declared a nationwide lockdown on 24 March, 2020. The objective of this study is to assess preparedness among general public and healthcare providers against COVID-19 by way of adopting public health measures at the very beginning of the nationwide lockdown in India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A rapid cross sectional electronic survey was conducted across the country between 25 and 27 March, 2020. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Participants were general public and healthcare providers. Online questionnaire was generated in Google Forms. This included precautionary measures such as staying home, hand hygiene, wearing masks, cough hygiene and advisory against face touching. The web link to the form was shared through WhatsApp. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive data analysis was done using Epi Info software (version-7). RESULTS: A total of 226 persons (general public = 183; healthcare providers [HCPs] = 43) participated in the study. During the lockdown, HCPs spent more time outside than the general public (p = 0.009). Only 47% of the participants claimed to practise frequent hand washing and majority (72%; n = 163) did not wear masks while outdoors. Almost a half (45%) of the participants touched their face frequently and very few (8%) participants covered their mouth or nose while coughing or sneezing. There was no significant difference between HCPs and general public in frequent hand washing (p = 0.456), wearing masks (p = 0.255), face touching (p = 0.632) or covering mouth/nose while coughing or sneezing (p = 0.428).

This pandemic has placed a substantial burden on the global healthcare system and the global economy. Availability of novel prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are crucially needed to prevent development of severe disease leading to major complications both acutely and chronically. The success in fighting this virus results from three main achievements: (a) Direct killing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (b) Development of a specific vaccine, and (c) Enhancement of the host’s immune system. A fundamental necessity to win the battle against the virus involves a better understanding of the host’s innate and adaptive immune response to the virus. Although the role of the adaptive immune response is directly involved in the generation of a vaccine, the role of innate immunity on RNA viruses in general, and coronaviruses in particular, is mostly unknown. In this review, we will consider the structure of RNA viruses, mainly coronaviruses, and their capacity to affect the lungs and the cardiovascular system. We will also consider the effects of the pattern recognition protein (PRP) trident composed by (a) Surfactant proteins A and D, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and complement component 1q (C1q), (b) C-reactive protein, and (c) Innate and adaptive IgM antibodies, upon clearance of viral particles and apoptotic cells in lungs and atherosclerotic lesions. We emphasize on the role of pattern recognition protein immune therapies as a combination treatment to prevent development of severe respiratory syndrome and to reduce pulmonary and cardiovascular complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and summarize the need of a combined therapeutic approach that takes into account all aspects of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 disease to allow mankind to beat this pandemic killer.","Labarrere, Carlos A.; Kassab, Ghassan S.",Front Immunol,112,2

Crowded indoor environments, such as schools, represent possible hotspots for virus transmission since the basic non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures applied so far (e.g. social distancing) do not eliminate the airborne transmission mode. There is widespread consensus that improved ventilation is needed to minimize the transmission potential of airborne viruses in schools, whether through mechanical systems or ad-hoc manual airing procedures in naturally ventilated buildings. However, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding exactly what ventilation rates are required, and how to best achieve these targets with limited time and resources. This paper uses a mass balance approach to quantify the ability of both mechanical ventilation and ad-hoc airing procedures to mitigate airborne transmission risk in the classroom environment. For naturally-ventilated classrooms, we propose a novel feedback control strategy using CO(2) concentrations to continuously monitor and adjust the airing procedure. Our case studies show how such procedures can be applied in the real world to support the reopening of schools during the pandemic. Our results also show the inadequacy of relying on absolute CO(2) concentration thresholds as the sole indicator of airborne transmission risk.","Stabile, L.; Pacitto, A.; Mikszewski, A.; Morawska, L.; Buonanno, G.",Build Environ,112,26

Patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection requiring admission to UHB between 10th March 2020 and 17th April 2020 Exposure. Ethnicity Main outcome measures. Standardised Admission Ratio (SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each ethnicity was calculated using observed sex specific age distributions of COVID19 admissions and deaths and 2011 census data for Birmingham/Solihull. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated for each ethnic group with white population as reference group, using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation and co-morbidities, and propensity score matching. Results. 2217 patients admitted to UHB with a proven diagnosis of COVID19 were included. 58.2% were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co morbidities. 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger (median age 61 years vs.77 years), have no co morbidities (27.8% vs. 16.6%) but a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.0% vs 28.2%) than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted. South Asian patients were also more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.66 (95%CI 1.32 to 2.10)) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, (Hazard ratio 1.68 (1.33 to 2.13), using the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not.

OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously assess the presence of both quantitative and qualitative smell/taste dysfunctions in patients who suffered from COVID-19. METHODS: We enrolled 17 consecutive patients who suffered from COVID-19 over the last 6 months and 21 healthy controls, matched for sex and age. After a negative nasopharyngeal swab, the Sniffin’ Sticks Test and the Taste Strips were used to assess olfactory and taste function, respectively. At the same time, the presence of phantosmia, parosmia, phantogeusia, and parageusia was investigated with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Qualitative disturbances of smell and/or taste were found in 6/17 (35.3%) patients. Phantosmia was reported in 2/17 (11.8%) patients and parosmia in 4/17 (23.5%). There were no significant differences in smell test scores between patients who reported phantosmia and/or parosmia and patients who did not. Phantogeusia was described in 3/17 (17.6%) patients, and parageusia was identified in 4/17 (23.5%) patients. All tested patients were normogeusic. CONCLUSION: Around one-third of patients who recover from COVID-19 may have persistent qualitative dysfunction in smell/taste domains. Detection of phantogeusia in long-term COVID-19 patients represents a further novel finding. Further investigation is needed to better characterize the pathophysiology of phantosmia, parosmia, phantogeusia, and parageusia in patients who had COVID-19.","Ercoli, Tommaso; Masala, Carla; Pinna, Ilenia; Orofino, Gianni; Solla, Paolo; Rocchi, Lorenzo; Defazio, Giovanni",Neurol Sci,112,19

The target disorders that might be amenable to the promotion of this repair process are diverse and increasing in number. They range primarily from those of genetic, inflammatory to toxic origin. In order to apply remyelinating strategies to these disorders, it is essential to know whether the myelin damage results from a primary attack on myelin or the oligodendrocyte or both, and whether indeed these lead to myelin breakdown and demyelination. In some disorders, myelin sheath abnormalities are prominent but demyelination does not occur.

The proposed model offers considerable potentials, considering the inconsistency of existing methods for predicting novel proteins. Because some novel proteins might align without meaningful conserved domains, maximizing the score of sequence alignment is not the best criterion for predicting protein functions. This work presents a decision model that can minimize the cost of making a decision for predicting protein functions using the hierarchical homologies. Particularly, the model has three characteristics: (i) it is a hybrid evolutionary model with multiple fitness functions that uses genetic programming to predict protein functions on a distantly related protein family, (ii) it incorporates modified robust point matching to accurately compare all feature points using the moment invariant and thin-plate spline theorems, and (iii) the hierarchical homologies holding up a novel protein sequence in the form of a causal tree can effectively demonstrate the relationship between proteins. This work describes the comparisons of nucleocapsid proteins from the putative polyprotein SARS virus and other coronaviruses in other hosts using the model.","Hung, Chun-Min; Huang, Yueh-Min; Chang, Ming-Shi",Nonlinear Anal Theory Methods Appl,112,1

Methods: COVID-19 pneumonia data was divided into training set (256 of 321, 80%), internal validation set (65 of 321, 20%) and independent external validation set (n =188). After image processing, lesion segmentation, feature extraction and feature selection, radiomics signatures and clinical indicators were used to develop a radiomics model and a clinical model respectively. Combining radiomics signatures and clinical indicators, a radiomics nomogram was built. The performance of proposed models was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration curves and decision curve analysis were used to assess the performance of the radiomics nomogram. Results: Two clinical indicators that were age and chronic lung disease or asthma and 21 radiomics features were selected to build the radiomics nomogram. The radiomics nomogram yielded an Area Under The Curve (AUC) of 0.88 and accuracy of 0.80 in the training set, an AUC of 0.85 and accuracy of 0.77 in internal testing validation set and an AUC of 0.84 and accuracy of 0.75 in independent external validation set. The performance of radiomics nomogram was better than clinical model (AUC = 0.77, p <0.001) and radiomics model (AUC = 0.72, p = 0.025) in independent external validation set. Conclusions: The radiomics nomogram may be used to assess the deterioration of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhang, Mudan; Zeng, Xianchun; Huang, Chencui; Liu, Jun; Liu, Xinfeng; Xie, Xingzhi; Wang, Rongpin",Int J Med Inform,112,33

Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients’ home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan’s lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","Huang, Chunmei; Xu, Xinjie; Cai, Yuyang; Ge, Qinmin; Zeng, Guangwang; Li, Xiaopan; Zhang, Weide; Ji, Chen; Yang, Ling",J Med Internet Res,112,24

It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. Objectives: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. Data sources: Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. Study eligibility criteria: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff [≥] 10). Participants and interventions: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Meta-analysis and meta-regresssion. Results: In total, 226,638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic were 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There was a wide variance in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported in different regions of the world and countries. Asia, and China particularly, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased anxiety prevalence. Limitations: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e., city-specific) contexts. Conclusions and implications of key findings: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provides support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","Castaldelli-Maia, J.

Early advance care planning is preferred by patients, impacts outcomes and is promoted by PC frameworks. Systematic assessment of non-motor symptoms, psychosocial needs and spiritual/existential distress may address gaps in current models of care. Several complementary and emerging models of PC may be utilized to meet the needs of this population. SUMMARY: A PC approach may identify and improve important patient and caregiver-centered outcomes. As a relatively new application of PC, there is a need for research to adapt, develop and implement approaches to meet the unique needs of this population.","Macchi, Zachary A.; Tarolli, Christopher G.; Kluger, Benzi M.",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,112,24

CV risk-prediction models are used to identify and treat high risk populations and to communicate risk effectively. These tools are unexplored in Covid-19. The main objective is to evaluate the association between CV scoring systems and chest X ray (CXR) examination (in terms of severity of lung involvement) in 50 Italian Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: only the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was applicable to all patients. The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Score (ASCVD) was applicable to half. 62% of patients were classified as high risk according to FRS and 41% according to ASCVD. Patients who died had all a higher FRS compared to survivors. They were all hypertensive. FRS≥30 patients had a 9.7 higher probability of dying compared to patients with a lower FRS. We found a strong correlation between CXR severity and FRS and ASCVD (p<0.001). High CV risk patients had consolidations more frequently. CXR severity was significantly associated with hypertension and diabetes. 71% of hypertensive patients’ CXR and 88% of diabetic patients’ CXR had consolidations. Patients with diabetes or hypertension had 8 times greater risk of having consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: high CV risk correlates with more severe CXR pattern and death. Diabetes and hypertension are associated with more severe CXR. FRS offers more predictive utility and fits best to our cohort.

Only 384 responded, of which 361 patients could be included in the final analysis. During the pandemic, 42.1% of the 361 patients and 65.0% of the 234 patients on immunotherapies were exposed to teriflunomide. Compared to patients who didn't receive treatment, patients exposed to DMTs had significantly lower levels of neutrophils (P < 0.01) and immunoglobulin G (P < 0.01), and patients exposed to immunosuppressants had significantly lower levels of immunoglobulin G (P < 0.05). Over 80% of our patients followed effective protective measures and none of the 361 MS patients in our cohort contracted COVID-19. Patients whose treatment was disrupted had a significantly higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) during than before the pandemic (P < 0.01), while the ARR of patients with continuous treatment or without treatment remained unchanged. During the pandemic, the risk of MS attack due to treatment disruption possibly outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection under preventive measures, and MS treatment maintenance might be necessary.","Zhang, Yao; Yin, Hexiang; Xu, Yan; Xu, Tao; Peng, Bin; Cui, Liying; Zhang, Shuyang",Front Neurol,112,1

Mobile health promises to improve the reach of a limited pool of palliative care specialists through interprofessional, community-based care coordination. This work assessed the effectiveness of a smartphone- or Web-based app, mPalliative Care Link (mPCL), to extend specialist access via shared data and communication with local health workers. Central to mPCL is the African Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS), adapted for automated mobile symptom assessment and response. METHODS: Adult patients with incurable cancer were randomly assigned at hospital discharge to mPCL versus phone-contact POS collection. Sociodemographic, clinical, and POS data were obtained at baseline. Twice-weekly POS responses were collected and managed via mPCL or phone contact with clinician study personnel for up to 4 months, on the basis of study arm assignment. Patient end-of-study care satisfaction was assessed via phone survey. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients per arm participated. Comparison of baseline characteristics showed an insignificant trend toward more women (P = .07) and higher discharge morphine use (P = .09) in the mPCL group compared with phone-contact and significant between-group differences in cancer types (P = .003). Proportions of deaths were near equal between groups (mPCL: 27%; phone-contact: 29%). Overall symptom severity was significantly lower in the phone-contact group (P < .0001), and symptom severity decreased over time in both groups (P = .0001); however, between-group change in overall symptoms over time did not vary significantly (P = .34). Care satisfaction was generally high in both groups. CONCLUSION: Higher symptom severity scores in the mPCL arm likely reflect between-group sociodemographic and clinical differences and clinical support of phone-contact arm participants. Similar rates of care satisfaction in both groups suggest that mPCL may support symptom-focused care coordination in a more efficient and scalable manner than phone contact. A broader study of mPCL's cost efficiency and utility in Tanzania is needed.","Ngoma, Mamsau; Mushi, Beatrice; Morse, Robert S.; Ngoma, Twalib; Mahuna, Habiba; Lambden, Kaley; Quinn, Erin; Sagan, Sarah B.; Ho, Yun Xian; Lucas, F.

Although the rates of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant Haemophilus influenzae have risen to alarming levels, the rates of respiratory FQ (RFQ) resistance amongst these isolates remain relatively low. It is reported that ca. 1–7% of CAP cases are re-diagnosed as pulmonary TB in Asian countries. A longer duration (≥7 days) of symptoms, a history of night sweats, lack of fever (>38 °C), infection involving the upper lobe, presence of cavitary infiltrates, opacity in the lower lung without the presence of air, low total white blood cell count and the presence of lymphopenia are predictive of pulmonary TB. Amongst patients with CAP who reside in TB-endemic countries who are suspected of having TB, imaging studies as well as aggressive microbiological investigations need to be performed early on. Previous exposure to a FQ for >10 days in patients with TB is associated with the emergence of FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. However, rates of M. tuberculosis isolates with FQ resistance are significantly higher amongst multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates than amongst susceptible isolates. Consequently, in Taiwan and also in other countries with TB endemicity, a short-course (5-day) regimen of a RFQ is still recommended for empirical therapy for CAP patients if the patient is at low risk for TB.","Shen, Gwan-Han; Tsao, Thomas Chang-Yao; Kao, Shang-Jyh; Lee, Jen-Jyh; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Hsieh, Wei-Chung; Hsu, Gwo-Jong; Hsu, Yen-Tao; Huang, Ching-Tai; Lau, Yeu-Jun; Tsao, Shih-Ming; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,112,16

The PAPESCO-19 study investigated 13 COVID-19 symptoms and confirmed that in combination with anorexia, fever, headache, and rhinorrhea, anosmia has a strong association with COVID-19 for cancer patients while dysgeusia/ageusia does not. ABSTRACT: Background: Cancer patients may fail to distinguish COVID-19 symptoms such as anosmia, dysgeusia/ageusia, anorexia, headache, and fatigue, which are frequent after cancer treatments. We aimed to identify symptoms associated with COVID-19 and to assess the strength of their association in cancer and cancer-free populations. Methods: The multicenter cohort study PAPESCO-19 included 878 cancer patients and 940 healthcare workers (HCWs). At baseline and quarterly thereafter, they reported the presence or absence of 13 COVID-19 symptoms observed over 3 months and the results of routine screening RT-PCR, and they were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We identified the symptom combinations significantly associated with COVID-19. Results: Eight percent of cancer patients were COVID-19 positive, and 32% were symptomatic. Among the HCWs, these proportions were 9.5 and 52%, respectively. Anosmia, anorexia, fever, headache, and rhinorrhea together accurately discriminated (c-statistic = 0.7027) COVID-19 cases from cancer patients. Anosmia, dysgeusia/ageusia, muscle pain, intense fatigue, headache, and chest pain better discriminated (c-statistic = 0.8830) COVID-19 cases among the HCWs. Anosmia had the strongest association in both the cancer patients (OR = 7.48, 95% CI: 2.96–18.89) and HCWs (OR = 5.71, 95% CI: 2.21–14.75). Conclusions: COVID-19 symptoms and their diagnostic performance differ in the cancer patients and HCWs. Anosmia is associated with COVID-19 in cancer patients, while dysgeusia/ageusia is not.

This study aims to provide overview of early findings on COVID-19 and AMR as well as to provide recommendations and lesson learned toward improving antimicrobial stewardship. We conducted a rapid narrative review of published articles by searching PubMed and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and Antimicrobial Resistance with predetermined keywords. Secondary bacterial infections play crucial roles in mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19. Research has shown that a minority of COVID-19 patients need antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections. Current evidence reiterates the need not to give antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild COVID-19 or to patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 illness unless it is indicated. The pandemic has also brought to the fore the deficiencies in health systems around the world. This comes with a lot of lessons, one of which is that despite the advances in medicine; we remain incredibly vulnerable to infections with limited or no standard therapies. This is worth thinking in the context of AMR, as the resistant pathogens are evolving and leading us to the era of untreatable infections.

To investigate HCW attitudes towards anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination, we developed an anonymous online cross-sectional survey. 1723 Italian HCW responded. Overall, 1155 (67%) intended to be vaccinated, while 443 (26%) were not sure and 125 (7%) declared refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with hesitancy were using Facebook as the main information source and being a non-physician HCW, while predictors of acceptance included younger age, being in close contact with high-risk groups and having received flu vaccination during the 2019–2020 season. Reasons for hesitancy included lack of trust in vaccine safety (85%) and receiving little (78%) or conflicting (69%) information about vaccines. According to our results, adequate investment in vaccine education for healthcare personnel appears to be urgently needed, prioritizing non-physicians and information quality spread through social media.

At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID‐19, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated. METHODS: I describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID‐19 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID‐19. RESULTS: More than 41,000 COVID‐19 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%‐12% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID‐19 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension‐type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza‐like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs. CONCLUSIONS: Several headaches can appear during COVID‐19 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non‐infectious inflammatory intracranial disease. Although the reported prevalence of headaches as a symptom of COVID‐19 infection is low, this experience shows that, very probably, it is underestimated.","Belvis, Robert",Headache,112,20

Although this virus has been detected in the wastewater streams, there is no robust method for its detection and quantification in wastewater. This review compiled and analyzed the virus concentration approaches applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2, besides to provide insights about the methodology for viral concentration, limit of detection, occurrence, persistence, and perspectives post-COVID-19 related with the implications of the virus presence in wastewater. The SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater has been related to virus concentration methods, which present different recovery rates of the virus. The most used viral concentration methods have been the polyethylene glycol (PEG) for precipitation of viral material and the ultrafiltration at molecular weight level. After viral concentration, the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are mainly via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which is the clinical assay adapted for environmental purposes. Although in some experiments the positive control during RT-qPCR is running a surrogated virus (e.g., Mengovirus or Dengue virus), RT-qPCR or reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) targeting the gene encoding nucleocapsid (N1, N2 and N3) of SARS-CoV-2 are highly recommended to calculate the limit of detection in wastewater samples. Current results suggest that a rigorous methodology to elucidate the positive cases in a region from genomic copies in wastewater is needed.","Cervantes-Avilés, Pabel; Moreno-Andrade, Iván; Carrillo-Reyes, Julián",,112,19

The virus, proven to be very contagious, infected more than 9 million people worldwide (in June 2020). Nevertheless, it is not clear the role of air pollution and meteorological conditions on virus transmission. In this study, we quantitatively assessed how the meteorological and air quality parameters are correlated to the COVID-19 transmission in two large metropolitan areas in Northern Italy as Milan and Florence and in the autonomous province of Trento. Milan, capital of Lombardy region, it is considered the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Italy. Our main findings highlight that temperature and humidity related variables are negatively correlated to the virus transmission, whereas air pollution (PM(2.5)) shows a positive correlation (at lesser degree). In other words, COVID-19 pandemic transmission prefers dry and cool environmental conditions, as well as polluted air. For those reasons, the virus might easier spread in unfiltered air-conditioned indoor environments. Those results will be supporting decision makers to contain new possible outbreaks.","Lolli, Simone; Chen, Ying-Chieh; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang; Vivone, Gemine",Sci Rep,112,20

Due to the frequent hospitalizations, HF places a major burden on the available hospital and healthcare resources. In the future, HF care should not only be organized solely at the clinical ward and outpatient clinics, but remote monitoring strategies are urgently needed to guide, monitor, and treat chronic HF patients remotely from their homes as well. The intuitiveness and relatively low costs of non-invasive remote monitoring tools make them an appealing and emerging concept for developing new medical apps and devices. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the associated transition of patient care outside the hospital will boost the development of remote monitoring tools, and many strategies will be reinvented with modern tools. However, it is important to look carefully at the inconsistencies that have been reported in non-invasive remote monitoring effectiveness. With this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of the available evidence on non-invasive remote monitoring in chronic HF patients and provide future perspectives that may significantly benefit the broader group of HF patients.","Veenis, Jesse F.; Radhoe, Sumant P.; Hooijmans, Petra; Brugts, Jasper J.",Sensors (Basel),112,16

The rarity of these case poses therapeutic dilemmas about their further management. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 61 year old gentleman who had covid19 infection 2 months back, presented with new onset myasthenia gravis and an anterior mediastinal mass. He was diagnosed as a case of anti acetyl choline receptor antibody positive thymomatous myasthenia gravis. The patient was posted for video assisted thoracoscopic excision of thymoma. The procedure was uneventful and patient was discharged with improvement in myasthenic symptoms. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type A Spindle cell thymoma. DISCUSSION: SARS CoV19 infection is associated with an array of autoimmune disorders due to various proposed phenomenon including molecular mimicry and loss of immune tolerance. Post infectious thymomatous myasthenia gravis is extremely uncommon, and can be managed with open, minimally invasive or robotic approach. CONCLUSION: This is the first documented case of post covid19 infection thymomatous myasthenia gravis to the best of our knowledge, managed with minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery.

The greatest prevalence of severe disease requiring hospitalization in otherwise healthy children appears to be in those aged between 6 and 12 months, older than the peak age of hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus. Human metapneumovirus is also a significant cause of acute respiratory disease in adults, particularly the elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cancer.

DESIGN: Randomised, open label trial. SETTING: Nine hospitals in Brazil, 8 May to 17 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with confirmed covid-19 who were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and had abnormal levels of at least two serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, D dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, or ferritin). The data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early, after 129 patients had been enrolled, because of an increased number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab (single intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg) plus standard care (n=65) versus standard care alone (n=64). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome, clinical status measured at 15 days using a seven level ordinal scale, was analysed as a composite of death or mechanical ventilation because the assumption of odds proportionality was not met. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients were enrolled (mean age 57 (SD 14) years; 68% men) and all completed follow-up. All patients in the tocilizumab group and two in the standard care group received tocilizumab. 18 of 65 (28%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 13 of 64 (20%) in the standard care group were receiving mechanical ventilation or died at day 15 (odds ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 3.66; P=0.32). Death at 15 days occurred in 11 (17%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared with 2 (3%) in the standard care group (odds ratio 6.42, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 43.2). Adverse events were reported in 29 of 67 (43%) patients who received tocilizumab and 21 of 62 (34%) who did not receive tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe or critical covid-19, tocilizumab plus standard care was not superior to standard care alone in improving clinical outcomes at 15 days, and it might increase mortality.

SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a promising approach to COVID-19 therapy. However, the recently described accumulating mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are challenging the efficacy of approved and investigational mAbs, whose widespread use is also hampered by their significant costs and possible side effects, including Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Here we describe a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human single chain variable fragment antibodies, identified by phage display, sharing a common VH CDR3 sequence. Phage libraries were built by amplifying variable domains of immunoglobulin genes from cDNA derived from lymphocytes of COVID-19 convalescent subjects living in Bergamo, Italy. The scFv76-cluster antibodies (scFv76-cl Abs) exhibit high affinity for the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of Wuhan strain and emerging variants, leading to inhibition of RBD/human ACE2 interaction. The antigenic epitope recognized by scFv76 was mapped in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of RBD at residues L455, F456, Y473, N487 and Y489. None of these residues has been to date listed among the RBD mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), suggesting an important role of such epitope in viral infectivity. Treatment with scFv76-cl Abs is effective against SARS-CoV-2, as determined by in vitro experiments of viral infection, replication, cytopathogenicity and spike-mediated syncytia formation. Moreover, their intranasal administration is shown to counteract infection in two independent animal models. Overall, the biochemical and biological characteristics of scFv76-cl Abs are compatible with their clinical use for COVID-19 therapy by intranasal or aerosol administration. To our knowledge, this is the first example of promising human anti-SARS-CoV-2 scFv antibodies as drug candidates for COVID-19 therapy.","Minenkova, Olga; Santapaola, Daniela; Milazzo, Ferdinando Maria; Anastasi, Anna Maria; Battistuzzi, Gianfranco; Chiapparino, Caterina; Rosi, Antonio; Gritti, Giuseppe; Borleri, Gianmaria; Rambaldi, Alessandro; Dental, Clélia; Viollet, Cécile; Pagano, Bruno; Salvini, Laura; Marra, Emanuele; Luberto, Laura; Rossi, Antonio; Riccio, Anna; Pich, Emilio Merlo; Santoro, Maria Gabriella; De Santis, Rita",bioRxiv,112,26

Human movement is considered a significant and increasing factor in these processes, yet forced migration remains an understudied area of zoonotic research–due in part to the complexity of conducting interdisciplinary research in these settings. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review to identify and analyze theoretical frameworks and approaches used to study linkages between forced migration and zoonotic diseases. METHODS: We searched within eight electronic databases: ProQuest, SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed, PLoSOne, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Google Scholar, to identify a) research articles focusing on zoonoses considering forced migrants in their study populations, and b) forced migration literature which engaged with zoonotic disease. Both authors conducted a full-text review, evaluating the quality of literature reviews and primary data using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) model, while theoretical papers were evaluated for quality using a theory synthesis adapted from Bonell et al. (2013). Qualitative data were synthesized thematically according to the method suggested by Noblit and Hare (1988). RESULTS: Analyses of the 23 included articles showed the increasing use of interdisciplinary frameworks and approaches over time, the majority of which stemmed from political ecology. Approaches such as EcoHealth and One Health were increasingly popular, but were more often linked to program implementation and development than broader contextual research. The majority of research failed to acknowledge the heterogeneity of migrant populations, lacked contextual depth, and insufficient acknowledgments of migrant agency in responding to zoonotic threats. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing the emergence and spread of zoonoses in forced migration contexts requires more careful consideration and use of interdisciplinary research to integrate the contributions of social and natural science approaches. Robust interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks are an important step for better understanding the complex health, environment, and socio-political drivers of zoonotic diseases in forced migration. Lessons can be learned from the application of these approaches in other hard-to-reach or seldom-heard populations.","Tasker, Alex; Braam, Dorien",PLoS One,112,16

COVID-19 is associated with notable increases in morbidity and death worldwide. Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. The virus enters the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and plays a central function in the virus’s pathogenesis. A systematic understanding of cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV2 is needed to develop novel therapeutic tools to target the virus-induced cardiac damage as a potential strategy to minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and reduce the morbidity. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of COVID-19 mediated damage to the cardiovascular system.","Magadum, Ajit; Kishore, Raj",Cells,112,21

Considering the pivotal role of gut microbiota on host immune and inflammatory functions, we investigated the association between changes in gut microbiota composition and the clinical severity of COVID-19. We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study prospectively enrolling 115 COVID-19 patients categorized according to: 1) WHO Clinical Progression Scale - mild 19 (16.5%), moderate 37 (32.2%) or severe 59 (51.3%); and 2) location of recovery from COVID-19 - ambulatory 14 (household isolation; 12.2%), hospitalized in ward 40 (34.8%) or intensive care unit 61 (53.0%). Gut microbiota analysis was performed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data obtained was further related with clinical parameters of COVID-19 patients. Risk factors for COVID-19 severity were identified by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. In comparison with mild COVID-19 patients, the gut microbiota of moderate and severe patients has: a) lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, b) higher abundance of Proteobacteria; and c) lower abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Lachnospira genera. Multivariable regression analysis showed that Shannon index diversity (odds ratio [OR] 2.85 [95% CI 1.09-7.41]; p=0.032) and C-Reactive Protein (OR 3.45 [95% CI 1.33-8.91]; p=0.011) were risk factors for COVID-19 severe disease (a score of 6 or higher in WHO clinical progression scale). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that hospitalised moderate and severe COVID-19 patients have microbial signatures of gut dysbiosis and for the first time, the gut microbiota diversity is pointed out as a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity.","Moreira-Rosário, André; Marques, Cláudia; Pinheiro, Hélder; Araújo, João Ricardo; Ribeiro, Pedro; Rocha, Rita; Mota, Inês; Pestana, Diogo; Ribeiro, Rita; Pereira, Ana; de Sousa, Maria José; Pereira-Leal, José; de Sousa, José; Morais, Juliana; Teixeira, Diana; Rocha, Júlio César; Silvestre, Marta; Príncipe, Nuno; Gatta, Nuno; Amado, José; Santos, Lurdes; Maltez, Fernando; Boquinhas, Ana; de Sousa, Germano; Germano, Nuno; Sarmento, Gonçalo; Granja, Cristina; Póvoa, Pedro; Faria, Ana; Calhau, Conceição",bioRxiv,112,18

We aimed to prospectively evaluate the attitudes, concerns, and health behavior of IBD patients during COVID‐19. METHODS: An online survey was sent to patients from a tertiary IBD Service. The survey included demographic information and questions about the impact of COVID‐19, levels of concern caused by COVID‐19, perceived risk of IBD medications, medication cessation, and care delivery preferences. RESULTS: Of 97 respondents (39%), 95 (98%) reported concern about the impact of COVID‐19 on their health, and 43% felt their risk of contracting COVID‐19 was above average; 62% reported concern about medication‐induced COVID‐19 risk, and 11% stopped medications because of COVID‐19. Patients considered all medications to increase the risk of COVID‐19 susceptibility and severity; 45% preferred telehealth while 16% preferred face‐to‐face clinic reviews. Preference for IBD monitoring tools in decreasing order was blood testing, stool collection, gastrointestinal ultrasound, magnetic resonance enterography, and then colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD are demonstrated to experience concern related to their diagnosis and medications. The insights provided by the survey are informative for a possible “second‐wave” of COVID‐19 and routine care, including acceptance of telemedicine, preference for non‐invasive investigations, and a need for dissemination of information and education.","Goodsall, Thomas M; Han, Sangwoo; Bryant, Robert V",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,112,27

Expanding research on the human microbiome now allows ME/CFS-associated pathogens to be studied as interacting members of human microbiome communities. Humans harbor these vast ecosystems of bacteria, viruses and fungi in nearly all tissue and blood. Most well-studied inflammatory conditions are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of the human microbiome. While gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS, microbes and viruses outside the gut can also contribute to the illness. Pathobionts, and their associated proteins/metabolites, often control human metabolism and gene expression in a manner that pushes the body toward a state of illness. Intracellular pathogens, including many associated with ME/CFS, drive microbiome dysbiosis by directly interfering with human transcription, translation, and DNA repair processes. Molecular mimicry between host and pathogen proteins/metabolites further complicates this interference. Other human pathogens disable mitochondria or dysregulate host nervous system signaling. Antibodies and/or clonal T cells identified in patients with ME/CFS are likely activated in response to these persistent microbiome pathogens. Different human pathogens have evolved similar survival mechanisms to disable the host immune response and host metabolic pathways. The metabolic dysfunction driven by these organisms can result in similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms. ME/CFS may be driven by this pathogen-induced dysfunction, with the nature of dysbiosis and symptom presentation varying based on a patient's unique infectious and environmental history. Under such conditions, patients would benefit from treatments that support the human immune system in an effort to reverse the infectious disease process.","Proal, Amy; Marshall, Trevor",Front Pediatr,112,16

Cross-sectional findings indicated elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to historical norms, which were positively associated with COVID-19 concern more strongly than epidemiological data signifying risk (e.g., world and country confirmed cases). Employment loss was positively associated with greater depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern, and depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern were significantly associated with more stringent self-quarantine behavior.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein plays the essential roles in almost all key steps of the viral life cycle, thus representing a top drug target. Almost all key functions of N protein including liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) depend on its capacity in interacting with nucleic acids. Therefore, only the variants with their N proteins functional in binding nucleic acids might survive and spread in evolution and indeed, the residues critical for binding nucleic acids are highly conserved. Very recently, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was shown to prevent the transmission in a large-scale clinical study in Singapore but so far, no specific SARS-CoV-2 protein was experimentally identified to be targeted by HCQ. Here by NMR, we unambiguously decode that HCQ specifically binds NTD and CTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein with Kd of 112.1 and 57.1 μM respectively to inhibit their interaction with nucleic acid, as well as to disrupt LLPS essential for the viral life cycle. Most importantly, HCQ-binding residues are identical in SARS-CoV-2 variants and therefore HCQ is likely effective to them all. The results not only provide a structural basis for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HCQ, but also renders HCQ to be the first known drug capable of targeting LLPS. Furthermore, the unique structure of the HCQ-CTD complex decodes a promising strategy for further design of better anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs from HCQ. Therefore, HCQ is a promising candidate to help terminate the pandemic.","Dang, Mei; Song, Jianxing",bioRxiv,112,1

We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID 19 compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over 14 days starting in March 2020. Results: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (78%) or cough (77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11) or hospital care (n=44). 51% (n=28) were female, 49% were age <60. Common comorbidities included diabetes (22%), hypertension (27%), cancer (16%) and cardiovascular disease (13%). 69% of these (n=38) were RT-PCR confirmed positive for SARS CoV2 infection, 11 had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis.

Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16–21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements. FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16–18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks’ follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling revealed faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). INTERPRETATION: Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogeneous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. In mild infection, anti-S1 serology alone may underestimate incident infections. The mechanisms that underpin faster clearance and lower rates of sustained anti-S1 production may impact on the longevity of humoral immunity.

Owing to the high population density in these regions, they are exposed to various types of air pollutants. Fine particle air pollutants (<2.5 μm) can easily invade the human respiratory system, causing health issues. For fine particulate matter filtration, the use of a face mask filter is efficient; however, its use is accompanied by a high-pressure drop, making breathing difficult. Electrostatic interactions in the filter of the face mask constitute the dominant filtration mechanism for capturing fine particulate matter; these masks are, however, significantly weakened by the high humidity in exhaled breath. In this study, we demonstrate that a filter with an electrostatically rechargeable structure operates with normal breathing air power. In our novel face mask, a filter membrane is assembled by layer-by-layer stacking of the electrospun PVDF nanofiber mat formed on a nylon mesh. Tribo/piezoelectric characteristics via multilayer structure enhance filtration performance, even under air-powered filter bending taken as a normal breathing condition. The air gap between nanofiber and mesh layers increases air diffusion time and preserves the electrostatic charges within the multi-layered nanofiber filter membrane under humid air penetration, which is advantageous for face mask applications.","Kang, Dong Hee; Kim, Na Kyong; Kang, Hyun Wook",Polymers (Basel),112,24

Mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis. Infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mRNAs associated with Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10. Peak mRNA accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice. TNF-α mRNA was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis. Rapid transient increases in the mRNAs encoding IL-12, iNOS, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 occurred following infection. Nonlethal infections were associated with increased IL-12, IL-1β, and earlier expression of IL-6, while lethal infections were associated with increased iNOS and IL-1α mRNA. These data suggest a rapid but differential response within the central nervous system cells to infection by different JHMV variants. However, neither the accumulation nor kinetics of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection. Accumulation of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the central nervous system of JHMV-infected mice is consistent with the participation of both cytokines and cell immune effectors during resolution of acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis.","Parra, Beatriz; Hinton, David R.; Lin, Mark T.; Cua, Daniel J.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",Virology,112,8

The paper further explores how the human imagination, which we normally utilize to make meaning out of traumatic experience, can be hijacked by fear – leading to avoidance of suffering and to illusory formulations and alternative realities such as conspiracy theories. Alternatively, the imagination can be employed in more realistic and creative ways – leading through conscious suffering to healing and wholeness. Which path the imagination takes is shown to depend on the capacity of individuals to feel the full reality of the human condition in general and the exquisite vulnerability of our existence as fragile human beings at this moment in history.

In order to tackle the emergence of antimicrobial resistance it is vital to understand how they appear, their relationship with the host, how they behave as a whole in the ruminal ecosystem or how they spread to the environment or humans. We sequenced ruminal samples from 416 Holstein dairy cows in 14 Spanish farms using nanopore technology, to uncover the presence of resistance genes and their potential effect on human, animal and environmental health. RESULTS: We found 998 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the cow rumen and studied the 25 most prevalent genes in the 14 dairy cattle farms. The most abundant ARGs were related to the use of antibiotics to treat mastitis, metritis and lameness, the most common diseases in dairy cattle. The relative abundance (RA) of bacteriophages was positively correlated to the ARGs RA. The heritability of the RA of the more abundant ARGs ranged between 0.10 (mupA) and 0.49 (tetW), similar to the heritability of the RA of microbes that carried those ARGs. Even though these genes are carried by the microorganisms, the host is partially controlling their RA by having a more suitable rumen pH, folds, or other physiological traits that promote the growth of those microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to determine the most prevalent ARGs (macB, msbA, parY, rpoB2, tetQ and TaeA) in the ruminal bacteria ecosystem. The rumen is a reservoir of ARGs, and strategies to reduce the ARG load from livestock must be pursued.","López-Catalina, Adrián; Atxaerandio, Raquel; García-Rodríguez, Aser; Goiri, Idoia; Gutierrez-Rivas, Mónica; Jiménez‐Montero, José Antonio; González-Recio, Oscar",Anim Microbiome,112,33

The population and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 infections are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that in addition to individual clinical factors, demographic, socioeconomic and racial characteristics play an important role. Methods. We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results. Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data, with hot spots in all five boroughs. Spatial risk did not correspond precisely to population-based rates of positive tests. The strongest univariate association with positive testing rates was the proportion of residents in a ZIP Code Tabulation Area with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of COPD in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). The next strongest association was with the proportion of Black and African American residents, for which there was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7). Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons. Conclusions. The population and spatial patterns of COVID-19 infections differ by race, age, physical environment and health status. Areas with large proportions of Black/African American residents are at markedly higher risk that is not fully explained by characteristics of the environment and pre-existing conditions in the population.","DiMaggio, C.; Klein, M.; Berry, C.; Frangos, S.",,112,20

Recent evidence suggests that this will cause additional maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here we have explored the contextual factors influencing maternal, neonatal and children health (MNCH) care in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Africa amidst the pandemic. Our findings suggest that between March and May 2020, there was a reduction in utilisation of basic essential MNCH services such as antenatal care, family planning and immunization due to: a) the implementation of lockdown which triggered fear of contracting the COVID-19 and deterred people from accessing basic MNCH care, and b) a shift of focus towards pandemic, causing the detriment to other health services, and c) resource constraints. Taken together these issues have resulted in compromised provision of basic general healthcare. Given the likelihood of recurrent waves of the pandemic globally, COVID-19 mitigation plans therefore should be integrated with standard care provision to enhance system resilience to cope with all health needs. This commentary suggests a four-point contextualised mitigation plan to safeguard MNCH care during the pandemic using the observed countries as exemplars for LMIC health system adaptations to maintain the trajectory of progress regarding sustainable development goals (SDGs).","Ahmed, Tanvir; Rahman, Ahmed Ehsanur; Amole, Taiwo Gboluwaga; Galadanci, Hadiza; Matjila, Mushi; Soma-Pillay, Priya; Gillespie, Bronwen M.; El Arifeen, Shams; Anumba, Dilly O.

(H)CQ activity was examined in tissue culture cells to determine if their anti-viral benefits or adverse effects might be due to altering host cell pathways. Metabolic analysis revealed (H)CQ inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, likely by sequestering protons needed to drive ATP synthase. This activity could cause cardiotoxicity because heart muscle relies on beta oxidation of fatty acids. However, it might also explain their therapeutic benefit against COVID-19. A new model of SARS-CoV-2 infection postulates virus enters host cell mitochondria and uses its protons for genome release. Oxidative phosphorylation is eventually compromised, so glycolysis is upregulated to maintain ATP levels. (H)CQ could prevent viral infection and/or slow its replication by sequestering these protons. In support of this model other potential COVID-19 therapeutics also targeted mitochondria, as did tobacco smoke, which may underlie smokers protection. The mitochondria of young people are naturally more adaptable and resilient, providing a rationale for their resistance to disease progression. Conversely, obesity and diabetes could exacerbate disease severity by providing extra glucose to infected cells dependent on glycolysis. The description of (H)CQ function presented here, together with its implications for understanding SARS-CO-V2 infection, makes testable predictions about disease progression and identifies new approaches for treating COVID-19.","Sheaff, Robert J.",bioRxiv,112,20

The purpose of this study was to explore how parents experienced the pandemic-related restrictions and how they impacted their children’s movement behaviours. Methods: Twenty-nine semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted (June–July 2020) with parents of children (5–11 years old) in Ontario and British Columbia. Interviews lasted between 24–104 min, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results: Findings emphasized various individual (e.g., motivation), interpersonal (e.g., parent work schedule), built (e.g., closure of parks) and natural environment (e.g., weather) factors related to children’s movement behaviours. The findings highlighted the loss of structured activities and destinations for children’s physical activity, and restricted opportunities for outdoor play exacerbated by shrinking childhood independent mobility. Conclusion: Families are adapting to many pandemic-related challenges including adhering to public health restrictions, parents juggling multiple roles, conducting work and school from home, as well as exacerbating factors like weather. It will be important to continue to encourage outdoor time, support policies and practice that facilitate independent mobility, and develop centralized resources that help families in the maintenance of healthy movement behaviours.","Riazi, Negin A.; Wunderlich, Kelly; Gierc, Madelaine; Brussoni, Mariana; Moore, Sarah A.; Tremblay, Mark S.; Faulkner, Guy",Children (Basel),112,22

The glaring gaps in the service provision in delirium care, regardless of aetiology, after a hospital admission pre-existed the pandemic, but the pandemic arguably offers an opportunity now to address them. Whilst a delirium episode in itself is not a long-term condition, the context of it may well be, and therefore patients might benefit from personalised care and support planning. There is no reason to believe that the delirium following COVID-19 is fundamentally different from any other delirium. We propose that the needs of older patients who have experienced delirium including from COVID-19 could be addressed through a new model of post-acute delirium care that combines early supported discharge, including discharge-to-assess, with community-based follow-up to assess for persistent delirium and early new long-term cognitive impairment. Such a drive could be structurally integrated with existing memory clinic services. To succeed, such an ambition has to be flexible, adaptable and person-centred. To understand the impact on resource and service utilisation, techniques of quality improvement should be implemented, and appropriate metrics reflecting both process and outcome will be essential to underpin robust and sustainable business cases to support implementation of delirium care as a long-term solution.","Rahman, Shibley; Byatt, Kit",Age Ageing,112,16

Concurrent circulation of both classic and variant IBVs have been identified in most parts of the world, raising major challenges to global prevention and control efforts. Therefore, immunopathogenesis, particularly early host responses, needs to be better understood for effective control of diseases caused by different strains of IBVs. We investigated differing immunopathogenesis in chickens following infection with IS/885/00-like (885), QX-like (QX) and M41 IBV strains. We confirmed that the histopathological changes, proinflammatory and innate immune gene responses were induced to different magnitudes, depending on the IBV strain. Results indicated that upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-1β) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF) expression is induced by IBV M41 in the trachea and by IBV 885 and QX in the kidney, which mainly coincides with tracheal and renal histopathological lesions respectively caused by these strains. In addition, elevated levels of TLR3, MDA5 and IFN-β expression occurred concurrently with greater lesion severity in IBV infected trachea and kidney tissues. Overall, this study reports marked differences in the activation of early host responses by pathogenic IBV strains.","Chhabra, Rajesh; Ball, Christopher; Chantrey, Julian; Ganapathy, Kannan",Developmental & Comparative Immunology,112,24

The data was analyzed using R statistical package version 4.0.0. A two-tailed p-value<0.05 was considered significant. 81 patients were included from March 23rd to May 10th 2020. The median age was 59 years, 58.0% were female. The majority of the study population (82.7%) had comorbidities, 98.8% had radiological signs of pneumonia. Fourteen patients (17.3%) experienced QTc ≥ 480 ms and 16 patients (19.8%) had an increase of QTc ≥ 60 ms. Seven patients (8.6%) had QTc prolongation of ≥ 500 ms. The treatment was discontinued in 4 patients (4.9%). None of the patients developed ventricular tachycardia. The risk factors significantly associated with QTc ≥ 500 ms were hypokalemia (p = 0.032) and use of diuretics during the treatment (p = 0.020). Three patients (3.7%) died, the cause of death was bacterial superinfection with septic shock in two patients, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with multiple organ failure in one patient.

Shortcomings of current animal models for SARS-CoV-2 include limited lower respiratory disease, divergence from clinical COVID-19 disease, and requirements for host genetic modifications to permit infection. This study validates a feline model for SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in clinical disease and histopathologic lesions consistent with severe COVID-19 in humans. Intra-tracheal inoculation of concentrated SARS-CoV-2 caused infected cats to develop clinical disease consistent with that observed in the early exudative phase of COVID-19. A novel clinical scoring system for feline respiratory disease was developed and utilized, documenting a significant degree of lethargy, fever, dyspnea, and dry cough in infected cats. In addition, histopathologic pulmonary lesions such as diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, fibrin deposition, and proteinaceous exudates were observed due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, imitating lesions identified in people hospitalized with ARDS from COVID-19. A significant correlation exists between the degree of clinical disease identified in infected cats and pulmonary lesions. Viral loads and ACE2 expression were quantified in nasal turbinates, distal trachea, lung, and various other organs. Natural ACE2 expression, paired with clinicopathologic correlates between this feline model and human COVID-19, encourage use of this model for future translational studies. Author Summary Identifying an ideal animal model to study COVID-19 has been difficult, and current models come with challenges that restrict their potential in translational studies. Few lab animals naturally express the receptors necessary for viral infection (ACE2), and many fail to manifest clinical signs or pathology similar to that seen in humans. Other models (non-human primates, mink) are ideal for disease and transmission studies, but are restricted by cost, husbandry challenges, and scarce availability. Alternatively, cats naturally express ACE2 receptors, are naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and can transmit virus from cat-to-cat. Prior to this study, cats infected by oral/nasal routes have not displayed significant clinical disease or lung pathology. However, we demonstrate that direct inoculation of concentrated SARS-CoV-2 virus in the trachea of cats induces analogous clinical and pathologic features to hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19. Our results show that infected cats exhibit significant clinical signs during experimental infection (coughing, increased respiratory effort, lethargy, and fever) and exhibit extensive lung lesions that mimic severe COVID-19 pathology such as diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation – highlighting the immeasurable potential for this feline model to address translational approaches for COVID-19 and to better understand the role of cats in transmission and disease.","Rudd, Jennifer M.; Selvan, Miruthula Tamil; Cowan, Shannon; Kao, Yun-Fan; Midkiff, Cecily C.; Ritchey, Jerry W.; Miller, Craig A.",bioRxiv,112,10

Hepatic abnormalities included steatosis (12/19; 63%), moderate to severe venous congestion (5/19; 26%) and cirrhosis (4/19; 21%). A subsequent literature review indicated a significantly increased prevalence of steatosis (49%), venous congestion (34%) and cirrhosis (9.3%) in COVID-19 PM cases, compared with a pre-pandemic PM cohort (33%, 16%, and 2.6%, respectively), likely reflecting an increased mortality risk in SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with pre-existing liver disease. To corroborate this observation, we retrospectively analysed the admission liver function test (LFT) results of 276 consecutive, anonymised COVID-19 hospital patients in our centre, for whom outcome data were available. Of these patients, 236 (85.5%) had significantly reduced albumin levels at the time of admission to hospital, which was likely indicative of pre-existing chronic liver or renal disease.

Strict isolation and social distancing measures can flatten the coronavirus infectious curve, and the use of facemask needs to be encouraged and facilitated in crowded places, particularly in hospitals where the 6-feet social distancing cannot be adopted because of physical barriers.","Sergi, Consolato M.; Leung, Alexander K.C.",Public Health,112,1

Unprecedented mobilization has led to the development of a large number of projects, some of which have already been in test in humans for several months. The first efficacy and safety data are expected in the coming weeks. New vaccine technologies are being evaluated (RNA, replicating or non-replicating viral vectors), further increasing the chances of success. The criteria for evaluating vaccines-despite the exceptional speed of their development-must remain rigorous enough to ensure their acceptance by the population. Beyond their development, mass production and equitable distribution raise many questions. Finally, vaccination can only be successfully implemented if health professionals and the population are convinced of its validity, which implies particular attention to the quality of the information given and the methods of communication.","Fischer, Alain",C R Biol,112,21

We examined if the cognitive availability of COVID-19 leads to the perception of heightened threat facilitating coping strategies and the moderating role of global self-efficacy and intolerance of uncertainty. A total of 235 participants randomly received either a newspaper article about the COVID-19 virus or Germany’s soil condition and were asked to indicate their current level of the perceived threat of the virus and the use of different coping strategies. Results indicate that the cognitive availability of COVID-19 information leads to a higher perceived threat, leading to more seeking for social support. Although neither self-efficacy nor intolerance of uncertainty moderates the effect of cognitive availability on the perceived threat, both personality characteristics moderated the relationship between perceived threat and different coping strategies. We discuss our results in line with current research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on coping strategies and well-being.","Klümper, Lisa; Sürth, Svenja",Curr Psychol,112,32

A set of these tests was published in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education between 2002 and 2015. Such tests using an experimental approach help students to understand how living cells function. Besides being tools of education, they can be used for examination purposes as well to assess higher levels of intellectual skills (interpretation and problem solving) acquired by the students. The test presented in this paper is based on parts of an original publication in which the authors described seminal observations on the function of a viral protein in the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. The test is aimed at helping the students to understand the methods used in the experiments, to analyze the data and to draw conclusions from them regarding certain aspects of the mechanism of coronavirus infection.","Bátor, Judit; Szeberényi, József",Biochem. mol. biol. educ,112,1

Most chronic HBV infections, indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) on serologic testing, are acquired in infancy through perinatal or early childhood transmission (2). To prevent perinatal and childhood infections, WHO recommends that all infants receive at least 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), including a timely birth dose (HepB-BD)† (1). In 2016, the SEAR Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional hepatitis B control goal with a target of achieving hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence of ≤1% among children aged ≥5 years by 2020, which is in line with the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016-2021 (2,3). The South-East Asia Regional Vaccine Action Plan 2016-2020 (SEARVAP) (4) identified the acceleration of hepatitis B control as one of the eight regional goals for immunization. The plan outlined four main strategies for achieving hepatitis B control: 1) achieving ≥90% coverage with 3 doses of HepB (HepB3), 2) providing timely vaccination with a HepB birth dose (HepB-BD), 3) providing catch-up vaccination of older children, and 4) vaccinating adult populations at high risk and health care workers (1,4). In 2019, SEAR established a regional expert panel on hepatitis B to assess countries' HBV control status. This report describes the progress made toward hepatitis B control in SEAR during 2016-2019. By 2016, all 11 countries in the region had introduced HepB in their national immunization programs, and eight countries had introduced HepB-BD. During 2016-2019, regional HepB3 coverage increased from 89% to 91%, and HepB-BD coverage increased from 34% to 54%. In 2019, nine countries in the region achieved ≥90% HepB3 coverage, and three of the eight countries that provide HepB-BD achieved ≥90% HepB-BD coverage. By December 2019, four countries had been verified to have achieved the hepatitis B control goal. Countries in the region can make further progress toward hepatitis B control by using proven strategies to improve HepB-BD and HepB3 coverage rates. Conducting nationally representative hepatitis B serosurveys among children will be key to tracking and verifying the regional control targets.","Sandhu, Hardeep S.; Roesel, Sigrun; Sharifuzzaman, Mohammad; Chunsuttiwat, Supamit; Tohme, Rania A.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,112,16

However, this report did not mention chronic kidney disease (CKD) nor did it provide information on the relevance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or albuminuria. As the disease spread across the globe, information on larger populations with greater granularity on risk factors emerged. The recently published OpenSAFELY project analysed factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients. The picture that arose differs significantly from initial reports. For example, hypertension is not an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.89], but renal disease very much is. Dialysis (aHR 3.69), organ transplantation (aHR 3.53) and CKD (aHR 2.52 for patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) represent three of the four comorbidities associated with the highest mortality risk from COVID-19. The risk associated with CKD Stages 4 and 5 is higher than the risk associated with diabetes mellitus (aHR range 1.31–1.95, depending upon glycaemic control) or chronic heart disease (aHR 1.17). In another recent publication, the Global Burden of Disease collaboration identified that worldwide, CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, the distribution of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality appears to be different in patients with CKD when compared with the general population. The high prevalence of CKD in combination with the elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19 in CKD necessitates urgent action for this group of patients. This article defines essential action points (summarized in Box 1), among which is advocating the inclusion of CKD patients in clinical trials testing the efficacy of drugs and vaccines to prevent severe COVID-19.",,Nephrol Dial Transplant,112,1
